4230,the flood inventory in urban areas is often difficult to collect and therefore inadequate for training a machine learning ml based assessment model in this study we investigated the utility of transfer learning tl to improve urban flood susceptibility assessment using knowledge outside the training domain specifically we pre trained a convolutional neural network based assessment model in one catchment and then tried to improve the model performance of two other catchments by transferring knowledge from the pre trained model the results showed that 1 with the help of tl the model performance of the two transferred catchments improved by 10 25 in different data rich and data sparse scenarios and 2 tl typically provided positive effects when we transferred knowledge from a well pretrained model in data rich catchment however it may induce negative effects when the pre trained model has poor accuracy this study provides a promising approach to improve ml based hazard assessment by sharing knowledge from different regions keywords flood susceptibility urban catchment transfer learning convolutional neural network 1 introduction natural hazard inventories such as em dat ce dat and natdis have been gradually published worldwide over the past two decades degomme and guha sapir 2007 shen and hwang 2019 shi et al 2000 yamamura 2013 these inventories help us to understand the mechanism of disasters as well as play a fundamental role in hazard assessment and management cirella et al 2014 wirtz et al 2014 as the inventories are collected by a variety of agencies and groups for different purposes the consistency and coverage of the data remain inadequate hence accurate hazard assessment remains a challenge in data sparse areas cutter et al 2008 flooding is reported to be the most destructive natural disaster in cities hammond et al 2015 sufficient flood inventories in heterogeneous urban areas are difficult to collect particularly in newly developed cities di baldassarre and uhlenbrook 2012 holden et al 2009 an unanswered question in the area of hydrology is how to improve the assessment of disasters such as flood hazard in data sparse urban areas azizian and brocca 2020 ekeu wei and blackburn 2020 holden et al 2009 komi et al 2017 it is a great challenge for existing physical based models to assess urban flood hazard in a large catchment zhao et al 2019b the challenges raised by simplistic methods are the coarse resolution lack of model physicality using loose hydrologic hydraulic coupling and absence of urban water system data saksena et al 2020 although some urban flood hazard assessment studies have been conducted using physical based models in data rich catchments fewtrell et al 2011 jamali et al 2018 kulkarni et al 2014 schumann et al 2011 urban flood hazard modeling in data sparse catchments remains at an early stage for natural catchments regionalization techniques have been adopted in several studies to predict floods in data sparse catchments by transferring the parameters in the physical based model from nearby or similar data rich catchments razavi and coulibaly 2013 however these techniques are rarely applied in an urbanized catchment because of the heterogeneous urban land surface and high uncertainties in urban flood modeling jilge et al 2017 liu et al 2020 pang et al 2020 pu et al 2008 in the last decade machine learning ml has been regarded as an effective alternative to a physical based model in the assessment of natural hazards such as landslides forest fires and floods bui et al 2017 chapi et al 2017 frattini et al 2010 hong et al 2018 huang and zhao 2018 khosravi et al 2018 pourtaghi et al 2016 reichenbach et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 ml focuses on the development of computer algorithms that can extract essential information from large amounts of data and use the learned information for prediction without deep understanding of the underlying physical parameters mosavi et al 2018 sahoo et al 2017 by developing the relationship between flood occurrence and explanatory factors ml can identify flood prone areas in an urban catchment without using commercially sensitive data such as long term discharge or sewer system information recently new ml technique named deep learning dl has shown a bright future in flood assessment in data sparse catchments fang et al 2020 pham et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for example the convolutional neural network cnn a form of dl model has been demonstrated to be superior to conventional ml models in urban flood susceptibility assessment because it can consider the topographical information in the model inputs zhao et al 2020 despite this these ml models are trained only using the data inside the catchment and the extrapolation performance has been reported to decay quickly as the distance from the training domain increases mccartney et al 2020 therefore it is difficult to transfer a pre trained ml model to other catchments which limits the use of these models in data sparse catchments in this research we seek to address the identified limitation of ml by transferring the pre trained ml model from the training domain to other catchments we selected three catchments in the metropolitan areas of beijing city for model development and tried to transfer the pre trained cnn model parameters between different urban catchments to the best of our knowledge this is the first effort to improve ml based hazard assessment using knowledge outside the training domain the objective of the study is to investigate whether pre trained model parameters from one catchment can improve the urban susceptibility assessment of other catchment and how the accuracy of the pre trained model affects the transferred model results 2 methodologies description 2 1 study area and data description we selected three urban catchments as the study area dahongmen qinghe and bahe these catchments are all located in the metropolitan areas of beijing in china and have experienced rapid urbanization in the past two decades xu and zhao 2016 image based cnn models have been successfully demonstrated for urban flood susceptibility assessment in the dahongmen catchment zhao et al 2020 therefore we selected the well trained cnn model in the dahongmen catchment as the pre trained model as shown in fig 1 we selected the other two catchments qinghe and bahe as the transferred catchments tc and we tried to improve the assessment of the two tcs using the knowledge gained in the dahongmen catchment which we refer to as the pre trained catchment pc the flood inventories within the study area comprised a total of 926 flooded and non flooded sites collected from more than 20 heavy storms between 2004 and 2014 for each catchment the flood inventories were randomly divided into two datasets 60 and 40 of all sites were used for model training and testing respectively the locations of the training and testing sites are shown in fig 1 selecting reliable explanatory factors plays a fundamental role in hazard assessment we selected nine factors that is the annual maximum daily precipitation frequency of heavy rainstorms elevation slope topographic wetness index distance from the river drainage density distance to the road and normalized difference built up index as the explanatory factors these factors have been successfully used for urban flood susceptibility both in the dahongmen catchment and across all metropolitan areas in beijing zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2020 the data source and detailed information of the nine explanatory factors were described by zhao et al 2019a and zhao et al 2020 two indices that is accuracy a and kappa k were used for model evaluation and are described as follows 1 a tp t n tp f p t n f n 2 k a p e 1 p e where true positive tp is the number of samples correctly classified as flooded sites true negative tn is the number of samples correctly classified as non flooded sites false positive fp is the number of samples incorrectly classified as flooded sites false negative fn is the number of samples incorrectly classified as non flooded sites and pe is the hypothetical probability of a chance agreement described in viera and garrett 2005 accuracy is a widely used metric for evaluating classification and the value represents the percentage of correct predictions among all predictions kappa evaluates the interrater reliability of the model by comparing the accuracy of the model system to the accuracy of a random system mchugh 2012 as defined by landis and koch 1977 model performance can be described by kappa as follows slight agreement 0 0 2 fair agreement 0 21 0 40 moderate agreement 0 41 0 60 substantial agreement 0 61 0 80 and almost perfect agreement 0 81 1 0 2 2 transfer learning transfer learning tl is a popular approach for improving the dl model in a new task through the transfer of knowledge from a related task that has already been learned olivas et al 2009 in tl the base model is first trained using the samples for one task called the pre trained model the learned knowledge from the base model is then reused and transferred to a second target model called the transferred model the transferred knowledge is reflected by the same weights in both the pre trained and transferred models the remaining weights in the transferred models are trained using the new samples and task in this study we adopted one widely used cnn model that is the lenet 5 model to develop the relationship between flood occurrence and the nine explanatory factors both in the pc and two tcs as shown in fig 2 a the lenet 5 model mainly involves eight layers one input layer two convolutional layers two pooling layers two fully connected neural network layers and one output layer this architecture was demonstrated by zhao et al 2020 as a useful model for flood susceptibility and outperformed the benchmark support vector machine and random forest models in the dahongmen catchment the layers of the lenet 5 model were divided into four modules m1 m4 the number of trainable weights in each module is shown in fig 2 a fig 2 b describes the traditional strategy of susceptibility assessment using the ml model the weights in the original model were randomly generated before training the pc and original tc models were then trained separately only using the data within each catchment after the training process knowledge derived from the explanatory factors and flood inventories was identified and reflected by the trained weights in each module as there was no knowledge exchange between the pc and tc original models the performance of each model only depended on the accuracy and amount of data within the training catchment fig 2 c shows the susceptibility mapping using the tl strategy we first trained a base model in the pc called the pc pre trained model after the training process knowledge was stored by weights in the modules of the pc pre trained model then we transferred the weights of the modules from the pc pre trained model to the tc transferred model and then trained the weights of the remaining modules in the tc transferred model using the data from the tc using this transferring process we retained some of the knowledge in the pc and used it for model development in the tc 3 results and discussion 3 1 module transfer comparison as the number of transferred modules increased the trainable weights of the tc transferred model decreased which reduced the flexibility of the tc transferred model we started by testing how the transferred modules influenced model accuracy table 1 shows 11 different lenet 5 networks validated using the same testing dataset in qinghe and bahe in s1 we directly used the pre trained model developed for the dahongmen catchment to predict the flood susceptibility for the qinghe and bahe catchments although these catchments are located in metropolitan areas of beijing and the explanatory factors and flood inventories were collected from the same datasets the model developed for the dahongmen catchment demonstrated poor prediction ability for the qinghe and bahe catchments accuracy 0 65 and kappa 0 30 this result was expected because the ml models are interpolative by nature and it is high risk to construct an extrapolation outside the training catchments in s2 we trained the two original models independently using the data in the qinghe and bahe catchments as shown in table 1 both original models provided a satisfactory result with an accuracy of 0 807 in the qinghe catchment and 0 841 in the bahe catchment from s3 to s12 we transferred different combinations of modules from the pc pre trained model to the tc transferred models the weights of the transferred modules in the pc pre trained model were fixed and were the same as those in the tc transferred model the weights of the remaining modules in the tc transferred models were trained using the new data in the tc compared with the results in s1 and s2 in table 1 s3 to s11 demonstrated different degrees of improvement in terms of model performance with the help of tl we can conclude that tl is an effective approach to improve model results using knowledge outside the training domain the improvements in kappa ranged from 1 4 to 12 5 in the qinghe catchment and 7 1 to 16 5 in the bahe catchment with different combinations of transferred modules this demonstrates that the transferred module is a sensitive factor and should be selected during tl although the pre trained model was the same the optimal transferred modules were different in the qinghe and bahe catchments the best performance in the qinghe catchment was in s5 when m3 was transferred with the highest accuracy of 0 867 and kappa of 0 712 the best performance in the bahe catchment was in s8 when m2 and m3 were transferred with the highest accuracy of 0 921 and kappa of 0 839 3 2 transfer learning improvements in data sparse areas we found that the tc original models in the qinghe and bahe catchments s2 in table 1 provided satisfactory results which demonstrates that the training samples in tc were sufficient however as long term flood inventories are difficult to collect in urban catchments the tc original model typically demonstrated poor performance when using a limited number of training samples hence we tested the effectiveness of tl on tc transferred models with different numbers of training samples we considered four scenarios by gradually reducing the amount of training data 100 75 50 and 25 of the total samples in the tcs as shown in fig 3 a and b as expected the qinghe and bahe original model performances in the testing period decreased as the amount of training data reduced according to the evaluation criteria of kappa by landis and koch 1977 the original models demonstrated fair agreement with the observations 0 21 kappa 0 40 when the training data was reduced below 50 of the total samples among all the original models only the bahe original model trained with 100 of the training samples provided substantial agreement with the observations kappa 0 60 with the help of tl the transferred model in qinghe and bahe provided moderate agreement 0 40 kappa 0 6 using 50 of the training samples the bahe transferred model trained by using 100 of the samples provided near perfect agreement with the observations in the testing periods as shown in fig 3 c tl improved kappa by at least 10 and 14 for different amounts of training samples in the qinghe and bahe catchments respectively this demonstrates that tl effectively improved the assessment results of both data rich and data sparse catchments by using the knowledge trained weights from a data rich catchment 3 3 impact of the pre trained model performance on transfer learning during the module transfer process the uncertainties in the pre trained model were inevitably delivered to the transferred model in section 3 2 we found that tl typically provided positive effects when we transferred knowledge from a data rich catchment where the pc pre trained model was well trained in this section we consider the impact of pre trained model performance on transferred model accuracy fig 4 a b c describes the impact of the pre trained model on the tc transferred model with sufficient training data in tc 100 of the total training samples in qinghe and bahe the original models provided satisfactory results kappa 0 587 and 0 674 in qinghe and bahe without tl and we tried to transfer knowledge from different accuracies of pre trained models to a data rich catchment in this scenario we gradually reduced the amount of training data from 100 to 25 of the total sample for pre trained model training and therefore the kappa of the pre trained model decreased from 0 724 to 0 261 as expected as shown in fig 4 c tl demonstrated different degrees of improvement 7 17 for kappa in the qinghe and bahe catchments this revealed that the accuracy of the pre trained model was not sensitive to the transferred model when the tc already had sufficient training samples fig 4 d e f describes the impact of the pre trained model accuracy on the tc transferred model without sufficient training data in tc we found that the original qinghe and bahe models could not provide reliable results kappa 0 30 with this limited number of training samples only 25 of the total training samples used for training in qinghe and bahe in this data sparse scenario we tried to transfer knowledge trained weights from different accuracies of pc models to the data sparse qinghe and bahe catchments we found that the accuracy of the pre trained model was sensitive to the transferred model in this scenario as shown in fig 4 c the tl improvements reduced as the accuracy of the pre trained model decreased when kappa for the pre trained model was less than 0 427 tl induced negative impacts both in the qinghe and bahe catchments this demonstrated that it is high risk to transfer knowledge from a data sparse region to another data sparse region 4 conclusions ml models have been widely used in natural hazard assessment however an ml model that performs well in one region is difficult to apply outside the training domain and therefore its applications are limited for other data sparse areas we have proposed the first tl based approach to improve urban flood susceptibility mapping in a catchment using the knowledge gained outside the training domain we have successfully demonstrated the proposed approach in two catchments both in data rich and data sparse scenarios we have obtained the following conclusions 1 the ml performance in one catchment was improved as a result of transferring the ml weights trained from another catchment the improvements in kappa ranged from 1 4 to 12 5 in the qinghe catchment and 7 1 to 16 5 in the bahe catchment using different combinations of transferred modules 2 both the data sparse and data rich catchments benefited from tl when the pre trained model was well trained improvements of more than 10 and 14 were achieved in the qinghe and bahe catchments respectively for different data scenarios 3 the effectiveness of tl relied on the precision of the pre trained model it was safe to transfer weights from a data rich region to another region however transferring knowledge from one data sparse region to another may induce a negative impact we conclude that the proposed approach is a promising method for improving the ml based assessment of natural hazards particularly in data sparse areas credit authorship contribution statement gang zhao conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

the transferred model in this scenario as shown in fig 4 c the tl improvements reduced as the accuracy of the pre trained model decreased when kappa for the pre trained model was less than 0 427 tl induced negative impacts both in the qinghe and bahe catchments this demonstrated that it is high risk to transfer knowledge from a data sparse region to another data sparse region 4 conclusions ml models have been widely used in natural hazard assessment however an ml model that performs well in one region is difficult to apply outside the training domain and therefore its applications are limited for other data sparse areas we have proposed the first tl based approach to improve urban flood susceptibility mapping in a catchment using the knowledge gained outside the training domain we have successfully demonstrated the proposed approach in two catchments both in data rich and data sparse scenarios we have obtained the following conclusions 1 the ml performance in one catchment was improved as a result of transferring the ml weights trained from another catchment the improvements in kappa ranged from 1 4 to 12 5 in the qinghe catchment and 7 1 to 16 5 in the bahe catchment using different combinations of transferred modules 2 both the data sparse and data rich catchments benefited from tl when the pre trained model was well trained improvements of more than 10 and 14 were achieved in the qinghe and bahe catchments respectively for different data scenarios 3 the effectiveness of tl relied on the precision of the pre trained model it was safe to transfer weights from a data rich region to another region however transferring knowledge from one data sparse region to another may induce a negative impact we conclude that the proposed approach is a promising method for improving the ml based assessment of natural hazards particularly in data sparse areas credit authorship contribution statement gang zhao conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

4231,to meet the needs of human recreation and provide community amenities landscape dams i e water retaining structures for intercepting river water in cities and surrounding areas which are mainly used to create an urban landscape environment are built in urban and peri urban areas worldwide the construction of these dams however may adversely affect the local and regional water cycle we collected water samples from 2015 to 2019 from different water bodies in urban and peri urban areas traversing the middle and upper reaches of shiyang river basin in the arid area of central asia to analyze their isotopic characteristics meanwhile field surveys as well as meteorological hydrological and remote sensing data were added to evaluate the hydrologic effects of urban landscape dams on a watershed scale in an arid region with scarce water resources and fragile ecosystems isotopic values of landscape water were more enriched than that of natural river the result of the evaporation loss ratio showed that the landscape water was 0 5 higher moreover the cumulative effect of multiple landscape dams leads to a great loss of water resources in arid areas the study also demonstrated that evaporation is a vital factor in causing change in the isotope composition of the landscape water in the shiyang river basin the interaction between surface water and groundwater was frequent within the landscape dam area wherein groundwater was mainly recharged by surface water leakage sufficient attention should be given to the evaporation leakage local precipitation and groundwater changes caused by the impoundment of landscape dams thus the potentially adverse effects of urban landscape dams in arid regions should be highly considered in long term water resources sustainability

1 introduction a large number of dams have been built worldwide in the past century to meet the needs for electricity irrigation and recreation biemans et al 2011 poff and schmidt 2016 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 presently about two thirds of global rivers have been retained by reservoirs and dams luo et al 2020 maavara 2020 zhang et al 2017 most of these dams are landscape dams located in the middle and lower reaches of rivers a significant number of studies have clearly demonstrated that dams may reduce connectivity between watersheds which can have potential hydrological and ecological impacts on the watersheds song 2020 zhang et al 2020 the urban landscape water is characterized by small water area shallow depth low velocity and strong evaporation chen et al 2013 henny and meutia 2014 to date more and more small dams with water sources mainly from river water from upstream areas have been constructed in urban rivers as a landscape engineering practice bao et al 2018 chang et al 2020 hilton et al 2006 while urbanization progresses rapidly the impact of small landscape dams on the environment has increasingly attracted attention zhao et al 2012 similar to large reservoirs small dams likewise change the morphological and hydrological characteristics of rivers bao et al 2020 gao et al 2017 guo et al 2017 studies have shown that additional water loss caused by reservoir based evaporation amounts to about 5 of global river water flow giving rise to great reduction of water resources in some regions lehner et al 2011 stable water supply in arid regions is essential for human well being and socioeconomic development quinn et al 2019 given this it is imperative to clarify and systematically elaborate the hydrological effects of small landscape dams on a specific watershed in arid areas stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes δd and δ18o in river water are ideal natural tracers craig 1961 gat 1996 which help understand various hydrological processes related to the water cycle deng et al 2016 wang et al 2019 wei 2017 existing research on the effects of damming and drought on water cycle dynamics using hydrogen and oxygen isotopes is enlightening grabb et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 saranya et al 2020 wu et al 2021 but these studies mainly focus on large river systems hillel et al 2015 wang et al 2019 recent studies used stable isotope methods to elucidate changes in river water cycle due to reservoir impoundment deng et al 2016 and focused on the comprehensive review of the yangtze river li et al 2016 the lancang river fan et al 2015 and other rivers yang et al 2020 with abundant water energy as of late we see the emergence of studies on the impact of small dams on river water cycle for example it is reported that small dams usually cause more sediment to be trapped in impounding areas kim et al 2004 furthermore quantifying the water balance of small watersheds such as lakes and reservoirs is vital for maintaining river water health in arid areas biggs et al 2015 gibson et al 2016 wan et al 2019 another study pointed out that stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes as natural tracers can be regarded as the dna of a water body by accurately providing the source information of the leakage point ghomshei and allen 2000 peng and wang 2008 yi et al 2018 in contrast there is a relative lack of studies on urban runoff in arid and semi arid regions jefferson et al 2017 which accounts for 40 of global land areas regier et al 2020 moreover research on the influence of water conservancy projects on water cycle in urban and peri urban areas in arid regions are rare thus it is urgent to monitor the dynamic process of water cycle within the vicinity of urban landscape dams understanding the hydrological process of landscape dams in arid regions will help to quantify the water cycle response mechanism under dam intervention and provide reference for water resources management in the said regions previous studies failed to fully understand the water cycle effect of urban landscape dams in arid areas for lack of high density and more refined stable isotope monitoring network to fill these knowledge gaps observation systems were established in wuwei city shiyang river basin china s inland river basin the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope method was used to trace the climate and hydrological response mechanism under the intervention of urban landscape dams in the shiyang river basin the goals of this study are to 1 characterize the spatiotemporal variability of stable isotope values in natural rivers and landscape water 2 discuss the climate hydrology and environmental variables that cause changes in the isotopic composition of urban landscape water and 3 explore the interaction among the river water local precipitation and groundwater around the area of urban landscape dams this study will greatly improve the present understanding of the impact of urban landscape dams on the water cycle in arid regions and may contribute to the sustainable management of urban water resources in these regions 2 study area the shiyang river basin is located in the east of the he xi corridor of gansu province west of the wushaoling mountain and north of the foot of qilian mountain in the east it is bounded by the wushao ling the maomao mountain the laohu mountain and the yellow river basin zhu et al 2019 the dahuang mountain maying beach and the heihe river basin are the boundaries in the west the shiyang river has a total length of 250 km the total area of the basin is 41 600 km2 and the average annual runoff is 1 57 109 m3 ma et al 2009 the basin can be divided into three areas namely the northern desert area annual precipitation is between 54 and 82 mm the central plain area annual precipitation is between 83 and 124 mm and the southern qilian mountain area annual precipitation is between 124 and 608 mm zhonggen wang 2012 most of the shiyang river basin belongs to an arid climate zone with strong solar radiation sufficient sunshine little precipitation strong evaporation and dry air the annual precipitation in the whole basin varies from 54 mm to 608 mm and the annual evaporation capacity is as high as 2000 3000 mm li et al 2021 the vegetation is typical for the desert vegetation landscape urban landscape dams are mainly distributed in urban and peri urban areas of wuwei city the middle reaches of the shiyang river basin with annual precipitation amounting to 83 124 mm zhonggen wang 2012 four rivers flow through the city including xiying river zamu river huangyang river and jinta river with a total catchment area of 3986 km2 they are the main water source for the whole region in 2000 only five landscape dams were built on the rivers in wuwei city by 2019 51 urban landscape dams have been built in urban and peri urban areas of wuwei city mainly artificial landscape waterfalls and rubber dams fig 1 which are used to create urban public landscape water bodies in this study the landscape water is clearly distinguished from natural river water landscape water refers to the water body intercepted and accumulated by landscape dams in urban and peri urban areas its primary function is to provide people with recreation and appreciation however due to the improper implementation of anti seepage treatment measures for the dam body dam leakage is common in urban landscape dams fig 1 table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and laboratory analysis from april 2015 to october 2019 276 samples m1 m10 were collected from the source of binggou river a tributary of the shiyang river to the middle reaches of the shiyang river among them m8 m10 are landscape water samples affected by landscape dams furthermore 209 groundwater samples were collected from 17 sampling points g1 g14 gl1 gl3 in the whole basin and 542 precipitation samples p1 p10 from 10 sampling points at the same time an automatic weather station was used to record the temperature relative humidity and other meteorological variables river water and groundwater samples were stored in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles precipitation samples were collected with standard funnels at meteorological stations to prevent evaporation and leakage of samples during transport and storage all bottle openings were sealed with plastic tape and then frozen all the water samples collected were tested by a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research usa in the stable isotope laboratory of northwest normal university to ensure the accuracy of the measurements a duplicate sample was collected for each sample considering the average value of the two as the final value the isotope analysis results are expressed with the notation δ and relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 1 δ sample r sample r v sample 1 1000 where rsample is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in the samples and rstandard is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in v smow the precision was 0 60 for δ2h and 0 20 for δ18o the researchers counted and compared the number of landscape dams built in the built up area of wuwei city in 2005 2010 2015 and 2019 to better reveal the impact of landscape dams on river water in and around urban areas found in the arid area the number of landscape dams built in different historical periods was based on analyzing the satellite images of landsat 7 and field inspection was carried out to verify the accuracy of the results the details of urban landscape dams are shown in table s1 river water level and groundwater level data were obtained from the local hydrological bureau altitude information for each sampling point was gathered using trimble juno sa a high precision outdoor handheld gps data collector 3 2 analysis methods 3 2 1 calculation and indication of deuterium excess d excess stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h are ideal natural tracers to understand the water cycle and related diverse hydrological processes thomas and rose 2003 the deuterium excess d excess d δd 8δ18o has been widely applied to precipitation and ice core studies jouzel et al 1997 merlivat and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 welker 2012 it is also used in this contribution to investigate the river water cycle of inland river basins in arid regions river water sources mainly include precipitation other surface water and groundwater the d excess values of these water masses may vary considerably river water that experiences intense evaporation has a lower d excess compared to δd and δ18o d excess is a more comprehensive indicator and can be used to trace different water masses more accurately 3 2 2 quantifying evaporation loss in the urban water landscape evaporative loss from surface water bodies and subsequent water level fluctuations in rivers lakes and wetlands are important elements of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle gammons et al 2006 hamilton et al 2005 water loss caused by evaporation cannot be ignored on the river water in arid regions as well as the urban landscape water with a slow flow caused by artificial river closure the evaporation loss ratio of a water body can be calculated by the formula 2 skrzypek et al 2015 2 f 1 δ δ δ 0 δ 1 m where f is the evaporation loss ratio δ is the measured value for the urban landscape water body and δ0 is the initial value of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water the intersection of the local meteoric water line and the local evaporation line lel is generally considered to be the average isotopic composition of the input water body in the basin gibson et al 2005 therefore this intersection point δ18o 9 70 δd 61 20 is chosen as the value of δ0 δ is the limiting isotope enrichment factor and m is the enrichment slope these parameters worked well in the study of previous studies the calculation of the above parameters was implemented in the hydrocalculator skrzypek et al 2015 http hydrocalculator gskrzypek com the calculation results of water evaporation loss ratio calculated by δ18o were found to be reliable qian et al 2007 thus the δ18o value was used to calculate the evaporation loss of the upper reaches of the shiyang river and the urban landscape water in wuwei city in the middle reaches of the shiyang river 3 2 3 estimating water mass balance using isotope mass balance imb model the usefulness of determining water balance with the isotope mass balance model imb has been demonstrated previously in the case study of lakes in northern canada gibson et al 2002 the imb which assumes well mixed conditions and steady state hydrology was used to estimate the ratio of evaporation to total inflow e i based on the isotopic offset between the evaporatively enriched lake water and precipitation this method only considers the average isotopic composition of the whole water body its main objective is to determine the proportion of inflow water evaporated from the catchment area for a well mixed inland catchment the water volume is assumed to be stable on a long term scale the water balance equation is as follows 3 i q e m 3 year 1 where i is the total amount flowing into the small catchment area due to the lack of precipitation the impact of precipitation on the water inflow and the river isotope in the urban landscape water area was ignored q is the output of river water in the urban landscape water area e is the evaporation capacity of river water in the landscape water area by multiplying each term of the water balance equation by its corresponding stable isotope composition the equation of isotopic mass conservation of the small catchment area may be written as 4 i δ i q δ q e δ e m 3 year 1 where δi δq and δe are the isotopic contents of the inflow water the outflow water and the evaporating water vapor of the urban landscape water for well mixed artificial inland waters we assume δq δl gibson et al 2017 δl is the isotopic value of a reservoir by combining formula 3 and formula 4 q can be eliminated and the evaporation to inflow ratio f of the urban landscape water can be deduced 5 e i δ l δ i δ l δ e dimensionless the isotopic composition of evaporating δe can be estimated with the help of the craig and gordon 1965 linear resistance model given by gonfiantini 1986 as 6 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where h is the relative humidity decimal fraction δa is the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture ɛ is the equilibrium isotopic separation horita and wesolowski 1994 α is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation whereby ɛ 1000 α 1 and ɛk is the kinetic isotopic separation the latter being quantified for operational use is from a range of laboratory and field experiments horita et al 2008 δe is then substituted into eq 7 7 e i δ l δ i m δ δ l dimensionless where δ is the limiting isotopic enrichment which is atmospherically controlled gat and levy 1978 and can be calculated by the following formula 8 δ h δ a ε h 10 3 ε where δa is the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture which can be estimated by formula 9 9 δ a δ p 10 3 α 1 where δp is the isotope composition of local precipitation and α is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation for δ18o α is calculated by the formula 10 10 10 3 ln α 1 137 t 2 10 6 0 4156 t 10 3 2 0667 where t is the interface temperature k of the atmosphere in formula 7 m is the isotope enrichment slope which can be obtained by the following formula 11 m h 10 3 ε 1 h 10 3 ε k dimensionless where ɛ is the total isotopic separation factor including both equilibrium ɛ and kinetic ɛk components which can be calculated as follows 12 ε ε ε k 13 ε 1 1 α 10 3 14 ε k c k 1 h under normal evaporation conditions the constant experimentally determined ck values of 14 2 for the stable oxygen isotope are used as typical lake evaporation conditions gonfiantini 1986 aragu aragu et al 2000 15 ε k 14 2 1 h as the inflow to a water area is comprised of precipitation on the lake surface as well as ungauged inflow r i e i p r we can estimate r for landscape water area by substitution of eq 16 16 r e f p m 3 year 1 where f e i e e la and p p la e and p are the annual depth equivalent of evaporation and precipitation m year 1 and la is the lake area m2 water yield wy or the depth equivalent runoff can then be estimated as 17 wy r wa 1000 mm year 1 where wa is the watershed area the application of the imb model requires the selection of appropriate parameters the coordinates latitude longitude for the landscape water and the landscape water elevation were obtained using trimble juno sa a high precision outdoor handheld gps data collector the shiyang river basin data in vector format were obtained from the geospatial data cloud platform http www gscloud cn search we used arcgis to process the vector information of the shiyang river basin each precipitation sampling point is equipped with a meteorological station where the meteorological parameters were obtained by a meteorological recorder the parameters extracted were total surface precipitation mm yr 1 relative humidity surface evaporation mm yr 1 and temperature c the evaporation flux weighting approach gibson et al 2016 was used to flux weight estimates of relative humidity and temperature the water balance calculations represented the open water season annual averages of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation δp were amount weighted values based on the amount and isotopic composition of 542 precipitation events sampled during 2015 2019 note that calculations were performed using long term climatologies of the parameters 4 results 4 1 characteristics of the urban landscape dam and surrounding water bodies in spring fig 2 a δd values of the urban landscape water in wuwei varied from 61 04 to 35 05 with an average value of 48 32 values of δ18o varied from 9 57 to 3 44 with an average of 7 56 in summer fig 2b δd values of the urban landscape water were from 59 00 to 31 16 with an average of 48 80 δ18o values varied from 9 37 to 3 41 with an average of 7 75 also during this time the slope of the landscape water line ulwl which represents the urban landscape water line based on the regression of δd and δ18o values near wuwei city in the middle reaches of the shiyang river was the smallest slope 4 70 indicating that the evaporation effect of the urban landscape water was the strongest in autumn fig 2c δd values of urban landscape water ranged from 54 78 to 32 60 with an average of 45 84 δ18o values varied from 8 74 to 5 67 with an average of 7 60 due to the water bodies freeze in cold season from nov to mar of the following year mean monthly temperature is between 3 and 1 c caused by the high latitude 101 22 104 04 e and 37 07 39 27 n of the study area it is hard to obtain river water samples during this period during the whole sampling period fig 2d table s3 δd values of the natural river water in the upper reaches varied from 108 30 to 33 63 with an average of 52 20 δ18o values varied from 17 34 to 5 87 with an average of 8 37 δd values of the urban landscape water varied from 61 04 to 26 57 with an average of 47 43 δ18o values varied from 9 57 to 3 41 with an average of 7 60 most of the river water sampling points plotted are located near lmwl which indicates that precipitations are the main source of the river water supply the δd values for the groundwater samples varied from 76 99 to 36 48 with an average of 55 38 the δ18o values for the groundwater samples varied from 10 43 to 6 24 with an average of 8 78 in general the linear fitting equation of δd and δ18o in precipitation lmwl in the shiyang river basin was δd 7 58δ18o 9 35 showing a significantly positive linear correlation table s3 the slope of lmwl was smaller than the global meteoric water line gmwl this area is less disturbed by precipitation and has strong evaporation and fractionation effect the curve of river water samples in the shiyang river from april 2015 to october 2019 was fitted as follows δd 6 48δ18o 3 88 fig 2d where the liner fitting curve of landscape water samples was represented by δd 5 29δ18o 7 20 the slope and the intercept of the two lines were smaller than lmwl indicating an obvious evaporation effect on the surface water in the middle and upper reaches of the shiyang river the groundwater line gwl and the river water line rwl represents the river water line based on the regression of δd and δ18o values of all surface water in the middle and upper reaches were close to lmwl this indicates that the river water and the groundwater are supplied by precipitation 4 2 spatiotemporal variation of isotopic values of water bodies in urban landscape dams the isotopic values in river water varied in accordance with the dry and wet seasons the dry season is from november to april while the wet season is from may to october table 2 in the dry season fig 3 b the surface water was gradually enriched from the natural river water to the landscape water δd values varied from 61 80 to 26 50 with an average of 50 10 δ18o values varied from 10 27 to 3 44 with an average of 8 10 d excess values varied from 2 94 to 30 44 with an average of 14 75 in the wet season fig 3a the surface water also became gradually enriched from the natural river water to the landscape water δd values varied from 61 27 to 31 16 with an average of 48 90 δ18o values varied from 9 52 to 3 41 with an average of 8 12 d excess values varied from 4 29 to 31 58 with an average of 16 07 from the spatial perspective surface water isotopic values showed a gradual enrichment from the natural river water in the upper reaches to the landscape water in the middle reaches the spatial variation of δd and δ18o values is of similar characteristic δd values varied from 61 40 to 30 10 with an average of 50 20 δ18o values varied from 9 60 to 3 40 with an average of 8 20 using the dunnett test stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of the natural river water in the upper reaches are significantly different from those of the landscape water in the middle reaches p 0 05 the average isotopic value of m3 was the lowest among the whole sampling points 51 87 and 8 56 respectively while the average isotopic value of sampling point m10 was the highest among all the sampling points 45 61 and 7 17 respectively δd and δ18o values of the landscape water in wuwei city the middle reaches of the shiyang river were higher than those in the natural river water for sampling points in wuwei city average values of δd and δ18o at the outlet of wuwei city were the highest 45 61 and 7 17 respectively while average values of δd and δ18o at the water inlet m8 were the lowest 49 31 and 8 08 respectively compared to the water inlet of wuwei city average values of δd and δ18o at the outlet of wuwei city increased by 4 3 and 0 91 respectively the d excess values showed similar characteristics in both seasons the average values decreased gradually from the upstream to the midstream in terms of spatial differentiation d excess values were opposite to the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of the surface water they gradually decreased from the upstream to the midstream 4 3 comparison of river water and urban landscape water affected by evaporation the evaporation loss ratios of urban landscape water in wuwei city and the upper reaches of the shiyang river in 2018 were compared with the help of hydrocalculator fig 4 analysis showed that the evaporation intensity of river water was higher during summer and lower during winter the evaporation loss ratio f of the natural river water in the upper reaches of the shiyang river was less than 7 the urban landscape water was between 7 and 12 using the dunnett test it was revealed that isotopic values of the natural river water were significantly different from those of the landscape water p 0 05 the f value of urban landscape water was significantly higher than that of the upstream natural river water indicating that evaporation affected the urban landscape water more than the upstream natural river water 5 discussion 5 1 evaporation effect of urban landscape dams evaporation is one of the most important processes in the hydrological cycle it is considered as one of the leading factors responsible for climate change in the terrestrial environment especially in arid regions gibson et al 2002 gibson and edwards 2002 fig 2 shows that the surface water isotope data points were close to lmwl but the slope and the intercept of the linear fitting curve were smaller moreover it shows that the river water was supplied by precipitation but experienced evaporation and fractionation to a certain extent the slope of the urban landscape water line for sites in wuwei city was the smallest which indicates that the evaporation of urban landscape water is at its highest the ratio of evaporation to total inflow e i is an important indicator of water balance for a relatively stable open water area the short term water balance can be easily estimated by using the isotope mass balance imb method to determine the e i δ18o was selected to estimate the e i value of urban landscape water where the reliability of part 4 3 of this study was verified the evaporation and inflow ratio e i of urban landscape water in the shiyang river basin was estimated based on the imb model and combined with the obtained precipitation and river water stable isotope data the results showed that the evaporation was high due to water impoundment caused by landscape dams and subsequent temperature rose caused by the urban heat island effect about 21 71 of the water flowing into the urban landscape water area was consumed by evaporation table 3 and the remaining 78 29 continued to flow downstream table s2 the water yield wy of the shiyang river basin was 12 mm corroborating a large evaporation loss ratio of 22 inflow the e i value of the shiyang river affected by human activities and drought was the largest compared with other research results the e i of the yellow river source area in the qinghai tibet plateau was 6 biggs et al 2015 and the water yield was between 170 mm and 250 mm the e i of the lake area in ontario canada was 9 gibson et al 2017 and the water yield was 395 mm these areas are all located in the river source area with small evaporation and high water yield in 2016 gibson et al 2016 investigated 50 lakes in alberta canada among them sandy lake n showed a higher e i value and negative water yield table 3 the estimation of water balance by the imb method can lead to errors gat and levy 1978 the reliability of the estimated e i results mainly depends on the validity of the model input parameters where parameters obtained by actual monitoring t h δl δa are better uncertainty exists to a certain extent in terms of parameters obtained through the calculation of relative equations in the process of model operation ε and εk were mainly related to the actual monitoring water surface temperature and atmospheric relative humidity which had minimal errors the most critical parameter in the model is δ one of the main sources of error in δ was the data δa obtained from field monitoring such data obtained through field monitoring was relatively reliable when the δ value was set to change within 10 the e i result would change within 5 therefore the evaporation results of urban landscape water calculated by the imb method are comparatively reliable 5 2 impact of anti seepage treatment of urban landscape dams on groundwater the construction of landscape dams on rivers disturbs the natural state of rivers after the completion of dams the original runoff distribution of the river changed greatly and the natural recharge of groundwater also changed peng and wang 2008 geochemical tracing methods including natural and artificial water tracks are used in some cases to detect dam leakage sources bedmar and araguas 2002 di and wang 2010 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen have been widely used to investigate the leakage of dams and reservoirs accurately ghomshei and allen 2000 isotopic evidences for landscape water and groundwater combined with river and groundwater level data proved that the landscape water is an significant source of recharge to the surrounding groundwater the river water level rose caused by the impoundment of landscape dam is the main reason for its leakage the isotopic evidence showed fig 5 that the sampling points of urban landscape water were concentrated in the lower right corner of lmwl indicating that the urban landscape water is strongly affected by evaporation the h o isotopic composition of groundwater samples in the whole basin showed a linear regression of δd 6 25δ18o 0 44 the h o isotopic composition of groundwater samples in the wuwei city showed a linear regression of δd 5 05δ18o 7 84 while the linear regression equation of the ulwl was δd 5 29δ18o 7 20 we can conclude that there is a close interaction between the groundwater and the landscape water indicating that the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of groundwater around the landscape dam area well inherit the isotopic characteristics of local landscape water that is to say the dynamics of the groundwater around the landscape dam area are greatly affected by the dams themselves on the contrary the groundwater isotopic values near natural rivers without urban landscape dams did not show an obvious effect of evaporation and a close interaction with surface water this enlightens that the leak coming from the dam leads to the inherent interaction between surface water and groundwater similar results were also reached by ba et al 2014 and rai et al 2012 who have successfully used the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes for leakage source detection in other reservoirs in addition we collected the groundwater level of gl2 sampling point and the river water level within the urban landscape dam area in the nearby hydrological station from 2017 to 2019 fig 6 the river water level was higher than the groundwater level during the flood season june to september indicating that the river supplies the groundwater this is consistent with the results of the present study groundwater is recharged by the surface water coming from the leakage in the urban landscape dam area 6 conclusions based on the measured data of stable isotopes of different water bodies in the shiyang river basin as well as hydrological and meteorological observation data the variation characteristics and influencing factors of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water from the upper reaches of shiyang river to the middle reaches of arid region of central asia were studied results showed that the stable isotope values in the natural river and landscape water had strong spatial temporal variability for the time variability of stable isotopes the average value of δ18o in the natural river during dry season was 8 4 while it was 7 41 in the landscape water the enrichment degree of landscape water was significantly higher than that of the natural river from the perspective of spatial variability the average value of δ18o in the upstream natural river was 8 35 and 7 55 in the landscape water the isotopic composition of surface water in the shiyang river basin is gradually enriched from upstream to midstream with the landscape water having relatively greater enrichment isotopic evidence showed that evaporation is an important factor in the variation of landscape water isotopic composition a comparison of the evaporation loss ratios between the urban landscape water area and the upper reaches of the shiyang river basin was made by means of hydrocalculator this analysis showed that the f value of urban landscape water between 7 and 12 was significantly higher than that of the upstream river water less than 7 this indicating that the evaporation effect of urban landscape water in the middle reaches is stronger than the upstream river water using the imb model the e i value of the open water intercepted by the urban landscape dam in shiyang river basin was estimated to be 22 indicating a high evaporation loss ratio urban landscape dams in arid regions lead to the increase of evaporation where the urban landscape water tends to dry gradually the interaction between surface water and groundwater in the landscape dam area was explored by means of the developed comparative conceptual model and river water level data isotopic evidence showed that the urban landscape water line was close to the underground water line within the landscape dam area there is a close exchange relationship between them landscape water supplies groundwater the transformation of a large amount of surface water into groundwater and the loss of water resources through evaporation in arid regions may significantly affect the amount of river water flowing downstream declaration of competing

4231,to meet the needs of human recreation and provide community amenities landscape dams i e water retaining structures for intercepting river water in cities and surrounding areas which are mainly used to create an urban landscape environment are built in urban and peri urban areas worldwide the construction of these dams however may adversely affect the local and regional water cycle we collected water samples from 2015 to 2019 from different water bodies in urban and peri urban areas traversing the middle and upper reaches of shiyang river basin in the arid area of central asia to analyze their isotopic characteristics meanwhile field surveys as well as meteorological hydrological and remote sensing data were added to evaluate the hydrologic effects of urban landscape dams on a watershed scale in an arid region with scarce water resources and fragile ecosystems isotopic values of landscape water were more enriched than that of natural river the result of the evaporation loss ratio showed that the landscape water was 0 5 higher moreover the cumulative effect of multiple landscape dams leads to a great loss of water resources in arid areas the study also demonstrated that evaporation is a vital factor in causing change in the isotope composition of the landscape water in the shiyang river basin the interaction between surface water and groundwater was frequent within the landscape dam area wherein groundwater was mainly recharged by surface water leakage sufficient attention should be given to the evaporation leakage local precipitation and groundwater changes caused by the impoundment of landscape dams thus the potentially adverse effects of urban landscape dams in arid regions should be highly considered in long term water resources sustainability

1 introduction a large number of dams have been built worldwide in the past century to meet the needs for electricity irrigation and recreation biemans et al 2011 poff and schmidt 2016 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 presently about two thirds of global rivers have been retained by reservoirs and dams luo et al 2020 maavara 2020 zhang et al 2017 most of these dams are landscape dams located in the middle and lower reaches of rivers a significant number of studies have clearly demonstrated that dams may reduce connectivity between watersheds which can have potential hydrological and ecological impacts on the watersheds song 2020 zhang et al 2020 the urban landscape water is characterized by small water area shallow depth low velocity and strong evaporation chen et al 2013 henny and meutia 2014 to date more and more small dams with water sources mainly from river water from upstream areas have been constructed in urban rivers as a landscape engineering practice bao et al 2018 chang et al 2020 hilton et al 2006 while urbanization progresses rapidly the impact of small landscape dams on the environment has increasingly attracted attention zhao et al 2012 similar to large reservoirs small dams likewise change the morphological and hydrological characteristics of rivers bao et al 2020 gao et al 2017 guo et al 2017 studies have shown that additional water loss caused by reservoir based evaporation amounts to about 5 of global river water flow giving rise to great reduction of water resources in some regions lehner et al 2011 stable water supply in arid regions is essential for human well being and socioeconomic development quinn et al 2019 given this it is imperative to clarify and systematically elaborate the hydrological effects of small landscape dams on a specific watershed in arid areas stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes δd and δ18o in river water are ideal natural tracers craig 1961 gat 1996 which help understand various hydrological processes related to the water cycle deng et al 2016 wang et al 2019 wei 2017 existing research on the effects of damming and drought on water cycle dynamics using hydrogen and oxygen isotopes is enlightening grabb et al 2021 jiang et al 2021 saranya et al 2020 wu et al 2021 but these studies mainly focus on large river systems hillel et al 2015 wang et al 2019 recent studies used stable isotope methods to elucidate changes in river water cycle due to reservoir impoundment deng et al 2016 and focused on the comprehensive review of the yangtze river li et al 2016 the lancang river fan et al 2015 and other rivers yang et al 2020 with abundant water energy as of late we see the emergence of studies on the impact of small dams on river water cycle for example it is reported that small dams usually cause more sediment to be trapped in impounding areas kim et al 2004 furthermore quantifying the water balance of small watersheds such as lakes and reservoirs is vital for maintaining river water health in arid areas biggs et al 2015 gibson et al 2016 wan et al 2019 another study pointed out that stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes as natural tracers can be regarded as the dna of a water body by accurately providing the source information of the leakage point ghomshei and allen 2000 peng and wang 2008 yi et al 2018 in contrast there is a relative lack of studies on urban runoff in arid and semi arid regions jefferson et al 2017 which accounts for 40 of global land areas regier et al 2020 moreover research on the influence of water conservancy projects on water cycle in urban and peri urban areas in arid regions are rare thus it is urgent to monitor the dynamic process of water cycle within the vicinity of urban landscape dams understanding the hydrological process of landscape dams in arid regions will help to quantify the water cycle response mechanism under dam intervention and provide reference for water resources management in the said regions previous studies failed to fully understand the water cycle effect of urban landscape dams in arid areas for lack of high density and more refined stable isotope monitoring network to fill these knowledge gaps observation systems were established in wuwei city shiyang river basin china s inland river basin the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope method was used to trace the climate and hydrological response mechanism under the intervention of urban landscape dams in the shiyang river basin the goals of this study are to 1 characterize the spatiotemporal variability of stable isotope values in natural rivers and landscape water 2 discuss the climate hydrology and environmental variables that cause changes in the isotopic composition of urban landscape water and 3 explore the interaction among the river water local precipitation and groundwater around the area of urban landscape dams this study will greatly improve the present understanding of the impact of urban landscape dams on the water cycle in arid regions and may contribute to the sustainable management of urban water resources in these regions 2 study area the shiyang river basin is located in the east of the he xi corridor of gansu province west of the wushaoling mountain and north of the foot of qilian mountain in the east it is bounded by the wushao ling the maomao mountain the laohu mountain and the yellow river basin zhu et al 2019 the dahuang mountain maying beach and the heihe river basin are the boundaries in the west the shiyang river has a total length of 250 km the total area of the basin is 41 600 km2 and the average annual runoff is 1 57 109 m3 ma et al 2009 the basin can be divided into three areas namely the northern desert area annual precipitation is between 54 and 82 mm the central plain area annual precipitation is between 83 and 124 mm and the southern qilian mountain area annual precipitation is between 124 and 608 mm zhonggen wang 2012 most of the shiyang river basin belongs to an arid climate zone with strong solar radiation sufficient sunshine little precipitation strong evaporation and dry air the annual precipitation in the whole basin varies from 54 mm to 608 mm and the annual evaporation capacity is as high as 2000 3000 mm li et al 2021 the vegetation is typical for the desert vegetation landscape urban landscape dams are mainly distributed in urban and peri urban areas of wuwei city the middle reaches of the shiyang river basin with annual precipitation amounting to 83 124 mm zhonggen wang 2012 four rivers flow through the city including xiying river zamu river huangyang river and jinta river with a total catchment area of 3986 km2 they are the main water source for the whole region in 2000 only five landscape dams were built on the rivers in wuwei city by 2019 51 urban landscape dams have been built in urban and peri urban areas of wuwei city mainly artificial landscape waterfalls and rubber dams fig 1 which are used to create urban public landscape water bodies in this study the landscape water is clearly distinguished from natural river water landscape water refers to the water body intercepted and accumulated by landscape dams in urban and peri urban areas its primary function is to provide people with recreation and appreciation however due to the improper implementation of anti seepage treatment measures for the dam body dam leakage is common in urban landscape dams fig 1 table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and laboratory analysis from april 2015 to october 2019 276 samples m1 m10 were collected from the source of binggou river a tributary of the shiyang river to the middle reaches of the shiyang river among them m8 m10 are landscape water samples affected by landscape dams furthermore 209 groundwater samples were collected from 17 sampling points g1 g14 gl1 gl3 in the whole basin and 542 precipitation samples p1 p10 from 10 sampling points at the same time an automatic weather station was used to record the temperature relative humidity and other meteorological variables river water and groundwater samples were stored in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles precipitation samples were collected with standard funnels at meteorological stations to prevent evaporation and leakage of samples during transport and storage all bottle openings were sealed with plastic tape and then frozen all the water samples collected were tested by a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research usa in the stable isotope laboratory of northwest normal university to ensure the accuracy of the measurements a duplicate sample was collected for each sample considering the average value of the two as the final value the isotope analysis results are expressed with the notation δ and relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow 1 δ sample r sample r v sample 1 1000 where rsample is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in the samples and rstandard is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in v smow the precision was 0 60 for δ2h and 0 20 for δ18o the researchers counted and compared the number of landscape dams built in the built up area of wuwei city in 2005 2010 2015 and 2019 to better reveal the impact of landscape dams on river water in and around urban areas found in the arid area the number of landscape dams built in different historical periods was based on analyzing the satellite images of landsat 7 and field inspection was carried out to verify the accuracy of the results the details of urban landscape dams are shown in table s1 river water level and groundwater level data were obtained from the local hydrological bureau altitude information for each sampling point was gathered using trimble juno sa a high precision outdoor handheld gps data collector 3 2 analysis methods 3 2 1 calculation and indication of deuterium excess d excess stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h are ideal natural tracers to understand the water cycle and related diverse hydrological processes thomas and rose 2003 the deuterium excess d excess d δd 8δ18o has been widely applied to precipitation and ice core studies jouzel et al 1997 merlivat and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 welker 2012 it is also used in this contribution to investigate the river water cycle of inland river basins in arid regions river water sources mainly include precipitation other surface water and groundwater the d excess values of these water masses may vary considerably river water that experiences intense evaporation has a lower d excess compared to δd and δ18o d excess is a more comprehensive indicator and can be used to trace different water masses more accurately 3 2 2 quantifying evaporation loss in the urban water landscape evaporative loss from surface water bodies and subsequent water level fluctuations in rivers lakes and wetlands are important elements of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle gammons et al 2006 hamilton et al 2005 water loss caused by evaporation cannot be ignored on the river water in arid regions as well as the urban landscape water with a slow flow caused by artificial river closure the evaporation loss ratio of a water body can be calculated by the formula 2 skrzypek et al 2015 2 f 1 δ δ δ 0 δ 1 m where f is the evaporation loss ratio δ is the measured value for the urban landscape water body and δ0 is the initial value of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water the intersection of the local meteoric water line and the local evaporation line lel is generally considered to be the average isotopic composition of the input water body in the basin gibson et al 2005 therefore this intersection point δ18o 9 70 δd 61 20 is chosen as the value of δ0 δ is the limiting isotope enrichment factor and m is the enrichment slope these parameters worked well in the study of previous studies the calculation of the above parameters was implemented in the hydrocalculator skrzypek et al 2015 http hydrocalculator gskrzypek com the calculation results of water evaporation loss ratio calculated by δ18o were found to be reliable qian et al 2007 thus the δ18o value was used to calculate the evaporation loss of the upper reaches of the shiyang river and the urban landscape water in wuwei city in the middle reaches of the shiyang river 3 2 3 estimating water mass balance using isotope mass balance imb model the usefulness of determining water balance with the isotope mass balance model imb has been demonstrated previously in the case study of lakes in northern canada gibson et al 2002 the imb which assumes well mixed conditions and steady state hydrology was used to estimate the ratio of evaporation to total inflow e i based on the isotopic offset between the evaporatively enriched lake water and precipitation this method only considers the average isotopic composition of the whole water body its main objective is to determine the proportion of inflow water evaporated from the catchment area for a well mixed inland catchment the water volume is assumed to be stable on a long term scale the water balance equation is as follows 3 i q e m 3 year 1 where i is the total amount flowing into the small catchment area due to the lack of precipitation the impact of precipitation on the water inflow and the river isotope in the urban landscape water area was ignored q is the output of river water in the urban landscape water area e is the evaporation capacity of river water in the landscape water area by multiplying each term of the water balance equation by its corresponding stable isotope composition the equation of isotopic mass conservation of the small catchment area may be written as 4 i δ i q δ q e δ e m 3 year 1 where δi δq and δe are the isotopic contents of the inflow water the outflow water and the evaporating water vapor of the urban landscape water for well mixed artificial inland waters we assume δq δl gibson et al 2017 δl is the isotopic value of a reservoir by combining formula 3 and formula 4 q can be eliminated and the evaporation to inflow ratio f of the urban landscape water can be deduced 5 e i δ l δ i δ l δ e dimensionless the isotopic composition of evaporating δe can be estimated with the help of the craig and gordon 1965 linear resistance model given by gonfiantini 1986 as 6 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where h is the relative humidity decimal fraction δa is the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture ɛ is the equilibrium isotopic separation horita and wesolowski 1994 α is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation whereby ɛ 1000 α 1 and ɛk is the kinetic isotopic separation the latter being quantified for operational use is from a range of laboratory and field experiments horita et al 2008 δe is then substituted into eq 7 7 e i δ l δ i m δ δ l dimensionless where δ is the limiting isotopic enrichment which is atmospherically controlled gat and levy 1978 and can be calculated by the following formula 8 δ h δ a ε h 10 3 ε where δa is the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture which can be estimated by formula 9 9 δ a δ p 10 3 α 1 where δp is the isotope composition of local precipitation and α is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation for δ18o α is calculated by the formula 10 10 10 3 ln α 1 137 t 2 10 6 0 4156 t 10 3 2 0667 where t is the interface temperature k of the atmosphere in formula 7 m is the isotope enrichment slope which can be obtained by the following formula 11 m h 10 3 ε 1 h 10 3 ε k dimensionless where ɛ is the total isotopic separation factor including both equilibrium ɛ and kinetic ɛk components which can be calculated as follows 12 ε ε ε k 13 ε 1 1 α 10 3 14 ε k c k 1 h under normal evaporation conditions the constant experimentally determined ck values of 14 2 for the stable oxygen isotope are used as typical lake evaporation conditions gonfiantini 1986 aragu aragu et al 2000 15 ε k 14 2 1 h as the inflow to a water area is comprised of precipitation on the lake surface as well as ungauged inflow r i e i p r we can estimate r for landscape water area by substitution of eq 16 16 r e f p m 3 year 1 where f e i e e la and p p la e and p are the annual depth equivalent of evaporation and precipitation m year 1 and la is the lake area m2 water yield wy or the depth equivalent runoff can then be estimated as 17 wy r wa 1000 mm year 1 where wa is the watershed area the application of the imb model requires the selection of appropriate parameters the coordinates latitude longitude for the landscape water and the landscape water elevation were obtained using trimble juno sa a high precision outdoor handheld gps data collector the shiyang river basin data in vector format were obtained from the geospatial data cloud platform http www gscloud cn search we used arcgis to process the vector information of the shiyang river basin each precipitation sampling point is equipped with a meteorological station where the meteorological parameters were obtained by a meteorological recorder the parameters extracted were total surface precipitation mm yr 1 relative humidity surface evaporation mm yr 1 and temperature c the evaporation flux weighting approach gibson et al 2016 was used to flux weight estimates of relative humidity and temperature the water balance calculations represented the open water season annual averages of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation δp were amount weighted values based on the amount and isotopic composition of 542 precipitation events sampled during 2015 2019 note that calculations were performed using long term climatologies of the parameters 4 results 4 1 characteristics of the urban landscape dam and surrounding water bodies in spring fig 2 a δd values of the urban landscape water in wuwei varied from 61 04 to 35 05 with an average value of 48 32 values of δ18o varied from 9 57 to 3 44 with an average of 7 56 in summer fig 2b δd values of the urban landscape water were from 59 00 to 31 16 with an average of 48 80 δ18o values varied from 9 37 to 3 41 with an average of 7 75 also during this time the slope of the landscape water line ulwl which represents the urban landscape water line based on the regression of δd and δ18o values near wuwei city in the middle reaches of the shiyang river was the smallest slope 4 70 indicating that the evaporation effect of the urban landscape water was the strongest in autumn fig 2c δd values of urban landscape water ranged from 54 78 to 32 60 with an average of 45 84 δ18o values varied from 8 74 to 5 67 with an average of 7 60 due to the water bodies freeze in cold season from nov to mar of the following year mean monthly temperature is between 3 and 1 c caused by the high latitude 101 22 104 04 e and 37 07 39 27 n of the study area it is hard to obtain river water samples during this period during the whole sampling period fig 2d table s3 δd values of the natural river water in the upper reaches varied from 108 30 to 33 63 with an average of 52 20 δ18o values varied from 17 34 to 5 87 with an average of 8 37 δd values of the urban landscape water varied from 61 04 to 26 57 with an average of 47 43 δ18o values varied from 9 57 to 3 41 with an average of 7 60 most of the river water sampling points plotted are located near lmwl which indicates that precipitations are the main source of the river water supply the δd values for the groundwater samples varied from 76 99 to 36 48 with an average of 55 38 the δ18o values for the groundwater samples varied from 10 43 to 6 24 with an average of 8 78 in general the linear fitting equation of δd and δ18o in precipitation lmwl in the shiyang river basin was δd 7 58δ18o 9 35 showing a significantly positive linear correlation table s3 the slope of lmwl was smaller than the global meteoric water line gmwl this area is less disturbed by precipitation and has strong evaporation and fractionation effect the curve of river water samples in the shiyang river from april 2015 to october 2019 was fitted as follows δd 6 48δ18o 3 88 fig 2d where the liner fitting curve of landscape water samples was represented by δd 5 29δ18o 7 20 the slope and the intercept of the two lines were smaller than lmwl indicating an obvious evaporation effect on the surface water in the middle and upper reaches of the shiyang river the groundwater line gwl and the river water line rwl represents the river water line based on the regression of δd and δ18o values of all surface water in the middle and upper reaches were close to lmwl this indicates that the river water and the groundwater are supplied by precipitation 4 2 spatiotemporal variation of isotopic values of water bodies in urban landscape dams the isotopic values in river water varied in accordance with the dry and wet seasons the dry season is from november to april while the wet season is from may to october table 2 in the dry season fig 3 b the surface water was gradually enriched from the natural river water to the landscape water δd values varied from 61 80 to 26 50 with an average of 50 10 δ18o values varied from 10 27 to 3 44 with an average of 8 10 d excess values varied from 2 94 to 30 44 with an average of 14 75 in the wet season fig 3a the surface water also became gradually enriched from the natural river water to the landscape water δd values varied from 61 27 to 31 16 with an average of 48 90 δ18o values varied from 9 52 to 3 41 with an average of 8 12 d excess values varied from 4 29 to 31 58 with an average of 16 07 from the spatial perspective surface water isotopic values showed a gradual enrichment from the natural river water in the upper reaches to the landscape water in the middle reaches the spatial variation of δd and δ18o values is of similar characteristic δd values varied from 61 40 to 30 10 with an average of 50 20 δ18o values varied from 9 60 to 3 40 with an average of 8 20 using the dunnett test stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of the natural river water in the upper reaches are significantly different from those of the landscape water in the middle reaches p 0 05 the average isotopic value of m3 was the lowest among the whole sampling points 51 87 and 8 56 respectively while the average isotopic value of sampling point m10 was the highest among all the sampling points 45 61 and 7 17 respectively δd and δ18o values of the landscape water in wuwei city the middle reaches of the shiyang river were higher than those in the natural river water for sampling points in wuwei city average values of δd and δ18o at the outlet of wuwei city were the highest 45 61 and 7 17 respectively while average values of δd and δ18o at the water inlet m8 were the lowest 49 31 and 8 08 respectively compared to the water inlet of wuwei city average values of δd and δ18o at the outlet of wuwei city increased by 4 3 and 0 91 respectively the d excess values showed similar characteristics in both seasons the average values decreased gradually from the upstream to the midstream in terms of spatial differentiation d excess values were opposite to the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of the surface water they gradually decreased from the upstream to the midstream 4 3 comparison of river water and urban landscape water affected by evaporation the evaporation loss ratios of urban landscape water in wuwei city and the upper reaches of the shiyang river in 2018 were compared with the help of hydrocalculator fig 4 analysis showed that the evaporation intensity of river water was higher during summer and lower during winter the evaporation loss ratio f of the natural river water in the upper reaches of the shiyang river was less than 7 the urban landscape water was between 7 and 12 using the dunnett test it was revealed that isotopic values of the natural river water were significantly different from those of the landscape water p 0 05 the f value of urban landscape water was significantly higher than that of the upstream natural river water indicating that evaporation affected the urban landscape water more than the upstream natural river water 5 discussion 5 1 evaporation effect of urban landscape dams evaporation is one of the most important processes in the hydrological cycle it is considered as one of the leading factors responsible for climate change in the terrestrial environment especially in arid regions gibson et al 2002 gibson and edwards 2002 fig 2 shows that the surface water isotope data points were close to lmwl but the slope and the intercept of the linear fitting curve were smaller moreover it shows that the river water was supplied by precipitation but experienced evaporation and fractionation to a certain extent the slope of the urban landscape water line for sites in wuwei city was the smallest which indicates that the evaporation of urban landscape water is at its highest the ratio of evaporation to total inflow e i is an important indicator of water balance for a relatively stable open water area the short term water balance can be easily estimated by using the isotope mass balance imb method to determine the e i δ18o was selected to estimate the e i value of urban landscape water where the reliability of part 4 3 of this study was verified the evaporation and inflow ratio e i of urban landscape water in the shiyang river basin was estimated based on the imb model and combined with the obtained precipitation and river water stable isotope data the results showed that the evaporation was high due to water impoundment caused by landscape dams and subsequent temperature rose caused by the urban heat island effect about 21 71 of the water flowing into the urban landscape water area was consumed by evaporation table 3 and the remaining 78 29 continued to flow downstream table s2 the water yield wy of the shiyang river basin was 12 mm corroborating a large evaporation loss ratio of 22 inflow the e i value of the shiyang river affected by human activities and drought was the largest compared with other research results the e i of the yellow river source area in the qinghai tibet plateau was 6 biggs et al 2015 and the water yield was between 170 mm and 250 mm the e i of the lake area in ontario canada was 9 gibson et al 2017 and the water yield was 395 mm these areas are all located in the river source area with small evaporation and high water yield in 2016 gibson et al 2016 investigated 50 lakes in alberta canada among them sandy lake n showed a higher e i value and negative water yield table 3 the estimation of water balance by the imb method can lead to errors gat and levy 1978 the reliability of the estimated e i results mainly depends on the validity of the model input parameters where parameters obtained by actual monitoring t h δl δa are better uncertainty exists to a certain extent in terms of parameters obtained through the calculation of relative equations in the process of model operation ε and εk were mainly related to the actual monitoring water surface temperature and atmospheric relative humidity which had minimal errors the most critical parameter in the model is δ one of the main sources of error in δ was the data δa obtained from field monitoring such data obtained through field monitoring was relatively reliable when the δ value was set to change within 10 the e i result would change within 5 therefore the evaporation results of urban landscape water calculated by the imb method are comparatively reliable 5 2 impact of anti seepage treatment of urban landscape dams on groundwater the construction of landscape dams on rivers disturbs the natural state of rivers after the completion of dams the original runoff distribution of the river changed greatly and the natural recharge of groundwater also changed peng and wang 2008 geochemical tracing methods including natural and artificial water tracks are used in some cases to detect dam leakage sources bedmar and araguas 2002 di and wang 2010 stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen have been widely used to investigate the leakage of dams and reservoirs accurately ghomshei and allen 2000 isotopic evidences for landscape water and groundwater combined with river and groundwater level data proved that the landscape water is an significant source of recharge to the surrounding groundwater the river water level rose caused by the impoundment of landscape dam is the main reason for its leakage the isotopic evidence showed fig 5 that the sampling points of urban landscape water were concentrated in the lower right corner of lmwl indicating that the urban landscape water is strongly affected by evaporation the h o isotopic composition of groundwater samples in the whole basin showed a linear regression of δd 6 25δ18o 0 44 the h o isotopic composition of groundwater samples in the wuwei city showed a linear regression of δd 5 05δ18o 7 84 while the linear regression equation of the ulwl was δd 5 29δ18o 7 20 we can conclude that there is a close interaction between the groundwater and the landscape water indicating that the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of groundwater around the landscape dam area well inherit the isotopic characteristics of local landscape water that is to say the dynamics of the groundwater around the landscape dam area are greatly affected by the dams themselves on the contrary the groundwater isotopic values near natural rivers without urban landscape dams did not show an obvious effect of evaporation and a close interaction with surface water this enlightens that the leak coming from the dam leads to the inherent interaction between surface water and groundwater similar results were also reached by ba et al 2014 and rai et al 2012 who have successfully used the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes for leakage source detection in other reservoirs in addition we collected the groundwater level of gl2 sampling point and the river water level within the urban landscape dam area in the nearby hydrological station from 2017 to 2019 fig 6 the river water level was higher than the groundwater level during the flood season june to september indicating that the river supplies the groundwater this is consistent with the results of the present study groundwater is recharged by the surface water coming from the leakage in the urban landscape dam area 6 conclusions based on the measured data of stable isotopes of different water bodies in the shiyang river basin as well as hydrological and meteorological observation data the variation characteristics and influencing factors of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water from the upper reaches of shiyang river to the middle reaches of arid region of central asia were studied results showed that the stable isotope values in the natural river and landscape water had strong spatial temporal variability for the time variability of stable isotopes the average value of δ18o in the natural river during dry season was 8 4 while it was 7 41 in the landscape water the enrichment degree of landscape water was significantly higher than that of the natural river from the perspective of spatial variability the average value of δ18o in the upstream natural river was 8 35 and 7 55 in the landscape water the isotopic composition of surface water in the shiyang river basin is gradually enriched from upstream to midstream with the landscape water having relatively greater enrichment isotopic evidence showed that evaporation is an important factor in the variation of landscape water isotopic composition a comparison of the evaporation loss ratios between the urban landscape water area and the upper reaches of the shiyang river basin was made by means of hydrocalculator this analysis showed that the f value of urban landscape water between 7 and 12 was significantly higher than that of the upstream river water less than 7 this indicating that the evaporation effect of urban landscape water in the middle reaches is stronger than the upstream river water using the imb model the e i value of the open water intercepted by the urban landscape dam in shiyang river basin was estimated to be 22 indicating a high evaporation loss ratio urban landscape dams in arid regions lead to the increase of evaporation where the urban landscape water tends to dry gradually the interaction between surface water and groundwater in the landscape dam area was explored by means of the developed comparative conceptual model and river water level data isotopic evidence showed that the urban landscape water line was close to the underground water line within the landscape dam area there is a close exchange relationship between them landscape water supplies groundwater the transformation of a large amount of surface water into groundwater and the loss of water resources through evaporation in arid regions may significantly affect the amount of river water flowing downstream declaration of competing

4232,in spite of many well known benefits of green roofs their widespread adoption as source control measures in urban stormwater management requires the use of adequate modelling tools the purpose of this study was to develop a simple water balance model for green roof runoff simulation based on conceptual hydrological processes and integrated into green roof designs the model was calibrated and validated with a pilot experimental dataset that included various green roof configurations the validated model was applied to simulate the hydrological responses of green roofs under different substrate designs and rainfall characteristics results showed that the model nash suttcliffe efficiency nse values under calibration and validation period ranged from 0 933 to 0 982 and the volume errors of relative percentage difference rpd varied from 1 45 to 5 35 which indicated the simulated runoff processes of green roofs were satisfactorily accurate the sensitivity analysis of parameters e g increased parameters by 50 showed the most sensitive parameter for simulating green roof runoff was the initial substrate water content which changed by 74 5 for runoff volume and 58 5 for time to runoff for a 50 increase in the saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity it increased runoff volume by 60 2 as well as the substrate depth increased runoff volume by 56 5 and changed time to runoff by 46 3 the simulated hydrograph indicated that decreasing the saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity distinctly delayed time to runoff and increased runoff retention similarly the runoff rate declined and runoff generation time was delayed with an increase in the substrate depths runoff retention percentages of the green roofs declined as rainfall depths increased with rainfall intensity decreasing mean time to runoff of the green roofs significantly increased from 30 0 min to 113 3 min runoff detention effects of green roofs were distinctly enhanced with the peak rainfall intensity delayed this study provided a simple modelling tool for simulating hydrological responses of green roofs under a wide set of substrate characteristics and rainfall conditions in order to guide green

surfaces into built environment locatelli et al 2014 green areas are being replaced by roofs roads sidewalks and public squares changing the original permeable condition into impervious surfaces berndtsson 2010 as a result impervious areas hinder the infiltration capacity of urban surfaces thus increasing stormwater runoff discharge güneralp et al 2015 moreover current urban drainage systems have limited capacity to deal with extreme storms caused by climate change larsen et al 2009 consequently there has been a considerable increase in stormwater runoff leading to raised risk of waterlogging or flooding in urban areas fletcher et al 2013 jha et al 2012 in an attempt to mitigate urban flooding several innovative strategies have been adopted to improve urban stormwater management and address future climatic challenges such as low impact development lid green infrastructure gi water sensitive urban design wsud and sustainable urban drainage systems suds as an advanced technology among them green roofs are increasingly being implemented in stormwater management practices as they retain detain and slowly release rainwater and do not use new space cipolla et al 2016 palla et al 2011 recent years green roofs have received increased recognition in many countries such as the usa japan australia germany and china shafique et al 2018 vijayaraghavan 2016 williams et al 2010 xiao et al 2014 hydrological performance monitoring of green roofs is an essential part of assessing their functionality and efficiency in order to guide future planning and implementation efforts bloomberg and strickland 2012 vijayaraghavan 2016 numerous studies have quantified the runoff volume retention of green roofs by both test modules and full scale roof installations gong et al 2019 gregoire and clausen 2011 liu et al 2019 wong and jim 2014 runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs depends on several factors such as substrate physical properties and its depth planted vegetation and roof slope getter et al 2007 gong et al 2021 graceson et al 2013 liu et al 2019 vanwoert et al 2005 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 antecedent substrate moisture condition bengtsson et al 2005 denardo et al 2005 liu et al 2020 seasonality mentens et al 2006 villarreal 2007 and climatic settings klein and coffman 2015 sims et al 2016 several studies have also concluded that retention and detention efficiency depends strongly on the rainfall amount and intensity of storm events brandão et al 2017 brunetti et al 2016 carter and rasmussen 2006 hilten et al 2008 simmons et al 2008 in general experimental studies are usually limited by the specific green roof configurations and local climatic settings as a result simulating the hydrological performance of green roofs is becoming increasingly important for stormwater engineers and urban planners berardi et al 2014 berndtsson 2010 in the last few years researchers have proposed many modelling tools to simulate green roof efficiency for example simple and robust empirical relations like curve number and rational coefficient berthier et al 2011 carson et al 2013 fassman beck et al 2013 liu et al 2020 event based hydrological models carbone et al 2014 kasmin et al 2010 lamera et al 2014 palla et al 2012 she and pang 2010 conceptual models for long term simulation locatelli et al 2014 stovin et al 2013 zhang and guo 2013 and numerical models by using software such as hydrus 1d brunetti et al 2016 feitosa and wilkinson 2016 hakimdavar et al 2014 hilten et al 2008 swmm baek et al 2020 cipolla et al 2016 hamouz and muthanna 2019 johannessen et al 2019 versini et al 2015 yao et al 2020 mike urban locatelli et al 2014 and swap metselaar 2012 however these models require accurate physical parameters and specific substrate information that can be difficult to obtain or measure hakimdavar et al 2016 moreover predicting the hydrologic responses of green roofs with regard to substrate design parameters is challenging because of the highly non linear relationships involved li and babcock 2016 therefore in order to support green roof design the model should be simple have low computational requirements and able to be easily integrated in decision support tools soulis et al 2017 in adoption of green roof technology one of the key limiting factors is the lack of appropriate modeling tools for evaluating the efficiency of designed green roofs elliott and trowsdale 2007 soulis et al 2017 the hydrological responses to single rainfall events particularly the extreme storm events are important characteristics in performance evaluation of green roofs however the observed rainfall runoff data are limited which makes it difficult to draw comprehensive conclusion about runoff retention and detention performance for green roofs accordingly storms with various rainfall characteristics need to be investigated to verify the green roof s reduction effectiveness in urban flooding lee et al 2013 however some modelling efforts are limited in estimating hydrological performance of designed green roof in response to different rainfall patterns li and babcock 2014 stovin et al 2013 the objectives of the present study are 1 to develop a simple water balance model for runoff simulation of green roofs based on conceptual hydrological processes and integrated into green roof designs 2 to demonstrate the simulation accuracy of the developed model by using data collected for pilot modules of green roofs in field experiments 3 to simulate the hydrological responses of green roof configurations to different substrate designs and rainfall characteristics these results will help to inform green roof designers regarding storm specific hydrologic responses of alternative green roof configurations 2 material and methods 2 1 water mass balance model development fig 1 presents the conceptual diagram for water mass balance of a green roof system in order to explicitly consider the water exchange processes between the substrate and storage layer the green roof system was generalized as two modules for modelling purposes a substrate layer module and a storage layer module during a rainfall event the key hydrological mechanisms operating within the green roof are the interception of rainfall by the vegetation layer infiltration and storage in the substrate layer when the water content in the substrate is greater than its maximum water storage capacity water will seep from the substrate layer into the storage layer and be temporarily stored any water in excess of the storage capacity of the storage layer will be discharged as runoff meanwhile substrate moisture will be lost to the atmosphere as a result of evaporation during dry periods based on the above analysis a water mass balance equation of the green roof system is expressed as q p v inter s stor r stor e t where q is the runoff depth from green roof mm p is the rainfall depth mm vinter is the interception of vegetation mm sstor is the water storage in the substrate layer mm rstor is the water storage in the storage layer mm et is the actual evaporation

performed in the rutter model to reduce model parameter requirements rainfall intercepted by the vegetation of a green roof is referred to as leaf surface storage when the maximum water storage of leaf surface is exceeded the effective rainfall is driven as infiltration into the substrate layer the equation to calculate rainfall intercepted by vegetation canopy vinter is expressed as v inter c

infiltration equation modified by mein and larson mein and larson 1973 is used to simulate the rainfall infiltration process net rainfall after the vegetation interception is infiltrated and stored in the substrate layer when the accumulated rainfall is larger than the substrate s maximum water holding capacity smax the water will seep from substrate into the storage layer the water holding capacity depends upon the substrate materials composition and its depths soulis et al 2017 the equation to calculate water storage in the substrate layer sstor is expressed as s stor s t 1 f et sub s

following evaporation process θrs is the remaining substrate water content after free drainage θi is the initial substrate water content ds is the substrate depth mm the infiltration rate of substrate ft mm min is calculated as follows f t i t t p k s 1 θ s θ i s f f t t p t p f p i f θ s θ i s f i k s 1 where i is the net rainfall intensity mm min tp is the onset time of surface ponding minute ks is the substrate saturated hydraulic conductivity mm min θs is the substrate saturated water content sf is the suction at wetting front of the substrate mm the infiltration depth at that moment fp is given by setting ft i in eq 7 and solving for fp 2 1 3 evaporation the evaporation process is used hargreaves method that simulated the evaporation process using only air temperatures hargreaves and samani 1985 the equation for calculating potential evaporation pet is given as pet 0 0023 0 408 ra max λ t max t min 0 5 t av 17 8 where ramax is the extraterrestrial radiation of the surface related to latitude mj m2 d λ is the latent heat of vapor mj kg which is 2 45 mj kg tmax is the maximum daily temperature oc tmin is the minimum daily temperature oc tav is the average daily temperature oc the constant value of 0 408 is used to convert the radiation to evaporation equivalents in mm for estimating actual evaporation of the substrate etsub under conditions of restricted water availability the etsub is defined as a function of pet multiplied by the ratio of actual water storage to the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate zhao et al 2013 and it can be expressed as et sub p e t s stor s max 2 1 4 storage layer module rainwater seeped from the substrate layer will be temporarily stored into the storage layer when the water storage capacity of the storage layer is exceeded excess water will be discharged as runoff the variation of water amount in the storage layer rstor is described as follows r stor r t 1 r seep et stor r t 1 r seep et stor r max r max r t 1 r seep et stor r max r seep c s stor where r stor is the water amount in the storage layer mm r seep is the water seeped from the substrate layer mm et stor is the evaporation from the storage layer mm rmax is the maximum water storage capacity of the storage layer mm c is the runoff release coefficient of the substrate the evaporation of rainwater from the storage layer etstor during dry periods is based on dalton s equation qin et al 2013 and it can be written as et stor c 1 1 θ θ s e 0 e x p 17 62 t w 24 3 t w where c 1 is the aerodynamic conductance which usually depends on the horizontal wind speed surface roughness and thermally induced turbulence commonly c 1 is assumed to be a constant coefficient since the wind speed above the water surface of the storage layer is zero θ is the unsaturated water content of substrate e 0 is the saturation vapor pressure at 0 kpa t w is the temperature of the water surface oc all the algorithm of the process equations were calculated and iterated by r codes the model simulation has been implemented in r software version 3 4 2 2 2 field experiment design and data collection nine pilot modules of extensive green roofs were constructed with custom made stainless steel with 2 mm thickness with internal dimensions of 1 0 m wide 1 0 m long 0 10 0 30 m height the design structure of a green roof system consisted of a water storage layer a filter fabric a growing substrate layer and a vegetation layer from bottom to top assembled combinations of the green roofs were designed following orthogonal experimental design with four structural factors i e substrate materials substrate depth vegetation types and slope gradients at three levels fig 2a 2b 2c the vegetation types were only considering the monocultures of plant communities and plants were chose according to the roof greening material available in china bls 2005 three selected plant species have been widely incorporated in local landscapes and have high resistance abilities to drought stress conditions jim and peng 2012 nardini et al 2012 for example the sedum spectabile has a shallow root system and is able to efficiently utilize water making it ideal candidates for tolerating the severe conditions on rooftops emilsson 2008 rowe et al 2012 in this study the runoff outlet was constructed in the middle of the drainage layer and connected by a pipe with 25 mm diameter this design of the outlet allows the excess water to freely discharging out from the drainage layer bianchini and hewage 2012 it will decrease the risk of water leaks to the rooftop and avoid water adding an extra weight to the roof assembly the other detailed design structures of green roofs are shown in a previous study liu et al 2019 these pilot modules were placed at the runoff test site in the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation in gansu province china 35 34 45 88 n 104 38 5 67 e this region was located in a semiarid climatic zone and was dominated by warm humid summers and cold dry winters mean annual precipitation was 421 mm most of which falls in the period from july to september field simulated rainfall experiments were conducted in 2019 a norton ladder type artificial rainfall simulator was set to 3 5 m above the pilot modules of green roofs in the field experiments six veejet 80 100 nozzles with 41 kpa water pressure were used in the spraying systems a tipping bucket rain gauge onset hobo 0 2 mm rainfall smart sensor s rgb was positioned near the pilot modules to monitor the actual rainfall depth in the experiment the recorded rainfall depth and duration ranged between 17 4 mm and 29 2 mm and 52 0 min to 90 0 min respectively outflow runoff from the pilot modules were collected into plastic containers below the modules by means of pipes installed at downstream ends the weight of the collection containers were continuously measured by the industrial grade pressure transducer weighing load cells bengbu sensor system engineering company jlbu bengbu china an appropriate calibration relationship which converted the weight of rainwater into runoff depth was determined before field experiments the calibrated 5te sensors decagon devices 5te usa were inserted into the mid depth of the substrate to monitor the water content of the substrate layer these measurements with one second interval were logged into a data logger campbell scientific cr300 usa during the experimental periods 2 3 model calibration and validation model calibration and validation strategy is based on the comparison of the simulated and measured runoff flow hydrographs nash suttcliffe efficiency nse was selected and used as the optimization criterion to evaluate the model performance the nse is a commonly used goodness of fit measure between the simulated and observed runoff values nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is expressed as nse 1 i q o i q s i 2 i q o i q o i 2 where q o i is the observed runoff values q s i is the simulated runoff values q o i is the average value of the observed runoff the best performance for runoff prediction is expected to yield nse 1 moriasi et al 2007 walvoord et al 2003 furthermore the relative percentage difference rpd was also selected to represent the simulation errors which calculate the difference between observed and simulated total runoff volumes for each rainfall event has been computed as rpd v obs v sim v obs 100 where v obs and v sim are the observed and simulated total runoff volumes respectively 2 4 design storms three groups of storm events were designed to investigate how the hydrological performance of green roofs is affected by rainfall amount rainfall intensity and timing of peak rainfall intensity respectively the intensity and duration frequency of storm events was designed according to the local storm formulation which is described as below h 6 86 1 1 33 l g n t 12 70 0 83 where h is the rainfall intensity mm min n is the recurrence period of storm year t is the rainfall duration minute hyetographs of the design storm events were determined according to a rainfall pattern closest to the actual observed condition using the formula for synthetic chicago storms keifer and chu 1957 fig 3 illustrates the intensity durationfrequency curves of the designed storm events in group i storm events have different return periods 1 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year and the corresponding total rainfall amounts ranged from 11 8 mm to 43 3 mm they all have the same rainfall duration 1 h and location of peak rainfall intensity r 0 4 fig 3a in group ii storm events have different rainfall durations 1 5 2 3 4 and 5 h they have the same return period 10 year and location of peak intensity r 0 4 and the corresponding rainfall depth ranged from 31 0 mm to 33 4 mm fig 3b in group iii storm events have different locations of peak rainfall intensity r 0 1 0 2 0 6 and 0 8 and they have the same rainfall amount around 33 4 mm and rainfall duration 2 h fig 3c 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results the parameters characterizing the green roof configurations were determined by their structure properties the initial substrate water content was measured during the green roof experiments the empirical values of the other model parameters were acquired from the previous literature these model parameters were then adjusted by the trial and error method to obtain a reasonable estimation of the measured runoff data the optimal values of model parameters for green roof modules are shown in table 1 the model was calibrated and validated by the rainfall events and synchronously monitored runoff discharged from the pilot green roof modules the observation data from experimental periods was divided into two independent sub periods from june to july 2019 for calibration and from august to september 2019 for validation the tested rainfall depths were ranged from 17 4 mm to 22 6 mm excepted for 29 2 mm for g9 module in calibration period the represented comparison between observed and simulated runoff for green roof configurations are plotted in fig 4 in these cases the model followed closely the shape of the observed hydrographs the quantitative assessment of the model performance under represented rainfall events during calibration and validation periods are summarized in table 2 results showed the nse values computed over the calibration period were higher than 0 933 and the corresponding volume errors rpd varied from 1 45 to 5 35 during the validation period the nse coefficient ranged from 0 935 to 0 975 and the volume errors lower than 5 overall satisfactory results were obtained for green roof configurations for both calibration and validation periods therefore the model can be used to investigate the effects of substrate designs and rainfall characteristics on hydrological performances of green roofs 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the main parameters before characterizing the effects of green roof designs on retaining and detaining runoff a model sensitivity analysis was used to identify the most sensitive parameters six model parameters representing green roof characteristics were chosen to evaluate sensitivity by comparing the percent changes of simulated runoff volume and time to runoff from the default simulation scenario g4 green roof configuration the sensitivity analysis was carried out by assuming a 50 increase in one parameter while others were fixed results of sensitivity analysis in fig 5 showed the most sensitive parameter for simulating runoff process of green roofs was the initial substrate water content which changed by 74 5 for runoff volume and 58 5 for time to runoff secondly the saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity increased runoff volume by 60 2 as well as the substrate depth increased runoff volume by 56 5 and changed time to runoff by 46 3 subsequently the saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity delayed time to runoff by 29 3 the saturated substrate water content increased by 33 5 for runoff volume and 29 3 for time to runoff however the storage layer depth slightly impacted runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs the leaf area index had little effect on the model simulation results therefore it can be concluded that the initial substrate moisture saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity and substrate depth are the key parameters affecting runoff simulation of green roofs 3 3 simulated hydrological performance with different substrate designs the validated model can help interpret the physical meaning of parameters allowing the investigation of various substrate design scenarios fig 6 demonstrates the runoff processes of green roofs with various substrate parameters simulated hydrographs showed the model adequately described hydrologic responses of green roofs with substrate characteristic variables table 3 summarizes runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs under different substrate designs while the saturated hydraulic conductivity of substrate decreased from 192 mm h to 144 mm h runoff retention percentages increased from 72 15 to 91 60 and time to runoff was delayed from 33 min to 59 min 3 4 effects of rainfall characteristics on hydrological performance there are very limited rainfall patterns in field experimental investigations under simulated rainfall events in the present study the hydrological responses for green roofs under various types of design storm events were simulated using the model developed the effects of different rainfall return periods rainfall amounts on runoff retention and detention performance were first evaluated and the results are shown in fig 7 a b results indicated the green roofs were more effective in runoff reduction during smaller storm events as rainfall amounts increased from 11 8 mm to 43 3 mm the average runoff reduction percentage declined from 68 4 to 21 6 as well as the mean time to runoff slightly decreased from 25 min to 17 min it was noted that no runoff was evident for green roof g4 under a rainfall event with a 1 year return period the impacts of different rainfall durations rainfall intensity on green roof performances are shown in fig 7c d when the rainfall duration increased from 1 5 h to 5 h i e rainfall intensity decreased from 20 6 mm h to 6 7 mm h the mean runoff retention percentage increased from 48 9 to 63 2 simultaneously when rainfall intensity decreased the average time to runoff of green roofs dramatically increased from 30 0 min to 113 3 min the responses of green roofs retention and detention performance to different locations of peak rainfall intensity r are shown in fig 7e f with the timing of peak rainfall intensity postponed the average runoff reduction percentages gradually decreased from 59 4 to 47 8 it should be noted that runoff detention effects of green roofs were distinctly enhanced when peak rainfall intensity is delayed and the mean time to runoff under location of peak rainfall intensity r 0 8 was highly delayed by 5 8 times that for r 0 1 it can be concluded that rainfall patterns with late peak intensity are likely to exhibit the largest runoff detention 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the developed water balance model in this study the developed simple water balance model was validated to satisfactorily represent the hydrological behaviour of green roof configurations some studies also concluded that conceptual models represented adequate solutions for modelling the hydrological behavior of green roofs carbone et al 2014 palla et al 2012 stovin et al 2013 vesuviano et al 2014 vesuviano and stovin 2013 the performances of the developed model support this general conclusion as well palla et al 2012 reported that a conceptual model based on a cascade of three linear reservoirs performed sufficiently well and nse values ranged between 0 52 and 0 985 carbone et al 2014 demonstrated the conceptual model was able to accurately predict the hydrological behavior of the green roof system and the r 2 was equal to 0 99 soulis et al 2017 found the proposed conceptual model can be sufficiently utilized for modeling the hydrological performance of green roofs for substrate depths up to 200 mm accordingly the simpler model developed is still capable of describing the hydrological behavior of green roofs at least in the cases of small size pilot modules 4 2 the key factors influenced runoff simulation of green roofs the results in this study are aligned with previous studies such as brunetti et al 2016 hakimdavar et al 2014 and locatelli et al 2014 that concluded runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs is mainly influenced by initial substrate moisture locatelli et al 2014 found the most sensitive parameter in single event simulation of green roofs was the initial substrate moisture condition brunetti et al 2016 concluded runoff retained by green roofs was mainly determined by their initial substrate moisture in a green roof system the actual retained runoff volume is determined by the substrate s water storage capacity and initial water content at the start of a rainfall event moreover the results were also consistent with the general agreement from green roof monitoring literature that substrate material composition and depth contribute notably to runoff retention and detention performance dunnett et al 2008 liu et al 2019 peng et al 2020 stovin et al 2012 similarly rocha et al 2006 suggested the water movement in the soil profile was sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity curvature peng et al 2019 found the runoff predictions based on richard s equation are sensitive to hydraulic conductivity function of substrate the physical properties of a substrate particularly the maximum water holding capacity govern its runoff retention performance consequently the initial substrate moisture condition and substrate properties are crucial for how much runoff will be retained by green roofs in the study area the heavy rainfalls are mainly concentrated in july to september which accounting for more than 50 of the annual rainfall amount thus this work focused on simulating the hydrological responses of green roofs to event based storms with different characteristics however when continuously simulating the annual performance of green roofs the impacts of seasonal variations and canopy shading of different vegetation types needed to be highly considered while the seasonal variations in temperature and shading effects of different canopy forms on substrate were significant the possible covariation between evapotranspiration and substrate moisture can influence the green roof performance some studies investigated that the warm season has higher et and resulted in green roof retention capacity regenerates faster driscoll et al 2015 mentens et al 2006 villarreal 2007 in addition several studies have also examined the effects of plant mixtures as opposed to monocultures on green roof performance they found that hydrologic performance could be improved through greater diversity of plant life forms lundholm et al 2010 lundholm 2015 nagase and dunnett 2010 wolf and lundholm 2008 pointed out that more shading of the substrate surface can be captured in continuous canopies in vegetation types of plant mixtures and it might be reduced evaporation from the substrate therefore to simulate the annual hydrological performance of green roofs the model should be improved by considering the influences of seasonal variations and canopy shading of different vegetation types 4 3 effects of the substrate designs on hydrological performance the results revealed that decreasing the saturated hydraulic conductivity distinctly delayed time to runoff and increased runoff retention this is because hydraulic conductivity determines the speed of water flowing through the substrate thus it influences the runoff starting time de ville et al 2017 peng et al 2020 a lower conductivity caused slower rainfall infiltration and higher water holding capacity and resulted in less runoff discharged similarly runoff rate declined and runoff generation time delayed with an increase in depth of the substrate layer as the substrate depths increased from 50 mm to 200 mm runoff retention percentages raised from 78 92 to 92 92 and time to runoff was delayed from 42 min to 63 min the findings agreed with previous studies such as feitosa and wilkinson 2016 and versini et al 2015 that showed the thicker substrate discharged less runoff volume feitosa and wilkinson 2016 also found the runoff retention capacity increased with substrate depths according to a linear pattern it should be noted that substrate hydraulic properties and depths are very important design parameters that influence the hydrological performance of green roofs accordingly this simple water balance model can be jointly used in order to facilitate the broader use of simple conceptual models to support substrate design 4 4 hydrological responses under different rainfall patterns in the present study the finding of decreasing trends in the runoff retained percentages with increased storm sizes is consistent with prior studies carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 fassman beck et al 2013 getter et al 2007 simmons et al 2008 vanwoert et al 2005 carter and rasmussen 2005 showed runoff retention percentage decreased from 90 in a 13 mm storm event to 39 in a 54 mm storm voyde et al 2010 concluded that the single event retention efficiency of green roofs was likely to decrease with increasing rainfall return period yao et al 2020 found that green roofs can effectively retain the rainwater in their substrate for small rainfall events but the retention capacity of green roofs was limited when facing heavy storms rainfall depth directly influences the potential for runoff volume reduction of green roofs since it is the sole input to green roofs wong and jim 2014 for smaller storm events sims et al 2016 concluded there was greater probability that the storm size will be smaller than the available water storage capacity in three climate regions of canada for higher rainfall return periods the expected rainfall depth will significantly exceed the green roof s maximum water retention capacity in most locations thus runoff is mainly determined by the rainfall depth sims et al 2019 the influences of rainfall intensity on runoff retention herein presented agreed with those observed in getter et al 2007 lee et al 2015 qin et al 2013 sherrard and jacobs 2012 and zhang et al 2015 in regard to the inverse relationship between rainfall intensity and the efficiencies in runoff retention qin et al 2013 found green roof designs were more effective in flood reduction during lower rainfall intensity stovin et al 2017 concluded runoff detention effects of green roofs were highly sensitive to rainfall intensity villarreal and bengtsson 2005 found runoff retention performance of a green roof was highly dependent on the rainfall intensity with generally lower intensities resulting in larger retention rates this is because a lower intensity tends to decrease the rainfall amount for the same duration and may result in a slower saturation process of substrate infiltration yang et al 2015 speak et al 2013 pointed out that when the substrate was saturated it was difficult for water to infiltrate through the substrate thus enabling surface runoff in a similar way the timing of peak rainfall intensity has also been identified as one of the multiple drivers of retention and detention performance of green roofs the results agreed with simulated responses from qin et al 2013 that green roof performed better for flood reduction in a storm event with a late peak intensity brunetti et al 2016 revealed positively skewed rainfall distribution was likely to exhibit the largest peak flow reduction yio et al 2013 investigated the rainfall event with the earlier peak rainfall intensity resulted in better peak runoff attenuation this is because the earlier the peak rainfall intensity occurs the larger the potential for available water storage of green roofs in summary under the storm events with larger rainfall depth higher rainfall intensity and earlier timing of peak rainfall intensity the runoff retention and detention performances of green roofs were declined therefore green roofs alone cannot solely be relied upon to provide complete flooding mitigation under extreme storm events at the urban scale carter and jackson 2007 suggested that combined with other stormwater source controls or and retention infrastructures green roofs could contribute to a significant reduction in the quantity of runoff water flowing into the sewage network during extreme storm events 5 conclusions this study presented a simple water balance model for simulating runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs based on conceptual hydrological processes and integrated into green roof designs the model was calibrated and validated by experimental data from green roof modules and applied to investigate the effects of substrate designs and rainfall characteristics on the hydrological performance of green roofs the model calibration and validation results concluded that the proposed conceptual model is satisfactorily accurate in modelling the hydrological behavior of green roofs in most cases the sensitivity analysis of parameters showed the initial substrate moisture substrate saturated hydraulic conductivity and substrate depth were the key parameters affecting runoff simulation of green roofs simulated responses of runoff retention and detention of the green roofs distinctly increased with lower saturated hydraulic conductivity and substrate depths green roofs were more effective in flooding reduction during smaller storm events runoff detention effects of green roofs increased significantly as rainfall intensity declined similarly the runoff detention of green roofs performed better in storm events with a late peak rainfall intensity in summary the developed model allows the use of a simple conceptual model for a wider set of conditions than the available experimental data to support green roof design moreover it provides an effective tool for estimating the retention and detention performance expected for a green roof installation in response to specific design storm characteristics the simulation results can facilitate understanding the hydrological behavior of designed green roofs under various rainfall conditions to guide the appropriate implementation of green roof technology in urban areas further studies are suggested to continuously simulate the impacts of seasonal changes and canopy shading of different vegetation types on the annual hydrological performance of green roofs credit authorship contribution statement

4232,in spite of many well known benefits of green roofs their widespread adoption as source control measures in urban stormwater management requires the use of adequate modelling tools the purpose of this study was to develop a simple water balance model for green roof runoff simulation based on conceptual hydrological processes and integrated into green roof designs the model was calibrated and validated with a pilot experimental dataset that included various green roof configurations the validated model was applied to simulate the hydrological responses of green roofs under different substrate designs and rainfall characteristics results showed that the model nash suttcliffe efficiency nse values under calibration and validation period ranged from 0 933 to 0 982 and the volume errors of relative percentage difference rpd varied from 1 45 to 5 35 which indicated the simulated runoff processes of green roofs were satisfactorily accurate the sensitivity analysis of parameters e g increased parameters by 50 showed the most sensitive parameter for simulating green roof runoff was the initial substrate water content which changed by 74 5 for runoff volume and 58 5 for time to runoff for a 50 increase in the saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity it increased runoff volume by 60 2 as well as the substrate depth increased runoff volume by 56 5 and changed time to runoff by 46 3 the simulated hydrograph indicated that decreasing the saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity distinctly delayed time to runoff and increased runoff retention similarly the runoff rate declined and runoff generation time was delayed with an increase in the substrate depths runoff retention percentages of the green roofs declined as rainfall depths increased with rainfall intensity decreasing mean time to runoff of the green roofs significantly increased from 30 0 min to 113 3 min runoff detention effects of green roofs were distinctly enhanced with the peak rainfall intensity delayed this study provided a simple modelling tool for simulating hydrological responses of green roofs under a wide set of substrate characteristics and rainfall conditions in order to guide green

surfaces into built environment locatelli et al 2014 green areas are being replaced by roofs roads sidewalks and public squares changing the original permeable condition into impervious surfaces berndtsson 2010 as a result impervious areas hinder the infiltration capacity of urban surfaces thus increasing stormwater runoff discharge güneralp et al 2015 moreover current urban drainage systems have limited capacity to deal with extreme storms caused by climate change larsen et al 2009 consequently there has been a considerable increase in stormwater runoff leading to raised risk of waterlogging or flooding in urban areas fletcher et al 2013 jha et al 2012 in an attempt to mitigate urban flooding several innovative strategies have been adopted to improve urban stormwater management and address future climatic challenges such as low impact development lid green infrastructure gi water sensitive urban design wsud and sustainable urban drainage systems suds as an advanced technology among them green roofs are increasingly being implemented in stormwater management practices as they retain detain and slowly release rainwater and do not use new space cipolla et al 2016 palla et al 2011 recent years green roofs have received increased recognition in many countries such as the usa japan australia germany and china shafique et al 2018 vijayaraghavan 2016 williams et al 2010 xiao et al 2014 hydrological performance monitoring of green roofs is an essential part of assessing their functionality and efficiency in order to guide future planning and implementation efforts bloomberg and strickland 2012 vijayaraghavan 2016 numerous studies have quantified the runoff volume retention of green roofs by both test modules and full scale roof installations gong et al 2019 gregoire and clausen 2011 liu et al 2019 wong and jim 2014 runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs depends on several factors such as substrate physical properties and its depth planted vegetation and roof slope getter et al 2007 gong et al 2021 graceson et al 2013 liu et al 2019 vanwoert et al 2005 villarreal and bengtsson 2005 antecedent substrate moisture condition bengtsson et al 2005 denardo et al 2005 liu et al 2020 seasonality mentens et al 2006 villarreal 2007 and climatic settings klein and coffman 2015 sims et al 2016 several studies have also concluded that retention and detention efficiency depends strongly on the rainfall amount and intensity of storm events brandão et al 2017 brunetti et al 2016 carter and rasmussen 2006 hilten et al 2008 simmons et al 2008 in general experimental studies are usually limited by the specific green roof configurations and local climatic settings as a result simulating the hydrological performance of green roofs is becoming increasingly important for stormwater engineers and urban planners berardi et al 2014 berndtsson 2010 in the last few years researchers have proposed many modelling tools to simulate green roof efficiency for example simple and robust empirical relations like curve number and rational coefficient berthier et al 2011 carson et al 2013 fassman beck et al 2013 liu et al 2020 event based hydrological models carbone et al 2014 kasmin et al 2010 lamera et al 2014 palla et al 2012 she and pang 2010 conceptual models for long term simulation locatelli et al 2014 stovin et al 2013 zhang and guo 2013 and numerical models by using software such as hydrus 1d brunetti et al 2016 feitosa and wilkinson 2016 hakimdavar et al 2014 hilten et al 2008 swmm baek et al 2020 cipolla et al 2016 hamouz and muthanna 2019 johannessen et al 2019 versini et al 2015 yao et al 2020 mike urban locatelli et al 2014 and swap metselaar 2012 however these models require accurate physical parameters and specific substrate information that can be difficult to obtain or measure hakimdavar et al 2016 moreover predicting the hydrologic responses of green roofs with regard to substrate design parameters is challenging because of the highly non linear relationships involved li and babcock 2016 therefore in order to support green roof design the model should be simple have low computational requirements and able to be easily integrated in decision support tools soulis et al 2017 in adoption of green roof technology one of the key limiting factors is the lack of appropriate modeling tools for evaluating the efficiency of designed green roofs elliott and trowsdale 2007 soulis et al 2017 the hydrological responses to single rainfall events particularly the extreme storm events are important characteristics in performance evaluation of green roofs however the observed rainfall runoff data are limited which makes it difficult to draw comprehensive conclusion about runoff retention and detention performance for green roofs accordingly storms with various rainfall characteristics need to be investigated to verify the green roof s reduction effectiveness in urban flooding lee et al 2013 however some modelling efforts are limited in estimating hydrological performance of designed green roof in response to different rainfall patterns li and babcock 2014 stovin et al 2013 the objectives of the present study are 1 to develop a simple water balance model for runoff simulation of green roofs based on conceptual hydrological processes and integrated into green roof designs 2 to demonstrate the simulation accuracy of the developed model by using data collected for pilot modules of green roofs in field experiments 3 to simulate the hydrological responses of green roof configurations to different substrate designs and rainfall characteristics these results will help to inform green roof designers regarding storm specific hydrologic responses of alternative green roof configurations 2 material and methods 2 1 water mass balance model development fig 1 presents the conceptual diagram for water mass balance of a green roof system in order to explicitly consider the water exchange processes between the substrate and storage layer the green roof system was generalized as two modules for modelling purposes a substrate layer module and a storage layer module during a rainfall event the key hydrological mechanisms operating within the green roof are the interception of rainfall by the vegetation layer infiltration and storage in the substrate layer when the water content in the substrate is greater than its maximum water storage capacity water will seep from the substrate layer into the storage layer and be temporarily stored any water in excess of the storage capacity of the storage layer will be discharged as runoff meanwhile substrate moisture will be lost to the atmosphere as a result of evaporation during dry periods based on the above analysis a water mass balance equation of the green roof system is expressed as q p v inter s stor r stor e t where q is the runoff depth from green roof mm p is the rainfall depth mm vinter is the interception of vegetation mm sstor is the water storage in the substrate layer mm rstor is the water storage in the storage layer mm et is the actual evaporation from the substrate layer and storage layer mm 2 1 1 interception the calculation of vegetation interception is based on wang et al 2008 that simplifies the explicit simulation of canopy interception performed in the rutter model to reduce model parameter requirements rainfall intercepted by the vegetation of a green roof is referred to as leaf surface storage when the maximum water storage of leaf surface is exceeded the effective rainfall is driven as infiltration into the substrate layer the equation to calculate rainfall intercepted by vegetation canopy vinter is expressed as v inter c

the substrate layer when the accumulated rainfall is larger than the substrate s maximum water holding capacity smax the water will seep from substrate into the storage layer the water holding capacity depends upon the substrate materials composition and its depths soulis et al 2017 the equation to calculate water storage in the substrate layer sstor is expressed as s stor s t 1 f et sub s

following evaporation process θrs is the remaining substrate water content after free drainage θi is the initial substrate water content ds is the substrate depth mm the infiltration rate of substrate ft mm min is calculated as follows f t i t t p k s 1 θ s θ i s f f t t p t p f p i f θ s θ i s f i k s 1 where i is the net rainfall intensity mm min tp is the onset time of surface ponding minute ks is the substrate saturated hydraulic conductivity mm min θs is the substrate saturated water content sf is the suction at wetting front of the substrate mm the infiltration depth at that moment fp is given by setting ft i in eq 7 and solving for fp 2 1 3 evaporation the evaporation process is used hargreaves method that simulated the evaporation process using only air temperatures hargreaves and samani 1985 the equation for calculating potential evaporation pet is given as pet 0 0023 0 408 ra max λ t max t min 0 5 t av 17 8 where ramax is the extraterrestrial radiation of the surface related to latitude mj m2 d λ is the latent heat of vapor mj kg which is 2 45 mj kg tmax is the maximum daily temperature oc tmin is the minimum daily temperature oc tav is the average daily temperature oc the constant value of 0 408 is used to convert the radiation to evaporation equivalents in mm for estimating actual evaporation of the substrate etsub under conditions of restricted water availability the etsub is defined as a function of pet multiplied by the ratio of actual water storage to the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate zhao et al 2013 and it can be expressed as et sub p e t s stor s max 2 1 4 storage layer module rainwater seeped from the substrate layer will be temporarily stored into the storage layer when the water storage capacity of the storage layer is exceeded excess water will be discharged as runoff the variation of water amount in the storage layer rstor is described as follows r stor r t 1 r seep et stor r t 1 r seep et stor r max r max r t 1 r seep et stor r max r seep c s stor where r stor is the water amount in the storage layer mm r seep is the water seeped from the substrate layer mm et stor is the evaporation from the storage layer mm rmax is the maximum water storage capacity of the storage layer mm c is the runoff release coefficient of the substrate the evaporation of rainwater from the storage layer etstor during dry periods is based on dalton s equation qin et al 2013 and it can be written as et stor c 1 1 θ θ s e 0 e x p 17 62 t w 24 3 t w where c 1 is the aerodynamic conductance which usually depends on the horizontal wind speed surface roughness and thermally induced turbulence commonly c 1 is assumed to be a constant coefficient since the wind speed above the water surface of the storage layer is zero θ is the unsaturated water content of substrate e 0 is the saturation vapor pressure at 0 kpa t w is the temperature of the water surface oc all the algorithm of the process equations were calculated and iterated by r codes the model simulation has been implemented in r software version 3 4 2 2 2 field experiment design and data collection nine pilot modules of extensive green roofs were constructed with custom made stainless steel with 2 mm thickness with internal dimensions of 1 0 m wide 1 0 m long 0 10 0 30 m height the design structure of a green roof system consisted of a water storage layer a filter fabric a growing substrate layer and a vegetation layer from bottom to top assembled combinations of the green roofs were designed following orthogonal experimental design with four structural factors i e substrate materials substrate depth vegetation types and slope gradients at three levels fig 2a 2b 2c the vegetation types were only considering the monocultures of plant communities and plants were chose according to the roof greening material available in china bls 2005 three selected plant species have been widely incorporated in local landscapes and have high resistance abilities to drought stress conditions jim and peng 2012 nardini et al 2012 for example the sedum spectabile has a shallow root system and is able to efficiently utilize water making it ideal candidates for tolerating the severe conditions on rooftops emilsson 2008 rowe et al 2012 in this study the runoff outlet was constructed in the middle of the drainage layer and connected by a pipe with 25 mm diameter this design of the outlet allows the excess water to freely discharging out from the drainage layer bianchini and hewage 2012 it will decrease the risk of water leaks to the rooftop and avoid water adding an extra weight to the roof assembly the other detailed design structures of green roofs are shown in a previous study liu et al 2019 these pilot modules were placed at the runoff test site in the dingxi institute of soil and water conservation in gansu province china 35 34 45 88 n 104 38 5 67 e this region was located in a semiarid climatic zone and was dominated by warm humid summers and cold dry winters mean annual precipitation was 421 mm most of which falls in the period from july to september field simulated rainfall experiments were conducted in 2019 a norton ladder type artificial rainfall simulator was set to 3 5 m above the pilot modules of green roofs in the field experiments six veejet 80 100 nozzles with 41 kpa water pressure were used in the spraying systems a tipping bucket rain gauge onset hobo 0 2 mm rainfall smart sensor s rgb was positioned near the pilot modules to monitor the actual rainfall depth in the experiment the recorded rainfall depth and duration ranged between 17 4 mm and 29 2 mm and 52 0 min to 90 0 min respectively outflow runoff from the pilot modules were collected into plastic containers below the modules by means of pipes installed at downstream ends the weight of the collection containers were continuously measured by the industrial grade pressure transducer weighing load cells bengbu sensor system engineering company jlbu bengbu china an appropriate calibration relationship which converted the weight of rainwater into runoff depth was determined before field experiments the calibrated 5te sensors decagon devices 5te usa were inserted into the mid depth of the substrate to monitor the water content of the substrate layer these measurements with one second interval were logged into a data logger campbell scientific cr300 usa during the experimental periods 2 3 model calibration and validation model calibration and validation strategy is based on the comparison of the simulated and measured runoff flow hydrographs nash suttcliffe efficiency nse was selected and used as the optimization criterion to evaluate the model performance the nse is a commonly used goodness of fit measure between the simulated and observed runoff values nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is expressed as nse 1 i q o i q s i 2 i q o i q o i 2 where q o i is the observed runoff values q s i is the simulated runoff values q o i is the average value of the observed runoff the best performance for runoff prediction is expected to yield nse 1 moriasi et al 2007 walvoord et al 2003 furthermore the relative percentage difference rpd was also selected to represent the simulation errors which calculate the difference between observed and simulated total runoff volumes for each rainfall event has been computed as rpd v obs v sim v obs 100 where v obs and v sim are the observed and simulated total runoff volumes respectively 2 4 design storms three groups of storm events were designed to investigate how the hydrological performance of green roofs is affected by rainfall amount rainfall intensity and timing of peak rainfall intensity respectively the intensity and duration frequency of storm events was designed according to the local storm formulation which is described as below h 6 86 1 1 33 l g n t 12 70 0 83 where h is the rainfall intensity mm min n is the recurrence period of storm year t is the rainfall duration minute hyetographs of the design storm events were determined according to a rainfall pattern closest to the actual observed condition using the formula for synthetic chicago storms keifer and chu 1957 fig 3 illustrates the intensity durationfrequency curves of the designed storm events in group i storm events have different return periods 1 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year and the corresponding total rainfall amounts ranged from 11 8 mm to 43 3 mm they all have the same rainfall duration 1 h and location of peak rainfall intensity r 0 4 fig 3a in group ii storm events have different rainfall durations 1 5 2 3 4 and 5 h they have the same return period 10 year and location of peak intensity r 0 4 and the corresponding rainfall depth ranged from 31 0 mm to 33 4 mm fig 3b in group iii storm events have different locations of peak rainfall intensity r 0 1 0 2 0 6 and 0 8 and they have the same rainfall amount around 33 4 mm and rainfall duration 2 h fig 3c 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results the parameters characterizing the green roof configurations were determined by their structure properties the initial substrate water content was measured during the green roof experiments the empirical values of the other model parameters were acquired from the previous literature these model parameters were then adjusted by the trial and error method to obtain a reasonable estimation of the measured runoff data the optimal values of model parameters for green roof modules are shown in table 1 the model was calibrated and validated by the rainfall events and synchronously monitored runoff discharged from the pilot green roof modules the observation data from experimental periods was divided into two independent sub periods from june to july 2019 for calibration and from august to september 2019 for validation the tested rainfall depths were ranged from 17 4 mm to 22 6 mm excepted for 29 2 mm for g9 module in calibration period the represented comparison between observed and simulated runoff for green roof configurations are plotted in fig 4 in these cases the model followed closely the shape of the observed hydrographs the quantitative assessment of the model performance under represented rainfall events during calibration and validation periods are summarized in table 2 results showed the nse values computed over the calibration period were higher than 0 933 and the corresponding volume errors rpd varied from 1 45 to 5 35 during the validation period the nse coefficient ranged from 0 935 to 0 975 and the volume errors lower than 5 overall satisfactory results were obtained for green roof configurations for both calibration and validation periods therefore the model can be used to investigate the effects of substrate designs and rainfall characteristics on hydrological performances of green roofs 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the main parameters before characterizing the effects of green roof designs on retaining and detaining runoff a model sensitivity analysis was used to identify the most sensitive parameters six model parameters representing green roof characteristics were chosen to evaluate sensitivity by comparing the percent changes of simulated runoff volume and time to runoff from the default simulation scenario g4 green roof configuration the sensitivity analysis was carried out by assuming a 50 increase in one parameter while others were fixed results of sensitivity analysis in fig 5 showed the most sensitive parameter for simulating runoff process of green roofs was the initial substrate water content which changed by 74 5 for runoff volume and 58 5 for time to runoff secondly the saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity increased runoff volume by 60 2 as well as the substrate depth increased runoff volume by 56 5 and changed time to runoff by 46 3 subsequently the saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity delayed time to runoff by 29 3 the saturated substrate water content increased by 33 5 for runoff volume and 29 3 for time to runoff however the storage layer depth slightly impacted runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs the leaf area index had little effect on the model simulation results therefore it can be concluded that the initial substrate moisture saturated substrate hydraulic conductivity and substrate depth are the key parameters affecting runoff simulation of green roofs 3 3 simulated hydrological performance with different substrate designs the validated model can help interpret the physical meaning of parameters allowing the investigation of various substrate design scenarios fig 6 demonstrates the runoff processes of green roofs with various substrate parameters simulated hydrographs showed the model adequately described hydrologic responses of green roofs with substrate characteristic variables table 3 summarizes runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs under different substrate designs while the saturated hydraulic conductivity of substrate decreased from 192 mm h to 144 mm h runoff retention percentages increased from 72 15 to 91 60 and time to runoff was delayed from 33 min to 59 min 3 4 effects of rainfall characteristics on hydrological performance there are very limited rainfall patterns in field experimental investigations under simulated rainfall events in the present study the hydrological responses for green roofs under various types of design storm events were simulated using the model developed the effects of different rainfall return periods rainfall amounts on runoff retention and detention performance were first evaluated and the results are shown in fig 7 a b results indicated the green roofs were more effective in runoff reduction during smaller storm events as rainfall amounts increased from 11 8 mm to 43 3 mm the average runoff reduction percentage declined from 68 4 to 21 6 as well as the mean time to runoff slightly decreased from 25 min to 17 min it was noted that no runoff was evident for green roof g4 under a rainfall event with a 1 year return period the impacts of different rainfall durations rainfall intensity on green roof performances are shown in fig 7c d when the rainfall duration increased from 1 5 h to 5 h i e rainfall intensity decreased from 20 6 mm h to 6 7 mm h the mean runoff retention percentage increased from 48 9 to 63 2 simultaneously when rainfall intensity decreased the average time to runoff of green roofs dramatically increased from 30 0 min to 113 3 min the responses of green roofs retention and detention performance to different locations of peak rainfall intensity r are shown in fig 7e f with the timing of peak rainfall intensity postponed the average runoff reduction percentages gradually decreased from 59 4 to 47 8 it should be noted that runoff detention effects of green roofs were distinctly enhanced when peak rainfall intensity is delayed and the mean time to runoff under location of peak rainfall intensity r 0 8 was highly delayed by 5 8 times that for r 0 1 it can be concluded that rainfall patterns with late peak intensity are likely to exhibit the largest runoff detention 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the developed water balance model in this study the developed simple water balance model was validated to satisfactorily represent the hydrological behaviour of green roof configurations some studies also concluded that conceptual models represented adequate solutions for modelling the hydrological behavior of green roofs carbone et al 2014 palla et al 2012 stovin et al 2013 vesuviano et al 2014 vesuviano and stovin 2013 the performances of the developed model support this general conclusion as well palla et al 2012 reported that a conceptual model based on a cascade of three linear reservoirs performed sufficiently well and nse values ranged between 0 52 and 0 985 carbone et al 2014 demonstrated the conceptual model was able to accurately predict the hydrological behavior of the green roof system and the r 2 was equal to 0 99 soulis et al 2017 found the proposed conceptual model can be sufficiently utilized for modeling the hydrological performance of green roofs for substrate depths up to 200 mm accordingly the simpler model developed is still capable of describing the hydrological behavior of green roofs at least in the cases of small size pilot modules 4 2 the key factors influenced runoff simulation of green roofs the results in this study are aligned with previous studies such as brunetti et al 2016 hakimdavar et al 2014 and locatelli et al 2014 that concluded runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs is mainly influenced by initial substrate moisture locatelli et al 2014 found the most sensitive parameter in single event simulation of green roofs was the initial substrate moisture condition brunetti et al 2016 concluded runoff retained by green roofs was mainly determined by their initial substrate moisture in a green roof system the actual retained runoff volume is determined by the substrate s water storage capacity and initial water content at the start of a rainfall event moreover the results were also consistent with the general agreement from green roof monitoring literature that substrate material composition and depth contribute notably to runoff retention and detention performance dunnett et al 2008 liu et al 2019 peng et al 2020 stovin et al 2012 similarly rocha et al 2006 suggested the water movement in the soil profile was sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity curvature peng et al 2019 found the runoff predictions based on richard s equation are sensitive to hydraulic conductivity function of substrate the physical properties of a substrate particularly the maximum water holding capacity govern its runoff retention performance consequently the initial substrate moisture condition and substrate properties are crucial for how much runoff will be retained by green roofs in the study area the heavy rainfalls are mainly concentrated in july to september which accounting for more than 50 of the annual rainfall amount thus this work focused on simulating the hydrological responses of green roofs to event based storms with different characteristics however when continuously simulating the annual performance of green roofs the impacts of seasonal variations and canopy shading of different vegetation types needed to be highly considered while the seasonal variations in temperature and shading effects of different canopy forms on substrate were significant the possible covariation between evapotranspiration and substrate moisture can influence the green roof performance some studies investigated that the warm season has higher et and resulted in green roof retention capacity regenerates faster driscoll et al 2015 mentens et al 2006 villarreal 2007 in addition several studies have also examined the effects of plant mixtures as opposed to monocultures on green roof performance they found that hydrologic performance could be improved through greater diversity of plant life forms lundholm et al 2010 lundholm 2015 nagase and dunnett 2010 wolf and lundholm 2008 pointed out that more shading of the substrate surface can be captured in continuous canopies in vegetation types of plant mixtures and it might be reduced evaporation from the substrate therefore to simulate the annual hydrological performance of green roofs the model should be improved by considering the influences of seasonal variations and canopy shading of different vegetation types 4 3 effects of the substrate designs on hydrological performance the results revealed that decreasing the saturated hydraulic conductivity distinctly delayed time to runoff and increased runoff retention this is because hydraulic conductivity determines the speed of water flowing through the substrate thus it influences the runoff starting time de ville et al 2017 peng et al 2020 a lower conductivity caused slower rainfall infiltration and higher water holding capacity and resulted in less runoff discharged similarly runoff rate declined and runoff generation time delayed with an increase in depth of the substrate layer as the substrate depths increased from 50 mm to 200 mm runoff retention percentages raised from 78 92 to 92 92 and time to runoff was delayed from 42 min to 63 min the findings agreed with previous studies such as feitosa and wilkinson 2016 and versini et al 2015 that showed the thicker substrate discharged less runoff volume feitosa and wilkinson 2016 also found the runoff retention capacity increased with substrate depths according to a linear pattern it should be noted that substrate hydraulic properties and depths are very important design parameters that influence the hydrological performance of green roofs accordingly this simple water balance model can be jointly used in order to facilitate the broader use of simple conceptual models to support substrate design 4 4 hydrological responses under different rainfall patterns in the present study the finding of decreasing trends in the runoff retained percentages with increased storm sizes is consistent with prior studies carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 fassman beck et al 2013 getter et al 2007 simmons et al 2008 vanwoert et al 2005 carter and rasmussen 2005 showed runoff retention percentage decreased from 90 in a 13 mm storm event to 39 in a 54 mm storm voyde et al 2010 concluded that the single event retention efficiency of green roofs was likely to decrease with increasing rainfall return period yao et al 2020 found that green roofs can effectively retain the rainwater in their substrate for small rainfall events but the retention capacity of green roofs was limited when facing heavy storms rainfall depth directly influences the potential for runoff volume reduction of green roofs since it is the sole input to green roofs wong and jim 2014 for smaller storm events sims et al 2016 concluded there was greater probability that the storm size will be smaller than the available water storage capacity in three climate regions of canada for higher rainfall return periods the expected rainfall depth will significantly exceed the green roof s maximum water retention capacity in most locations thus runoff is mainly determined by the rainfall depth sims et al 2019 the influences of rainfall intensity on runoff retention herein presented agreed with those observed in getter et al 2007 lee et al 2015 qin et al 2013 sherrard and jacobs 2012 and zhang et al 2015 in regard to the inverse relationship between rainfall intensity and the efficiencies in runoff retention qin et al 2013 found green roof designs were more effective in flood reduction during lower rainfall intensity stovin et al 2017 concluded runoff detention effects of green roofs were highly sensitive to rainfall intensity villarreal and bengtsson 2005 found runoff retention performance of a green roof was highly dependent on the rainfall intensity with generally lower intensities resulting in larger retention rates this is because a lower intensity tends to decrease the rainfall amount for the same duration and may result in a slower saturation process of substrate infiltration yang et al 2015 speak et al 2013 pointed out that when the substrate was saturated it was difficult for water to infiltrate through the substrate thus enabling surface runoff in a similar way the timing of peak rainfall intensity has also been identified as one of the multiple drivers of retention and detention performance of green roofs the results agreed with simulated responses from qin et al 2013 that green roof performed better for flood reduction in a storm event with a late peak intensity brunetti et al 2016 revealed positively skewed rainfall distribution was likely to exhibit the largest peak flow reduction yio et al 2013 investigated the rainfall event with the earlier peak rainfall intensity resulted in better peak runoff attenuation this is because the earlier the peak rainfall intensity occurs the larger the potential for available water storage of green roofs in summary under the storm events with larger rainfall depth higher rainfall intensity and earlier timing of peak rainfall intensity the runoff retention and detention performances of green roofs were declined therefore green roofs alone cannot solely be relied upon to provide complete flooding mitigation under extreme storm events at the urban scale carter and jackson 2007 suggested that combined with other stormwater source controls or and retention infrastructures green roofs could contribute to a significant reduction in the quantity of runoff water flowing into the sewage network during extreme storm events 5 conclusions this study presented a simple water balance model for simulating runoff retention and detention performance of green roofs based on conceptual hydrological processes and integrated into green roof designs the model was calibrated and validated by experimental data from green roof modules and applied to investigate the effects of substrate designs and rainfall characteristics on the hydrological performance of green roofs the model calibration and validation results concluded that the proposed conceptual model is satisfactorily accurate in modelling the hydrological behavior of green roofs in most cases the sensitivity analysis of parameters showed the initial substrate moisture substrate saturated hydraulic conductivity and substrate depth were the key parameters affecting runoff simulation of green roofs simulated responses of runoff retention and detention of the green roofs distinctly increased with lower saturated hydraulic conductivity and substrate depths green roofs were more effective in flooding reduction during smaller storm events runoff detention effects of green roofs increased significantly as rainfall intensity declined similarly the runoff detention of green roofs performed better in storm events with a late peak rainfall intensity in summary the developed model allows the use of a simple conceptual model for a wider set of conditions than the available experimental data to support green roof design moreover it provides an effective tool for estimating the retention and detention performance expected for a green roof installation in response to specific design storm characteristics the simulation results can facilitate understanding the hydrological behavior of designed green roofs under various rainfall conditions to guide the appropriate implementation of green roof technology in urban areas further studies are suggested to continuously simulate the impacts of seasonal changes and canopy shading of different vegetation types on the annual hydrological performance of green roofs credit authorship contribution statement

4233,karst catchments have complex flow paths dynamics due to the unique marked spatial heterogeneity of karst groundwater systems we used the storage selection sas function framework to explore variations in age distributions of outflow and evapotranspiration from a small karst catchment in southwest china as well as two hillslope spring systems within it daily hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes δd and δ18o in precipitation and at corresponding discharge points were measured for 3 years in order to calibrate the model parameters the seasonal variations in flux age of the three karst groundwater systems are similar which indicates the generally strong hydrological connection between hillslope and depression at seasonal scales the age distribution of outflow shows a high low high variation pattern in the whole catchment while a high low low pattern in hillslope system at the beginning of the wet season in addition to sinkholes in depression the distributions of soil and epikarst relating to the system storage capacity resulting in variations of flow paths under different wetness conditions is likely the main control on the age distributions in runoff for different karst system the discharge selection preferences generally shift from for younger water in wet season to for older water in dry season in the whole catchment while that for younger water in both wet and dry seasons in hillslope system the dynamics of discharge selection preferences can be linked to the critical zone structure of karst underground system the results in this study show that both hillslope and whole catchment preferentially release younger water to evapotranspiration in the study area keywords flux age distribution flow paths karst groundwater system stable isotope sas function 1 introduction the most striking hydrogeological feature of the karst critical zone is the heterogeneity of porous media for water and solute transport encompassing the soil matrix small fractures large fractures and conduits ford and williams 2007 consequently there are marked variations in velocities of water flow within subsurface ranging from slow flows in the matrix and small fractures to fast flows in large fractures and conduits white 2007 worthington 2009 zhang et al 2019 thus the strong influence of the unique structure of carbonate rocks on hydrological function of the critical zone is a dominant control on hydrological processes in karst catchments hartmann et al 2014 meanwhile the pore space distribution and volume of a karst aquifer which relates to the extent and distribution of different media within the aquifer itself affects variation in water storage and hydrological connectivity at the catchment scale zhang et al 2013 this can cause dramatic changes in the dynamics of flow path distribution in the karst critical zone under different wetness conditions zhang et al 2017 these fundamental hydrological functions control catchment transport processes which control water quality such as the nitrate leaching and rapid loss in karst landscapes yue et al 2015 husic et al 2019 although assessment of flow paths can be addressed by monitoring all water and mass fluxes it remains an open problem at the catchment scale due to logistical practicalities of expensive observations especially for karst environment with high spatial heterogeneity water ages often defined as specific metrics such as travel time residence time or young water fractions have been used to provide insights into mechanisms of variations in flow paths at catchment scale kirchner et al 2000 kirchner 2016 botter 2012 mcdonnell and beven 2014 sprenger et al 2019 in karst catchments the stream age varies intensely for example the mean stream age during storm events can even reach an age of just a few days from hundreds of days at an early time following a heavy rainfall event zhang et al 2019 which is linked with the variations in flow paths controlled by the hydrometeorological condition and karst hydrogeological structure worthington 2007 zhang et al 2019 in addition to the studies focused on water ages many reports on water quality in karst area also implied the variabilities in water ages and its relationship with the catchment transport for example husic et al 2019 found that the slow flow with relatively high age via moderate flow paths in epikarst contributed nearly 90 nitrate to streamflow in a karst catchment of cane run in kentucky usa while z j wang et al 2020b indicated that very large amounts of nitrate enter drainage systems through fast flow paths after heavy rains the flow with low age in houzhai karst catchment in southwest china there are significant differences in travel time between the fast and slow flow path in karst catchment zhang et al 2019 based on the dynamics of flow in different pathways simulated by a process based distributed model aamery et al 2021 suggested that travel times in different pathways in karst catchment vary by five orders of magnitude additionally the bidirectional exchange of flux between slow and fast flow paths kaufmann and braun 2000 bauer et al 2003 chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 may accelerate the spatio temporal variations in stream age in karst catchment however how hydrometeorological condition and critical zone architecture control the dynamics of flow paths and associated stream age distributions in karst catchment is still poorly understood in earlier studies tracer tests e g environmental and injected tracer as well as the input concentration and output concentration relationship for conservative tracers in rainfall and runoff hu et al 2015 were used to assess the mean travel time in karst aquifer worthington 2007 tracer aided conceptual model using tracers to aid modelling has helped to track water age in different landscape unit in the karst catchment and infer the wider karst landform influences on travel time distributions zhang et al 2019 however the priori parameterizations of mixing assumption for different medias with significantly different hydrogeological property in the model have a potential limitation on the application of this kind of method for karst catchments hrachowitz et al 2013 process based distributed model that have been applied in many studies for non karst catchments kuppel et al 2018 yang et al 2018 wilusz et al 2020 potentially provide an insight into the spatio temporal variations in water age in karst catchment however limited knowledge about the structure of aquifer and mass of required hydrogeological data limit the application of this method in complex karst environment al aamery et al 2021 recently more parsimonious time variant methods have been developed focusing on solving the age master equation me expressing mass and age continuity botter et al 2011 with a storage selection sas function this provides expressions for travel and residence time distribution as a function of water flux this approach has been shown to be effective at simulating transport at plot scales e g lysimeters by asadollahi et al 2020 soil profiles by smith et al 2020a experimental hillslopes e g pangle et al 2017 kim et al 2016 kim et al 2020 lakes smith et al 2018 and at the catchment scale e g van der velde et al 2015 harman 2015 benettin et al 2017 wilusz et al 2017 yang et al 2018 rodriguez et al 2018 visser et al 2019 as the sas approach benefits from a parsimonious unified framework integrating flow and transport processes it provides a potentially useful method to examine the variations in stream age and associated flow paths in complex heterogenous karst systems however due to limited knowledge about actual travel time distributions for a specific catchment this approach makes a priori parameterization of travel time distributions the priori is usually uncertain even if successful in observed tracer data sets simulations as they may give the right answer for the wrong reason kirchner 2019 kim and troch 2020 due to the common equifinality problem this limitation may be more pronounced in karst environment due to the complex subsurface drainage networks and the lack of relevant research to help address the general research gap on quantifying transport processes in karst catchments the first objective of this study was to use the sas approach to describe temporal variabilities in the stream age distribution travel time distribution of three complex karst systems the second objective was to explore the dynamics of flow paths in karst groundwater systems and their associated controls in relation to hydrometeorological condition and critical zone architecture 2 site and methodology 2 1 three karst groundwater systems the chenqi catchment fig 1 is a 1 25 km2 surface drainage area sub basin of the houzhai catchment located in the puding karst ecohydrological observation station in guizhou province of south western china and both sites have been the focus of long term karst ecohydrological investigations zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the catchment has a subtropical wet monsoon climate hot and humid in summer cold and dry in winter the mean annual temperature precipitation and humidity are 20 1 1140 mm and 76 respectively the wet season is from may to september and the dry season is from october to april this catchment contains numerous conical hills with high elevation ranging from 1340 to 1500 m and star shaped valleys with low elevations less than 1340 m which is typical for cockpit karst with surrounding conical hills separated by star shaped valleys chen et al 2018 the catchment is drained by a main underground conduit the outlet spring is shown in fig 1 three sinkholes linking surface runoff to the underground conduit during heavy rainfall events are distributed in the depression there are five kinds of geological strata in this catchment dolostone thick and thin limestone marlite and quaternary soil profiles fig 1 soils are very thin on hillslopes less than 30 cm and are relatively deep in the depression with the mean thickness 2 m there are many exposed outcrops of carbonate rocks on the hillslopes covering 10 30 of the hillslope area deciduous broad leaved forest and shrub cover the upper parts of the hillslope and corn crops are planted on the lower of hillslope rice paddy and oilseed rape are planted in rotation in the thicker soils of the depression there are two hillslope spring systems s5 and s7 within chenqi catchment that have been selected to explore storage dependent age distributions of water flux in addition to the whole catchment the spring s5 is located at the foot of the eastern hillslope and s7 is located at the upper hillslope of the northern steep hillslope fig 1 based on the dem of this catchment the surface drainage areas of the two hillslope springs of s5 and s7 is identified using the flow direction tool in arcgis with 0 05 and 0 01 km2 respectively the orange shapes in fig 1 according to previous geophysical surveys using ground penetrating radar gpr the thickness of epikarst the near surface weathered zone of carbonates for hillslope 6 1 12 6 m is much smaller than that for depression 15 20 m the epikarst thickness decreases upward along the hillslope as a result mean epikarst thicknesses of 10 2 and 6 3 m have been estimated for s5 and s7 respectively zhang et al 2013 from a previous survey by cheng et al 2019 using electrical resistivity tomography ert there is a thin marlstone layer in the lower part of s5 system it acts as a horizontally continuous impermeable layer that results in the discharge of groundwater in lower slope springs and the flow at s5 is formed by perched groundwater above thin marlstone layer thinner soil layers and epikarst result in the fastest response of flow to rainfall celerity of water in the system at s7 followed by s5 and finally the catchment outflow zhang et al 2013 the main land cover is deciduous broad leaved forest and shrub in s7 the s5 system contains forest and shrub in upper hillslope and corn crops in lower hillslope 2 2 hydrometeorological and isotope observations in chenqi catchment an automatic weather station was established on the southern hillslope to record precipitation air temperature wind radiation air humidity and pressure three v notch weirs with the hight of 0 29 0 08 and 0 02 m respectively were established at catchment outlet and the two hillslope springs of s5 and s7 fig 1 water levels were automatically recorded by hobo u20 water level loggers onset corporation usa with a time interval of 15 min the discharge and weather data were all measured from 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2019 covering three complete hydrological years for isotopes precipitation the catchment outlet and the two hillslope spring flows were sampled daily using an autosampler during the same period as hydrometeorological observation all water samples were collected in 5 ml glass vials the stable isotope ratios of δd and δ18o were measure using a mat 253 laser isotope analyser which were reported in the δ notation using the vienna standard mean ocean water standards the instruments precision is 0 5 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o dynamics in precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet using penman monteith equation discharge and isotope signature for these three observation points are shown in fig 2 and the statistical characteristics summarised in table 1 during the study all discharge measurements at the catchment outlet and spring s5 and spring s7 show obvious seasonal variation table 1 in particular the response of flow to precipitation in all three systems is sharp during wet seasons due to the activation of fast flow paths in the karst critical zone fig 2 discharge at the catchment outlet with mean value of 6 1 10 3 m3 s is much higher than at s5 and s7 with mean values of 12 10 5 and 4 2 10 5 m3 s respectively the flow at the outlet also had the highest coefficient of variation cv of discharge 2 48 over the study period indicating that the temporal variability of outflow from the catchment system was more marked than that of hillslope spring system the δd ratios showed a gradual enrichment during the dry season and pronounced variability during wet season for the three karst groundwater systems compared with discharge the δd ratios in the outflow at s7 tend to show a more dramatic seasonality than at the outlet and s5 with absolute cv of 0 1 the local meteoric water line lmwl for the catchment with r2 0 97 is derived from the regression of δ18o and δd values in daily precipitation sampled from august 2016 to july 2019 although the points for all three systems are scattered in the dual isotope space the slopes of evaporation line for these three systems coloured lines are lower than that of lmwl this indicates evaporative fractionation signals in the outflows of the three groundwater systems and is consistent with other observations in karst catchments e g hu et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the dual isotope plots for catchment outlet s5 and s7 are shown in fig 3 which indicates that both δ18o and δd in outflow are more enriched at the catchment outlet than at s5 and s7 although the soil layer on the steeper hillslopes is typically very thin in karst catchments there are clear fractionated isotopic signals in the hillslope spring flow at certain times e g 2 to 7 august 2016 for s7 this seems to differ from some non karst catchments where evaporative fractionation can result in isotopically enriched water in the topsoil in summer but affected by winter precipitation and damping along flow paths result in unfractionated isotopic signals in the groundwater and stream flow sprenger et al 2016 sprenger et al 2018 however at chenqi where rainfall is also concentrated in the summer it can be inferred that the fractionated soil water from the thin hillslopes can be rapidly displaced in high intensity rainfall and recharge groundwater 2 3 the storage selection approach according to the storage selection approach the age ranked storage st representing the cumulative volumes of water in storage as ranked by their age t is applied to estimate the contributions of different components of ranked storage to outflows or evapotranspiration the governing equation for st from considering the fluxes of water in and out of different ages and by considering the aging of water remaining in the control volume can be expressed as harman 2015 benettin et al 2017 1 s t t t t s t t t t j t q t ω q s t t t t e t t ω et s t t t t where j t q t and et t respectively represent the actual input water rainfall in this area discharge and evapotranspiration at time t st t t is the mass of water the cumulative volumes of water in the system with age t at time t ω s t t is the sas function which formalizes the functional relationship between the age distribution of the system storage and that of the outflows corresponding to the cumulative volumes of water st t t to the relevant outflows i e ω q for discharge q t and ω et for evapotranspiration e t t the power law shaped functions are used to express the sas functions ω q s t t and ω e t s t t in this study queloz et al 2015 benettin et al 2017 2 ω q s t t s t t t s t k q 3 ω e t s t t s t t t s t k e t where kq and ket are preference parameters for discharge and evapotranspiration kq ket less than 1 represents the system preference to release young water to flow evapotranspiration kq ket 1 represents the system preference to release old water the case of kq ket 1 represents random sampling equivalent to a completely mixed system van der velde et al 2015 rinaldo et al 2015 to take into account the time variance of the sas function which is parameterized to vary in time with the relative catchment wetness w t state benettin et al 2017 4 k q t k 1 1 w t k 2 k 1 where k1 and k2 are two parameters which are used for illustration purposes and should not be taken as representative of a general catchment behavior benettin and bertuzzo 2018 in karst catchments the discharge is sensitive to precipitation due to the high permeability of aquifer some high discharge events could occur after precipitation in the dry season when the catchment storage is low fig 2 hence in this study the discharge variations were normalized to serve as a nondimensional metric of catchment wetness 5 w t q t q min q max q min where qmin and qmax represent the maximum and minimum discharge for evapotranspiration the parameter of ket is fixed which gives a fixed sas function similar to water age the distributions of tracer concentrations in discharge and evapotranspiration cq and cet can be estimated using the selection process consequently the stream and evapotranspiration concentrations are estimated by integrating the contribution of all the released water volumes 6 c q t 0 c s t t p q t t d t 7 c et t 0 c s t t p et t t d t where cs t t represents the concentration of the storage st t t p q t t and p et t t are the age distribution of outflow and evapotranspiration respectively which are obtained by 8 p q t t ω q s t t s t t 9 p et t t ω et s t t s t t where ω s t is the probability density function of ω s t t the water stable isotope deuterium is used as the tracer in this study in this case the concentration c e g eq 6 and 7 can be replaced by an isotope ratio δ ala aho et al 2017 kuppel et al 2018 kirchner 2019 benettin et al 2019 the evaporative fractionation effects on water isotope composition in karst catchments are in fig 3 and have been reported in previous studies hu et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 consequently it is likely to be important that evaporative fractionation effects need to be incorporated in isotopes based modelling for sub tropical karst landscapes although there is still a debate over whether transpiration affects the fractionation many isotope tests of plant water have provided the evaporative fractionation caused by transpiration farquhar et al 2007 vargas et al 2017 chen et al 2020 therefore the effect of evaporative fractionation on the isotope signal in storage is considered to be linked to evapotranspiration in this study this method has been successfully used to model the evaporative fractionation in this study catchment zhang et al 2019 as well as in bruntland burn catchment in scotland benettin et al 2017 following the approach by queloz et al 2015 with the relations of t t t0 an ordinary differential equation of the isotope composition in each age ranked storage volume can be obtained 10 d δ s t t t 0 dt f e t t t 0 ω e t s t t t 0 δ s t t t 0 where f is fractionation coefficient 2 4 modelling procedures in a karst catchment the drainage area of the hydrological system is usually unknown or imprecise due to inconsistencies between the topographically defined catchment boundary with the underground boundary liu et al 2020 therefore in this study the actual drainage area area for each system was obtained by adjusting the surface drainage area areas using a parameter α area α areas and then the discharge with the unit of mm d q t in eq 1 was calculated using the actual drainage area this method is similar to the effective catchment by liu et al 2020 actual daily evapotranspiration et t in each system was estimated by e t t β p e t t and the fitting parameter β was obtained according to mass balance of water over the entire study period hence the model includes a total of six calibrated parameters k1 k2 ket s0 f and α and the initial range for each of the parameters is shown in table 2 the dynamics of isotope composition were estimated using the sas approach for the three groundwater systems and then the variations in mean travel times and the travel time distributions of outflows at catchment outlet and the s5 and s7 springs were modelled with respective calibrated model parameters model calibration was performed on daily time steps from 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2018 a total of 730 steps for each groundwater system and the model performance was checked against a one year validation period also on daily time steps from 1 august 2018 to 31 july 2019 a spin up period of 2 years based on looping the hydrologic and isotope data from the calibration period was used to establish initial conditions of storages isotope ratios and water ages limited samples of the isotope composition of rainfall during the study period were missing due to the too little rainfall amount or instrument failure if there was isotope data in the adjacent the day before and the day after precipitation time series it was used to fill in the missing data when data were available both the day before and the day after their mean was used otherwise the mean value 60 4 for δd over the study period was used to in the missing data in this study model parameter space and uncertainty were explored using a monte carlo approach to simulations the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criterion was used to formulate calibration objective applied to the time series of δd signatures in outflows at each observation point the coefficient of determination r2 between the observed and simulated isotope ratios as well as nse is used to evaluate the success of the calibration the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue procedure beven and binley 1992 beven 2012 is usually used in parameter calibration and uncertainty evaluation to avoid that behavioral model structures were excluded due to a high threshold specified a variant of glue birkel and soulsby 2015 xie et al 2018 was used in this study a total of 100 000 parameter combinations were randomly generated from the initial ranges for each karst groundwater system only the 200 best parameter sets with the highest values of nse from the 100 000 tested parameter combinations were retained to enable the calibration scheme to explore the global variable domain the initial range of each parameter value was set to be large table 2 for example the initial ranges of ket and f were set to 0 05 10 and 0 0 1 respectively much larger than that of 0 2 3 and 0 0 05 used by benettin et al 2017 and the initial ranges for both k1 and k2 were set to 0 05 10 enabling a large initial range of kq the upper limit of s0 for each site was determined by the corresponding maximum aquifer depth surveyed in system multiplied by a high porosity of 20 for the hillslopes and 30 for the catchment system much higher than the measured value of 6 9 in this catchment by zhang et al 2014 the initial ranges of the adjustment coefficient α for the catchment s5 and s7 were set to 0 15 1 5 0 03 0 3 and 0 06 0 6 respectively which caused a runoff coefficient of 0 1 1 for the three systems a range of 0 44 to 0 69 for runoff coefficient for karst catchment in this area has been suggested by zhang et al 2014 according to estimations in 23 karst catchments in southwest china the simulation bounds representing posterior parameter uncertainty were also determined from the 200 best parameter sets this method has been used in previous isotope tracer studies birkel and soulsby 2015 soulsby et al 2015 the dynamics of water ages in outflow and how it is affected by karst subsurface architectures were assessed based on the model results with the 200 best calibrated parameter sets 3 results 3 1 simulated isotopes in outflow of the three groundwater systems fig 4 shows the daily deuterium ratios in outflows at the catchment outlet s5 and s7 simulated using the sas approach with the calibrated parameter sets the results show that the temporal variations in δd signals of the system outflows at these three observation points are generally captured in the calibration period and are reproduced in the validation period by the model with the same calibrated parameter sets for the calibration period across the 200 best parameter sets shown in table 2 the maximum mean and minimum objective function values of nse were 0 66 0 60 and 0 57 respectively for catchment outlet and 0 78 0 67 and 0 63 for the s5 system and 0 65 0 58 and 0 55 for s7 system the mean r2 was 0 66 0 76 and 0 68 for catchment s5 and s7 respectively over the calibrations period the main variations of δd in outflows at the three observations points are also generally reproduced for the validation period with mean nse of 0 5 0 55 and 0 5 for catchment outlet s5 and s7 respectively the mean r2 was 0 56 0 63 and 0 5 for catchment s5 and s7 respectively over the validation period however there are some outliers of the δd variations were not captured by the corresponding model for example some especially enriched values at catchment outlet e g june 2018 are shown to be out with the simulation range in fig 4 the most likely explanation for this is that the fractionated water is occasionally displaced from the flooded paddy fields during rainfall events and enters the underground conduit the paddy water was sampled for two times during rice growing season of june and july 2018 with the mean δd value of 35 8 more enriched than that of outflow there were also some depletion isotope signals that were not captured for the three systems especially at the start of the validation e g end of june to july 2018 in addition to the errors in the model calculation e g water balance errors caused by evapotranspiration estimations as mentioned another likely explanation for this is that averaging precipitation inputs to daily timesteps underestimates high intensity sub daily inputs of more depleted water which breakthrough into the stream for example the δd values of rain water as model input were 25 1 and 51 5 at 22nd and 23th june 2018 with the corresponding daily rain amounts of 47 4 and 30 8 mm respectively however these two rainfall events lasted 8 and 6 h respectively and the hourly rainfall peak for each event were not at the corresponding sampling hour such mis timings with daily averaging of samples also likely led to disinformative inputs at other times during intensive rainfall periods e g june and july in 2017 and 2018 shown in fig 4 the probability density of each parameter was estimated based on normal kernel functions for the 200 best model parameter sets for the three systems fig 5 the results showed that the distributions of the six model parameters varied substantially for the three systems the distribution ranges of k1 for all the three systems are relatively large from 0 01 to 3 however the mean value of k2 for the catchment outlet between 1 14 and 1 54 was notably higher than both s5 between 0 71 and 1 47 and s7 between 0 54 and 1 2 systems it can be inferred that the catchment system has a generally higher preference parameter for discharge kq than s5 and s7 systems under same wetness condition from eq 4 which may result in a stronger preference for releasing water from older storage components than the s5 and s7 springs the preference parameter for evapotranspiration ket has a wider distribution for s5 and s7 0 14 to 0 86 than for the catchment from 0 27 to 0 63 the initial storage parameter s0 for the catchment 340 556 mm is much higher than that for s5 66 138 mm and s7 83 118 mm systems which would be consistent with the ground penetrating radar gpr survey in the catchment defining the epikarst thickness as 6 1 12 6 m and 15 20 m for the hillslope and depression respectively zhang et al 2013 this is also consistent with previous findings that soil and small fractures in the depression are the main storage zones in the catchment zhang et al 2019 the catchment system also has the narrowest distribution of the fractionation coefficient f and the mean f of the 200 best parameter sets 0 5 10 3 is significantly lower than that of s5 2 5 10 3 and s7 15 10 3 systems the distribution of the adjustment coefficient for injected water α for the catchment system varies from 0 72 to 1 02 indicating the catchment water balance is not closed and it is likely that some rainfall leaves the catchment unmeasured via fractures or conduits in contrast the narrow distributions of α for s5 and s7 with values less than 0 3 indicate that only a small fraction of rainfall actually are drained through the hillslope springs in this study the actual daily evapotranspiration in eq 1 was calculated by multiplying the potential evapotranspiration by a fitting parameter which was obtained from water balance of water over the entire study period for each system this may lead to inaccurate storage at daily scale using the mass balance harman 2015 although the study catchment is in a wet region with mean annual precipitation of 1140 mm to assess the accuracy of this method the calculated evapotranspiration was compared to a time series of actual daily evapotranspiration measured over the period from 1 january 2017 to 31 december 2017 at the nearby puding karst ecosystem research station by y wang et al 2020a using a flux tower figure s1 the results show that the calculated evapotranspiration was generally consistent with the observed values over this period additionally the observed evapotranspiration was directly used in the estimation of water balance eq 1 for tracking the tracer dynamics in outflows at the catchment outlet based on the calibrated parameter set for the best simulation the estimated deuterium ratios in flow over the period 1 january 2017 to 31 december 2017 were close to that using the original evapotranspiration estimates shown in figure s2 with the nse of 0 60 and 0 54 for the set of calculated and observed actual evapotranspiration respectively the time invariant adjusting coefficient for drainage area α was used to consider the inconsistency of the topographic boundary with the underground catchment boundary however the underground boundary may change over time due to the variability in hydrological connectivity within the aquifer changing with storage chen et al 2018 potentially using a time invariant α leads more or less inaccurate water balance calculation at the daily scale especially in the karst hillslope system with no marked topographical change in the larger catchment no large fractures or conduits are found at the boundary according to geophysical surveys undertaken which means any water fluxes into or out of each hydrogeological system likely mainly occur through slow flow paths therefore the results of water balance calculation in this study appear reasonable for each system 3 2 variations in the sas functions and selection preference parameters based on the calibrated model parameters the time variant power law sas functions ω q s t t and ω e t s t t for catchment s5 and s7 systems were estimated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively the calculated ω q s t t and ω e t s t t vs normalized age ranked storage over the study period for the whole catchment s5 and s7 systems are shown in fig 6 blue and purple lines represent wet and dry season respectively most lines of sas function for discharge especially in hillslope are convex pattern for all the three systems during wet season indicating the preference for younger water releasing in contrast some sas function lines of discharge at s5 and most at catchment outlet are concave pattern during dry season purple lines showing the preference for older water releasing the sas function lines of evapotranspiration for all the three systems based on the corresponding calibrated parameter of ket are above the random sampling line fig 6 which indicates the preference for younger water releasing to evapotranspiration in karst groundwater systems the temporal dynamics in the preference parameter for discharge kq for the three systems are shown in fig 7 the results showed the marked seasonal variability due to the changes in wetness over the study period the mean kq values were 1 15 0 99 and 0 7 for the whole catchment s5 and s7 respectively for the wet season june to october the mean values of kq were 1 11 and 0 96 and for the dry season november to may that were 1 2 and 1 03 for the catchment and s5 respectively this indicated that the catchment system exhibits a stronger preference for older water releasing to discharge than that in the s5 system in comparison kq was less than 1 for s7 for both wet and dry season fig 7 indicating the strongest preference for younger water releasing to discharge in the system at the top of hillslope it is worth noting that the value of kq varied sharply around 1 after heavy rainfall especially during the early wet season both for the whole catchment and hillslope e g s5 this emphasises the dramatic temporal changes in the system preference for releasing younger or older water to discharge although the estimated sas functions for evapotranspiration are more uncertain due to the poorer constraint of evapotranspiration ages derived from isotopic composition of drainage water it can provide a first approximation of the selection preference of each system for evapotranspiration asadollahi et al 2020 all calibrated values of ket are less than 1 for the three systems table 2 which suggests that the karst system in this area preferentially release younger water to evapotranspiration 3 3 dynamics of water age and storage in the three systems simulated dynamics of daily dynamics in storage and median age in outflow over study period are shown in fig 8 the mean storages were 428 96 and 67 mm from the 200 best simulations for the catchment and s5 and s7 systems respectively which are higher than mean active storages of catchment and hillslope unit with 270 and 23 mm respectively derived from the tracer aided model zhang et al 2019 this could be explained by greater passive storage in depressions where oldest water is likely to be stored which were not considered in the tracer aided model while it is considered in the simulated storages using the sas approach in this study as a representative metric of stream age median age can avoid determining the exact age of each ranked storage element which can be exceeded from the age distribution calculated by the model at any time step harman 2015 benettin et al 2017 benettin and bertuzzo 2018 wilusz et al 2020 in this study we used the median age median travel time to assess the dynamics of system outflow ages and its responses to the changes of hydrologic state in the three groundwater systems the mean modelled median age in catchment outflow was 231 days over the study period which is a similar magnitude to mean age of catchment outflow of 326 days calculated by the tracer aided model zhang et al 2019 although the study periods of these two cases are not exactly the same 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2019 vs 1 november 2016 to 31 october 2017 and at the two hillslope spring systems s5 and s7 the mean median ages of outflow were 192 and 177 days respectively which are also consistent with the mean age in a conceptual hillslope unit outflow with 137 days calculated by the tracer aided model seasonal variations in the median age in outflow were apparent in the three systems from 300 days in the dry season to a few days after heavy rainfall in the wet season fig 8 it is obvious that the seasonal variation in median ages in the outflow of the three systems are generally similar even though they have contrasting storage magnitudes however there are some significant differences in temporal variability of flux age for the three systems at high time resolution for example there are some sharp variations in median age in s7 outflow during the dry season while they rise gradually at the catchment and s5 over the same periods fig 8 further the patterns of variations in the median age for the three systems are also markedly different at the beginning of the wet season according to the higher temporal resolution plots the right column in fig 8 the explanation of these will be discussed below to assess the variability in age distribution in outflow under different hydroclimatic conditions six times in the study period were chosen see fig 8 t1 t3 4 5 and 6 may 2017 t4 t6 14 15 and 17 june 2017 respectively for estimating the cumulative distribution function cdf of flux age at the three observation points the first three adjacent days of t1 to t3 were in dry season and the other three t3 to t4 were in wet season in fig 9 on 4 and 6 may 2017 there was no rain and the daily rainfall amount was 20 3 mm on 5 may 2017 for another three days in wet season there was 29 6 mm rainfall amount on 15 june 2017 and no rain on 14 and 17 june 2017 the cdfs of flux age extracted on the six selected days are shown in fig 9 the results show that the outflows at the three systems have higher proportion of younger water under the wet condition than that under the dry condition for example water younger than 69 days young water defined by kirchner 2016 accounted for about 39 62 in outflow for the three systems on 14 15 and 17 june 2017 but only 10 41 on 4 to 6 may 2017 it is worth noting that from 4 to 5 may 2017 the proportion of young water in outflow rose significantly after the rain 20 3 mm in the dry season in s7 and which returns to the initial state quickly after the proportion rise while the proportion of young water in outflow was almost unchanged for both catchment outlet and s5 in contrast from 14 to 15 june 2017 at the beginning of the wet season the proportion of young water in outflow rose quickly when it rains for all the catchment s5 and s7 however from 15 to 17 the proportion of young water in outflow declined quickly after the rain in both the catchment and s5 while it was almost unchanged in s7 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 availability and potential limitation of discharge dependent method of sas function for karst groundwater system in karst catchment some high discharge can exist after precipitation in the dry season when the catchment storage is low fig 2 meaning the same storage volume can correspond to different flow path arrangements this can be explained that the fast flow paths e g large fractures or conduits are activated although the catchment storage is low it suggests that thin soil cover even bare fractures rather than the variations in groundwater level dominate the hydrological connection of fast drainage networks in karst critical zone in this study the discharge variations were normalized to serve as a nondimensional metric of catchment wetness equation 5 which determines the time variation sas function discharge dependent sas function however the simulated flow paths could be different at the same discharge when the storage is different like the temporal variations in sas function for the three systems shown in fig 6 due to the hysteresis in the storage discharge relationship e g caused by the evapotranspiration calculation method in this study especially when the fast flow paths were not adequately activated during dry or small rainfall period as a result the potentially inaccurate storage calculated by the mass balance method in this study e g the evapotranspiration calculation may lead the uncertainties of flow path estimation age selection hence the storage discharge relationship at the catchment scale for karst system need to be further investigated such as the catchment sensitivity function e g harman 2015 or specific storage discharge relations e g van der velde et al 2015 4 2 effect of flow paths on flux age distributions in contrasting karst groundwater systems notwithstanding uncertainties involved in the water age simulation due to some degree of hysteresis of storage discharge discussed above the results of age flux age distribution can provide useful insights for the characterization of the flow paths under different wetness condition in karst catchment spatio temporal variations in the modelled flux ages in this study can provide a reasonable basis for conceptualising selective preference for releasing water to flow and evapotranspiration relating to flow paths actions under different critical zone architecture conditions in heterogenous karst groundwater systems fig 10 it can be inferred that the markedly low ages in outflows in the wet season fig 8 is released to the enhanced activation of large fractures or conduits in both the hillslopes and depressions units in the wet season this is similar to the role of shallow subsurface flow paths in the more permeable upper layer of hillslopes in non karst catchments which are dominated by younger waters under wet condition rodhe et al 1996 furthermore the high proportion of hillslope in the cockpit karst landscapes area with areas of 0 88 and 0 37 km2 for the hillslopes and depression in chenqi and the strong hydrological connectivity between hillslope and depression zhang et al 2019 can explain the similar variations in age in outflow for the hillslope and whole catchment at season scale the dynamics of median flux age and storage over the period from 5 june to 15 july 2016 beginning of the wet season for the whole catchment s5 and s7 the right column in fig 8 show that as the catchment becomes wetter due to ongoing rainfall median age in the catchment outflow exhibits a dramatic change of high low high while that for s7 declines sharply and then maintains a low level high low low this indicates the significant difference in age distributions for the three systems during this period in the heavy rainfall events part of the rainfall infiltration in the depression recharges to underground conduit via large fractures or sinkholes and flows out the catchment in a short time leading the sharp decline in age in the catchment outflow e g the median age in outflow at catchment outlet could decrease from 300 days to a few days in one rainfall event shown in fig 8 due to the low storage capacity large fractures account for around 8 of the volume in the karst critical zone by zhang et al 2013 younger water in large fractures and conduits in depression would quickly be replaced by older water from soil or matrix squeezd by the rain water and hillslope flow this can explain the high low high pattern of age in outflow for the whole catchment and it is consistent with the age distributions in outflow at outlet shown in fig 9 also this inference is supported by the sharp variations in sas functions and the preference parameter for flow kq in catchment after heavy rain at beginning of the wet season figs 6 and 7 compared to the depression the hillslope especially on the top of hillslope like s7 has markedly thin soil and epikarst resulting in only relatively small precipitation inputs being needed to activate the fast flow paths this can explain the higher variation in the isotope signatures in hillslope system cv of δd in table 1 and the significant increase in the proportion of younger water in outflow at s7 after rainfall in dry season also the continuous high proportion of younger water resulting in the high low low pattern fig 8 in heavy rainfall events at the start of the wet season is related to the low storage capacity in hillslope due to the thin soil and epikarst another noteworthy phenomenon is that the weak negative correlation between system storage and median age in outflow for all three systems shown in fig 8 can be linked to the inverse storage effect which is supported by the results reported by zhang et al 2020 this is consistent with the findings by husic et al 2020 that the epikarst flow contribution to outflow will increase during medium to high events it also can be inferred that the inverse storage effect and a very transient direct storage effect where higher storage results in a greater bias toward older water by harman 2015 appear alternately after heavy rainfall at the beginning of wet season for the catchment system corresponding to the rapid variations in the flux age at the start of the wet season at the catchment outlet fig 8 affected by the activation of fast flow paths especially in the hillslope system e g s7 the direct storage effect sometimes occurs in dry season when the younger water tends to be released with low catchment storage in karst area fig 8 this is also found in other studies in karst catchment husic et al 2020 in the depression of cockpit karst areas in southwest china crops e g rice paddy and oilseed rape in this catchment mainly abstract the water in shallow soil layer due to the short roots fan et al 2016 which suggests the preference for releasing younger water to evapotranspiration on the hillslope in karst areas the forest and shrub roots usually extend into the fractured rock aquifers resulting in the abstraction of water from both shallow soil and fractured rock aquifers rong et al 2011 therefore the preference for releasing younger water to evapotranspiration for hillslope system fig 7 is consistence to that the residence time of water in large fractures in hillslope where the roots extend is low to clarify the preference of each system to release water of different ages to evapotranspiration more accurate representation of the rooting zone in a more process based model using soil isotopes would better constrain the ages of evapotranspiration under different vegetation e g smith et al 2020b in karst catchments 4 3 linking karst critical zone structure to dynamics of discharge selection preference understanding the shifts of discharge selection preference in karst system requires a closer look at the critical zone structure affecting the streamflow generation mechanisms in karst aquifer the fracture aperture and porosity usually decrease with the increase of depth from the ground surface ford and williams 2007 zhang et al 2013 therefore the hydrological connectivity of the relatively large fractures in the upper part of epikart will be enhanced when water table rises under wet condition zhang et al 2019 as a result the probability of the younger water being selected for discharge increases this is supported by the sas function distributions for the three systems fig 6 although discharge is mainly fed by the water stored in the small fractures in both hillslope and whole catchment during dry period zhang et al 2017 their preferences for younger or older water releasing may differ fig 6 due to the notable difference in critical zone structure between hillslope and depression in the flat depression with thick soil and epikarst the conduits usually extend near the base of epikarst cheng et al 2019 hence the vertical piston flow could result in the relatively high contribution of the water stored in the deeper small fractures to discharge under dry condition as a result the whole catchment shows a generally preference for older water releasing to discharge in contrast due to the thin soil and epikarst and steeper topography in hillslope system the water stored in the shallower fractures with higher hydraulic conductivity is easier to be delivered to outlet along the hillslope than that in the deeper small fractures therefore the hillslope system usually shows a preference for younger water releasing to discharge especially for the upper hillslope system e g s7 affected by the bare large fractures and sinkholes in the depression rain water can recharge to the underground flow in a short time which will convert the discharge selection preference from for older water to for younger water in the whole catchment after rainfall during dry season consistent with the sas function distributions in catchment outlet shown in fig 6 5 conclusions we explored the age distributions in outflow and flow paths in three karst groundwater systems with different critical zone architectures using the storage selection approach the discharge dependent sas functions were used to simulated the transport in this study model results show that the dynamics of daily isotope in outflow can be well reproduced for the typical karst catchment of chenqi and two karst hillslope spring systems within in the seasonal variations in the flux ages of the three karst groundwater systems are similar which indicates the strong hydrological connectivity between hillslope and depression in this catchment the modelled results show the continuous decline of flux age and oscillations between high and low flux age for hillslope system and whole catchment respectively this is likely related to the distributions of soil and epikarst in hillslope and depression resulting in the variations in flow paths under different wetness conditions the sas function distributions show that the preference of releasing younger water to discharge in hillslope system both in wet and dry season while the discharge selection preferences generally shift from for younger water in wet season to for older water in dry season in the whole catchment this is likely related to the critical zone structures of hillslope and depression leading the different streamflow generation mechanisms within the two landform units in the study area younger water in both hillslope system and whole catchment is abstracted for evapotranspiration more than older water whilst the dynamics of flow paths and associated flow age distributions in karst groundwater system need further assessment at different scales this study is an encouraging step forward in the exploration of hydrological function of karst catchment credit authorship contribution statement zhicai zhang

4233,karst catchments have complex flow paths dynamics due to the unique marked spatial heterogeneity of karst groundwater systems we used the storage selection sas function framework to explore variations in age distributions of outflow and evapotranspiration from a small karst catchment in southwest china as well as two hillslope spring systems within it daily hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes δd and δ18o in precipitation and at corresponding discharge points were measured for 3 years in order to calibrate the model parameters the seasonal variations in flux age of the three karst groundwater systems are similar which indicates the generally strong hydrological connection between hillslope and depression at seasonal scales the age distribution of outflow shows a high low high variation pattern in the whole catchment while a high low low pattern in hillslope system at the beginning of the wet season in addition to sinkholes in depression the distributions of soil and epikarst relating to the system storage capacity resulting in variations of flow paths under different wetness conditions is likely the main control on the age distributions in runoff for different karst system the discharge selection preferences generally shift from for younger water in wet season to for older water in dry season in the whole catchment while that for younger water in both wet and dry seasons in hillslope system the dynamics of discharge selection preferences can be linked to the critical zone structure of karst underground system the results in this study show that both hillslope and whole catchment preferentially release younger water to evapotranspiration in the study area keywords flux age distribution flow paths karst groundwater system stable isotope sas function 1 introduction the most striking hydrogeological feature of the karst critical zone is the heterogeneity of porous media for water and solute transport encompassing the soil matrix small fractures large fractures and conduits ford and williams 2007 consequently there are marked variations in velocities of water flow within subsurface ranging from slow flows in the matrix and small fractures to fast flows in large fractures and conduits white 2007 worthington 2009 zhang et al 2019 thus the strong influence of the unique structure of carbonate rocks on hydrological function of the critical zone is a dominant control on hydrological processes in karst catchments hartmann et al 2014 meanwhile the pore space distribution and volume of a karst aquifer which relates to the extent and distribution of different media within the aquifer itself affects variation in water storage and hydrological connectivity at the catchment scale zhang et al 2013 this can cause dramatic changes in the dynamics of flow path distribution in the karst critical zone under different wetness conditions zhang et al 2017 these fundamental hydrological functions control catchment transport processes which control water quality such as the nitrate leaching and rapid loss in karst landscapes yue et al 2015 husic et al 2019 although assessment of flow paths can be addressed by monitoring all water and mass fluxes it remains an open problem at the catchment scale due to logistical practicalities of expensive observations especially for karst environment with high spatial heterogeneity water ages often defined as specific metrics such as travel time residence time or young water fractions have been used to provide insights into mechanisms of variations in flow paths at catchment scale kirchner et al 2000 kirchner 2016 botter 2012 mcdonnell and beven 2014 sprenger et al 2019 in karst catchments the stream age varies intensely for example the mean stream age during storm events can even reach an age of just a few days from hundreds of days at an early time following a heavy rainfall event zhang et al 2019 which is linked with the variations in flow paths controlled by the hydrometeorological condition and karst hydrogeological structure worthington 2007 zhang et al 2019 in addition to the studies focused on water ages many reports on water quality in karst area also implied the variabilities in water ages and its relationship with the catchment transport for example husic et al 2019 found that the slow flow with relatively high age via moderate flow paths in epikarst contributed nearly 90 nitrate to streamflow in a karst catchment of cane run in kentucky usa while z j wang et al 2020b indicated that very large amounts of nitrate enter drainage systems through fast flow paths after heavy rains the flow with low age in houzhai karst catchment in southwest china there are significant differences in travel time between the fast and slow flow path in karst catchment zhang et al 2019 based on the dynamics of flow in different pathways simulated by a process based distributed model aamery et al 2021 suggested that travel times in different pathways in karst catchment vary by five orders of magnitude additionally the bidirectional exchange of flux between slow and fast flow paths kaufmann and braun 2000 bauer et al 2003 chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 may accelerate the spatio temporal variations in stream age in karst catchment however how hydrometeorological condition and critical zone architecture control the dynamics of flow paths and associated stream age distributions in karst catchment is still poorly understood in earlier studies tracer tests e g environmental and injected tracer as well as the input concentration and output concentration relationship for conservative tracers in rainfall and runoff hu et al 2015 were used to assess the mean travel time in karst aquifer worthington 2007 tracer aided conceptual model using tracers to aid modelling has helped to track water age in different landscape unit in the karst catchment and infer the wider karst landform influences on travel time distributions zhang et al 2019 however the priori parameterizations of mixing assumption for different medias with significantly different hydrogeological property in the model have a potential limitation on the application of this kind of method for karst catchments hrachowitz et al 2013 process based distributed model that have been applied in many studies for non karst catchments kuppel et al 2018 yang et al 2018 wilusz et al 2020 potentially provide an insight into the spatio temporal variations in water age in karst catchment however limited knowledge about the structure of aquifer and mass of required hydrogeological data limit the application of this method in complex karst environment al aamery et al 2021 recently more parsimonious time variant methods have been developed focusing on solving the age master equation me expressing mass and age continuity botter et al 2011 with a storage selection sas function this provides expressions for travel and residence time distribution as a function of water flux this approach has been shown to be effective at simulating transport at plot scales e g lysimeters by asadollahi et al 2020 soil profiles by smith et al 2020a experimental hillslopes e g pangle et al 2017 kim et al 2016 kim et al 2020 lakes smith et al 2018 and at the catchment scale e g van der velde et al 2015 harman 2015 benettin et al 2017 wilusz et al 2017 yang et al 2018 rodriguez et al 2018 visser et al 2019 as the sas approach benefits from a parsimonious unified framework integrating flow and transport processes it provides a potentially useful method to examine the variations in stream age and associated flow paths in complex heterogenous karst systems however due to limited knowledge about actual travel time distributions for a specific catchment this approach makes a priori parameterization of travel time distributions the priori is usually uncertain even if successful in observed tracer data sets simulations as they may give the right answer for the wrong reason kirchner 2019 kim and troch 2020 due to the common equifinality problem this limitation may be more pronounced in karst environment due to the complex subsurface drainage networks and the lack of relevant research to help address the general research gap on quantifying transport processes in karst catchments the first objective of this study was to use the sas approach to describe temporal variabilities in the stream age distribution travel time distribution of three complex karst systems the second objective was to explore the dynamics of flow paths in karst groundwater systems and their associated controls in relation to hydrometeorological condition and critical zone architecture 2 site and methodology 2 1 three karst groundwater systems the chenqi catchment fig 1 is a 1 25 km2 surface drainage area sub basin of the houzhai catchment located in the puding karst ecohydrological observation station in guizhou province of south western china and both sites have been the focus of long term karst ecohydrological investigations zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the catchment has a subtropical wet monsoon climate hot and humid in summer cold and dry in winter the mean annual temperature precipitation and humidity are 20 1 1140 mm and 76 respectively the wet season is from may to september and the dry season is from october to april this catchment contains numerous conical hills with high elevation ranging from 1340 to 1500 m and star shaped valleys with low elevations less than 1340 m which is typical for cockpit karst with surrounding conical hills separated by star shaped valleys chen et al 2018 the catchment is drained by a main underground conduit the outlet spring is shown in fig 1 three sinkholes linking surface runoff to the underground conduit during heavy rainfall events are distributed in the depression there are five kinds of geological strata in this catchment dolostone thick and thin limestone marlite and quaternary soil profiles fig 1 soils are very thin on hillslopes less than 30 cm and are relatively deep in the depression with the mean thickness 2 m there are many exposed outcrops of carbonate rocks on the hillslopes covering 10 30 of the hillslope area deciduous broad leaved forest and shrub cover the upper parts of the hillslope and corn crops are planted on the lower of hillslope rice paddy and oilseed rape are planted in rotation in the thicker soils of the depression there are two hillslope spring systems s5 and s7 within chenqi catchment that have been selected to explore storage dependent age distributions of water flux in addition to the whole catchment the spring s5 is located at the foot of the eastern hillslope and s7 is located at the upper hillslope of the northern steep hillslope fig 1 based on the dem of this catchment the surface drainage areas of the two hillslope springs of s5 and s7 is identified using the flow direction tool in arcgis with 0 05 and 0 01 km2 respectively the orange shapes in fig 1 according to previous geophysical surveys using ground penetrating radar gpr the thickness of epikarst the near surface weathered zone of carbonates for hillslope 6 1 12 6 m is much smaller than that for depression 15 20 m the epikarst thickness decreases upward along the hillslope as a result mean epikarst thicknesses of 10 2 and 6 3 m have been estimated for s5 and s7 respectively zhang et al 2013 from a previous survey by cheng et al 2019 using electrical resistivity tomography ert there is a thin marlstone layer in the lower part of s5 system it acts as a horizontally continuous impermeable layer that results in the discharge of groundwater in lower slope springs and the flow at s5 is formed by perched groundwater above thin marlstone layer thinner soil layers and epikarst result in the fastest response of flow to rainfall celerity of water in the system at s7 followed by s5 and finally the catchment outflow zhang et al 2013 the main land cover is deciduous broad leaved forest and shrub in s7 the s5 system contains forest and shrub in upper hillslope and corn crops in lower hillslope 2 2 hydrometeorological and isotope observations in chenqi catchment an automatic weather station was established on the southern hillslope to record precipitation air temperature wind radiation air humidity and pressure three v notch weirs with the hight of 0 29 0 08 and 0 02 m respectively were established at catchment outlet and the two hillslope springs of s5 and s7 fig 1 water levels were automatically recorded by hobo u20 water level loggers onset corporation usa with a time interval of 15 min the discharge and weather data were all measured from 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2019 covering three complete hydrological years for isotopes precipitation the catchment outlet and the two hillslope spring flows were sampled daily using an autosampler during the same period as hydrometeorological observation all water samples were collected in 5 ml glass vials the stable isotope ratios of δd and δ18o were measure using a mat 253 laser isotope analyser which were reported in the δ notation using the vienna standard mean ocean water standards the instruments precision is 0 5 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o dynamics in precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet using penman monteith equation discharge and isotope signature for these three observation points are shown in fig 2 and the statistical characteristics summarised in table 1 during the study all discharge measurements at the catchment outlet and spring s5 and spring s7 show obvious seasonal variation table 1 in particular the response of flow to precipitation in all three systems is sharp during wet seasons due to the activation of fast flow paths in the karst critical zone fig 2 discharge at the catchment outlet with mean value of 6 1 10 3 m3 s is much higher than at s5 and s7 with mean values of 12 10 5 and 4 2 10 5 m3 s respectively the flow at the outlet also had the highest coefficient of variation cv of discharge 2 48 over the study period indicating that the temporal variability of outflow from the catchment system was more marked than that of hillslope spring system the δd ratios showed a gradual enrichment during the dry season and pronounced variability during wet season for the three karst groundwater systems compared with discharge the δd ratios in the outflow at s7 tend to show a more dramatic seasonality than at the outlet and s5 with absolute cv of 0 1 the local meteoric water line lmwl for the catchment with r2 0 97 is derived from the regression of δ18o and δd values in daily precipitation sampled from august 2016 to july 2019 although the points for all three systems are scattered in the dual isotope space the slopes of evaporation line for these three systems coloured lines are lower than that of lmwl this indicates evaporative fractionation signals in the outflows of the three groundwater systems and is consistent with other observations in karst catchments e g hu et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the dual isotope plots for catchment outlet s5 and s7 are shown in fig 3 which indicates that both δ18o and δd in outflow are more enriched at the catchment outlet than at s5 and s7 although the soil layer on the steeper hillslopes is typically very thin in karst catchments there are clear fractionated isotopic signals in the hillslope spring flow at certain times e g 2 to 7 august 2016 for s7 this seems to differ from some non karst catchments where evaporative fractionation can result in isotopically enriched water in the topsoil in summer but affected by winter precipitation and damping along flow paths result in unfractionated isotopic signals in the groundwater and stream flow sprenger et al 2016 sprenger et al 2018 however at chenqi where rainfall is also concentrated in the summer it can be inferred that the fractionated soil water from the thin hillslopes can be rapidly displaced in high intensity rainfall and recharge groundwater 2 3 the storage selection approach according to the storage selection approach the age ranked storage st representing the cumulative volumes of water in storage as ranked by their age t is applied to estimate the contributions of different components of ranked storage to outflows or evapotranspiration the governing equation for st from considering the fluxes of water in and out of different ages and by considering the aging of water remaining in the control volume can be expressed as harman 2015 benettin et al 2017 1 s t t t t s t t t t j t q t ω q s t t t t e t t ω et s t t t

be taken as representative of a general catchment behavior benettin and bertuzzo 2018 in karst catchments the discharge is sensitive to precipitation due to the high permeability of aquifer some high discharge events could occur after precipitation in the dry season when the catchment storage is low fig 2 hence in this study the discharge variations were normalized to serve as a nondimensional metric of catchment wetness 5 w t q t q min q max q min where qmin and qmax represent the maximum and minimum discharge for evapotranspiration the parameter of ket is fixed which gives a fixed sas function similar to water age the distributions of tracer concentrations in discharge and evapotranspiration cq and cet can be estimated using the selection process consequently the stream and

replaced by an isotope ratio δ ala aho et al 2017 kuppel et al 2018 kirchner 2019 benettin et al 2019 the evaporative fractionation effects on water isotope composition in karst catchments are in fig 3 and have been reported in previous studies hu et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 consequently it is likely to be important that evaporative fractionation effects need to be incorporated in isotopes based modelling for sub tropical karst landscapes although there is still a debate over whether transpiration affects the fractionation many isotope tests of plant water have provided the evaporative fractionation caused by transpiration farquhar et al 2007 vargas et al 2017 chen et al 2020 therefore the effect of evaporative fractionation on the isotope signal in storage is considered to be linked to evapotranspiration in this study this method has been successfully used to model the evaporative fractionation in this study catchment zhang et al 2019 as well as in bruntland burn catchment in scotland benettin et al 2017 following the approach by queloz et al 2015 with the relations of t t t0 an ordinary differential equation of the isotope composition in each age ranked storage volume can be obtained 10 d δ s t t t 0 dt f e t t t 0 ω e t s t t t 0 δ s t t t 0 where f is fractionation coefficient 2 4 modelling procedures in a karst catchment the drainage area of the hydrological system is usually unknown or imprecise due to inconsistencies between the topographically defined catchment boundary with the underground boundary liu et al 2020 therefore in this study the actual drainage area area for each system was obtained by adjusting the surface drainage area areas using a parameter α area α areas and then the discharge with the unit of mm d q t in eq 1 was calculated using the actual drainage area this method is similar to the effective catchment by liu et al 2020 actual daily evapotranspiration et t in each system was estimated by e t t β p e t t and the fitting parameter β was obtained according to mass balance of water over the entire study period hence the model includes a total of six calibrated parameters k1 k2 ket s0 f and α and the initial range for each of the parameters is shown in table 2 the dynamics of isotope composition were estimated using the sas approach for the three groundwater systems and then the variations in mean travel times and the travel time distributions of outflows at catchment outlet and the s5 and s7 springs were modelled with respective calibrated model parameters model calibration was performed on daily time steps from 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2018 a total of 730 steps for each groundwater system and the model performance was checked against a one year validation period also on daily time steps from 1 august 2018 to 31 july 2019 a spin up period of 2 years based on looping the hydrologic and isotope data from the calibration period was used to establish initial conditions of storages isotope ratios and water ages limited samples of the isotope composition of rainfall during the study period were missing due to the too little rainfall amount or instrument failure if there was isotope data in the adjacent the day before and the day after precipitation time series it was used to fill in the missing data when data were available both the day before and the day after their mean was used otherwise the mean value 60 4 for δd over the study period was used to in the missing data in this study model parameter space and uncertainty were explored using a monte carlo approach to simulations the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criterion was used to formulate calibration objective applied to the time series of δd signatures in outflows at each observation point the coefficient of determination r2 between the observed and simulated isotope ratios as well as nse is used to evaluate the success of the calibration the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue procedure beven and binley 1992 beven 2012 is usually used in parameter calibration and uncertainty evaluation to avoid that behavioral model structures were excluded due to a high threshold specified a variant of glue birkel and soulsby 2015 xie et al 2018 was used in this study a total of 100 000 parameter combinations were randomly generated from the initial ranges for each karst groundwater system only the 200 best parameter sets with the highest values of nse from the 100 000 tested parameter combinations were retained to enable the calibration scheme to explore the global variable domain the initial range of each parameter value was set to be large table 2 for example the initial ranges of ket and f were set to 0 05 10 and 0 0 1 respectively much larger than that of 0 2 3 and 0 0 05 used by benettin et al 2017 and the initial ranges for both k1 and k2 were set to 0 05 10 enabling a large initial range of kq the upper limit of s0 for each site was determined by the corresponding maximum aquifer depth surveyed in system multiplied by a high porosity of 20 for the hillslopes and 30 for the catchment system much higher than the measured value of 6 9 in this catchment by zhang et al 2014 the initial ranges of the adjustment coefficient α for the catchment s5 and s7 were set to 0 15 1 5 0 03 0 3 and 0 06 0 6 respectively which caused a runoff coefficient of 0 1 1 for the three systems a range of 0 44 to 0 69 for runoff coefficient for karst catchment in this area has been suggested by zhang et al 2014 according to estimations in 23 karst catchments in southwest china the simulation bounds representing posterior parameter uncertainty were also determined from the 200 best parameter sets this method has been used in previous isotope tracer studies birkel and soulsby 2015 soulsby et al 2015 the dynamics of water ages in outflow and how it is affected by karst subsurface architectures were assessed based on the model results with the 200 best calibrated parameter sets 3 results 3 1 simulated isotopes in outflow of the three groundwater systems fig 4 shows the daily deuterium ratios in outflows at the catchment outlet s5 and s7 simulated using the sas approach with the calibrated parameter sets the results show that the temporal variations in δd signals of the system outflows at these three observation points are generally captured in the calibration period and are reproduced in the validation period by the model with the same calibrated parameter sets for the calibration period across the 200 best parameter sets shown in table 2 the maximum mean and minimum objective function values of nse were 0 66 0 60 and 0 57 respectively for catchment outlet and 0 78 0 67 and 0 63 for the s5 system and 0 65 0 58 and 0 55 for s7 system the mean r2 was 0 66 0 76 and 0 68 for catchment s5 and s7 respectively over the calibrations period the main variations of δd in outflows at the three observations points are also generally reproduced for the validation period with mean nse of 0 5 0 55 and 0 5 for catchment outlet s5 and s7 respectively the mean r2 was 0 56 0 63 and 0 5 for catchment s5 and s7 respectively over the validation period however there are some outliers of the δd variations were not captured by the corresponding model for example some especially enriched values at catchment outlet e g june 2018 are shown to be out with the simulation range in fig 4 the most likely explanation for this is that the fractionated water is occasionally displaced from the flooded paddy fields during rainfall events and enters the underground conduit the paddy water was sampled for two times during rice growing season of june and july 2018 with the mean δd value of 35 8 more enriched than that of outflow there were also some depletion isotope signals that were not captured for the three systems especially at the start of the validation e g end of june to july 2018 in addition to the errors in the model calculation e g water balance errors caused by evapotranspiration estimations as mentioned another likely explanation for this is that averaging precipitation inputs to daily timesteps underestimates high intensity sub daily inputs of more depleted water which breakthrough into the stream for example the δd values of rain water as model input were 25 1 and 51 5 at 22nd and 23th june 2018 with the corresponding daily rain amounts of 47 4 and 30 8 mm respectively however these two rainfall events lasted 8 and 6 h respectively and the hourly rainfall peak for each event were not at the corresponding sampling hour such mis timings with daily averaging of samples also likely led to disinformative inputs at other times during intensive rainfall periods e g june and july in 2017 and 2018 shown in fig 4 the probability density of each parameter was estimated based on normal kernel functions for the 200 best model parameter sets for the three systems fig 5 the results showed that the distributions of the six model parameters varied substantially for the three systems the distribution ranges of k1 for all the three systems are relatively large from 0 01 to 3 however the mean value of k2 for the catchment outlet between 1 14 and 1 54 was notably higher than both s5 between 0 71 and 1 47 and s7 between 0 54 and 1 2 systems it can be inferred that the catchment system has a generally higher preference parameter for discharge kq than s5 and s7 systems under same wetness condition from eq 4 which may result in a stronger preference for releasing water from older storage components than the s5 and s7 springs the preference parameter for evapotranspiration ket has a wider distribution for s5 and s7 0 14 to 0 86 than for the catchment from 0 27 to 0 63 the initial storage parameter s0 for the catchment 340 556 mm is much higher than that for s5 66 138 mm and s7 83 118 mm systems which would be consistent with the ground penetrating radar gpr survey in the catchment defining the epikarst thickness as 6 1 12 6 m and 15 20 m for the hillslope and depression respectively zhang et al 2013 this is also consistent with previous findings that soil and small fractures in the depression are the main storage zones in the catchment zhang et al 2019 the catchment system also has the narrowest distribution of the fractionation coefficient f and the mean f of the 200 best parameter sets 0 5 10 3 is significantly lower than that of s5 2 5 10 3 and s7 15 10 3 systems the distribution of the adjustment coefficient for injected water α for the catchment system varies from 0 72 to 1 02 indicating the catchment water balance is not closed and it is likely that some rainfall leaves the catchment unmeasured via fractures or conduits in contrast the narrow distributions of α for s5 and s7 with values less than 0 3 indicate that only a small fraction of rainfall actually are drained through the hillslope springs in this study the actual daily evapotranspiration in eq 1 was calculated by multiplying the potential evapotranspiration by a fitting parameter which was obtained from water balance of water over the entire study period for each system this may lead to inaccurate storage at daily scale using the mass balance harman 2015 although the study catchment is in a wet region with mean annual precipitation of 1140 mm to assess the accuracy of this method the calculated evapotranspiration was compared to a time series of actual daily evapotranspiration measured over the period from 1 january 2017 to 31 december 2017 at the nearby puding karst ecosystem research station by y wang et al 2020a using a flux tower figure s1 the results show that the calculated evapotranspiration was generally consistent with the observed values over this period additionally the observed evapotranspiration was directly used in the estimation of water balance eq 1 for tracking the tracer dynamics in outflows at the catchment outlet based on the calibrated parameter set for the best simulation the estimated deuterium ratios in flow over the period 1 january 2017 to 31 december 2017 were close to that using the original evapotranspiration estimates shown in figure s2 with the nse of 0 60 and 0 54 for the set of calculated and observed actual evapotranspiration respectively the time invariant adjusting coefficient for drainage area α was used to consider the inconsistency of the topographic boundary with the underground catchment boundary however the underground boundary may change over time due to the variability in hydrological connectivity within the aquifer changing with storage chen et al 2018 potentially using a time invariant α leads more or less inaccurate water balance calculation at the daily scale especially in the karst hillslope system with no marked topographical change in the larger catchment no large fractures or conduits are found at the boundary according to geophysical surveys undertaken which means any water fluxes into or out of each hydrogeological system likely mainly occur through slow flow paths therefore the results of water balance calculation in this study appear reasonable for each system 3 2 variations in the sas functions and selection preference parameters based on the calibrated model parameters the time variant power law sas functions ω q s t t and ω e t s t t for catchment s5 and s7 systems were estimated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively the calculated ω q s t t and ω e t s t t vs normalized age ranked storage over the study period for the whole catchment s5 and s7 systems are shown in fig 6 blue and purple lines represent wet and dry season respectively most lines of sas function for discharge especially in hillslope are convex pattern for all the three systems during wet season indicating the preference for younger water releasing in contrast some sas function lines of discharge at s5 and most at catchment outlet are concave pattern during dry season purple lines showing the preference for older water releasing the sas function lines of evapotranspiration for all the three systems based on the corresponding calibrated parameter of ket are above the random sampling line fig 6 which indicates the preference for younger water releasing to evapotranspiration in karst groundwater systems the temporal dynamics in the preference parameter for discharge kq for the three systems are shown in fig 7 the results showed the marked seasonal variability due to the changes in wetness over the study period the mean kq values were 1 15 0 99 and 0 7 for the whole catchment s5 and s7 respectively for the wet season june to october the mean values of kq were 1 11 and 0 96 and for the dry season november to may that were 1 2 and 1 03 for the catchment and s5 respectively this indicated that the catchment system exhibits a stronger preference for older water releasing to discharge than that in the s5 system in comparison kq was less than 1 for s7 for both wet and dry season fig 7 indicating the strongest preference for younger water releasing to discharge in the system at the top of hillslope it is worth noting that the value of kq varied sharply around 1 after heavy rainfall especially during the early wet season both for the whole catchment and hillslope e g s5 this emphasises the dramatic temporal changes in the system preference for releasing younger or older water to discharge although the estimated sas functions for evapotranspiration are more uncertain due to the poorer constraint of evapotranspiration ages derived from isotopic composition of drainage water it can provide a first approximation of the selection preference of each system for evapotranspiration asadollahi et al 2020 all calibrated values of ket are less than 1 for the three systems table 2 which suggests that the karst system in this area preferentially release younger water to evapotranspiration 3 3 dynamics of water age and storage in the three systems simulated dynamics of daily dynamics in storage and median age in outflow over study period are shown in fig 8 the mean storages were 428 96 and 67 mm from the 200 best simulations for the catchment and s5 and s7 systems respectively which are higher than mean active storages of catchment and hillslope unit with 270 and 23 mm respectively derived from the tracer aided model zhang et al 2019 this could be explained by greater passive storage in depressions where oldest water is likely to be stored which were not considered in the tracer aided model while it is considered in the simulated storages using the sas approach in this study as a representative metric of stream age median age can avoid determining the exact age of each ranked storage element which can be exceeded from the age distribution calculated by the model at any time step harman 2015 benettin et al 2017 benettin and bertuzzo 2018 wilusz et al 2020 in this study we used the median age median travel time to assess the dynamics of system outflow ages and its responses to the changes of hydrologic state in the three groundwater systems the mean modelled median age in catchment outflow was 231 days over the study period which is a similar magnitude to mean age of catchment outflow of 326 days calculated by the tracer aided model zhang et al 2019 although the study periods of these two cases are not exactly the same 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2019 vs 1 november 2016 to 31 october 2017 and at the two hillslope spring systems s5 and s7 the mean median ages of outflow were 192 and 177 days respectively which are also consistent with the mean age in a conceptual hillslope unit outflow with 137 days calculated by the tracer aided model seasonal variations in the median age in outflow were apparent in the three systems from 300 days in the dry season to a few days after heavy rainfall in the wet season fig 8 it is obvious that the seasonal variation in median ages in the outflow of the three systems are generally similar even though they have contrasting storage magnitudes however there are some significant differences in temporal variability of flux age for the three systems at high time resolution for example there are some sharp variations in median age in s7 outflow during the dry season while they rise gradually at the catchment and s5 over the same periods fig 8 further the patterns of variations in the median age for the three systems are also markedly different at the beginning of the wet season according to the higher temporal resolution plots the right column in fig 8 the explanation of these will be discussed below to assess the variability in age distribution in outflow under different hydroclimatic conditions six times in the study period were chosen see fig 8 t1 t3 4 5 and 6 may 2017 t4 t6 14 15 and 17 june 2017 respectively for estimating the cumulative distribution function cdf of flux age at the three observation points the first three adjacent days of t1 to t3 were in dry season and the other three t3 to t4 were in wet season in fig 9 on 4 and 6 may 2017 there was no rain and the daily rainfall amount was 20 3 mm on 5 may 2017 for another three days in wet season there was 29 6 mm rainfall amount on 15 june 2017 and no rain on 14 and 17 june 2017 the cdfs of flux age extracted on the six selected days are shown in fig 9 the results show that the outflows at the three systems have higher proportion of younger water under the wet condition than that under the dry condition for example water younger than 69 days young water defined by kirchner 2016 accounted for about 39 62 in outflow for the three systems on 14 15 and 17 june 2017 but only 10 41 on 4 to 6 may 2017 it is worth noting that from 4 to 5 may 2017 the proportion of young water in outflow rose significantly after the rain 20 3 mm in the dry season in s7 and which returns to the initial state quickly after the proportion rise while the proportion of young water in outflow was almost unchanged for both catchment outlet and s5 in contrast from 14 to 15 june 2017 at the beginning of the wet season the proportion of young water in outflow rose quickly when it rains for all the catchment s5 and s7 however from 15 to 17 the proportion of young water in outflow declined quickly after the rain in both the catchment and s5 while it was almost unchanged in s7 fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 availability and potential limitation of discharge dependent method of sas function for karst groundwater system in karst catchment some high discharge can exist after precipitation in the dry season when the catchment storage is low fig 2 meaning the same storage volume can correspond to different flow path arrangements this can be explained that the fast flow paths e g large fractures or conduits are activated although the catchment storage is low it suggests that thin soil cover even bare fractures rather than the variations in groundwater level dominate the hydrological connection of fast drainage networks in karst critical zone in this study the discharge variations were normalized to serve as a nondimensional metric of catchment wetness equation 5 which determines the time variation sas function discharge dependent sas function however the simulated flow paths could be different at the same discharge when the storage is different like the temporal variations in sas function for the three systems shown in fig 6 due to the hysteresis in the storage discharge relationship e g caused by the evapotranspiration calculation method in this study especially when the fast flow paths were not adequately activated during dry or small rainfall period as a result the potentially inaccurate storage calculated by the mass balance method in this study e g the evapotranspiration calculation may lead the uncertainties of flow path estimation age selection hence the storage discharge relationship at the catchment scale for karst system need to be further investigated such as the catchment sensitivity function e g harman 2015 or specific storage discharge relations e g van der velde et al 2015 4 2 effect of flow paths on flux age distributions in contrasting karst groundwater systems notwithstanding uncertainties involved in the water age simulation due to some degree of hysteresis of storage discharge discussed above the results of age flux age distribution can provide useful insights for the characterization of the flow paths under different wetness condition in karst catchment spatio temporal variations in the modelled flux ages in this study can provide a reasonable basis for conceptualising selective preference for releasing water to flow and evapotranspiration relating to flow paths actions under different critical zone architecture conditions in heterogenous karst groundwater systems fig 10 it can be inferred that the markedly low ages in outflows in the wet season fig 8 is released to the enhanced activation of large fractures or conduits in both the hillslopes and depressions units in the wet season this is similar to the role of shallow subsurface flow paths in the more permeable upper layer of hillslopes in non karst catchments which are dominated by younger waters under wet condition rodhe et al 1996 furthermore the high proportion of hillslope in the cockpit karst landscapes area with areas of 0 88 and 0 37 km2 for the hillslopes and depression in chenqi and the strong hydrological connectivity between hillslope and depression zhang et al 2019 can explain the similar variations in age in outflow for the hillslope and whole catchment at season scale the dynamics of median flux age and storage over the period from 5 june to 15 july 2016 beginning of the wet season for the whole catchment s5 and s7 the right column in fig 8 show that as the catchment becomes wetter due to ongoing rainfall median age in the catchment outflow exhibits a dramatic change of high low high while that for s7 declines sharply and then maintains a low level high low low this indicates the significant difference in age distributions for the three systems during this period in the heavy rainfall events part of the rainfall infiltration in the depression recharges to underground conduit via large fractures or sinkholes and flows out the catchment in a short time leading the sharp decline in age in the catchment outflow e g the median age in outflow at catchment outlet could decrease from 300 days to a few days in one rainfall event shown in fig 8 due to the low storage capacity large fractures account for around 8 of the volume in the karst critical zone by zhang et al 2013 younger water in large fractures and conduits in depression would quickly be replaced by older water from soil or matrix squeezd by the rain water and hillslope flow this can explain the high low high pattern of age in outflow for the whole catchment and it is consistent with the age distributions in outflow at outlet shown in fig 9 also this inference is supported by the sharp variations in sas functions and the preference parameter for flow kq in catchment after heavy rain at beginning of the wet season figs 6 and 7 compared to the depression the hillslope especially on the top of hillslope like s7 has markedly thin soil and epikarst resulting in only relatively small precipitation inputs being needed to activate the fast flow paths this can explain the higher variation in the isotope signatures in hillslope system cv of δd in table 1 and the significant increase in the proportion of younger water in outflow at s7 after rainfall in dry season also the continuous high proportion of younger water resulting in the high low low pattern fig 8 in heavy rainfall events at the start of the wet season is related to the low storage capacity in hillslope due to the thin soil and epikarst another noteworthy phenomenon is that the weak negative correlation between system storage and median age in outflow for all three systems shown in fig 8 can be linked to the inverse storage effect which is supported by the results reported by zhang et al 2020 this is consistent with the findings by husic et al 2020 that the epikarst flow contribution to outflow will increase during medium to high events it also can be inferred that the inverse storage effect and a very transient direct storage effect where higher storage results in a greater bias toward older water by harman 2015 appear alternately after heavy rainfall at the beginning of wet season for the catchment system corresponding to the rapid variations in the flux age at the start of the wet season at the catchment outlet fig 8 affected by the activation of fast flow paths especially in the hillslope system e g s7 the direct storage effect sometimes occurs in dry season when the younger water tends to be released with low catchment storage in karst area fig 8 this is also found in other studies in karst catchment husic et al 2020 in the depression of cockpit karst areas in southwest china crops e g rice paddy and oilseed rape in this catchment mainly abstract the water in shallow soil layer due to the short roots fan et al 2016 which suggests the preference for releasing younger water to evapotranspiration on the hillslope in karst areas the forest and shrub roots usually extend into the fractured rock aquifers resulting in the abstraction of water from both shallow soil and fractured rock aquifers rong et al 2011 therefore the preference for releasing younger water to evapotranspiration for hillslope system fig 7 is consistence to that the residence time of water in large fractures in hillslope where the roots extend is low to clarify the preference of each system to release water of different ages to evapotranspiration more accurate representation of the rooting zone in a more process based model using soil isotopes would better constrain the ages of evapotranspiration under different vegetation e g smith et al 2020b in karst catchments 4 3 linking karst critical zone structure to dynamics of discharge selection preference understanding the shifts of discharge selection preference in karst system requires a closer look at the critical zone structure affecting the streamflow generation mechanisms in karst aquifer the fracture aperture and porosity usually decrease with the increase of depth from the ground surface ford and williams 2007 zhang et al 2013 therefore the hydrological connectivity of the relatively large fractures in the upper part of epikart will be enhanced when water table rises under wet condition zhang et al 2019 as a result the probability of the younger water being selected for discharge increases this is supported by the sas function distributions for the three systems fig 6 although discharge is mainly fed by the water stored in the small fractures in both hillslope and whole catchment during dry period zhang et al 2017 their preferences for younger or older water releasing may differ fig 6 due to the notable difference in critical zone structure between hillslope and depression in the flat depression with thick soil and epikarst the conduits usually extend near the base of epikarst cheng et al 2019 hence the vertical piston flow could result in the relatively high contribution of the water stored in the deeper small fractures to discharge under dry condition as a result the whole catchment shows a generally preference for older water releasing to discharge in contrast due to the thin soil and epikarst and steeper topography in hillslope system the water stored in the shallower fractures with higher hydraulic conductivity is easier to be delivered to outlet along the hillslope than that in the deeper small fractures therefore the hillslope system usually shows a preference for younger water releasing to discharge especially for the upper hillslope system e g s7 affected by the bare large fractures and sinkholes in the depression rain water can recharge to the underground flow in a short time which will convert the discharge selection preference from for older water to for younger water in the whole catchment after rainfall during dry season consistent with the sas function distributions in catchment outlet shown in fig 6 5 conclusions we explored the age distributions in outflow and flow paths in three karst groundwater systems with different critical zone architectures using the storage selection approach the discharge dependent sas functions were used to simulated the transport in this study model results show that the dynamics of daily isotope in outflow can be well reproduced for the typical karst catchment of chenqi and two karst hillslope spring systems within in the seasonal variations in the flux ages of the three karst groundwater systems are similar which indicates the strong hydrological connectivity between hillslope and depression in this catchment the modelled results show the continuous decline of flux age and oscillations between high and low flux age for hillslope system and whole catchment respectively this is likely related to the distributions of soil and epikarst in hillslope and depression resulting in the variations in flow paths under different wetness conditions the sas function distributions show that the preference of releasing younger water to discharge in hillslope system both in wet and dry season while the discharge selection preferences generally shift from for younger water in wet season to for older water in dry season in the whole catchment this is likely related to the critical zone structures of hillslope and depression leading the different streamflow generation mechanisms within the two landform units in the study area younger water in both hillslope system and whole catchment is abstracted for evapotranspiration more than older water whilst the dynamics of flow paths and associated flow age distributions in karst groundwater system need further assessment at different scales this study is an encouraging step forward in the exploration of hydrological function of karst catchment credit authorship contribution statement zhicai zhang

4234,throughfall in a forest ecosystem has potential hydrological impacts in the semi arid loess region of china due to continuous human intervention however in black locust forests in this region throughfall and its spatial heterogeneity and controlling factors remain unclear we examined throughfall its spatial variability and the effects of rainfall characteristics and vegetation structure on throughfall in a black locust stand experiment of the 489 72 mm cumulative gross rainfall during 20 sampled events the average of throughfall for all trees interception loss il and stemflow sf were 380 93 mm 77 71 98 48 mm 20 19 and 10 30 mm 2 10 respectively for a single tree measured throughfall percentage decreased from upper to bottom in the canopy vertical layer and the horizontal distribution increased with distance from the trunk a correlation analysis between throughfall and rainfall characteristics indicated that rainfall amount had a greater effect on throughfall than rainfall intensity and duration throughfall generally occurred following rainfall events of more than 0 76 mm for black locust throughfall percentage initially increased weakly and then decreased with increasing rainfall intensity while it initially increased and then remained constant with increasing rainfall duration throughfall percentage decreased with increasing leaf area index lai during differently sized rainfall events whereas throughfall variations were different in differently sized rainfall events throughfall is affected by tree height diameter at breast height dbh canopy width and canopy openness to some degree while the effects were higher in larger storms than in smaller storms our study highlights the need to consider the effects of throughfall on hydrological processes

provide to society brauman et al 2010 pan et al 2011 as the main moisture input to forests rainfall can be partitioned into vegetation canopy interception loss il throughfall and stemflow sf zhang et al 2015 il is the part of incident rainfall that is intercepted stored and subsequently evaporated from forest leaves branches and stems during and after rainfall events shi et al 2010 the remaining net rainfall reaches the soil surface by throughfall and sf throughfall is the rainfall fraction that reaches the ground directly through canopy gaps free throughfall or indirectly through leaf and branch drip canopy throughfall magliano et al 2019a sf is the rainfall fraction that reaches the base of trees via their trunks or stems levia and germer 2015 therefore the vertical and horizontal spatial distribution of rainfall is transformed via il throughfall and sf which obviously affect the ecology and hydrology of arid semi arid areas jian et al 2019 throughfall is a primary component of the hydrological and ecological processes in forest ecosystems and its spatial patterns have an important influence on soil processes watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry keim et al 2005 staelens et al 2006 related studies shown that throughfall spatial variability has important effects on spatially distributed processes in forest soils such as trace gas fluxes ion loading and solute leaching hansen 1996 as well as implications for sampling strategies and interpretation of throughfall data in terms of water and ionic inputs whelan and anderson 1996 specifically spatial variations in throughfall volume influence soil moisture patterns and fine root distribution in forest soil ford and deans 1978 schume et al 2003 forest floor vegetation composition such as lichens and mosses carleton and kavanagh 1990 soil moisture infiltration and surface runoff generation nanko et al 2011 and water and nutrient cycling chang and egbert 2000 throughfall in forest ecosystems is a complex process affected by morphological attributes such as plant density leaf area index canopy cover and canopy storage capacity and meteorological conditions including rainfall characteristics wind and evaporation rate ma et al 2019 magliano et al 2019a staelens et al 2008 for example leaf size and canopy vertical layering clearly influence throughfall drop size and terminal velocity calder 2001 nanko et al 2006 tree density branch angle crown height uniformity or lack of it the nature and thickness of the bark layer leaf shape and inclination and leaf area index also influence throughfall crockford and richardson 2000 vegetation canopy throughfall has been investigated in different vegetation types including coniferous forests shi et al 2010 deciduous forest mużyło et al 2012 semiarid afforestation areas sadeghi et al 2016 shrublands jian et al 2019 and crops nazari et al 2020 a review of rainfall partitioning in drylands delimited by a rainfall potential evapotranspiration ratio 0

2007 the loess plateau of china has become a region with severe soil erosion due to steep slopes frequent heavy rainfall in rainy seasons june september and anthropogenic activities gao et al 2016 yu et al 2014 zhao et al 2013 to control severe soil erosion and improve ecosystem services on the loess plateau afforestation measures were implemented in the 1950s jia et al 2017 and vegetation cover

change the ecological environment surface runoff and soil moisture dynamics wang et al 2015 xu et al 2018a zhao et al 2015 black locust robinia pseudoacacia is a major reforestation species in the loess plateau due to its high drought infertility and low high temperature tolerance as well as faster growth than some native tree species vitkova et al 2017 wang et al 2010a black locust plantations provide a wide range of ecological and socio economic functions in this region zhou et al 2014 such as soil water retention wang et al 2010a soil respiration regulation xue et al 2007 and soil chemical and microbiological improvements wang et al 2011 at a macro scale black locust plantations can significantly impact hydrology processes however their throughfall characteristics and spatial heterogeneity are less clear on the loess plateau which hinders an understanding of hydrological processes in this region large plantations have increased soil water consumption and therefore to alleviate soil drought a greater understanding of hydrological characteristics in black locust plantings is necessary this is the first study to characterize throughfall in different canopy locations for a single tree and to further analyze the effects of rainfall characteristics and tree attributes on throughfall in this region our overall aims therefore are to 1 quantify throughfall il and sf rainfall partitioning for black locust forest in the semi arid loess region of china 2 compare throughfall spatial characteristics in different single tree locations and 3 examine the effect of rainfall characteristics and tree attributes on throughfall our results should provide a reference for black locust forest management from the perspective of water management in semi arid loess regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our study in the semi arid loess region of china was conducted in black locust robinia pseudoacacia plantations in zhifanggou watershed 109 13 03 109 16 46 e 36 46 28 36 46 42 n from august 2018 to october 2019 zhifanggou watershed is a typical catchment located in a hilly gullied loess landscape with a drainage area of 8 7 km2 slope ranging from 0 to 65 and altitude ranging from 1010 to 1431 m qiu et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 the watershed is located in the warm temperate semi arid climate zone where the total annual sunshine is 2415 6 h and annual average temperature is 8 8 c average annual precipitation is 543 mm 70 of which occurs between june and september due to the monsoon climate luo et al 2019 and annual evaporation ranges from 1010 to 1400 mm zhao et al 2017 the study area soil type is huangmian soil which is comprised of sand 21 6 silt 63 3 and clay 16 4 respectively ye et al 2018 the chinese government implemented the grain for green program on the loess plateau in 1999 and the watershed ecosystems gradually began to recover by 2005 the watershed ecosystems reached a relatively stable state with forest and grassland cover of more than 80 xu et al 2018b the vegetation types in this watershed are typical for the western loess plateau where forests are dominated by black locust robinia pseudoacacia zhao et al 2016 2 2 field experimental arrangement in zhifanggou watershed an area 20 m 30 m 600 m2 of typical black locust forest was selected for this study the stand was located on a 30 slope with a northwest exposure and an elevation of 1251 m according to the field survey average tree height was 9 60 m and ranged from 5 00 m to 15 00 m the range of canopy height canopy diameter and diameter at the breast dbh was 2 5 9 0 m 2 0 5 0 m and 6 00 23 00 cm respectively according to black locust distribution canopy structure and tree architecture in the sample area nine robust and healthy trees were selected as experimental trees tree height canopy height canopy diameter and dbh of the nine experimental trees were in the range of those found at the field site and therefore typical and representative the morphological and structural features of the 9 individual trees were characterized table 1 in this study tree height was measured with a tree height meter that could freely extend and contract to a maximum of 20 m canopy diameter was measured according to canopy shape whereby a point on the canopy edge was determined by vertical projection to the ground and a similar point opposite to it and directly through the center of the trunk also determined the distance between the two points was measured the process repeated three times and the average of the 3 measurements taken as canopy diameter trunk dbh was measured 1 3 m above the ground a canopy photograph was taken with an unmanned aerial vehicle directly above each throughfall collector the image was loaded into the gap light analyzer software and then the results were exported by sidelook software where the threshold value was determined and finally lai was calculated in the gap light analyzer software according to the determined threshold value to measure throughfall vertical distribution the canopy was divided into three layers according to tree canopy height upper middle and below canopy fig 1 a and rainfall collectors were placed in each layer to measure throughfall horizontal distribution 7 throughfall collectors were located in each layer one at the center of the tree trunk and the remaining six in three directions 0 120 and 240 and equidistant from the tree trunk to crown periphery fig 1b the three directions were mutually staggered in each layer to avoid the influence of the upper layer on the lower layer in the process of throughfall collection in this study we assumed that meteorological factors were consistent at different observation locations the collectors were 20 cm in diameter and 20 cm high and collected throughfall passed through a plastic pipe connected to a measuring device above the ground stemflow sf was sampled using white halved rubber hose 5 mm thick which was spirally wrapped around the tree trunk and vaseline used to create a water tight environment between the stem and the hose dong et al 2020 the lower side of the hose was connected to a 25 l plastic bucket and after each rainfall event water volume in the bucket was measured 2 3 field measurements gross rainfall gr throughfall and sf were measured from 22 august 2018 to 5 october 2019 gr was measured by an automated meteorological station a resolution of 0 2 mm installed on an open hillside 50 m from the plot rainfall indicators were measured using a hobo u30 nrc monitor u s a with a rainfall measurement interval of 30 min an intermittence longer than 2 h between rainfall events was used to define individual rainfall events chen et al 2009 li et al 2016 yu et al 2007 throughfall and sf was measured after each rainfall event and rain gauges then emptied throughfall depth of each rainfall collector tfi was calculated as 1 tf i tf v ca where tf i is throughfall depth of each rainfall collector mm tf v is throughfall volume of each rainfall collector mm3 and ca is the area of each rainfall collector mm2 throughfall of each canopy layer is the average throughfall of each rainfall collector in this canopy layer throughfall for all trees is the average of throughfall of each rainfall collector in the below canopy layer sf depth was calculated as 2 sf 1 n i 1 n sf i fa i where sf is average sf of per unit area mm n is the number of observed trees n 9 sf i is the ith tree sf mm3 and fa i is the canopy project area of ith tree mm2 interception loss il mm was calculated as 3 il p t f s f where il is canopy interception loss mm p is gross rainfall amount mm tf is throughfall of each tree mm and sf is stemflow mm 2 4 statistical analysis descriptive statistics were used to analyze rainfall characteristics rainfall amount duration and intensity and trees morphological characteristics statistical analysis was carried out using spss v 17 0 ibm company and microsoft excel 2016 microsoft redmond usa software duncan s multiple range tests with a p 0 05 significance level were conducted to identify significant differences in spatial location for each tree 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics a total of 604 4 mm of rainfall occurred during this period which was unevenly distributed through time fig 2 rainfall was concentrated mainly in august to october of 2018 and june to october of 2019 equivalent to 189 2 mm 31 3 and 386 4 mm 63 9 of rainfall respectively during this experimental period grey rectangles in fig 2a from 22 august to 18 october 2018 and from 7 may to 5 october 2019 58 rainfall events occurred totaling 503 8 mm of rainfall the average rainfall for individual rainfall events was 6 5 mm with a range of 0 2 53 6 mm average rainfall duration was 4 57 h with a range of 0 5 29 h average rainfall intensity was 1 39 mm h with a range of 0 4 12 mm h generally low intensity rainfall events were the most frequent and contributed a lower percentage of total rainfall than larger rainfall events fig 3 a for example individual rainfall events 2 mm occurred 41 times with total rainfall of 28 2 mm accounting for 47 13 of total rainfall events but only 4 67 of total rainfall amount individual rainfall events 20 mm was much less frequent 8 05 of total rainfall events but provided 41 83 of total rainfall short duration 6 h rainfall events mainly occurred in this period accounting for 75 86 of total rainfall events while long duration 6 h rainfall events contributed a greater portion to total rainfall 71 64 fig 3b lower intensity rainfall events were much more frequent than higher intensity rainfall events while the sum of rainfall events with 5 mm h accounted for 95 40 of total rainfall events and 95 43 of total rainfall amount fig 3c 3 2 rainfall partitioning rainfall partitioning was calculated using the averages of below canopy throughfall data during the study period 20 effective rainfall events effective rainfall events are those that can produce throughfall and stemflow which were effectively collected were recorded 490 2 mm for 20 rainfall events event size was mainly concentrated from 10 to 15 mm accounting for 31 43 of total rainfall events fig 4 a rainfall duration and intensity were mainly focused on 6 12 h and 0 2 5 mm h accounting for 42 86 and 80 00 of total rainfall events respectively fig 4b and c mean rainfall amount for recorded rainfall events was 24 51 mm with a range of 4 30 55 94 mm rainfall intensity ranged from 0 34 to 7 43 mm h with a mean of 2 11 mm h only 2 of 20 recorded rainfall events had rainfall intensity greater than 6 mm h high intensity rainfall events it shows that the rainfall characteristics of 20 rainfall events were broadly typical of this region throughfall ranged between 3 23 mm and 42 30 mm coefficient of variation cv 62 07 accounting for 62 25 81 98 cv 7 68 of corresponding incident rainfall il minimum and maximum were 1 06 mm and 12 24 mm cv 59 96 accounting for 11 34 36 46 cv 25 91 of corresponding incident rainfall sf was 0 003 1 41 mm cv 76 72 accounting for 0 06 3 70 of corresponding individual incident rainfall fig 5 a total throughfall depth was 380 93 mm during observation periods accounting for 77 71 of corresponding gross rainfall il and sf depths were 98 48 mm and 10 30 mm during observation periods accounting for 20 19 and 2 10 of corresponding gross rainfall respectively fig 5b 3 3 throughfall canopy spatial heterogeneity throughfall depth did not significantly differ with canopy height p 0 05 fig 6 b throughfall depth was greatest in the upper canopy followed by the middle canopy and least in the below canopy with an average of 20 59 mm cv 64 02 19 64 mm cv 63 32 and 19 02 mm cv 62 17 respectively the vertical distribution of throughfall percentage with canopy height was consistent with throughfall depth however the differences were significant p 0 05 averages of throughfall percentage were 81 80 cv 7 29 78 24 cv 8 15 and 76 39 7 95 at upper canopy middle canopy and below canopy respectively the horizontal distribution of throughfall depth and throughfall percentage increased with increasing distance from the trunk but there were no significant differences at different horizontal locations p 0 05 fig 6c and 6d throughfall depths were 19 89 mm cv 62 73 19 75 mm cv 63 31 and 19 46 mm cv 64 24 at crown radius 1 2 crown radius and trunk locations respectively throughfall percentages were 79 61 cv 7 18 78 65 cv 7 78 and 77 28 cv 8 02 at crown radius 1 2 crown radius and trunk locations respectively 3 4 throughfall in relation to rainfall characteristics throughfall depth was significantly linearly correlated with amount of rainfall r2 0 98 p 0 0001 fig 7 a according to the fitted equations rainfall depth for throughfall generation were 0 76 mm for black locust throughfall percentage showed a quadratic function relationship with rainfall amount whereby it initially increased and then stabilized with increasing rainfall fig 7b the throughfall depth rainfall intensity relationship followed a quadratic polynomial function and the throughfall percentage rainfall intensity relationship was similar fig 7c and d throughfall depth initially increased and then decreased with increasing rainfall intensity from a critical value of 3 35 mm h throughfall percentage weakly increased and then decreased rapidly with increasing rainfall intensity throughfall depth followed a power function typically increasing with increasing rainfall duration followed by a gradual slowing with increasing rainfall duration fig 7e the corresponding throughfall percentage also followed a power function with increasing rainfall duration where throughfall percentage initially increased and then slowed to a constant fig 7f 3 5 throughfall in relation to trees attributes in the analysis of tree attributes on throughfall data from each rainfall collector produced by a single rainfall event was used not the average of all 20 rainfall events figs 8 and 9 corresponding lai lai gradually change in the growing season was measured during the period of approaching single rainfall in fig 8 throughfall data of each collector is the average of below canopy in each tree in four rainfall conditions light 4 30 mm moderate 11 57 mm heavy 20 22 mm and rainstorm 45 97 mm the relationship between throughfall percentage and lai was a second degree polynomial where the coefficient of determination was higher in light and moderate rainfall than in heavy rainfall and rainstorm in light rainfall conditions throughfall percentage initially declines and then weakly increases with increasing lai fig 8a in moderate rainfall conditions throughfall percentage weakly declines with increasing lai fig 8b in heavy rainfall conditions throughfall percentage followed the opposite trend to light rainfall fig 8c however in rainstorm conditions throughfall percentage trends were similar to those for moderate rainfall fig 8d generally lai throughfall percentage coefficients were negative and the effect of lai on throughfall was more obvious when precipitation was low and conversely the effect was weak when precipitation was high the relationship between throughfall percentage and tree height dbh canopy width and canopy openness was a second degree polynomial in different size rainfall events fig 9 however the coefficient of determination was different for different tree attributes in the same rainfall conditions in light rainfall the best relationship was between throughfall percentage and tree height r2 0 17 in moderate and heavy rainfall the best relationship was between throughfall percentage and canopy width r2 0 75 and r2 0 33 and in a rainstorm it was between throughfall percentage and dbh r2 0 39 throughfall percentage declined with increasing tree height under light rainfall fig 9a while it increased under moderate rainfall fig 9e throughfall percentage increased weakly at first and then decreased with increasing tree height in heavy rainfall fig 9i but in contrast throughfall percentage changes during rainstorms was similar to moderate rainfall fig 9m throughfall percentage declined initially and then increased with increasing dbh in light rainfall while it increased and then decreased in moderate rainfall fig 9b and 9f under heavy rainfall throughfall percentage increased with increasing dbh but it decreased during rainstorms fig 9j and n in contrast changes in throughfall percentage with canopy width were similar during moderate and heavy rainfall where they initially increased and then declined fig 9g and k with light rainfall throughfall percentage decreased with increasing canopy width while it increased during rainstorms fig 9c and o throughfall percentage declined with increasing canopy openness in light and moderate rainfall fig 9d and h while it initially decreased and then increased in heavy rainfall fig 9l in contrast throughfall percentage increased with increasing canopy openness during rainstorms fig 9p 4 discussion 4 1 throughfall characteristics in different studies rainfall characteristics directly affect throughfall when they make contact with the tree canopy over the study period rainfall events between 0 and 10 mm 75 86 rainfall duration between 0 and 3 h 56 32 and rainfall intensity is 0 2 5 mm h 87 35 were the most frequent rainfall characteristics li 2011 showed that 5 mm rainfall events account for 75 of total rainfall events in the semi arid areas of china and where the contribution of rainfall events is relatively stable they account for 14 25 of total precipitation however the frequency of 10 mm rainfall events account for 16 of total rainfall events and has larger inter annual variation accounting for 52 1 65 4 of total precipitation our results show that 10 mm events occur more frequently in semiarid areas but 10 mm rainfall events contribute the most to total precipitation numerous studies on throughfall for different plant species exist in different global regions and differences in vegetation type and regional climate lead to great variation in throughfall for example throughfall percentage for various forest types ranged from 55 to 90 depending on canopy structure and climatic conditions siles et al 2010 throughfall percentage varied from 70 to 90 in temperate coniferous broad leaved forest while it varied more widely in tropical forest from 60 to 95 bruijnzeel 2004 levia and frost 2006 llorens and domingo 2007 torsten et al 2008 throughfall percentages were 65 2 15 5 in arid areas where the throughfall of herbaceous plants was lower than for trees and shrubs li 2011 magliano et al 2019a furthermore related studies show that the throughfall percentage was higher for trees 72 3 than shrubs 72 3 deciduous 69 8 than evergreen trees 65 3 pinnate leaved 72 9 than needle 65 5 and broadleaved trees 66 6 and rough 70 5 than smooth bark 61 8 magliano et al 2019a in our study the throughfall percentage contribution to gross rainfall was 77 71 comfortably falling within this range indicating that our experimental results are dependable however during our study period values for throughfall rather than gross rainfall were obtained partially from the canopy region mainly because preferential drip points in the canopy occurred during continuous rainfall events queiroz et al 2020 siegert et al 2016 vernimmen et al 2007 moreover we analyzed black locust throughfall il and sf percentages in previous studies and our results were comparable although some studies had obvious differences table 2 black locust forms a wide broadleaved deciduous forest therefore throughfall percentage is lower than evergreen forest and higher than needle leaved forest previous studies show that these forests range from 62 00 to 89 00 6 00 37 50 and 1 30 5 00 respectively our throughfall was much higher than that found by sadeghi et al 2016 and gao et al 2020 but much lower than in ma et al 2019 wei et al 2008 wang et al 2012 and zhang et al 2016 the main reasons for these differences are likely related to rainfall characteristics topographic variables and canopy structure in different study regions aboala et al 2000 for example thicker crown depth and denser leaves results in greater rainfall interception and a reduced throughfall percentage because of increased length of interaction between raindrops and the crown surface ma et al 2019 meanwhile throughfall percentage is affected by collector amount size spatial location and measurement method compared with previous studies our arrangement of throughfall collectors was denser and individual tree centered 4 2 throughfall spatial heterogeneity throughfall horizontal spatial variation the horizontal distribution from the trunk center to the periphery of the canopy has been widely studied in forests mululo sato et al 2011 staelens et al 2006 zuecco et al 2014 related studies also show a significant relationship between throughfall generation and the distance from the center to canopy periphery magliano et al 2019b to examine throughfall spatial variation throughfall depths were measured in different horizontal locations and at canopy vertical heights for each single tree in our study we found that the horizontal distribution of throughfall depth and throughfall percentage increased with distance from the trunk fig 6b however the horizontal distribution of throughfall is not consistent for example mululo sato et al 2011 and magliano et al 2019b found that throughfall was higher close to the trunk than further away while staelens et al 2008 found that throughfall was lower close to the trunk moreover a related study showed higher throughfall near the trunk in young coniferous forest lower in old coniferous forest and in other situations no relationship between throughfall and distance from the trunk keim et al 2005 studies of throughfall vertical spatial variation exist but are relatively rare in our study the order of throughfall depth and percentage was upper canopy middle canopy below canopy in different vertical canopy height fig 6a hansen 1996 showed that for a norway spruce canopy divided into six depths throughfall depth was highest at the top of tree and decreased down through the canopy however fritsche et al 1989 found that throughfall increased from top to bottom moreover spatial throughfall variability has time stability mululo sato et al 2011 related studies show that throughfall exhibits gathering effects in the canopy queiroz et al 2020 which are caused by the lateral flow of rainwater within the tree crown frischbier and wagner 2015 generally speaking goâmez et al 2002 found that gathering effects were more likely to occur at the edge of the canopy or sometimes within the canopy edge however the throughfall gathering area occurs more at the middle of the canopy radius and sometimes at the edge of the canopy we found that higher throughfall occurs at the edge of the crown radius and declines towards the trunk center while previous studies show that throughfall depth and percentage were lower midway between the trunk and the canopy edge nanko et al 2011 interestingly throughfall percentage minima were not closest to the trunk but at a distance of 1 2 m from the trunk center in a pinus armandii stand shi et al 2009 we believe that the determinants of throughfall spatial variability are not the distance from the trunk but rather canopy thickness canopy cover and leaf area index at different distances from the trunk 4 3 factors influencing throughfall throughfall is affected by meteorological characteristics rainfall amount intensity and duration and wind speed and vegetation structure canopy cover thickness tree height dbh and lai related studies show that gross rainfall has a major impact on rainfall partitioning into throughfall sf and il kaushal et al 2017 previous studies found that throughfall increased as gross rainfall event size increased fleischbein et al 2005 magliano et al 2019a marin et al 2000 xiao et al 2000 in our study we found a significantly linear relationship between throughfall and amount of rainfall where throughfall increased with increasing rainfall fig 8a this is consistent with previous findings where higher throughfall was associated with higher gross rainfall mużyło et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 however the relationship was a quadratic function for throughfall percentage and rainfall amount where it initially increased and then gradually stabilized fig 7b which agrees with zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 also showed that higher intensity rainfall can generate stronger vegetation impacts than lower intensity rainfall which helps throughfall generation we found that throughfall depth increased initially and then decreased with rainfall intensity fig 7c and that throughfall percentage changes followed a similar trend fig 7d however examining the relationship between throughfall and rainfall intensity is only meaningful when the analysis controls for rainfall duration keim 2004 throughfall depth increased gradually with increasing rainfall duration fig 7e whereas the corresponding throughfall percentage trend initially increased and then remained constant in our study area many rainfall events are of short duration that produce low amounts of rainfall fig 2 but even in the longer rainfall events the hourly time step reveals periods of low and high intensity fig 3 previous studies have shown that low intensity short duration events generated the lowest throughfall staelens et al 2008 which differs to our findings where other climate factors and canopy structure differences may be important vegetation structure can be extremely complex and includes tree height lai bark thickness and dbh sadeghi et al 2016 and so understanding how it determines rainfall partitioning is no easy task previous studies show that leaf size and canopy vertical layering strongly affect throughfall drop size and terminal velocity calder 2001 nanko et al 2006 in our study the relationship between throughfall percentage and lai followed a second degree polynomial function fig 8 the change shows that throughfall percentage initially increased and then decreased weakly with increasing lai during light rainfall fig 8a while initially declined and then increased weakly during heavy rainfall fig 8c during moderate rainfall and rainstorms throughfall percentage decreased with increasing lai fig 8b and 8d an increase in lai does not always lead to a reduction in throughfall because of the effects of time and nature of thinning on the ratio of basal area to lai aboala et al 2000 other studies also show that higher throughfall did not correspond to lower lai limin et al 2015 because lai alone did not correlate with throughfall park and cameron 2008 moreover we analyzed the relationship between throughfall percentage and canopy structure characteristics tree height canopy width dbh and canopy openness during differently sized rainfall events and found these relationships differed in general the relationship between throughfall percentage and tree attributes was described by a second degree polynomial in differently sized rainfall events while the coefficient of determination was different for different tree attributes in the same rainfall conditions for example throughfall percentage in light moderate and heavy rainfall increased with increasing tree height whereas during a rainstorm throughfall percentage was higher and increased with dbh however the best fitting relationships of canopy width and canopy openness with throughfall percentage were during moderate and heavy rainfall respectively these results suggest that tree attribute effects on throughfall are greater in larger storms that in lesser storms this is consistent with previous findings that crown depth and canopy openness all affect throughfall during smaller storms but live crown length was the only significant predictor of storms that were deeper than 20 mm park and cameron 2008 in our study the weak correlations between tree attributes and throughfall could indicate that other parameters that could be inter correlated are influencing throughfall 5 conclusions for black locust forest in the semi arid loess region of china throughfall was quantified and its spatial heterogeneity analyzed rainfall events are mainly of short duration and low intensity in this region while the overall rainfall amount is mainly from long duration and low intensity rainfall in rainfall partitioning throughfall is the most important part followed by the canopy interception loss and finally by stemflow for a single tree throughfall varies in different canopy locations in the vertical direction throughfall depth and percentage decreased with decreasing canopy height in the horizontal direction throughfall depth and percentage increased with distance from the trunk rainfall characteristics exerted a dominant effect on throughfall and the effects of rainfall amount were higher than rainfall intensity and duration throughfall is affected by tree attributes lai height dbh canopy width and canopy openness to some degree and these effects are greater

4234,throughfall in a forest ecosystem has potential hydrological impacts in the semi arid loess region of china due to continuous human intervention however in black locust forests in this region throughfall and its spatial heterogeneity and controlling factors remain unclear we examined throughfall its spatial variability and the effects of rainfall characteristics and vegetation structure on throughfall in a black locust stand experiment of the 489 72 mm cumulative gross rainfall during 20 sampled events the average of throughfall for all trees interception loss il and stemflow sf were 380 93 mm 77 71 98 48 mm 20 19 and 10 30 mm 2 10 respectively for a single tree measured throughfall percentage decreased from upper to bottom in the canopy vertical layer and the horizontal distribution increased with distance from the trunk a correlation analysis between throughfall and rainfall characteristics indicated that rainfall amount had a greater effect on throughfall than rainfall intensity and duration throughfall generally occurred following rainfall events of more than 0 76 mm for black locust throughfall percentage initially increased weakly and then decreased with increasing rainfall intensity while it initially increased and then remained constant with increasing rainfall duration throughfall percentage decreased with increasing leaf area index lai during differently sized rainfall events whereas throughfall variations were different in differently sized rainfall events throughfall is affected by tree height diameter at breast height dbh canopy width and canopy openness to some degree while the effects were higher in larger storms than in smaller storms our study highlights the need to consider the effects of throughfall on hydrological processes

provide to society brauman et al 2010 pan et al 2011 as the main moisture input to forests rainfall can be partitioned into vegetation canopy interception loss il throughfall and stemflow sf zhang et al 2015 il is the part of incident rainfall that is intercepted stored and subsequently evaporated from forest leaves branches and stems during and after rainfall events shi et al 2010 the remaining net rainfall reaches the soil surface by throughfall and sf throughfall is the rainfall fraction that reaches the ground directly through canopy gaps free throughfall or indirectly through leaf and branch drip canopy throughfall magliano et al 2019a sf is the rainfall fraction that reaches the base of trees via their trunks or stems levia and germer 2015 therefore the vertical and horizontal spatial distribution of rainfall is transformed via il throughfall and sf which obviously affect the ecology and hydrology of arid semi arid areas jian et al 2019 throughfall is a primary component of the hydrological and ecological processes in forest ecosystems and its spatial patterns have an important influence on soil processes watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry keim et al 2005 staelens et al 2006 related studies shown that throughfall spatial variability has important effects on spatially distributed processes in forest soils such as trace gas fluxes ion loading and solute leaching hansen 1996 as well as implications for sampling strategies and interpretation of throughfall data in terms of water and ionic inputs whelan and anderson 1996 specifically spatial variations in throughfall volume influence soil moisture patterns and fine root distribution in forest soil ford and deans 1978 schume et al 2003 forest floor vegetation composition such as lichens and mosses carleton and kavanagh 1990 soil moisture infiltration and surface runoff generation nanko et al 2011 and water and nutrient cycling chang and egbert 2000 throughfall in forest ecosystems is a complex process affected by morphological attributes such as plant density leaf area index canopy cover and canopy storage capacity and meteorological conditions including rainfall characteristics wind and evaporation rate ma et al 2019 magliano et al 2019a staelens et al 2008 for example leaf size and canopy vertical layering clearly influence throughfall drop size and terminal velocity calder 2001 nanko et al 2006 tree density branch angle crown height uniformity or lack of it the nature and thickness of the bark layer leaf shape and inclination and leaf area index also influence throughfall

2007 the loess plateau of china has become a region with severe soil erosion due to steep slopes frequent heavy rainfall in rainy seasons june september and anthropogenic activities gao et al 2016 yu et al 2014 zhao et al 2013 to control severe soil erosion and improve ecosystem services on the loess plateau afforestation measures were implemented in the 1950s jia et al 2017 and vegetation cover

change the ecological environment surface runoff and soil moisture dynamics wang et al 2015 xu et al 2018a zhao et al 2015 black locust robinia pseudoacacia is a major reforestation species in the loess plateau due to its high drought infertility and low high temperature tolerance as well as faster growth than some native tree species vitkova et al 2017 wang et al 2010a black locust plantations provide a wide range of ecological and socio economic functions in this region zhou et al 2014 such as soil water retention wang et al 2010a soil respiration regulation xue et al 2007 and soil chemical and microbiological improvements wang et al 2011 at a macro scale black locust plantations can significantly impact hydrology processes however their throughfall characteristics and spatial heterogeneity are less clear on the loess plateau which hinders an understanding of hydrological processes in this region large plantations have increased soil water consumption and therefore to alleviate soil drought a greater understanding of hydrological characteristics in black locust plantings is necessary this is the first study to characterize throughfall in different canopy locations for a single tree and to further analyze the effects of rainfall characteristics and tree attributes on throughfall in this region our overall aims therefore are to 1 quantify throughfall il and sf rainfall partitioning for black locust forest in the semi arid loess region of china 2 compare throughfall spatial characteristics in different single tree locations and 3 examine the effect of rainfall characteristics and tree attributes on throughfall our results should provide a reference for black locust forest management from the perspective of water management in semi arid loess regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our study in the semi arid loess region of china was conducted in black locust robinia pseudoacacia plantations in zhifanggou watershed 109 13 03 109 16 46 e 36 46 28 36 46 42 n from august 2018 to october 2019 zhifanggou watershed is a typical catchment located in a hilly gullied loess landscape with a drainage area of 8 7 km2 slope ranging from 0 to 65 and altitude ranging from 1010 to 1431 m qiu et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 the watershed is located in the warm temperate semi arid climate zone where the total annual sunshine is 2415 6 h and annual average temperature is 8 8 c average annual precipitation is 543 mm 70 of which occurs between june and september due to the monsoon climate luo et al 2019 and annual evaporation ranges from 1010 to 1400 mm zhao et al 2017 the study area soil type is huangmian soil which is comprised of sand 21 6 silt 63 3 and clay 16 4 respectively ye et al 2018 the chinese government implemented the grain for green program on the loess plateau in 1999 and the watershed ecosystems gradually began to recover by 2005 the watershed ecosystems reached a relatively stable state with forest and grassland cover of more than 80 xu et al 2018b the vegetation types in this watershed are typical for the western loess plateau where forests are dominated by black locust robinia pseudoacacia zhao et al 2016 2 2 field experimental arrangement in zhifanggou watershed an area 20 m 30 m 600 m2 of typical black locust forest was selected for this study the stand was located on a 30 slope with a northwest exposure and an elevation of 1251 m according to the field survey average tree height was 9 60 m and ranged from 5 00 m to 15 00 m the range of canopy height canopy diameter and diameter at the breast dbh was 2 5 9 0 m 2 0 5 0 m and 6 00 23 00 cm respectively according to black locust distribution canopy structure and tree architecture in the sample area nine robust and healthy trees were selected as experimental trees tree height canopy height canopy diameter and dbh of the nine experimental trees were in the range of those found at the field site and therefore typical and representative the morphological and structural features of the 9 individual trees were characterized table 1 in this study tree height was measured with a tree height meter that could freely extend and contract to a maximum of 20 m canopy diameter was measured according to canopy shape whereby a point on the canopy edge was determined by vertical projection to the ground and a similar point opposite to it and directly through the center of the trunk also determined the distance between the two points was measured the process repeated three times and the average of the 3 measurements taken as canopy diameter trunk dbh was measured 1 3 m above the ground a canopy photograph was taken with an unmanned aerial vehicle directly above each throughfall collector the image was loaded into the gap light analyzer software and then the results were exported by sidelook software where the threshold value was determined and finally lai was calculated in the gap light analyzer software according to the determined threshold value to measure throughfall vertical distribution the canopy was divided into three layers according to tree canopy height upper middle and below canopy fig 1 a and rainfall collectors were placed in each layer to measure throughfall horizontal distribution 7 throughfall collectors were located in each layer one at the center of the tree trunk and the remaining six in three directions 0 120 and 240 and equidistant from the tree trunk to crown periphery fig 1b the three directions were mutually staggered in each layer to avoid the influence of the upper layer on the lower layer in the process of throughfall collection in this study we assumed that meteorological factors were consistent at different observation locations the collectors were 20 cm in diameter and 20 cm high and collected throughfall passed through a plastic pipe connected to a measuring device above the ground stemflow sf was sampled using white halved rubber hose 5 mm thick which was spirally wrapped around the tree trunk and vaseline used to create a water tight environment between the stem and the hose dong et al 2020 the lower side of the hose was connected to a 25 l plastic bucket and after each rainfall event water volume in the bucket was measured 2 3 field measurements gross rainfall gr throughfall and sf were measured from 22 august 2018 to 5 october 2019 gr was measured by an automated meteorological station a resolution of 0 2 mm installed on an open hillside 50 m from the plot rainfall indicators were measured using a hobo u30 nrc monitor u s a with a rainfall measurement interval of 30 min an intermittence longer than 2 h between rainfall events was used to define individual rainfall events chen et al 2009 li et al 2016 yu et al 2007 throughfall and sf was measured after each rainfall event and rain gauges then emptied throughfall depth of each rainfall collector tfi was calculated as 1 tf i tf v ca where tf i is throughfall depth of each rainfall collector mm tf v is throughfall volume of each rainfall collector mm3 and ca is the area of each rainfall collector mm2 throughfall of each canopy layer is the average throughfall of each rainfall collector in this canopy layer throughfall for all trees is the average of throughfall of each rainfall collector in the below canopy layer sf depth was calculated as 2 sf 1 n i 1 n sf i fa i where sf is average sf of per unit area mm n is the number of observed trees n 9 sf i is the ith tree sf mm3 and fa i is the canopy project area of ith tree mm2 interception loss il mm was calculated as 3 il p t f s f where il is canopy interception loss mm p is gross rainfall amount mm tf is throughfall of each tree mm and sf is stemflow mm 2 4 statistical analysis descriptive statistics were used to analyze rainfall characteristics rainfall amount duration and intensity and trees morphological characteristics statistical analysis was carried out using spss v 17 0 ibm company and microsoft excel 2016 microsoft redmond usa software duncan s multiple range tests with a p 0 05 significance level were conducted to identify significant differences in spatial location for each tree 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics a total of 604 4 mm of rainfall occurred during this period which was unevenly distributed through time fig 2 rainfall was concentrated mainly in august to october of 2018 and june to october of 2019 equivalent to 189 2 mm 31 3 and 386 4 mm 63 9 of rainfall respectively during this experimental period grey rectangles in fig 2a from 22 august to 18 october 2018 and from 7 may to 5 october 2019 58 rainfall events occurred totaling 503 8 mm of rainfall the average rainfall for individual rainfall events was 6 5 mm with a range of 0 2 53 6 mm average rainfall duration was 4 57 h with a range of 0 5 29 h average rainfall intensity was 1 39 mm h with a range of 0 4 12 mm h generally low intensity rainfall events were the most frequent and contributed a lower percentage of total rainfall than larger rainfall events fig 3 a for example individual rainfall events 2 mm occurred 41 times with total rainfall of 28 2 mm accounting for 47 13 of total rainfall events but only 4 67 of total rainfall amount individual rainfall events 20 mm was much less frequent 8 05 of total rainfall events but provided 41 83 of total rainfall short duration 6 h rainfall events mainly occurred in this period accounting for 75 86 of total rainfall events while long duration 6 h rainfall events contributed a greater portion to total rainfall 71 64 fig 3b lower intensity rainfall events were much more frequent than higher intensity rainfall events while the sum of rainfall events with 5 mm h accounted for 95 40 of total rainfall events and 95 43 of total rainfall amount fig 3c 3 2 rainfall partitioning rainfall partitioning was calculated using the averages of below canopy throughfall data during the study period 20 effective rainfall events effective rainfall events are those that can produce throughfall and stemflow which were effectively collected were recorded 490 2 mm for 20 rainfall events event size was mainly concentrated from 10 to 15 mm accounting for 31 43 of total rainfall events fig 4 a rainfall duration and intensity were mainly focused on 6 12 h and 0 2 5 mm h accounting for 42 86 and 80 00 of total rainfall events respectively fig 4b and c mean rainfall amount for recorded rainfall events was 24 51 mm with a range of 4 30 55 94 mm rainfall intensity ranged from 0 34 to 7 43 mm h with a mean of 2 11 mm h only 2 of 20 recorded rainfall events had rainfall intensity greater than 6 mm h high intensity rainfall events it shows that the rainfall characteristics of 20 rainfall events were broadly typical of this region throughfall ranged between 3 23 mm and 42 30 mm coefficient of variation cv 62 07 accounting for 62 25 81 98 cv 7 68 of corresponding incident rainfall il minimum and maximum were 1 06 mm and 12 24 mm cv 59 96 accounting for 11 34 36 46 cv 25 91 of corresponding incident rainfall sf was 0 003 1 41 mm cv 76 72 accounting for 0 06 3 70 of corresponding individual incident rainfall fig 5 a total throughfall depth was 380 93 mm during observation periods accounting for 77 71 of corresponding gross rainfall il and sf depths were 98 48 mm and 10 30 mm during observation periods accounting for 20 19 and 2 10 of corresponding gross rainfall respectively fig 5b 3 3 throughfall canopy spatial heterogeneity throughfall depth did not significantly differ with canopy height p 0 05 fig 6 b throughfall depth was greatest in the upper canopy followed by the middle canopy and least in the below canopy with an average of 20 59 mm cv 64 02 19 64 mm cv 63 32 and 19 02 mm cv 62 17 respectively the vertical distribution of throughfall percentage with canopy height was consistent with throughfall depth however the differences were significant p 0 05 averages of throughfall percentage were 81 80 cv 7 29 78 24 cv 8 15 and 76 39 7 95 at upper canopy middle canopy and below canopy respectively the horizontal distribution of throughfall depth and throughfall percentage increased with increasing distance from the trunk but there were no significant differences at different horizontal locations p 0 05 fig 6c and 6d throughfall depths were 19 89 mm cv 62 73 19 75 mm cv 63 31 and 19 46 mm cv 64 24 at crown radius 1 2 crown radius and trunk locations respectively throughfall percentages were 79 61 cv 7 18 78 65 cv 7 78 and 77 28 cv 8 02 at crown radius 1 2 crown radius and trunk locations respectively 3 4 throughfall in relation to rainfall characteristics throughfall depth was significantly linearly correlated with amount of rainfall r2 0 98 p 0 0001 fig 7 a according to the fitted equations rainfall depth for throughfall generation were 0 76 mm for black locust throughfall percentage showed a quadratic function relationship with rainfall amount whereby it initially increased and then stabilized with increasing rainfall fig 7b the throughfall depth rainfall intensity relationship followed a quadratic polynomial function and the throughfall percentage rainfall intensity relationship was similar fig 7c and d throughfall depth initially increased and then decreased with increasing rainfall intensity from a critical value of 3 35 mm h throughfall percentage weakly increased and then decreased rapidly with increasing rainfall intensity throughfall depth followed a power function typically increasing with increasing rainfall duration followed by a gradual slowing with increasing rainfall duration fig 7e the corresponding throughfall percentage also followed a power function with increasing rainfall duration where throughfall percentage initially increased and then slowed to a constant fig 7f 3 5 throughfall in relation to trees attributes in the analysis of tree attributes on throughfall data from each rainfall collector produced by a single rainfall event was used not the average of all 20 rainfall events figs 8 and 9 corresponding lai lai gradually change in the growing season was measured during the period of approaching single rainfall in fig 8 throughfall data of each collector is the average of below canopy in each tree in four rainfall conditions light 4 30 mm moderate 11 57 mm heavy 20 22 mm and rainstorm 45 97 mm the relationship between throughfall percentage and lai was a second degree polynomial where the coefficient of determination was higher in light and moderate rainfall than in heavy rainfall and rainstorm in light rainfall conditions throughfall percentage initially declines and then weakly increases with increasing lai fig 8a in moderate rainfall conditions throughfall percentage weakly declines with increasing lai fig 8b in heavy rainfall conditions throughfall percentage followed the opposite trend to light rainfall fig 8c however in rainstorm conditions throughfall percentage trends were similar to those for moderate rainfall fig 8d generally lai throughfall percentage coefficients were negative and the effect of lai on throughfall was more obvious when precipitation was low and conversely the effect was weak when precipitation was high the relationship between throughfall percentage and tree height dbh canopy width and canopy openness was a second degree polynomial in different size rainfall events fig 9 however the coefficient of determination was different for different tree attributes in the same rainfall conditions in light rainfall the best relationship was between throughfall percentage and tree height r2 0 17 in moderate and heavy rainfall the best relationship was between throughfall percentage and canopy width r2 0 75 and r2 0 33 and in a rainstorm it was between throughfall percentage and dbh r2 0 39 throughfall percentage declined with increasing tree height under light rainfall fig 9a while it increased under moderate rainfall fig 9e throughfall percentage increased weakly at first and then decreased with increasing tree height in heavy rainfall fig 9i but in contrast throughfall percentage changes during rainstorms was similar to moderate rainfall fig 9m throughfall percentage declined initially and then increased with increasing dbh in light rainfall while it increased and then decreased in moderate rainfall fig 9b and 9f under heavy rainfall throughfall percentage increased with increasing dbh but it decreased during rainstorms fig 9j and n in contrast changes in throughfall percentage with canopy width were similar during moderate and heavy rainfall where they initially increased and then declined fig 9g and k with light rainfall throughfall percentage decreased with increasing canopy width while it increased during rainstorms fig 9c and o throughfall percentage declined with increasing canopy openness in light and moderate rainfall fig 9d and h while it initially decreased and then increased in heavy rainfall fig 9l in contrast throughfall percentage increased with increasing canopy openness during rainstorms fig 9p 4 discussion 4 1 throughfall characteristics in different studies rainfall characteristics directly affect throughfall when they make contact with the tree canopy over the study period rainfall events between 0 and 10 mm 75 86 rainfall duration between 0 and 3 h 56 32 and rainfall intensity is 0 2 5 mm h 87 35 were the most frequent rainfall characteristics li 2011 showed that 5 mm rainfall events account for 75 of total rainfall events in the semi arid areas of china and where the contribution of rainfall events is relatively stable they account for 14 25 of total precipitation however the frequency of 10 mm rainfall events account for 16 of total rainfall events and has larger inter annual variation accounting for 52 1 65 4 of total precipitation our results show that 10 mm events occur more frequently in semiarid areas but 10 mm rainfall events contribute the most to total precipitation numerous studies on throughfall for different plant species exist in different global regions and differences in vegetation type and regional climate lead to great variation in throughfall for example throughfall percentage for various forest types ranged from 55 to 90 depending on canopy structure and climatic conditions siles et al 2010 throughfall percentage varied from 70 to 90 in temperate coniferous broad leaved forest while it varied more widely in tropical forest from 60 to 95 bruijnzeel 2004 levia and frost 2006 llorens and domingo 2007 torsten et al 2008 throughfall percentages were 65 2 15 5 in arid areas where the throughfall of herbaceous plants was lower than for trees and shrubs li 2011 magliano et al 2019a furthermore related studies show that the throughfall percentage was higher for trees 72 3 than shrubs 72 3 deciduous 69 8 than evergreen trees 65 3 pinnate leaved 72 9 than needle 65 5 and broadleaved trees 66 6 and rough 70 5 than smooth bark 61 8 magliano et al 2019a in our study the throughfall percentage contribution to gross rainfall was 77 71 comfortably falling within this range indicating that our experimental results are dependable however during our study period values for throughfall rather than gross rainfall were obtained partially from the canopy region mainly because preferential drip points in the canopy occurred during continuous rainfall events queiroz et al 2020 siegert et al 2016 vernimmen et al 2007 moreover we analyzed black locust throughfall il and sf percentages in previous studies and our results were comparable although some studies had obvious differences table 2 black locust forms a wide broadleaved deciduous forest therefore throughfall percentage is lower than evergreen forest and higher than needle leaved forest previous studies show that these forests range from 62 00 to 89 00 6 00 37 50 and 1 30 5 00 respectively our throughfall was much higher than that found by sadeghi et al 2016 and gao et al 2020 but much lower than in ma et al 2019 wei et al 2008 wang et al 2012 and zhang et al 2016 the main reasons for these differences are likely related to rainfall characteristics topographic variables and canopy structure in different study regions aboala et al 2000 for example thicker crown depth and denser leaves results in greater rainfall interception and a reduced throughfall percentage because of increased length of interaction between raindrops and the crown surface ma et al 2019 meanwhile throughfall percentage is affected by collector amount size spatial location and measurement method compared with previous studies our arrangement of throughfall collectors was denser and individual tree centered 4 2 throughfall spatial heterogeneity throughfall horizontal spatial variation the horizontal distribution from the trunk center to the periphery of the canopy has been widely studied in forests mululo sato et al 2011 staelens et al 2006 zuecco et al 2014 related studies also show a significant relationship between throughfall generation and the distance from the center to canopy periphery magliano et al 2019b to examine throughfall spatial variation throughfall depths were measured in different horizontal locations and at canopy vertical heights for each single tree in our study we found that the horizontal distribution of throughfall depth and throughfall percentage increased with distance from the trunk fig 6b however the horizontal distribution of throughfall is not consistent for example mululo sato et al 2011 and magliano et al 2019b found that throughfall was higher close to the trunk than further away while staelens et al 2008 found that throughfall was lower close to the trunk moreover a related study showed higher throughfall near the trunk in young coniferous forest lower in old coniferous forest and in other situations no relationship between throughfall and distance from the trunk keim et al 2005 studies of throughfall vertical spatial variation exist but are relatively rare in our study the order of throughfall depth and percentage was upper canopy middle canopy below canopy in different vertical canopy height fig 6a hansen 1996 showed that for a norway spruce canopy divided into six depths throughfall depth was highest at the top of tree and decreased down through the canopy however fritsche et al 1989 found that throughfall increased from top to bottom moreover spatial throughfall variability has time stability mululo sato et al 2011 related studies show that throughfall exhibits gathering effects in the canopy queiroz et al 2020 which are caused by the lateral flow of rainwater within the tree crown frischbier and wagner 2015 generally speaking goâmez et al 2002 found that gathering effects were more likely to occur at the edge of the canopy or sometimes within the canopy edge however the throughfall gathering area occurs more at the middle of the canopy radius and sometimes at the edge of the canopy we found that higher throughfall occurs at the edge of the crown radius and declines towards the trunk center while previous studies show that throughfall depth and percentage were lower midway between the trunk and the canopy edge nanko et al 2011 interestingly throughfall percentage minima were not closest to the trunk but at a distance of 1 2 m from the trunk center in a pinus armandii stand shi et al 2009 we believe that the determinants of throughfall spatial variability are not the distance from the trunk but rather canopy thickness canopy cover and leaf area index at different distances from the trunk 4 3 factors influencing throughfall throughfall is affected by meteorological characteristics rainfall amount intensity and duration and wind speed and vegetation structure canopy cover thickness tree height dbh and lai related studies show that gross rainfall has a major impact on rainfall partitioning into throughfall sf and il kaushal et al 2017 previous studies found that throughfall increased as gross rainfall event size increased fleischbein et al 2005 magliano et al 2019a marin et al 2000 xiao et al 2000 in our study we found a significantly linear relationship between throughfall and amount of rainfall where throughfall increased with increasing rainfall fig 8a this is consistent with previous findings where higher throughfall was associated with higher gross rainfall mużyło et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 however the relationship was a quadratic function for throughfall percentage and rainfall amount where it initially increased and then gradually stabilized fig 7b which agrees with zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 also showed that higher intensity rainfall can generate stronger vegetation impacts than lower intensity rainfall which helps throughfall generation we found that throughfall depth increased initially and then decreased with rainfall intensity fig 7c and that throughfall percentage changes followed a similar trend fig 7d however examining the relationship between throughfall and rainfall intensity is only meaningful when the analysis controls for rainfall duration keim 2004 throughfall depth increased gradually with increasing rainfall duration fig 7e whereas the corresponding throughfall percentage trend initially increased and then remained constant in our study area many rainfall events are of short duration that produce low amounts of rainfall fig 2 but even in the longer rainfall events the hourly time step reveals periods of low and high intensity fig 3 previous studies have shown that low intensity short duration events generated the lowest throughfall staelens et al 2008 which differs to our findings where other climate factors and canopy structure differences may be important vegetation structure can be extremely complex and includes tree height lai bark thickness and dbh sadeghi et al 2016 and so understanding how it determines rainfall partitioning is no easy task previous studies show that leaf size and canopy vertical layering strongly affect throughfall drop size and terminal velocity calder 2001 nanko et al 2006 in our study the relationship between throughfall percentage and lai followed a second degree polynomial function fig 8 the change shows that throughfall percentage initially increased and then decreased weakly with increasing lai during light rainfall fig 8a while initially declined and then increased weakly during heavy rainfall fig 8c during moderate rainfall and rainstorms throughfall percentage decreased with increasing lai fig 8b and 8d an increase in lai does not always lead to a reduction in throughfall because of the effects of time and nature of thinning on the ratio of basal area to lai aboala et al 2000 other studies also show that higher throughfall did not correspond to lower lai limin et al 2015 because lai alone did not correlate with throughfall park and cameron 2008 moreover we analyzed the relationship between throughfall percentage and canopy structure characteristics tree height canopy width dbh and canopy openness during differently sized rainfall events and found these relationships differed in general the relationship between throughfall percentage and tree attributes was described by a second degree polynomial in differently sized rainfall events while the coefficient of determination was different for different tree attributes in the same rainfall conditions for example throughfall percentage in light moderate and heavy rainfall increased with increasing tree height whereas during a rainstorm throughfall percentage was higher and increased with dbh however the best fitting relationships of canopy width and canopy openness with throughfall percentage were during moderate and heavy rainfall respectively these results suggest that tree attribute effects on throughfall are greater in larger storms that in lesser storms this is consistent with previous findings that crown depth and canopy openness all affect throughfall during smaller storms but live crown length was the only significant predictor of storms that were deeper than 20 mm park and cameron 2008 in our study the weak correlations between tree attributes and throughfall could indicate that other parameters that could be inter correlated are influencing throughfall 5 conclusions for black locust forest in the semi arid loess region of china throughfall was quantified and its spatial heterogeneity analyzed rainfall events are mainly of short duration and low intensity in this region while the overall rainfall amount is mainly from long duration and low intensity rainfall in rainfall partitioning throughfall is the most important part followed by the canopy interception loss and finally by stemflow for a single tree throughfall varies in different canopy locations in the vertical direction throughfall depth and percentage decreased with decreasing canopy height in the horizontal direction throughfall depth and percentage increased with distance from the trunk rainfall characteristics exerted a dominant effect on throughfall and the effects of rainfall amount were higher than rainfall intensity and duration throughfall is affected by tree attributes lai height dbh canopy width and canopy openness to some degree and these effects are greater
