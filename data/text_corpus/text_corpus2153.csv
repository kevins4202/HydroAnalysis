10765,to quantify the water absorbed by wheat in different soil layers and improve both wheat yields and water use efficiency wue a 2 year conservation tillage and straw treatment experiment was implemented this experiment involved four tillage methods conventional tillage c subsoiling s rotary tillage r and no tillage n and two straw treatments straw return w and no straw return 0 the hydrogen oxygen and carbon stable isotope method was used to evaluate the water source grain yield dry matter quantity and wue of wheat as well as the relationships between δ13c values of the wheat leaves stems ears and yield and the wue under different tillage and straw treatment methods at the jointing and harvest stages the results indicated that wheat water uptake occurred mainly within the 0 20 cm 86 22 soil layer at the jointing stage and within the 0 20 56 36 and 20 40 cm 38 74 soil layers at the harvest stage compared with those in the c 0 treatment the dry matter quantity in the s w treatment increased by 14 86 and 14 20 respectively at the jointing stage and the harvest stage the grain yield in the s w treatment significantly increased by 18 at the harvest stage p 0 05 the wuet and wuei in the s w treatment significantly increased by 46 21 and 45 31 respectively at the jointing stage p 0 05 and the wuey increased by 5 69 and 5 54 respectively at the jointing stage and the harvest stage the δ13c vales of the wheat leaves stems and ears were positively correlated with the yield dry matter quantity and wue of wheat in conclusion subsoiling with straw return should be adopted as a promising strategy for improving both wheat productivity and wue and for retaining soil water availability the δ13c value of wheat organs can be used to indicate changes in wheat yield and wue keywords subsoiling stable isotope water sources wheat yield water use efficiency 1 introduction in recent decades increasing amounts of attention have been paid to the interactions between precipitation soil water groundwater and plant stem water wang et al 2009 however estimating the important effects of these fluxes on the improvement of crop water use efficiency wue by quantifying the water fluxes of evaporation transpiration and drainage at the soil plant atmosphere interface is difficult the water absorption of the root system plays a very important role in the water interaction in the soil plant atmosphere ecosystem asbjornsen et al 2007 absorbing water by their root system and transpiration of leaves plants regulate the rate and amount of water reentering the land water cycle thus regulating the energy flow and cycle of materials in an ecosystem in contrast plant metabolism and soil resources affect plant physiological functions via soil moisture availability hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope methods have received extensive amounts of attention for predicting water sources in forest grassland and farmland ecosystems yang et al 2015 because water does not exchange with the external environment while being transported from the soil to the plant root system and through xylem vessels usually no isotope fractionation occurs white et al 1985 the isotopic composition of water in the xylem of plant stems can reflect the isotope information of the source of that water zimmermann et al 1967 therefore the contribution of these sources to plants can be determined by comparing the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen between plant stem water and possible water sources brunel et al 1995 the difference between isotopes from the different water source is caused by isotope fractionation while the main causes of isotope fractionation are physicochemical processes such as evaporation falling and infiltration asbjornsen et al 2007 soil water is the most important source of water for plants because the nature of the soil itself such as particle size and porosity there are differences in stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen at different soil layers generally speaking the moisture in the surface soil is relatively high in evaporation intensity due to easier contact with air thus resulting in stable isotope fractionation of hydrogen and oxygen according to the above theory light molecules are preferentially evaporated so the surface soil water is more enriched with heavier stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen than the deeper soil water therefore the stable isotope composition of hydrogen and oxygen in soil water at different soil depths is significantly different and is relatively stable until the deeper soil layer asbjornsen et al 2007 it is precisely because of various physical and chemical processes in nature that hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes from different sources are fractionated to different degrees which provides a research basis for quantitatively distinguishing different water sources of plants burgess et al 2000 most relevant studies have used the direct comparison method sekiya and yano 2002 and the equal source mixed model to determine plant water sources phillips et al 2005 a two layer mixed model was used to study the water supply status of pine trees during different seasons in central and southern texas the results showed that the main use of groundwater occurred during the dry and hot seasons whereas soil moisture was mainly used during the cold and wet seasons mccole and stern 2007 asbjornsen et al 2007 reported that maize and prairie plants obtain 45 and 36 of their water from the 0 20 cm soil layer respectively the contribution of soil moisture within a depth of 0 100 cm was studied by the use of a stable isotope technique moreover soil water at different growth stages was absorbed mainly within the 0 40 cm soil layer zhang et al 2011 wue is an important index that reflects the ability of plants to adapt to drought environments the wue can be divided into three forms wuet photosynthetic rate transpiration rate a tr wue at the leaf level wuei photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance a gs erice et al 2007 and wue at the yield level wuey yield crop water consumption y et jones 2004 reported that δ13c can be used to predict the wue of c3 plants the δ13c values of different plant organs can indicate the wue at different levels for example condon et al 1987 pointed out that in south australia grain δ13c δe was positively correlated with wheat grain yield in addition farquhar et al 1989a reported a negative correlation between δ13c δl and wuei in c3 plants with respect to improving crop yield and wue land use methods are very important in agriculture conservation tillage is a new type of tillage different from traditional tillage in terms of operation time and production cost mainly including reduced tillage no tillage and straw mulching etc scsa 1982 conservation tillage can help preserve soil and water increase soil moisture contents and improve soil quality and crop yields all of which are conducive to the sustainable development of agricultural production balwinder singh et al 2011 conventional tillage reduces soil water retention and disrupts soil structural stability biological activity and nutrient supplies and storage bissett et al 2013 especially in wheat fields conventional tillage leads to a relatively narrow plow layer and hinders the flow of air and water thus inhibiting root growth and reducing yields huang et al 2012 as such the sustainable development of agriculture in the huang huai hai region of china has been adversely affected by the destruction of soil structure latifmanesh et al 2018 thus reducing the wue compared with conventional tillage subsoiling can reduce the effects of soil compaction on crop yield jennings et al 2012 while increasing root elongation and the effects of moisture on crop growth lampurlanés et al 2001 in addition no tillage and subsoiling with straw mulch usually result in an increase in chlorophyll pigment content and net photosynthetic rate in flag leaves li et al 2006b therefore conservation tillage can improve soil water storage capacity and crop yield thus increasing economic benefits gicheru et al 2004 however guzha 2004 reported that the yield of wheat under reduced tillage and no tillage conditions was lower than that under conventional tillage conditions many studies have investigated wue in response to irrigation and water deficit treatments but relatively little research exists on the wue of crops under different tillage methods therefore four tillage and two straw treatment methods were used as part of a 16 year long term experiment the hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of the precipitation groundwater irrigation water soil water and stem water as well as the carbon isotope values of the leaves stems and ears of the wheat plants were determined at the jointing and harvest stages moreover the soil water content dry matter quantity of aboveground plant parts and wheat yields were determined the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the contributions of water from different soil layers to wheat 2 compare the crop yields and wue values under different tillage and straw treatments and 3 evaluate the relationships between the δ13c values of different wheat organs and crop yield dry matter quantity and wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 trial site this experiment was conducted at tai an northern china 36 09 n 117 09 e altitude 130 m above sea level which has a typical temperate continental monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 12 82 c and the annual average rainfall was 956 69 mm from october 2017 to june 2019 the soil is classified as cambisols fao unesco 1988 the basic physical and chemical properties of the soil within the 0 20 cm layer are shown in table 1 the mean precipitation and atmospheric temperature every month in wheat season during 2017 2019 were showed in table 2 the sample collection time was shown in table 3 the soil water content before sowing in 2017 and 2018 was shown in table 4 2 2 experimental design the experimental site was cropped with a typical rotation of winter wheat jimai 22 and summer maize zhengdan 958 in northern china this study was based on a 16 year long conservation tillage experiment that began in 2002 and was established as a split plot design replicated three times each plot was 15 m long and 4 m wide this experiment involved four tillage and two straw incorporation methods conventional tillage c 0 subsoiling s 0 rotary tillage r 0 and no tillage n 0 without straw return as well as conventional tillage c w subsoiling s w rotary tillage r w no tillage n w with straw return all kinds of tillage practices were carried out before wheat sowing and no tillage was performed during the maize season the specific operating procedures were as follows 1 conventional tillage c maize harvesting whole straw returning no straw returning stubbling applying basal fertilizer plowing with a moldboard plow 25 35 cm rotary with a rotary cultivator ridging sowing wheat 2 subsoiling s maize harvesting whole straw returning no straw returning stubbling applying basal fertilizer subsoiling with a deep shovel 40 45 cm rotary with a rotary cultivator ridging sowing wheat 3 rotary tillage r maize harvesting whole straw returning no straw returning stubbling applying basal fertilizer rotary with a rotary cultivator 10 15 cm ridging sowing wheat 4 no tillage n maize harvesting whole straw returning no straw returning stubbling applying basal fertilizer ridging sowing wheat the aim of rotary after tillage in above procedures before sowing is to make the ground flat and make the sowing depth consistent and ensure the emergence of seedlings to be neat and uniform ridges was used to eliminate the interaction between plots between winter wheat was generally sown between 10 and 15 october and harvested between 6 and 10 june the following year a basal fertilizer that consisted of 225 kg n ha 1 180 kg p ha 1 and 180 kg k ha 1 was applied before sowing and 110 kg n ha 1 was applied at the jointing stage together with 75 mm of irrigation 2 3 sample collection and determination 2 3 1 determination of soil water content the soil sampling time was shown in table 3 soil samples of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm were collected with three replications after the fresh soil was weighed fs the soil was dried in the oven until constant weight and then the dry soil was weighed ds the soil water content was calculated as follows toumi et al 2016 1 soil water content fs ds 100 2 3 2 determination of delta δ d and δ18o contents in the soil water a minimum of three evaporating dishes each containing 2 mm of liquid paraffin at the bottom to prevent water evaporation were put in the experimental field to collect precipitation irrigation water was collected every 15 min and 6 times per irrigation event soil and wheat base samples were collected in the early morning at the jointing and harvest stages both in the presence and absence of precipitation and irrigation for at least three days soil samples within the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm layers and at 200 cm considered groundwater in this experiment as well as wheat stem base samples were collected all the samples were immediately placed in capped glass bottles that were subsequently sealed with parafilm the soil and wheat samples were preserved at 20 c and precipitation and irrigation water samples were stored at 4 c the water in the soil and plant samples was fully extracted by a liquid water low temperature vacuum extraction system li 2100 lica united technology limited beijing china after the extraction was completed the water hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were determined by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo electron model delta v advantage bremen germany 2 3 3 determination of the gas exchange parameters dry matter quantity grain yield and δ13c content of each organ in wheat the photosynthetic rate a stomatal conductance gs intercellular carbon dioxide concentration ci and transpiration rate tr of wheat were measured by a li 6400 photosynthetic instrument during the jointing stage at the jointing and harvest stages one square meter of wheat was selected in each treatment with three replications the plant material was collected from the selected area and returned to the laboratory where it was first placed in an oven at 105 c to destroy the living components and then dried to a constant weight at 75 c to measure the amount of dry matter grain yield was measured at the harvest stage of wheat after they were dried the leaves stems and ears of the wheat plants were separated and their δ13c values were measured by a thermo delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer 2 4 calculations and analytical methods 2 4 1 contributions of water from different sources to wheat the method was to use isosource software to calculate the contribution of different water sources to wheat the fractional increment was set at 1 and the uncertainty level was set at 0 2 the sensitivity was analyzed with different fractional increments 0 5 2 and at different uncertainty levels 0 1 0 3 and 0 4 the results showed no significant differences in changes in fractional increment and uncertainty level 2 4 2 isotope ratio calculations natural 13c abundance expressed in δ units which indicates the isotopic ratio of a sample relative to that of the pee dee belemnite pdb standard can be calculated as follows farquhar et al 1989a 2 δ13c rsample rstandard 1 1000 where rsample is the isotopic ratio of the study material and rstandard is that of the reference standard pdb isotopic effects can also be expressed by isotopic discrimination values δ because co2 is the source of plant photosynthesis its photosynthetic discrimination value can be described as follows martínez sancho et al 2017 3 δ13c δ13ca δ13cp 1 δ13cp 1000 where δ13ca is the δ13c of atmospheric co2 8 and δ13cp is the δ13c of wheat leaves stems or ears the isotopic discrimination values of leaves stems and ears are represented by δl δs and δe respectively 2 4 3 determination of wue wuet refers to the amount of photosynthate assimilated per unit of water via leaf transpiration and depends on the ratio of leaf net a to the tr wuet represents the behavior of only a portion of the leaves of a plant based on instantaneous photosynthesis and transpiration the formula is as follows farquhar et al 1989a 4 wuet a tr wuei refers to the ratio of a to gs within plant leaves and reflects the inherent regulation of carbon absorption and water dissipation in leaves this metric can be expressed as follows farquhar et al 1989b 5 wuei a gs according to jones 2004 the wuey of crops has been defined as various combinations of the ratio of harvested yield aboveground biomass or total biomass to plant transpiration evapotranspiration et or total available water in the present study wuey was calculated as the percent grain yield divided by the amount of et during the growing season hussain and al jaloud 1995 using the following equation huang et al 2005 6 et p i c sw1 sw2 d r 7 wuey yield et where et mm is the evapotranspiration p mm is the effective precipitation during the growing season i mm is the irrigation c mm is the upward flow of water into the root zone sw1 mm is the soil water content at the time at which the crop was sown sw2 mm is the soil water content at the time at which the crop was harvested d is the downward drainage from the root zone and r is the surface runoff in the study area the ground was flat and the visual surface runoff could be considered null the groundwater depth was below 4 m the amount of groundwater recharge could therefore be considered negligible the depth of infiltration was not greater than 2 m thus the depth of the leakage could be considered null therefore c d and r terms in the above equation could be ignored 2 5 statistical analyses the figure data were analyzed and visualized by sigmaplot ver 12 5 systat software inc san jose usa significant differences between treatments were assessed using spss 18 0 statistical analysis system software spss 2009 duncan s test at p 0 05 and p 0 01 3 results 3 1 isotopic composition of water the hydrogen isotope value δd of the precipitation water ranged from 88 24 to 21 36 with an average value of 56 73 the oxygen isotope value δ18o ranged from 11 90 to 2 68 with an average value of 7 42 fig 1 the variation range of hydrogen isotope value was higher than that of oxygen isotope there was a significant linear relationship between hydrogen and oxygen in all water samples and δd and δ18o are evenly distributed in all water samples the stable isotopic distribution of stem water of wheat was near the fitting line of the soil water which indicated that the wheat stem water originated from soil water during this stage the irrigation water originated from a well next to the experimental field in the present study water at a depth of 2 m was considered groundwater the distribution of δd and δ18o in the irrigation water and groundwater was relatively concentrated while that in the precipitation water and soil water was more dispersed at the wheat jointing stage the δd and δ18o of the soil water ranged from 55 80 r 0 to 45 19 c w and 10 n w to 7 23 c w respectively within the 0 20 cm soil layer the δd and δ18o of the soil ranged from 70 63 s w and n w to 65 06 r 0 and 13 52 c w to 12 34 c 0 respectively within the 20 100 cm soil layer fig 2 a at the wheat harvest stage the δd and δ18o of the soil water ranged from 45 06 c w to 29 45 n w and 9 42 r 0 to 6 02 c 0 respectively within the 0 20 cm soil layer the δd and δ18o of the soil ranged from 73 34 s w and n w to 65 07 r 0 and 13 71 c w to 11 51 c 0 respectively within the 20 100 cm soil layer fig 2b in the 20 100 cm soil layer the treatments of the highest and lowest hydrogen and oxygen isotope values in the two periods were consistent the line fitting between the δd and δ18o of the soil water was calculated as δd 4 79δ18o 7 26 r2 0 702 p 0 0001 the δd of the soil water did not significantly differ between treatments table 5 while the δ18o of the soil water in c 0 was significantly greater than that in other treatments p 0 05 the δd and δ18o of the soil water within the 0 20 cm soil layer were significantly greater than those within the 20 100 cm soil layer p 0 05 with the soil depth the hydrogen and oxygen isotope values decreased this was because the seasonal variation of soil water input the evaporation of surface layer or the difference between soil water and groundwater soil water produced obvious isotopic composition gradient with the change of soil depth 3 2 wheat water uptake from different soil layer at the jointing stage wheat absorbed water mainly within the 0 20 cm soil layer the contribution of this soil profile was 86 22 and was significantly greater than that of the other soil profiles p 0 05 at the harvest stage wheat absorbed water mainly within the 0 20 56 36 and 20 40 cm 38 74 soil layers table 6 from jointing stage to harvest stage the depth of soil water used by wheat gradually deepened 3 3 dry matter quantity grain yield and wue of wheat at the jointing and harvest stages compared with that in the c 0 treatment the wheat dry matter quantity in the s w treatment increased by 14 20 and 5 54 at the jointing and harvest stages respectively table 7 moreover the dry matter quantity in the n 0 treatment was significantly lower than that in the c 0 treatment at both stages p 0 05 similarly compared with that in the c 0 treatment the grain yield in the s w treatment increased by 18 and the grain yield in the n 0 treatment was the lowest at the harvest stage the instantaneous water use efficiency wuet in the s w treatment was significantly greater than that in the other treatments p 0 05 except c w and compared with that in the c 0 treatment it increased by 46 21 in addition the wuet in the n 0 treatment was the lowest at the jointing stage the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei in the s w treatment was significantly greater than that in the other treatments p 0 05 and compared with that in the c 0 treatment it increased by 45 31 in addition the wuei in the n 0 treatment was significantly lower than that in the c 0 treatment p 0 05 at the jointing stage compared with that in the c 0 treatment the yield water use efficiency wuey in the s w treatment increased by 14 86 and 5 69 at the jointing and harvest stages respectively and the wuey in the n 0 treatment was significantly lower than that in the other treatments at both stages p 0 05 therefore compared with other treatments s w treatment can improve dry matter quality grain yield and water use efficiency however after long term no tillage treatment these indexes were significantly reduced 3 4 relationships between δl δs and δe and grain yield dry matter quantity and wue under different tillage and straw treatments as shown in fig 3 there were significant positive correlations between the carbon isotopic discrimination of leaves δl and grain yield p 0 05 dry matter quantity p 0 01 and wuey p 0 01 the carbon isotopic discrimination of stems δs was significantly positively correlated with grain yield dry matter quantity wuei and wuey at the p 0 01 level and with wuet at the p 0 05 level in addition there were significant positive correlations between the carbon isotopic discrimination of ears δe and wuet and wuei at the p 0 05 level and with dry matter quantity and wuey at the p 0 01 level therefore it was possible that the carbon isotope in different plant organs can indicate changes of dry matter grain yield and wue 4 discussion 4 1 contributions of water from different soil layers to wheat in the present study the δd and δ18o of the topsoil water were significantly different from those of the deep layer moreover the δ18o of soil water in 0 20 cm soil layer were significantly different among treatments this difference may be the result of situation during precipitation isotope fractionation occurs due to the influence of temperature elevation and other factors resulting in differences in isotopes in precipitation in different time and space maguas and griffiths 2003 the spatio temporal difference of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation will lead to the spatio temporal difference of soil water surface water groundwater and plant water in addition this difference may be because changes in δd and δ18o caused by soil evaporation english et al 2007 wang et al 2010 ma and song 2016 in the process of soil evaporation light isotope molecules evaporate upward first so the concentration of heavier oxygen isotope in the surface soil becomes larger soil evaporation increased the concentration of 18o in shallow soil throughout a long period of time before irrigation allison and leaney 1982 because of the limited precipitation irrigation water is very important to the growth of winter wheat under low moisture conditions guan et al 2015 wu et al 2016 obtained the same results when studying the water absorption of maize previous studies have shown that winter wheat absorbs mainly shallow water 0 20 cm during most growth stages whereas at the anthesis and filling stages soil water is absorbed mainly within 20 40 cm zhao et al 2018 in the present study wheat roots mainly absorbed water of 0 20 and 0 40 cm soil layers at jointing stage and harvest stage respectively these phenomena may occur because most wheat roots grow within the 0 40 cm soil layer li et al 2006a and the dry root weight density of winter wheat is positively correlated with the contribution of water uptake zhao et al 2018 however in the late stage of wheat growth there may be two reasons for the decrease of water absorption ratio in shallow layer one was that the roots grew deeper with the growth of plants which made it possible for the plants to use more water from the deeper soil layers another possible reason is the senescence of the root system on the surface reducing the water absorption from shallow layer yang et al 2018 4 2 effects of different tillage and straw treatments on the grain yield and wue of wheat at the jointing and harvest stages wang et al 2004 reported that compared with those under conventional tillage the yield and wue of wheat under subsoiling increased significantly by 18 8 and 16 8 respectively zhang et al 2013 reported that crop yields and wue increased by 19 2 and 10 1 respectively under subsoiling compared with conventional tillage on the loess plateau in addition because the retention of crop residue on the soil surface the evaporation of water was reduced and the wue increased jalota et al 2000 in the present study the δd and δ18o values of no straw returning were higher than those of straw returning which also indicated that the evaporation of soil water under straw returning would reduce su et al 2007 reported that no tillage and subsoiling were the best tillage methods for increasing water reserves wheat yields wue and energy conservation in this present study however the grain yield and wue of the subsoiling with straw return were the highest but the no tillage without straw return was the lowest because long term continuous no tillage can easily lead to soil compaction raper et al 1994 and soil compaction can limit the infiltration of rainwater and the absorption of deep soil moisture by crops which will decrease crop yield unger and kaspar 1994 in this present study higher δd and δ18o values of deep soil water under no tillage with no straw returning condition may resulted by lower rainwater infiltration and water deficit in addition rotary tillage reduces soil plow layer thickness and decreases the infiltration quantity of water thus reducing wheat yields bengough et al 2006 the δd and δ18o values of deep soil water under rotary tillage were also higher than those of conventional tillage and subsoiling which also indicated that there was water deficit in deep soil layers 4 3 relationships between δl δs and δe and grain yield dry matter quantity and wue under different tillage and straw treatments different crops or crop organs were found to have different isotopic compositions brugnoli and farquhar 2000 merah et al 2001 reported significant positive correlations between δe and wheat yields and between δl and wheat yields in the present study δe was positively correlated with grain yield and the δl was positively correlated with wuet and wuei however there were significant negative correlations between δl and wuet and wuei in wheat under water deficit conditions cabrera bosquet et al 2007 studies have shown that δe can be used to compare wuey and et because δe can reflect the effects of environmental factors such as water change on plant cui et al 2009 in rice a positive correlation between δe and wuey under different water deficit conditions was reported andrea et al 2006 another study has shown that the δl and δe of rice are significantly negatively correlated with wuey anyia et al 2007 cui et al 2009 showed that δl had better indicator for wuey and δe for yield in this study however δe was the worst indicator to grain yield compared with δl or δs these different results may be related to different experimental treatments crop species and climatic environments in a word the δ13c of different organs includingδl δs and δe can compare the response of wheat to tillage and straw returning methods and then compared the wue thus indirectly indicating crop yield and water use efficiency 5 conclusions by the use of the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope method this study showed that at the jointing stage wheat absorbed water mainly from the 0 20 cm soil layer and that at the harvest stage soil water use within the 0 20 cm decreased while 20 40 cm layers increased the results of a 16 year long tillage experiment showed that the dry matter quantity grain yield and wue of wheat significantly improved under subsoiling with straw return compared with other tillage treatments under conditions of no tillage with or without straw return the wheat yield dry matter quantity and wue were relatively low therefore subsoiling is conducive to increasing wheat yields and improving wue the δ13c values of the wheat leaves stems and ears were significantly positively correlated with the yield dry matter quantity and wue of wheat at the p 0 05 or 0 01 level positive correlations between δl and wuet and wuei and between δe and grain yield were recorded thus the δ13c values of wheat organs can be used to indicate changes and differences in the yield and wue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

10765,to quantify the water absorbed by wheat in different soil layers and improve both wheat yields and water use efficiency wue a 2 year conservation tillage and straw treatment experiment was implemented this experiment involved four tillage methods conventional tillage c subsoiling s rotary tillage r and no tillage n and two straw treatments straw return w and no straw return 0 the hydrogen oxygen and carbon stable isotope method was used to evaluate the water source grain yield dry matter quantity and wue of wheat as well as the relationships between δ13c values of the wheat leaves stems ears and yield and the wue under different tillage and straw treatment methods at the jointing and harvest stages the results indicated that wheat water uptake occurred mainly within the 0 20 cm 86 22 soil layer at the jointing stage and within the 0 20 56 36 and 20 40 cm 38 74 soil layers at the harvest stage compared with those in the c 0 treatment the dry matter quantity in the s w treatment increased by 14 86 and 14 20 respectively at the jointing stage and the harvest stage the grain yield in the s w treatment significantly increased by 18 at the harvest stage p 0 05 the wuet and wuei in the s w treatment significantly increased by 46 21 and 45 31 respectively at the jointing stage p 0 05 and the wuey increased by 5 69 and 5 54 respectively at the jointing stage and the harvest stage the δ13c vales of the wheat leaves stems and ears were positively correlated with the yield dry matter quantity and wue of wheat in conclusion subsoiling with straw return should be adopted as a promising strategy for improving both wheat productivity and wue and for retaining soil water availability the δ13c value of wheat organs can be used to indicate changes in wheat yield and wue keywords subsoiling stable isotope water sources wheat yield water use efficiency 1 introduction in recent decades increasing amounts of attention have been paid to the interactions between precipitation soil water groundwater and plant stem water wang et al 2009 however estimating the important effects of these fluxes on the improvement of crop water use efficiency wue by quantifying the water fluxes of evaporation transpiration and drainage at the soil plant atmosphere interface is difficult the water absorption of the root system plays a very important role in the water interaction in the soil plant atmosphere ecosystem asbjornsen et al 2007 absorbing water by their root system and transpiration of leaves plants regulate the rate and amount of water reentering the land water cycle thus regulating the energy flow and cycle of materials in an ecosystem in contrast plant metabolism and soil resources affect plant physiological functions via soil moisture availability hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope methods have received extensive amounts of attention for predicting water sources in forest grassland and farmland ecosystems yang et al 2015 because water does not exchange with the external environment while being transported from the soil to the plant root system and through xylem vessels usually no isotope fractionation occurs white et al 1985 the isotopic composition of water in the xylem of plant stems can reflect the isotope information of the source of that water zimmermann et al 1967 therefore the contribution of these sources to plants can be determined by comparing the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen between plant stem water and possible water sources brunel et al 1995 the difference between isotopes from the different water source is caused by isotope fractionation while the main causes of isotope fractionation are physicochemical processes such as evaporation falling and infiltration asbjornsen et al 2007 soil water is the most important source of water for plants because the nature of the soil itself such as particle size and porosity there are differences in stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen at different soil layers generally speaking the moisture in the surface soil is relatively high in evaporation intensity due to easier contact with air thus resulting in stable isotope fractionation of hydrogen and oxygen according to the above theory light molecules are preferentially evaporated so the surface soil water is more enriched with heavier stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen than the deeper soil water therefore the stable isotope composition of hydrogen and oxygen in soil water at different soil depths is significantly different and is relatively stable until the deeper soil layer asbjornsen et al 2007 it is precisely because of various physical and chemical processes in nature that hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes from different sources are fractionated to different degrees which provides a research basis for quantitatively distinguishing different water sources of plants burgess et al 2000 most relevant studies have used the direct comparison method sekiya and yano 2002 and the equal source mixed model to determine plant water sources phillips et al 2005 a two layer mixed model was used to study the water supply status of pine trees during different seasons in central and southern texas the results showed that the main use of groundwater occurred during the dry and hot seasons whereas soil moisture was mainly used during the cold and wet seasons mccole and stern 2007 asbjornsen et al 2007 reported that maize and prairie plants obtain 45 and 36 of their water from the 0 20 cm soil layer respectively the contribution of soil moisture within a depth of 0 100 cm was studied by the use of a stable isotope technique moreover soil water at different growth stages was absorbed mainly within the 0 40 cm soil layer zhang et al 2011 wue is an important index that reflects the ability of plants to adapt to drought environments the wue can be divided into three forms wuet photosynthetic rate transpiration rate a tr wue at the leaf level wuei photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance a gs erice et al 2007 and wue at the yield level wuey yield crop water consumption y et jones 2004 reported that δ13c can be used to predict the wue of c3 plants the δ13c values of different plant organs can indicate the wue at different levels for example condon et al 1987 pointed out that in south australia grain δ13c δe was positively correlated with wheat grain yield in addition farquhar et al 1989a reported a negative correlation between δ13c δl and wuei in c3 plants with respect to improving crop yield and wue land use methods are very important in agriculture conservation tillage is a new type of tillage different from traditional tillage in terms of operation time and production cost mainly including reduced tillage no tillage and straw mulching etc scsa 1982 conservation tillage can help preserve soil and water increase soil moisture contents and improve soil quality and crop yields all of which are conducive to the sustainable development of agricultural production balwinder singh et al 2011 conventional tillage reduces soil water retention and disrupts soil structural stability biological activity and nutrient supplies and storage bissett et al 2013 especially in wheat fields conventional tillage leads to a relatively narrow plow layer and hinders the flow of air and water thus inhibiting root growth and reducing yields huang et al 2012 as such the sustainable development of agriculture in the huang huai hai region of china has been adversely affected by the destruction of soil structure latifmanesh et al 2018 thus reducing the wue compared with conventional tillage subsoiling can reduce the effects of soil compaction on crop yield jennings et al 2012 while increasing root elongation and the effects of moisture on crop growth lampurlanés et al 2001 in addition no tillage and subsoiling with straw mulch usually result in an increase in chlorophyll pigment content and net photosynthetic rate in flag leaves li et al 2006b therefore conservation tillage can improve soil water storage capacity and crop yield thus increasing economic benefits gicheru et al 2004 however guzha 2004 reported that the yield of wheat under reduced tillage and no tillage conditions was lower than that under conventional tillage conditions many studies have investigated wue in response to irrigation and water deficit treatments but relatively little research exists on the wue of crops under different tillage methods therefore four tillage and two straw treatment methods were used as part of a 16 year long term experiment the hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of the precipitation groundwater irrigation water soil water and stem water as well as the carbon isotope values of the leaves stems and ears of the wheat plants were determined at the jointing and harvest stages moreover the soil water content dry matter quantity of aboveground plant parts and wheat yields were determined the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the contributions of water from different soil layers to wheat 2 compare the crop yields and wue values under different tillage and straw treatments and 3 evaluate the relationships between the δ13c values of different wheat organs and crop yield dry matter quantity and wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 trial site this experiment was conducted at tai an northern china 36 09 n 117 09 e altitude 130 m above sea level which has a typical temperate continental monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 12 82 c and the annual average rainfall was 956 69 mm from october 2017 to june 2019 the soil is classified as cambisols fao unesco 1988 the basic physical and chemical properties of the soil within the 0 20 cm layer are shown in table 1 the mean precipitation and atmospheric temperature every month in wheat season during 2017 2019 were showed in table 2 the sample collection time was shown in table 3 the soil water content before sowing in 2017 and 2018 was shown in table 4 2 2 experimental design the experimental site was cropped with a typical rotation of winter wheat jimai 22 and summer maize zhengdan 958 in northern china this study was based on a 16 year long conservation tillage experiment that began in 2002 and was established as a split plot design replicated three times each plot was 15 m long and 4 m wide this experiment involved four tillage and two straw incorporation methods conventional tillage c 0 subsoiling s 0 rotary tillage r 0 and no tillage n 0 without straw return as well as conventional tillage c w subsoiling s w rotary tillage r w no tillage n w with straw return all kinds of tillage practices were carried out before wheat sowing and no tillage was performed during the maize season the specific operating procedures were as follows 1 conventional tillage c maize harvesting whole straw returning no straw returning stubbling applying basal fertilizer plowing with a moldboard plow 25 35 cm rotary with a rotary cultivator ridging sowing wheat 2 subsoiling s maize harvesting whole straw returning no straw returning stubbling applying basal fertilizer subsoiling with a deep shovel 40 45 cm rotary with a rotary cultivator ridging sowing wheat 3 rotary tillage r maize harvesting whole straw returning no straw returning stubbling applying basal fertilizer rotary with a rotary cultivator 10 15 cm ridging sowing wheat 4 no tillage n maize harvesting whole straw returning no straw returning stubbling applying basal fertilizer ridging sowing wheat the aim of rotary after tillage in above procedures before sowing is to make the ground flat and make the sowing depth consistent and ensure the emergence of seedlings to be neat and uniform ridges was used to eliminate the interaction between plots between winter wheat was generally sown between 10 and 15 october and harvested between 6 and 10 june the following year a basal fertilizer that consisted of 225 kg n ha 1 180 kg p ha 1 and 180 kg k ha 1 was applied before sowing and 110 kg n ha 1 was applied at the jointing stage together with 75 mm of irrigation 2 3 sample collection and determination 2 3 1 determination of soil water content the soil sampling time was shown in table 3 soil samples of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm were collected with three replications after the fresh soil was weighed fs the soil was dried in the oven until constant weight and then the dry soil was weighed ds the soil water content was calculated as follows toumi et al 2016 1 soil water content fs ds 100 2 3 2 determination of delta δ d and δ18o contents in the soil water a minimum of three evaporating dishes each containing 2 mm of liquid paraffin at the bottom to prevent water evaporation were put in the experimental field to collect precipitation irrigation water was collected every 15 min and 6 times per irrigation event soil and wheat base samples were collected in the early morning at the jointing and harvest stages both in the presence and absence of precipitation and irrigation for at least three days soil samples within the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm layers and at 200 cm considered groundwater in this experiment as well as wheat stem base samples were collected all the samples were immediately placed in capped glass bottles that were subsequently sealed with parafilm the soil and wheat samples were preserved at 20 c and precipitation and irrigation water samples were stored at 4 c the water in the soil and plant samples was fully extracted by a liquid water low temperature vacuum extraction system li 2100 lica united technology limited beijing china after the extraction was completed the water hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were determined by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo electron model delta v advantage bremen germany 2 3 3 determination of the gas exchange parameters dry matter quantity grain yield and δ13c content of each organ in wheat the photosynthetic rate a stomatal conductance gs intercellular carbon dioxide concentration ci and transpiration rate tr of wheat were measured by a li 6400 photosynthetic instrument during the jointing stage at the jointing and harvest stages one square meter of wheat was selected in each treatment with three replications the plant material was collected from the selected area and returned to the laboratory where it was first placed in an oven at 105 c to destroy the living components and then dried to a constant weight at 75 c to measure the amount of dry matter grain yield was measured at the harvest stage of wheat after they were dried the leaves stems and ears of the wheat plants were separated and their δ13c values were measured by a thermo delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer 2 4 calculations and analytical methods 2 4 1 contributions of water from different sources to wheat the method was to use isosource software to calculate the contribution of different water sources to wheat the fractional increment was set at 1 and the uncertainty level was set at 0 2 the sensitivity was analyzed with different fractional increments 0 5 2 and at different uncertainty levels 0 1 0 3 and 0 4 the results showed no significant differences in changes in fractional increment and uncertainty level 2 4 2 isotope ratio calculations natural 13c abundance expressed in δ units which indicates the isotopic ratio of a sample relative to that of the pee dee belemnite pdb standard can be calculated as follows farquhar et al 1989a 2 δ13c rsample rstandard 1 1000 where rsample is the isotopic ratio of the study material and rstandard is that of the reference standard pdb isotopic effects can also be expressed by isotopic discrimination values δ because co2 is the source of plant photosynthesis its photosynthetic discrimination value can be described as follows martínez sancho et al 2017 3 δ13c δ13ca δ13cp 1 δ13cp 1000 where δ13ca is the δ13c of atmospheric co2 8 and δ13cp is the δ13c of wheat leaves stems or ears the isotopic discrimination values of leaves stems and ears are represented by δl δs and δe respectively 2 4 3 determination of wue wuet refers to the amount of photosynthate assimilated per unit of water via leaf transpiration and depends on the ratio of leaf net a to the tr wuet represents the behavior of only a portion of the leaves of a plant based on instantaneous photosynthesis and transpiration the formula is as follows farquhar et al 1989a 4 wuet a tr wuei refers to the ratio of a to gs within plant leaves and reflects the inherent regulation of carbon absorption and water dissipation in leaves this metric can be expressed as follows farquhar et al 1989b 5 wuei a gs according to jones 2004 the wuey of crops has been defined as various combinations of the ratio of harvested yield aboveground biomass or total biomass to plant transpiration evapotranspiration et or total available water in the present study wuey was calculated as the percent grain yield divided by the amount of et during the growing season hussain and al jaloud 1995 using the following equation huang et al 2005 6 et p i c sw1 sw2 d r 7 wuey yield et where et mm is the evapotranspiration p mm is the effective precipitation during the growing season i mm is the irrigation c mm is the upward flow of water into the root zone sw1 mm is the soil water content at the time at which the crop was sown sw2 mm is the soil water content at the time at which the crop was harvested d is the downward drainage from the root zone and r is the surface runoff in the study area the ground was flat and the visual surface runoff could be considered null the groundwater depth was below 4 m the amount of groundwater recharge could therefore be considered negligible the depth of infiltration was not greater than 2 m thus the depth of the leakage could be considered null therefore c d and r terms in the above equation could be ignored 2 5 statistical analyses the figure data were analyzed and visualized by sigmaplot ver 12 5 systat software inc san jose usa significant differences between treatments were assessed using spss 18 0 statistical analysis system software spss 2009 duncan s test at p 0 05 and p 0 01 3 results 3 1 isotopic composition of water the hydrogen isotope value δd of the precipitation water ranged from 88 24 to 21 36 with an average value of 56 73 the oxygen isotope value δ18o ranged from 11 90 to 2 68 with an average value of 7 42 fig 1 the variation range of hydrogen isotope value was higher than that of oxygen isotope there was a significant linear relationship between hydrogen and oxygen in all water samples and δd and δ18o are evenly distributed in all water samples the stable isotopic distribution of stem water of wheat was near the fitting line of the soil water which indicated that the wheat stem water originated from soil water during this stage the irrigation water originated from a well next to the experimental field in the present study water at a depth of 2 m was considered groundwater the distribution of δd and δ18o in the irrigation water and groundwater was relatively concentrated while that in the precipitation water and soil water was more dispersed at the wheat jointing stage the δd and δ18o of the soil water ranged from 55 80 r 0 to 45 19 c w and 10 n w to 7 23 c w respectively within the 0 20 cm soil layer the δd and δ18o of the soil ranged from 70 63 s w and n w to 65 06 r 0 and 13 52 c w to 12 34 c 0 respectively within the 20 100 cm soil layer fig 2 a at the wheat harvest stage the δd and δ18o of the soil water ranged from 45 06 c w to 29 45 n w and 9 42 r 0 to 6 02 c 0 respectively within the 0 20 cm soil layer the δd and δ18o of the soil ranged from 73 34 s w and n w to 65 07 r 0 and 13 71 c w to 11 51 c 0 respectively within the 20 100 cm soil layer fig 2b in the 20 100 cm soil layer the treatments of the highest and lowest hydrogen and oxygen isotope values in the two periods were consistent the line fitting between the δd and δ18o of the soil water was calculated as δd 4 79δ18o 7 26 r2 0 702 p 0 0001 the δd of the soil water did not significantly differ between treatments table 5 while the δ18o of the soil water in c 0 was significantly greater than that in other treatments p 0 05 the δd and δ18o of the soil water within the 0 20 cm soil layer were significantly greater than those within the 20 100 cm soil layer p 0 05 with the soil depth the hydrogen and oxygen isotope values decreased this was because the seasonal variation of soil water input the evaporation of surface layer or the difference between soil water and groundwater soil water produced obvious isotopic composition gradient with the change of soil depth 3 2 wheat water uptake from different soil layer at the jointing stage wheat absorbed water mainly within the 0 20 cm soil layer the contribution of this soil profile was 86 22 and was significantly greater than that of the other soil profiles p 0 05 at the harvest stage wheat absorbed water mainly within the 0 20 56 36 and 20 40 cm 38 74 soil layers table 6 from jointing stage to harvest stage the depth of soil water used by wheat gradually deepened 3 3 dry matter quantity grain yield and wue of wheat at the jointing and harvest stages compared with that in the c 0 treatment the wheat dry matter quantity in the s w treatment increased by 14 20 and 5 54 at the jointing and harvest stages respectively table 7 moreover the dry matter quantity in the n 0 treatment was significantly lower than that in the c 0 treatment at both stages p 0 05 similarly compared with that in the c 0 treatment the grain yield in the s w treatment increased by 18 and the grain yield in the n 0 treatment was the lowest at the harvest stage the instantaneous water use efficiency wuet in the s w treatment was significantly greater than that in the other treatments p 0 05 except c w and compared with that in the c 0 treatment it increased by 46 21 in addition the wuet in the n 0 treatment was the lowest at the jointing stage the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei in the s w treatment was significantly greater than that in the other treatments p 0 05 and compared with that in the c 0 treatment it increased by 45 31 in addition the wuei in the n 0 treatment was significantly lower than that in the c 0 treatment p 0 05 at the jointing stage compared with that in the c 0 treatment the yield water use efficiency wuey in the s w treatment increased by 14 86 and 5 69 at the jointing and harvest stages respectively and the wuey in the n 0 treatment was significantly lower than that in the other treatments at both stages p 0 05 therefore compared with other treatments s w treatment can improve dry matter quality grain yield and water use efficiency however after long term no tillage treatment these indexes were significantly reduced 3 4 relationships between δl δs and δe and grain yield dry matter quantity and wue under different tillage and straw treatments as shown in fig 3 there were significant positive correlations between the carbon isotopic discrimination of leaves δl and grain yield p 0 05 dry matter quantity p 0 01 and wuey p 0 01 the carbon isotopic discrimination of stems δs was significantly positively correlated with grain yield dry matter quantity wuei and wuey at the p 0 01 level and with wuet at the p 0 05 level in addition there were significant positive correlations between the carbon isotopic discrimination of ears δe and wuet and wuei at the p 0 05 level and with dry matter quantity and wuey at the p 0 01 level therefore it was possible that the carbon isotope in different plant organs can indicate changes of dry matter grain yield and wue 4 discussion 4 1 contributions of water from different soil layers to wheat in the present study the δd and δ18o of the topsoil water were significantly different from those of the deep layer moreover the δ18o of soil water in 0 20 cm soil layer were significantly different among treatments this difference may be the result of situation during precipitation isotope fractionation occurs due to the influence of temperature elevation and other factors resulting in differences in isotopes in precipitation in different time and space maguas and griffiths 2003 the spatio temporal difference of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation will lead to the spatio temporal difference of soil water surface water groundwater and plant water in addition this difference may be because changes in δd and δ18o caused by soil evaporation english et al 2007 wang et al 2010 ma and song 2016 in the process of soil evaporation light isotope molecules evaporate upward first so the concentration of heavier oxygen isotope in the surface soil becomes larger soil evaporation increased the concentration of 18o in shallow soil throughout a long period of time before irrigation allison and leaney 1982 because of the limited precipitation irrigation water is very important to the growth of winter wheat under low moisture conditions guan et al 2015 wu et al 2016 obtained the same results when studying the water absorption of maize previous studies have shown that winter wheat absorbs mainly shallow water 0 20 cm during most growth stages whereas at the anthesis and filling stages soil water is absorbed mainly within 20 40 cm zhao et al 2018 in the present study wheat roots mainly absorbed water of 0 20 and 0 40 cm soil layers at jointing stage and harvest stage respectively these phenomena may occur because most wheat roots grow within the 0 40 cm soil layer li et al 2006a and the dry root weight density of winter wheat is positively correlated with the contribution of water uptake zhao et al 2018 however in the late stage of wheat growth there may be two reasons for the decrease of water absorption ratio in shallow layer one was that the roots grew deeper with the growth of plants which made it possible for the plants to use more water from the deeper soil layers another possible reason is the senescence of the root system on the surface reducing the water absorption from shallow layer yang et al 2018 4 2 effects of different tillage and straw treatments on the grain yield and wue of wheat at the jointing and harvest stages wang et al 2004 reported that compared with those under conventional tillage the yield and wue of wheat under subsoiling increased significantly by 18 8 and 16 8 respectively zhang et al 2013 reported that crop yields and wue increased by 19 2 and 10 1 respectively under subsoiling compared with conventional tillage on the loess plateau in addition because the retention of crop residue on the soil surface the evaporation of water was reduced and the wue increased jalota et al 2000 in the present study the δd and δ18o values of no straw returning were higher than those of straw returning which also indicated that the evaporation of soil water under straw returning would reduce su et al 2007 reported that no tillage and subsoiling were the best tillage methods for increasing water reserves wheat yields wue and energy conservation in this present study however the grain yield and wue of the subsoiling with straw return were the highest but the no tillage without straw return was the lowest because long term continuous no tillage can easily lead to soil compaction raper et al 1994 and soil compaction can limit the infiltration of rainwater and the absorption of deep soil moisture by crops which will decrease crop yield unger and kaspar 1994 in this present study higher δd and δ18o values of deep soil water under no tillage with no straw returning condition may resulted by lower rainwater infiltration and water deficit in addition rotary tillage reduces soil plow layer thickness and decreases the infiltration quantity of water thus reducing wheat yields bengough et al 2006 the δd and δ18o values of deep soil water under rotary tillage were also higher than those of conventional tillage and subsoiling which also indicated that there was water deficit in deep soil layers 4 3 relationships between δl δs and δe and grain yield dry matter quantity and wue under different tillage and straw treatments different crops or crop organs were found to have different isotopic compositions brugnoli and farquhar 2000 merah et al 2001 reported significant positive correlations between δe and wheat yields and between δl and wheat yields in the present study δe was positively correlated with grain yield and the δl was positively correlated with wuet and wuei however there were significant negative correlations between δl and wuet and wuei in wheat under water deficit conditions cabrera bosquet et al 2007 studies have shown that δe can be used to compare wuey and et because δe can reflect the effects of environmental factors such as water change on plant cui et al 2009 in rice a positive correlation between δe and wuey under different water deficit conditions was reported andrea et al 2006 another study has shown that the δl and δe of rice are significantly negatively correlated with wuey anyia et al 2007 cui et al 2009 showed that δl had better indicator for wuey and δe for yield in this study however δe was the worst indicator to grain yield compared with δl or δs these different results may be related to different experimental treatments crop species and climatic environments in a word the δ13c of different organs includingδl δs and δe can compare the response of wheat to tillage and straw returning methods and then compared the wue thus indirectly indicating crop yield and water use efficiency 5 conclusions by the use of the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope method this study showed that at the jointing stage wheat absorbed water mainly from the 0 20 cm soil layer and that at the harvest stage soil water use within the 0 20 cm decreased while 20 40 cm layers increased the results of a 16 year long tillage experiment showed that the dry matter quantity grain yield and wue of wheat significantly improved under subsoiling with straw return compared with other tillage treatments under conditions of no tillage with or without straw return the wheat yield dry matter quantity and wue were relatively low therefore subsoiling is conducive to increasing wheat yields and improving wue the δ13c values of the wheat leaves stems and ears were significantly positively correlated with the yield dry matter quantity and wue of wheat at the p 0 05 or 0 01 level positive correlations between δl and wuet and wuei and between δe and grain yield were recorded thus the δ13c values of wheat organs can be used to indicate changes and differences in the yield and wue declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

10766,the use of photovoltaic pv energy in irrigation is increasing its relevance as energy source in irrigated agriculture the main reason relays on its economic and environmental benefits compared to traditional options to reduce economic materials and energy requirements of pv irrigation systems its design and dimensioning should be optimal in this work we developed the model mopiss model for optimal photovoltaic irrigation system sizing focussed on the selection of pipe diameters and pv plant dimensioning optimizing jointly the investment cost and operation of the system mopiss developed in matlab integrated a customized version of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii with two objective functions aimed at searching the optimal sizing of the irrigation network and pv plant the results showed a series of solutions with optimal hydrants grouping in sectors pipe diameters and pv plant size mopiss was applied to a real case study obtaining solutions which satisfied 96 of the irrigation requirements while saved cost between 22 9 and 38 2 over the total investment cost compared with the original design mopiss is a useful tool to produce optimal designs of sizing new pv irrigation system under a comprehensive approach that considers crop water and energy availability and network layout keywords mopiss photovoltaic irrigation optimization pipe diameters dimensioning pv peak power nsgaii genetic algorithm 1 introduction nowadays the remarkable increase in energy consumption and the general concern about global warming has promoted the use of renewable energies in the irrigation agriculture sector related to this photovoltaic pv technology offers a more sustainable alternative for the energy supply compared to traditional options such as diesel generators and grid electricity giz 2016 this technology has a lower environmental burden due to the virtually zero environmental impacts associated to its operation mérida garcía et al 2019 furthermore the period with the highest pv energy production usually coincides with the irrigation season for a wide variety of crops nevertheless as the energy production levels rely on the instant irradiation lópez luque et al 2015 that is affected by the occurrence of clouds the management of an irrigation network just powered by pv energy results much more complex thus the variable power availability must be properly managed to fully satisfy the daily irrigation requirements of the different sectors of a network for the optimal dimensioning of the pv irrigation system it should be considered the variability of the solar radiation throughout the irrigation season and during the day moreover the hydrants location and the layout of the irrigation network determine the power demand of each sector of the irrigation network conditioning the pumping power and the size of the pv plant for that reason the sizes of the pipes of the irrigation network and the size of the pv plant should be determined jointly the search for optimal design solutions in the water distribution network sector has been widely studied by numerous authors tayfur 2017 summarized the main characteristics of the most popular optimization methods used in water resources planning engineering and management among them the genetic algorithms ga ant colony ac differential evolution de particle swarm ps harmony search hs genetic programming gp and genetic programming expression gpe can be highlighted creaco and franchini 2014 presented a procedure to find optimal solutions in the cost reliability space for multi objective design of looped water distribution systems this work pointed out the computational and numerical efficiency of low level hybrid optimization procedures for multi objective water network design most recently fernández garcía et al 2017 presented an optimization methodology for the design and operational costs of pressurized irrigation networks using the ngsa ii algorithm lapo et al 2017 combined linear programming lp and ga in a hybrid model to optimize the pipe design operating pressure at the head of the network total investment cost and working shifts assigned to each hydrant all these works focussed on the optimal design of the irrigation network while none of them questions the availability and characteristics of the energy source on the other hand related to the adoption of pv technology in the irrigation sector several works focused on the development of optimal sizing methods the aim of these works was to determine the optimal peak power for the pv plant to satisfy crop irrigation requirements using the existing irrigation network bakelli et al 2011 lópez luque et al 2015 in order to reduce the dependence on climate factors other works also focused on the optimal management of installations which incorporated some water energy storage elements as well as auxiliary support systems e g diesel generator in that way wissem et al 2012 reges et al 2016 and yahyaoui et al 2016 studied the inclusion of batteries in the system later rodríguez gallegos et al 2017 studied the combination of the pv modules with both a battery and a diesel generator this pv battery diesel combination allowed reducing the overall system cost and control of the grid voltage based on ps methods in a similar way the hybridization of the pv plant with other renewable energy supply systems as wind or water turbines was also evaluated by ouachani et al 2017 and ramli et al 2018 another common application of pv technology in irrigation is the use of an intermediate water storage tank this tank is located at a higher level to feed the irrigation system by gravity olcan 2015 kabalci et al 2016 ghavidel et al 2016 muhsen et al 2018 this option is possible for relatively small plots with a suitable height difference these actions generally offer more flexibility to the system operation but have higher economic and in some cases higher environmental cost due to material requirements nevertheless mérida garcía et al 2018 proved that some crops as olive orchard in southern spain could be irrigated with a pv plant by a direct injection irrigation system without storage elements this was possible using a real time synchronization model which searched for the best fit between the power production and irrigation requirements even so most of the operating solar pv plants were designed to power existing irrigation systems that previously were powered by the grid thus the design of these irrigation systems pumps pipes and irrigation sectoring was developed to use the grid power and not the power from a solar energy source moreover nowadays the price of the pv technology is dropping and fostering the transformation of rain fed farms to irrigated lands allowing the use of pressurized irrigation in isolated areas in this context the objective of this work was to develop a methodology for the optimal sizing of the hydraulic network and the pv plant of an irrigation system with smart management from a techno economic point of view thus the sizing process considers both hydraulic and energy criteria in a comprehensive model developed in matlabtb pratap 2010 the search of optimal solutions based on economical and operational criteria was carried out using a customized version of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 this model includes a modified version of spim mérida garcía et al 2018 a smart photovoltaic irrigation manager to operate pv irrigation systems therefore the novelty of this work relies on the joint sizing of the network pipes and the pv plant so the irrigation system will work using efficiently the available water and solar energy finally the developed model was applied to a real case study placed in south spain comparing the original and optimized design solutions 2 methodology 2 1 case study the case study is an experimental pv irrigation system that waters a 13 4 ha olive orchard in the university of córdoba south spain the trial plot is divided into different subplots according to the olive tree variety and water allocation ranging from 1000 to 2000 m3 ha 1 continioning the layout of the irrigation network fig 1 the irrigation system is composed of a 13 hydrants irrigation network grouped in 3 sectors a sumergible pump directly powered by a pv plant an inverter and the control system the material of pipes was polyethylene pe the pump was located 1 35 km away from the irrigated field the irrigation network was originally designed for conventional energy supply and the pv plant was installed afterwards not considering simultaneously the joint design of the irrigation system and the pv plant the total instalation cost was 80 309 2 2 problem definition the objective of this work was to develop a procedure to determine the diameters of the network pipes and the required pv peak power pvpp to minimize the investment cost of a pv irrigation system ensuring its proper operation the developed methodology was integrated in the algorithm mopiss model for optimal photovoltaic irrigation system sizing the model assumes the crop distribution on the field as an initial constraint that conditions hydrants locations and the layout of the irrigation network that will not be modified through the optimization process moreover hydrants operation is controled by individual electrovalves that could be operated remotely the problem was defined as a multi objective optimization issue with two objective functions of1 and of2 these functions quantify the investment and operational cost of the irrigation system including the hydraulic network and the pv plant the use of pv energy does not entail operating cost and its maintenance cost are very small for this reason operation and maintenance cost have not been included in the problem statement the first objective function of1 focused on the minimization of the investment cost of the irrigation system pipes and pumps eq 1 1 o f 1 p 1 p n p c l p c p n o r m where pcϕ is the unit cost of the commercial pipe diameters lp is the total length of each pipe type included in the network and cp represents the pumping system cost based on commercial information this last cost was included after the pump power selection defined after the sectors power demand calculation of1 values were

value was defined hydrants with its respective flow demand were randomly assigned to each sector to stablish the different network operation configurations represented in each chromosome 2 4 multi objective solution algorithm the search procedure of optimal irrigation network and pv plant was based on the multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ii the nsga ii generates a series of chromosomes

the nsga ii algorithm was applied to minimize of1 and of2 which flow chart is shown in fig 2 the modifications made on the genetic operators are detailed below 2 4 1 initial population the initial population was integrated by a set of chromosomes pop with v variables which value was randomly assigned responding to specific ranges which must be previously defined the number of variables v was h p the sum of the number of hydrants and pipes respectively that composed the network represented in a type chromosome in fig 2 the value of the first h variables represents the sector of each hydrant s h h ranging from 1 to s on the other hand the following p variables corresponded to each pipe flow velocity in the network v p p in this case the pipe velocity values were randomly assigned between a maximum vmax and minimum vmin velocity rates which must be defined beforehand these vmax and vmin are stablished according to the desired operating conditions in the water distribution network for each particular case based on its size then these velocity values are adjusted in the chromosome in the optimization process described below the first h variables are discrete variables and the remaining p variables are continuous ones 2 4 2 evaluation of the objective functions the value for the previously detailed of1 and of2 were calculated for each chromosome a first simulation of the network including hydrants grouping in sectors fixed in the chromosome and hydrants flow provided pipes flow rates pipes velocity also fixed in the chromosome and pipe flow rates data determined pipe diameters these diameters were then adapted to the closest commercial ones ensuring a logical progression these logical progression entails that larger diameters are located closer to the pumping station while consecutive pipes must have equal or smaller diameters after this adjustment the irrigation network was again simulated this hydraulic analysis provided the real velocity rates for each pipe and nodes pressures after the diameters adjustment the chromosome is then updated with the real velocity rates the main steps of this process are represented in fig 3 based on nodes pressure data the sectors power demand is determined as a function of the most pressure demanding hydrant in each sector the sectors power demand was used in the calculation of of1 pump selection and of2 for pvpp calculation operation of the pv plant during the irrigation season and size of the photovoltaic panels surface area the pvpp was calculated based on the most power demanding sector of each chromosome considering the corresponding engine and inverter efficiencies for the calculation of the second term of of2 the daily irrigation requirements of the crop were previously estimated based on the difference between the effective precipitation and crop evapotranspiration finally the daily crop irrigation requirements were calculated for each irrigation sector based on the hydrants organization as well as the sectors water allocation 2 4 3 modified genetic operators the genetic operators crossover and mutation of the nsga ii were modified in order to ensure the generation of new child solutions different from parent solutions keeping discrete and continuous variables in the right positions in the chromosomes a specific coefficient determines the probability of being applied crossover mutation processes over the set of parent chromosomes thus for crossover operator a two point crossover procedure was applied to each pair of parents randomly selected crossover points were also randomly chosen one in each section of the chromosome corresponding to hydrants and pipes fig 4 the mutation process was applied to a randomly selected parent acting over a small portion of its variables which position was randomly selected once the mutation positions were chosen a new random value for the corresponding variable was assigned within the stablished ranges 3 results and discussion the developed methodology was applied to optimize the irrigation network and pv plant sizing for the case study irrigation system in the current design of the network hydrants are grouped according to their location hydrants 1 and 2 in sector 1 s1 hydrants 3 8 in sector 2 s2 while sector 3 s3 was composed by the 5 remaining hydrants 9 13 thus the sectors power and flow requirements were 7 07 6 77 and 13 35 kw and 9 67 9 60 and 12 40 ls 1 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively the pump power was 15 kw so the dimension of the pv plant was 17 7 kw the optimization of pipes size based on diameter selection must consider the material of pipes the selected material for this irrigation network was polyethylene pe thus commercial diameters roughness and pipe thickness were selected according to the material and specific characteristics of the network finally precipitation and reference evapotranspiration for crop irrigation needs calculation as well as irradiance data for the evaluation of the pv system of an average year were used to perform the simulation of the case study irrigation system moreover in the crop irrigation needs calculations the irrigation scheduling strategy which in the case study was focussed on a controlled deficit irrigation was also considered 3 1 sectoring alternatives the estimation of the possible maximum number of sectors s that permits the satisfaction of the daily irrigation requirements was 3 in june the most restrictive month for the case study analised the average total solar peak hours were 6 75 h per day and the average daily irrigation time was 2 08 h perday the s value was fixed for the subsequent network designing process matching the current number of network sectors in the case study thus the 13 hydrants with their corresponding flow demand and elevation were randomly grouped into 1 3 sectors in each chromsome of the initial population nevertheless after the optimization process all solutions in the pareto front had their hydrants grouped in 3 sectors 3 2 optimization process the optimal sizing of the irrigation network and pv plant for the case study was performed with a population size of 200 individuals pop and 100 generations gen as no significative changes were observed for a larger number of generations moreover crossover and mutation probabilities were fixed at 90 and 10 respectively each chromosome was conformed by 60 decision variables corresponding to the 13 hydrants h and 47 pipes p of the case study irrigation network the first 13 variables which possible values ranged between 1 3 maximum number of sectors defined hydrants organization in sectors on the other hand the remaining 47 variables were the flow velocities of each pipe of the network the flow velocity ranged between 0 5 and 1 85 ms 1 following the process of generation of the initial population described in section initial population then pipe diameters calculated from velocity values were aproximated to the closest commercial diameters among a set of 22 possibilities ranging from 32 to 630 mm 28 555 2 mm of internal diameter then the network was simulated using the software epanet rossman 2000 once the real flow velocity rates for pipes after the diameters adjustement were obtained the chromosome information updated the simulation also provided the sectors power requirements and pvpp considering engine and inverter efficiencies of 0 8 and 0 95 respectively the values of of1 and of2 per chromosome were normalized ranging between 0 1 to allow their comparison two scenarios for of2 were analysed 80 10 10 and 45 10 45 for ω and γ weighting coefficients respectively in both scenarios ω gives a small weight to the no satisfaction of the required irrigation depths this was decided after testing that the synchronization model always achieved good results for the satisfaction of the irrigation needs of the case study analized as the sectors power demand was managed properly scenario 1 gave the largest weight to the first term referring to the economic cost of the irrigation system while scenario 2 distributed the highest weights between the economic term and the one related to the photovoltaic surface after the optimization process the evolution of of1 and of2 values in each generation is shown in fig 5 thus it can be noted that depending on the weighting coefficients values the evolution of the minimum values of both of were slightly different the most significative reduction was shown in the first 10 generations for both of then only small reductions were appreciated in of1 and of2 up to generations 18 and 41 and 66 and 58 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively these figures show a fast stabilization of the minimum values and consequently the achivement of optimal results it was due to the boundary conditions stablished to manage the individuals generation as the flow velocity in pipes which were generated within an adequate range or the control in the distribution of diameters in the network eliminating unlogical solutions on the other hand the pareto front for the last generation showed a series of possible optimal solutions represented in fig 6 for both scenarios in this particular optimization problem a balance between the minimization of the two of was essential in order to achieve a solution with the lowest total cost of the system nevertheless all solutions presented realistic designs from an hydraulic point of view because in the previous diameter selection the extreme values were avoided by constraining the pipe flow velocity within a fixed range thus the of results ranged from 0 27 to 0 32 and 0 27 to 0 37 for of1 in scenario 1 and 2 respectively while for of2 these values ranged from 0 48 to 0 92 and 0 42 to 0 84 for scenario 1 and 2 respectively in economical terms these results corresponded to total costs values ranging between 49 154 and 61 402 for scenario 1 while solutions in scenario 2 showed a total investment cost between 48 955 and 58 917 all solutions had total costs under the cost of the original installation 80 309 as it is shown in table 1 which of values were 0 60 for of1 and 0 53 0 48 for of2 in scenario 1 and 2 respectively table 1 shows the total irrigation network pv plant lowest cost option op1 op2 and op3 respectively obtained for both of2 scenarios desagregated into the total investments cost the irrigation system cost and the pv plant cost it must be highlighted that the propossed optimal sizings presented a cost reduction between 23 5 39 1 in relation to the investment cost of the current system a fraction of this reduction was due to the drop in the investment cost of the irrigation network which oscillated between 38 9 and 55 9 nevertheless depending on the selected solution and its of values both the hydraulic and or pv components of the investment cost was a cheaper solution than the original design this fact can be observed in op 2 for both scenarios in these cases the total cost was lower than the original one due to a significative decrease in the irrigation network cost the reduction in pipes diameter size reduced the investment cost although involved higher power demands and consequently a larger pv plant which increased its cost by a 100 and 83 9 for scenario 1 and 2 respectively even then the irrigation network was significlantly cheaper than the current irrigation system on the other hand the most economical pv plant represented by op 3 showed an investment cost of 14 835 and 14 227 for scenario 1 and 2 which supossed 10 9 and 14 6 cost reductions table 2 collects information about the sectors power demand for the selected solutions as well as the fullfilment of irrigation needs and required pv surface area thus it can be observed that all these options grouped the 13 hydrants in three sectors with power demands between 10 0 and 26 6 kw per sector and 14 9 and 35 kw of pvpp moreover all selected designs satisfied the irrigation needs in more than a 96 requiring a pv modules area between 163 8 and 383 6 m2 finally fig 7 represents the total pipe length per commercial diameter internal included in the irrigation network design for each selected solution all these solutions combined between 5 6 different sizes of diameter moreover it showed flow pipe velocity values in pipes between 0 96 and 2 34 ms 1 which was within the recommended values for the correct operation of these pipes moreover these selected diameters oscillated between 28 123 4 mm which represented an important reduction in the irrigation network cost compared with the original design of the network with diameters from 44 to 158 6 mm moreover this figure also shows that the highest length was always represented by the largest diameter this fact was due to the length of the drive pipe which covered the distance between the pumping station and the irrigation field 4 conclusions the mopiss model provides the optimal size of pipe diameters and the pv plant dimensioning of a pv irrigation system it has been applied to a real case study the model considers the reduction of the total investment cost and the right operation of the system the optimization is based on the sectorization of hydrants operation the determination of the pipe diameters ensuring adequate flow pipe velocity and the pv plant dimensioning that can pump enough water to satisfy the irrigation requirements the model was applied to an actual operating pv irrigation system showing a series of solutions which presented important savings between 22 9 and 38 2 compared with the original system design the cheapest solution in relation to the total cost offered a design in which both the hydraulic and photovoltaic components had balanced costs although separately none of them was the cheapest option on the other hand the cheapest irrigation network involved a higher investment in the pv plant this solution could suggest an interesting option under an energy net balance scenario in which the excess of pv energy generated when the irrigation system is not working could be sold to the electricity grid in contrast the cheapest pv solution entailed the smallest pv plant with the reduction on the required surface for the pv modules installation and the corresponding reduction of the environmental impact derived from the modules production all solutions satisfied the irrigation requirements over a 96 which together with the control of the flow velocity in pipes allowed the generation of adequate and cheaper system designs options the results showed several possible optimal solutions that can be prioritised according to the minimization of the total investment irrigation network or pv plant costs depending on the specific characteristics of the project declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest to be reported acknowledgement this work was supported by the spanish ministry of economy

10766,the use of photovoltaic pv energy in irrigation is increasing its relevance as energy source in irrigated agriculture the main reason relays on its economic and environmental benefits compared to traditional options to reduce economic materials and energy requirements of pv irrigation systems its design and dimensioning should be optimal in this work we developed the model mopiss model for optimal photovoltaic irrigation system sizing focussed on the selection of pipe diameters and pv plant dimensioning optimizing jointly the investment cost and operation of the system mopiss developed in matlab integrated a customized version of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii with two objective functions aimed at searching the optimal sizing of the irrigation network and pv plant the results showed a series of solutions with optimal hydrants grouping in sectors pipe diameters and pv plant size mopiss was applied to a real case study obtaining solutions which satisfied 96 of the irrigation requirements while saved cost between 22 9 and 38 2 over the total investment cost compared with the original design mopiss is a useful tool to produce optimal designs of sizing new pv irrigation system under a comprehensive approach that considers crop water and energy availability and network layout keywords mopiss photovoltaic irrigation optimization pipe diameters dimensioning pv peak power nsgaii genetic algorithm 1 introduction nowadays the remarkable increase in energy consumption and the general concern about global warming has promoted the use of renewable energies in the irrigation agriculture sector related to this photovoltaic pv technology offers a more sustainable alternative for the energy supply compared to traditional options such as diesel generators and grid electricity giz 2016 this technology has a lower environmental burden due to the virtually zero environmental impacts associated to its operation mérida garcía et al 2019 furthermore the period with the highest pv energy production usually coincides with the irrigation season for a wide variety of crops nevertheless as the energy production levels rely on the instant irradiation lópez luque et al 2015 that is affected by the occurrence of clouds the management of an irrigation network just powered by pv energy results much more complex thus the variable power availability must be properly managed to fully satisfy the daily irrigation requirements of the different sectors of a network for the optimal dimensioning of the pv irrigation system it should be considered the variability of the solar radiation throughout the irrigation season and during the day moreover the hydrants location and the layout of the irrigation network determine the power demand of each sector of the irrigation network conditioning the pumping power and the size of the pv plant for that reason the sizes of the pipes of the irrigation network and the size of the pv plant should be determined jointly the search for optimal design solutions in the water distribution network sector has been widely studied by numerous authors tayfur 2017 summarized the main characteristics of the most popular optimization methods used in water resources planning engineering and management among them the genetic algorithms ga ant colony ac differential evolution de particle swarm ps harmony search hs genetic programming gp and genetic programming expression gpe can be highlighted creaco and franchini 2014 presented a procedure to find optimal solutions in the cost reliability space for multi objective design of looped water distribution systems this work pointed out the computational and numerical efficiency of low level hybrid optimization procedures for multi objective water network design most recently fernández garcía et al 2017 presented an optimization methodology for the design and operational costs of pressurized irrigation networks using the ngsa ii algorithm lapo et al 2017 combined linear programming lp and ga in a hybrid model to optimize the pipe design operating pressure at the head of the network total investment cost and working shifts assigned to each hydrant all these works focussed on the optimal design of the irrigation network while none of them questions the availability and characteristics of the energy source on the other hand related to the adoption of pv technology in the irrigation sector several works focused on the development of optimal sizing methods the aim of these works was to determine the optimal peak power for the pv plant to satisfy crop irrigation requirements using the existing irrigation network bakelli et al 2011 lópez luque et al 2015 in order to reduce the dependence on climate factors other works also focused on the optimal management of installations which incorporated some water energy storage elements as well as auxiliary support systems e g diesel generator in that way wissem et al 2012 reges et al 2016 and yahyaoui et al 2016 studied the inclusion of batteries in the system later rodríguez gallegos et al 2017 studied the combination of the pv modules with both a battery and a diesel generator this pv battery diesel combination allowed reducing the overall system cost and control of the grid voltage based on ps methods in a similar way the hybridization of the pv plant with other renewable energy supply systems as wind or water turbines was also evaluated by ouachani et al 2017 and ramli et al 2018 another common application of pv technology in irrigation is the use of an intermediate water storage tank this tank is located at a higher level to feed the irrigation system by gravity olcan 2015 kabalci et al 2016 ghavidel et al 2016 muhsen et al 2018 this option is possible for relatively small plots with a suitable height difference these actions generally offer more flexibility to the system operation but have higher economic and in some cases higher environmental cost due to material requirements nevertheless mérida garcía et al 2018 proved that some crops as olive orchard in southern spain could be irrigated with a pv plant by a direct injection irrigation system without storage elements this was possible using a real time synchronization model which searched for the best fit between the power production and irrigation requirements even so most of the operating solar pv plants were designed to power existing irrigation systems that previously were powered by the grid thus the design of these irrigation systems pumps pipes and irrigation sectoring was developed to use the grid power and not the power from a solar energy source moreover nowadays the price of the pv technology is dropping and fostering the transformation of rain fed farms to irrigated lands allowing the use of pressurized irrigation in isolated areas in this context the objective of this work was to develop a methodology for the optimal sizing of the hydraulic network and the pv plant of an irrigation system with smart management from a techno economic point of view thus the sizing process considers both hydraulic and energy criteria in a comprehensive model developed in matlabtb pratap 2010 the search of optimal solutions based on economical and operational criteria was carried out using a customized version of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 this model includes a modified version of spim mérida garcía et al 2018 a smart photovoltaic irrigation manager to operate pv irrigation systems therefore the novelty of this work relies on the joint sizing of the network pipes and the pv plant so the irrigation system will work using efficiently the available water and solar energy finally the developed model was applied to a real case study placed in south spain comparing the original and optimized design solutions 2 methodology 2 1 case study the case study is an experimental pv irrigation system that waters a 13 4 ha olive orchard in the university of córdoba south spain the trial plot is divided into different subplots according to the olive tree variety and water allocation ranging from 1000 to 2000 m3 ha 1 continioning the layout of the irrigation network fig 1 the irrigation system is composed of a 13 hydrants irrigation network grouped in 3 sectors a sumergible pump directly powered by a pv plant an inverter and the control system the material of pipes was polyethylene pe the pump was located 1 35 km away from the irrigated field the irrigation network was originally designed for conventional energy supply and the pv plant was installed afterwards not considering simultaneously the joint design of the irrigation system and the pv plant the total instalation cost was 80 309 2 2 problem definition the objective of this work was to develop a procedure to determine the diameters of the network pipes and the required pv peak power pvpp to minimize the investment cost of a pv irrigation system ensuring its proper operation the developed methodology was integrated in the algorithm mopiss model for optimal photovoltaic irrigation system sizing the model assumes the crop distribution on the field as an initial constraint that conditions hydrants locations and the layout of the irrigation network that will not be modified through the optimization process moreover hydrants operation is controled by individual electrovalves that could be operated remotely the problem was defined as a multi objective optimization issue with two objective functions of1 and of2 these functions quantify the investment and operational cost of the irrigation system including the hydraulic network and the pv plant the use of pv energy does not entail operating cost and its maintenance cost are very small for this reason operation and maintenance cost have not been included in the problem statement the first objective function of1 focused on the minimization of the investment cost of the irrigation system pipes and pumps eq 1 1 o f 1 p 1 p n p c l p c p n o r m where pcϕ is the unit cost of the commercial pipe diameters lp is the total length of each pipe type included in the network and cp represents the pumping system cost based on commercial information this last cost was included after the pump power selection defined after the sectors power demand calculation of1 values were then normalized between 0 1 in order to be comparable with of2 values the second objective function of2 evaluated the pv plant cost and its capacity to provide enough energy to the irrigation network eq 2 2 o f 2 ρ p v p p u c n o r m ω s 1 s s d 1 d i s r w v s d a w v s d s 1 s s w a n o r m γ s p v s c 100 n o r m in that way the first term of of2 quantified the pv plant cost as the product between the pvpp expressed in w and a unit cost uc expressed in per w of peak power the pvpp depends on the system operation and it is then traduced into the required number of pv modules and inverter dimensioning to reduce its value the network will be operated by sectors the maximal number of operating sectors s will be described later thus pvpp was estimated as a function of the sectors power demand previously determined for each sectoring network alternative this estimation was carried out using the hydraulic simulator epanet rossman 2000 evaluating the pressure requirements for the most restrictive hydrant in each sector the uc included the cost associated to the modules the wiring the inverter and the installation of all the elements of the pv plant the second term evaluated the pumping capacity of the pv plant during the irrigation season being is its duration in days to satisfy the irrigation requirements this capacity is expressed as the ratio between the sum of the required and the applied water volumes difference rwv and awv respectively throughout the irrigation season and the total water allocation assigned to the sectors all these values are expressed in m3 this evaluation was carried out using spim smart photovoltaic irrigation manager mérida garcía et al 2018 spim defined the daily operation sequence of the network sectors according to their power demand daily crop irrigation requirements and the instant radiation levels thus at the end of the irrigation season the model provides the total water volume applied to each sector and compares it with their water allocations finally the third term of the equation represents the ratio between the pv modules surface spv and the cultivated area sc the value of of2 was then also normalized weighting each term with ρ ω and γ coefficients these weighting factors allowed the study of the influence of each term in the selection of the best solutions the model can be easily adapted to the specific characteristics of each project and user preferences 2 3 hydrants sectoring as hydrants can operate independently the maximal number of groups of hydrants that can work simultaneously number

the satisfaction of the daily irrigation requirements was 3 in june the most restrictive month for the case study analised the average total solar peak hours were 6 75 h per day and the average daily irrigation time was 2 08 h perday the s value was fixed for the subsequent network designing process matching the current number of network sectors in the case study thus the 13 hydrants with their corresponding flow demand and elevation were randomly grouped into 1 3 sectors in each chromsome of the initial population nevertheless after the optimization process all solutions in the pareto front had their hydrants grouped in 3 sectors 3 2 optimization process the optimal sizing of the irrigation network and pv plant for the case study was performed with a population size of 200 individuals pop and 100 generations gen as no significative changes were observed for a larger number of generations moreover crossover and mutation probabilities were fixed at 90 and 10 respectively each chromosome was conformed by 60 decision variables corresponding to the 13 hydrants h and 47 pipes p of the case study irrigation network the first 13 variables which possible values ranged between 1 3 maximum number of sectors defined hydrants organization in sectors on the other hand the remaining 47 variables were the flow velocities of each pipe of the network the flow velocity ranged between 0 5 and 1 85 ms 1 following the process of generation of the initial population described in section initial population then pipe diameters calculated from velocity values were aproximated to the closest commercial diameters among a set of 22 possibilities ranging from 32 to 630 mm 28 555 2 mm of internal diameter then the network was simulated using the software epanet rossman 2000 once the real flow velocity rates for pipes after the diameters adjustement were obtained the chromosome information updated the simulation also provided the sectors power requirements and pvpp considering engine and inverter efficiencies of 0 8 and 0 95 respectively the values of of1 and of2 per chromosome were normalized ranging between 0 1 to allow their comparison two scenarios for of2 were analysed 80 10 10 and 45 10 45 for ω and γ weighting coefficients respectively in both scenarios ω gives a small weight to the no satisfaction of the required irrigation depths this was decided after testing that the synchronization model always achieved good results for the satisfaction of the irrigation needs of the case study analized as the sectors power demand was managed properly scenario 1 gave the largest weight to the first term referring to the economic cost of the irrigation system while scenario 2 distributed the highest weights between the economic term and the one related to the photovoltaic surface after the optimization process the evolution of of1 and of2 values in each generation is shown in fig 5 thus it can be noted that depending on the weighting coefficients values the evolution of the minimum values of both of were slightly different the most significative reduction was shown in the first 10 generations for both of then only small reductions were appreciated in of1 and of2 up to generations 18 and 41 and 66 and 58 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively these figures show a fast stabilization of the minimum values and consequently the achivement of optimal results it was due to the boundary conditions stablished to manage the individuals generation as the flow velocity in pipes which were generated within an adequate range or the control in the distribution of diameters in the network eliminating unlogical solutions on the other hand the pareto front for the last generation showed a series of possible optimal solutions represented in fig 6 for both scenarios in this particular optimization problem a balance between the minimization of the two of was essential in order to achieve a solution with the lowest total cost of the system nevertheless all solutions presented realistic designs from an hydraulic point of view because in the previous diameter selection the extreme values were avoided by constraining the pipe flow velocity within a fixed range thus the of results ranged from 0 27 to 0 32 and 0 27 to 0 37 for of1 in scenario 1 and 2 respectively while for of2 these values ranged from 0 48 to 0 92 and 0 42 to 0 84 for scenario 1 and 2 respectively in economical terms these results corresponded to total costs values ranging between 49 154 and 61 402 for scenario 1 while solutions in scenario 2 showed a total investment cost between 48 955 and 58 917 all solutions had total costs under the cost of the original installation 80 309 as it is shown in table 1 which of values were 0 60 for of1 and 0 53 0 48 for of2 in scenario 1 and 2 respectively table 1 shows the total irrigation network pv plant lowest cost option op1 op2 and op3 respectively obtained for both of2 scenarios desagregated into the total investments cost the irrigation system cost and the pv plant cost it must be highlighted that the propossed optimal sizings presented a cost reduction between 23 5 39 1 in relation to the investment cost of the current system a fraction of this reduction was due to the drop in the investment cost of the irrigation network which oscillated between 38 9 and 55 9 nevertheless depending on the selected solution and its of values both the hydraulic and or pv components of the investment cost was a cheaper solution than the original design this fact can be observed in op 2 for both scenarios in these cases the total cost was lower than the original one due to a significative decrease in the irrigation network cost the reduction in pipes diameter size reduced the investment cost although involved higher power demands and consequently a larger pv plant which increased its cost by a 100 and 83 9 for scenario 1 and 2 respectively even then the irrigation network was significlantly cheaper than the current irrigation system on the other hand the most economical pv plant represented by op 3 showed an investment cost of 14 835 and 14 227 for scenario 1 and 2 which supossed 10 9 and 14 6 cost reductions table 2 collects information about the sectors power demand for the selected solutions as well as the fullfilment of irrigation needs and required pv surface area thus it can be observed that all these options grouped the 13 hydrants in three sectors with power demands between 10 0 and 26 6 kw per sector and 14 9 and 35 kw of pvpp moreover all selected designs satisfied the irrigation needs in more than a 96 requiring a pv modules area between 163 8 and 383 6 m2 finally fig 7 represents the total pipe length per commercial diameter internal included in the irrigation network design for each selected solution all these solutions combined between 5 6 different sizes of diameter moreover it showed flow pipe velocity values in pipes between 0 96 and 2 34 ms 1 which was within the recommended values for the correct operation of these pipes moreover these selected diameters oscillated between 28 123 4 mm which represented an important reduction in the irrigation network cost compared with the original design of the network with diameters from 44 to 158 6 mm moreover this figure also shows that the highest length was always represented by the largest diameter this fact was due to the length of the drive pipe which covered the distance between the pumping station and the irrigation field 4 conclusions the mopiss model provides the optimal size of pipe diameters and the pv plant dimensioning of a pv irrigation system it has been applied to a real case study the model considers the reduction of the total investment cost and the right operation of the system the optimization is based on the sectorization of hydrants operation the determination of the pipe diameters ensuring adequate flow pipe velocity and the pv plant dimensioning that can pump enough water to satisfy the irrigation requirements the model was applied to an actual operating pv irrigation system showing a series of solutions which presented important savings between 22 9 and 38 2 compared with the original system design the cheapest solution in relation to the total cost offered a design in which both the hydraulic and photovoltaic components had balanced costs although separately none of them was the cheapest option on the other hand the cheapest irrigation network involved a higher investment in the pv plant this solution could suggest an interesting option under an energy net balance scenario in which the excess of pv energy generated when the irrigation system is not working could be sold to the electricity grid in contrast the cheapest pv solution entailed the smallest pv plant with the reduction on the required surface for the pv modules installation and the corresponding reduction of the environmental impact derived from the modules production all solutions satisfied the irrigation requirements over a 96 which together with the control of the flow velocity in pipes allowed the generation of adequate and cheaper system designs options the results showed several possible optimal solutions that can be prioritised according to the minimization of the total investment irrigation network or pv plant costs depending on the specific characteristics of the project declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest to be reported acknowledgement this work was supported by the spanish ministry of economy

have begun in lebanon from at least fifty years vink et al 1969 where corn was selected and studied thoroughly more recent studies have been conducted in this country e g karam et al 2007 farajalla

al 2009a 2009b karam and nangia 2016 nonetheless the lack of a standardized measurements method shall render problematic to compare spatially or temporally their findings with the current lack of any instrument measuring et across lebanon the need for an automated widely acknowledged et system is pressing within a global trend towards conserving water resources and limiting its consumption i e sustainable development goal number 6 sdg 6 as well as the location of lebanon in a hot political conflict region fueled by the existent of many trans boundary rivers and groundwater resources defining the water consumption in the agriculture sector is urgently needed this should begin by estimating et for the main crops by applying a widely validated remote sensing based approach nevertheless in lebanon some required inputs for et estimations are missing or biased particularly when considering soil related datasets thus it was required to consult other surface energy balance algorithms to retrieve alternative equations models the enhanced system is surnamed sebal improved or sebali hence the objective of this study is to estimate et values water consumption in more than 500 winter cereal plots i e wheat barley triticale this information shall benefit decision makers and farmers to best manage the agricultural lands also drawing a winter cereal et seasonal trend in such a semi arid climate would certainly help initiatives towards better efficient irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the baalbeck district within the bekaa plain of lebanon elevations range between 900 and 1200 m a s l the prevailing climate is continental semi arid and the average annual precipitation is around 592 mm karam et al 2009a more specifically in the winter cereal season i e november to june total precipitation corresponded to 358 mm according from a nearby weather station i e tal amara in 2017 2018 the study area has a variety of rock formations e g sand sandy clay loam silty clay loam and loam from different geological eras high temperatures coupled with high evaporation rates are generally observed in the region allaw et al 2015 while agriculture is the main economic activity in the bekaa plain cereal parcels predominate the region during winter field areas range from 0 1 ha to more than 20 ha nasrallah et al 2018 fig 1 shows the land use land cover lulc in 2013 of the study area as well as the location of the selected winter cereal parcels their areas vary from 0 1 29 6 ha with an average area of 2 7 ha 2 2 methods 2 2 1 field visits several field visits were conducted by the national center for remote sensing part of the lebanese national council for scientific research between february and april 2018 to check the validity i e the existence of winter cereal plantation of 552 parcels which have been reported as winter cereal parcels by farmers global positioning system gps devices were used to locate the visited fields while adding descriptions on the existence or not of plantation and then if the crop is winter cereal or other only winter cereal fields were selected the spatial distribution of these parcels is presented in fig 1 2 2 2 py sebal limitations sebal open source python script or py sebal is freely available to download at https github com wateraccounting sebal this script automates et values retrieval using a computer software library specialized in vector and raster reading processing and writing this latter is surnamed geospatial data abstraction library or gdal in sebal et is calculated as a residual of the surface energy balance liou and kar 2014 further information regarding this script are available through different documents found on ihe delft website i e www un ihe org however several issues were encountered when running py sebal in our study site first soil related datasets e g saturated soil moisture content saturated soil moisture content in the subsoil residual soil moisture content field capacity wilting point are missing generally it is recommended to use the latest soil map of lebanon produced in 2003 unfortunately soil classes alone may generate inaccurate information of the above needed soil related factors these missing factors are used to produce the water stress scalar second because of the usage of an open source library i e gdal an adequate selection of the hot and cold pixels is challenging to be more specific gdal can only limit the selection to a rectangle extent this may pose a major issue in lebanon where agricultural areas are generally coarse and mixed with different land cover types such as bare and wooded lands third while sebal creators acknowledge the biases generated when using top of atmosphere toa bands and where its operators state that an internal calibration is used to correct when possible this issue allen et al 2011 the usage of bottom of atmosphere boa surface reflectance sr bands are by far recommended allen et al 2011 finally py sebal does not contain an internal cloud removal mechanism resulting in producing inaccurate and unacceptable pixel values in some shaded or cloudy areas 2 2 3 sebali proposal sebali was developed with several improvements over py sebal the enhancements concern mainly the inputs instead of requiring a dozen of factors in py sebal related to soil types and characteristics an alternative approach proposed by yuan et al 2007 was used in their paper they argue that in one hand soil moisture is difficult to be characterized over large areas from either modeling or remote sensing on the other hand vapor pressure deficit vpd which also controls the moisture availability on plant photosynthesis might change tremendously over heterogeneous landscapes rendering any linear relation between vpd and soil water availability very difficult to be achieved yuan et al 2007 they propose then a water stress ws factor which could be calculated as follows eq 1 1 w s l e l e h where le is the latent heat flux in w m 2 corresponding to the instantaneous et and h is sensible heat flux in w m 2 several other studies e g kurc and small 2004 zhang et al 2004 suleiman and crago 2004 nutini et al 2014 yuan et al 2014 alfieri et al 2017 have used this indicator to characterize vegetation moisture conditions this is related to the fact that a decreasing amount of energy partitioned into latent heat flux suggests a stronger moisture limitation yuan et al 2007 using the water stress factor has facilitated the evaluation of daily and seasonal et in lebanon where soil related data are missing furthermore in order to enable the selection of a non square study area the arcgis library was used to build the proposed model the ability to select a random shape of the area of interest could enhance the selection of the hot cold pixels within the needed fields only thus providing a better internal calibration of the model moreover to improve the selection even further as proposed by the metric system allen et al 2005 2007 2011 agricultural areas extracted from the lulc in 2013 were embedded in the system hence only pixels within these areas could be selected surface reflectance sr landsat 8 datasets were downloaded and used as inputs cloud detection and removal was based on the quality assessment qa band retrieved along the landsat 8 datasets in each selected date a simplified flowchart of sebali is found in fig 2 a snapshot of the whole system is provided in fig a1 2 3 sebali calibrations and validations as only four months of et flux tower i e bowen ratio datasets are available in lebanon datasets from five locations i e two in germany one in belgium one in italy one in united states were collected corresponding to agricultural regions where et datasets from flux towers as well as satellite imageries are available more precisely italy and united states have a similar climatic zone i e csa mediterranean hot summer climates to our study area thus a validation in these regions as well as in other selected countries i e germany and belgium having another climatic zone i e cfb oceanic climate would largely reflect the accuracy of sebali outputs in our study region et related datasets were downloaded from the official data portal of the fluxnet community available at https fluxnet fluxdata org other required datasets such as digital elevation model dem and land use cover luc maps were acquired from different sources detailed in the table 1 the 30 m landsat 8 satellite imageries were retrieved from usgs official website accessible at https earthexplorer usgs gov with both level 1 i e top of atmosphere used for thermal bands calculations and level 2 i e bottom of atmosphere used for the other required bands calculations downloaded while landsat 8 has a revisit time of 16 day some months could have two images others only one as a result one image was downloaded each month whenever possible with a priority to the image occurring at the middle of each month three regions i e two in germany one in belgium corresponding to eleven datasets were used for calibrations which is a dynamic adjustment of the et values over water bodies considering the local relative humidity and wind speed conditions more precisely calibrations were made on two levels representing the sensible heat flux as well as the evapotranspiration of water bodies the other two regions i e italy and united states were used for validations having fifty monthly et values monthly root mean square error rmse absolute mean error ame and the r squared values between sebali outputs and flux towers datasets have been calculated to remove any related estimations biases five percent of datasets were eliminated corresponding to top four large ame these four datasets could be related to a change in vegetation cover within these months that were not able to be identified through satellite imageries due to the satellite sensing period before or after such event thus 9 datasets were used for calibrations and 48 data for validations moreover buffered zones from the central location of each eddy covariance flux tower have been produced using arcgis 10 6 function corresponding to buffered areas of 250 m 500 m 1 km 2 km 5 km 10 km and 20 km the calculation of sebali et in these buffered areas will check the validity of a flux tower to provide accurate results at each distance a simplified flowchart is presented in fig 3 3 results 3 1 sebali calibrations and validations 3 1 1 calibrations as shown in table 2 the calibration value of 1 4 represented the lower rmse and ame in comparison to nine flux towers in germany and belgium errors have increased moving upward and downward this value 3 1 2 validations when using the calibrated value based on nine towers datasets rmse and ame for the remaining 48 data represented 26 52 mm and 21 32 mm respectively table 3 still when incorporating the standard deviation std of each sebali datasets the new rmse and ame have decreased to 9 56 mm and 5 mm respectively fig 4 shows the correlation between 48 et values generated by sebali and those observed in flux towers in both italy and united states the r squared is 86 39 at the calibration value of 1 4 sebali et values with their respective std usually coincide with the flux tower et values with 29 out of 48 60 of values represent this case fig 5 more specifically average ame was at his peak in january and october with values corresponding to 14 79 and 11 26 mm respectively fig 6 lowest average ame values corresponded to summer s months in addition to march 3 1 3 buffered areas as shown in table 4 buffered zones larger than 5 km have generated rmse and ame values higher than those produced by sebali at parcel level still the lowest rmse appeared to be on the 2 km buffered area with 23 24 mm even though rmse and ame at the 2 km and 5 km buffered area showed better values compared to the parcel level assessment when sebali std were added this situation is inversed with parcel level rmse and ame were lower than both 2 km and 5 km buffered regions table 5 still the correlation between the 2 km and 5 km buffered zones as well as the et flux towers data showed promising results i e r squared higher than 85 with a small edge from the 2 km buffered regions fig 7 3 2 spatial and temporal et values et values reached more than 600 mm in some regions irrespective to the location of the parcels as shown in fig 8 most cereal fields i e 74 63 corresponded to the second and third classes i e between 301 and 500 mm average et trend for 552 cereal fields showed the highest et values in may i e flowering and grain filling growth stage fig 9 the average et was low i e less than 35 mm between november and march and then increased tremendously in the following months the standard deviation was high throughout the growth stages 4 discussions while applying several calibration values added to the dynamic changes related to the actual conditions of relative humidity and wind speed the value of 1 4 had the best agreement with the flux tower datasets in different countries and crop conditions such increase in the original sebali et values coincides with previous studies suggesting an underestimating of sebal values in comparison to et ground measurements e g singh et al 2008 long and singh 2012 mkhwanazi et al 2015 the monthly rmse ame and r squared values have been generated from 30 m spatial resolution datasets at parcel level they have showed a good agreement with the flux tower datasets furthermore when considering the sebali std values the rmse showed a very promising value of 9 56 mm month or 0 318 mm day with an ame of 0 167 mm day such results represent a concrete improvement over the previous sebal related validations e g bastiaanssen et al 1998a du et al 2013 jaber et al 2016 on one hand and the validation of the newly proposed sebali model on the other the highest ame are shown in months where information could be missing from a large part of the satellite image due to bad weather conditions and to a lower extent in months where crop development changes drastically within a month thus hindering the accurate estimation of the monthly et based on one satellite imagery per month the other months have presented very low ame values i e 0 mm when trying to identify the more accurate hypothesis i e larger spatial resolution satellite imageries used will generate better correlation between seb outputs and ground measurements data bastiaanssen et al 2002 versus smaller spatial resolution satellite imageries used will generate better correlation between seb outputs and ground measurements data jaber et al 2016 it has been found that working on coarsier spatial resolution i e 250 m and lower generated instantly better rmse and ame values r squared values were acceptable as well i e higher than 85 this scenario is inversed at spatial resolutions higher than 5 km thus enabling to recommend installing flux towers within a 5 km of the needed region such tower should be placed within 2 km of the studied area for best accuracies which is aligned with previous recommendations e g allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2015 still when including seb std the 30 m spatial resolution parcel based assessment generated the lowest rmse and ame thus it was found that both hypotheses found in previous studies are true to an extent more precisely when considering a regional or national study it would be advised to work on a coarser spatial resolution satellite imageries as results will coincide more with the ground measurements saving on time and resources would also be an option when processing these small size images on the other hand when et related values are needed at parcel level for instance to assess existent nitrogen high spatial resolution satellite imageries are recommended due to their abilities to monitor small fluctuations within the field which better coincide with flux towers datasets et values fluctuate between parcels irrespective to their geographical locations main causes could be related to different agricultural practices and varied soil types within the study area while the northern part of the study area is drier a scarcity in water resources coupled with a declining groundwater tables karam and karaa 2000 mhawej et al 2014 allaw et al 2015 are pushing farmers to produce rainfed cereals this is particularly reflected in most parcels corresponding to a seasonal et lower than 400 mm which is generally close to the precipitation amount found within the study area between november and june i e 358 mm furthermore the variation of precipitations within the sub regions has led to an et as low as 150 mm the low et values shown in november as presented in fig 9 are mainly related to the lack of vegetation thus resulting in very low transpiration values moreover the low temperatures coupled with a low incoming radiation generate low soil evaporation values following the dormancy period i e february and march cereals development continues combined with high consumption of water leading to an increase in the total et as the canopy reaches its maximum vegetative growth in may the crop actual et is at its highest levels requiring a significant amount of water karam et al 2009b starting the reproductive stage the canopy dries up and the transpiration decreases to reach very low levels until the cultivar is harvested the soil evaporation at these growth stages is generally masked by the much higher transpiration values even though that temperatures are rising days are longer and incoming solar radiations are more intense the importance of such study lies in calibrating and validating the newly proposed sebali et calculation model in an improved spatial and temporal resolutions setting such model will enable the generation of et values in an automated way without the need of specialized personnel and in a country with many missing datasets when applied in different country sebali validations showed an r squared value of 86 and a daily ame of 0 167 mm such model could be then applied in distinct climatic regions containing different crop types and particularly when soil related datasets are missing while a cloud removal process was included in sebali based on bqa in landsat 8 a more sophisticated algorithm could be used in the future moreover gap filling process should be included to avoid missing pivotal datasets in some locations using a promising newly proposed normalized difference latent heat index ndli liou et al 2018 that outperformed the other existing soil related indices to assess the water availability over a variety of lulc would be an integral addition in future sebali applications crop mapping could also be included to better estimate crop related factors it is also recommended to download and process multiple satellite images per month to decrease ame in months where bad climatic conditions exist or a shift in the crop s development stage occurs when missing these images could be forecasted by applying an existent imputation method such as the maximum likelihood or the wide range of the artificial neural network techniques future studies could focus on improving the spatial resolution of the images used by processing the 10 m sentinel 2 images assessing the daily accuracy of sebali would also be an interesting path to follow enabling the monitoring at a fine scale of the crop development and providing critical information for both policy makers and local farmers identifying the et trends as well as assessing seasonal et values for winter cereal parcels in a semi arid region with missing soil related datasets is the first step towards better scheduling irrigation and water saving while maintaining an acceptable yield this could help lebanon to clearly produce future food security plans government and official entities would have now a tool to estimate winter cereal water consumption per season and thus proposing better policies and management plans 5 conclusion the broader applications of remote sensing techniques aim to increase water productivity in order to support the growing population worldwide this should be done without affecting growth and yields while genetic engineering has already produced an astonishing improvement conserving water could be also achieved via adequate agricultural practices in this context we proposed in this paper an enhancement to the existent py sebal model surnamed sebali to accurately retrieve et values sebali has its strengths over other surface balance energy models particularly in term of using a reduced number of factors other improvements include cloud detection and elimination as well as using atmospherically corrected datasets main results show that the highest et values were in may i e flowering and grain filling growth stage with seasonal et values significantly varying irrespective of the spatial locations of the parcels thus guiding farmers and landowners and helping them to adjust their practices using sebali would be aligned with national and international initiatives to conserve water resources while maintaining high yields these actions would be vital for the establishment of the food security in the country author s contribution all authors of this research paper have directly participated in the planning execution or analysis of this study all authors of

have begun in lebanon from at least fifty years vink et al 1969 where corn was selected and studied thoroughly more recent studies have been conducted in this country e g karam et al 2007 farajalla and ziade 2010 bachour et al 2013 to assess soybean karam et al 2005 wheat and potatoes awad et al 2014 as well as several other crops such as maize cotton sunflower bell pepper and eggplants karam et al 2009a 2009b karam and nangia 2016 nonetheless the lack of a standardized measurements method shall render problematic to compare spatially or temporally their findings with the current lack of any instrument measuring et across lebanon the need for an automated widely acknowledged et system is pressing within a global trend towards conserving water resources and limiting its consumption i e sustainable development goal number 6 sdg 6 as well as the location of lebanon in a hot political conflict region fueled by the existent of many trans boundary rivers and groundwater resources defining the water consumption in the agriculture sector is urgently needed this should begin by estimating et for the main crops by applying a widely validated remote sensing based approach nevertheless in lebanon some required inputs for et estimations are missing or biased particularly when considering soil related datasets thus it was required to consult other surface energy balance algorithms to retrieve alternative equations models the enhanced system is surnamed sebal improved or sebali hence the objective of this study is to estimate et values water consumption in more than 500 winter cereal plots i e wheat barley triticale this information shall benefit decision makers and farmers to best manage the agricultural lands also drawing a winter cereal et seasonal trend in such a semi arid climate would certainly help initiatives towards better efficient irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the baalbeck district within the bekaa plain of lebanon elevations range between 900 and 1200 m a s l the prevailing climate is continental semi arid and the average annual precipitation is around 592 mm karam et al 2009a more specifically in the winter cereal season i e november to june total precipitation corresponded to 358 mm according from a nearby weather station i e tal amara in 2017 2018 the study area has a variety of rock formations e g sand sandy clay loam silty clay loam and loam from different geological eras high temperatures coupled with high evaporation rates are generally observed in the region allaw et al 2015 while agriculture is the main economic activity in the bekaa plain cereal parcels predominate the region during winter field areas range from 0 1 ha to more than 20 ha nasrallah et al 2018 fig 1 shows the land use land cover lulc in 2013 of the study area as well as the location of the selected winter cereal parcels their areas vary from 0 1 29 6 ha with an average area of 2 7 ha 2 2 methods 2 2 1 field visits several field visits were conducted by the national center for remote sensing part of the lebanese national council for scientific research between february and april 2018 to check the validity i e the existence of winter cereal plantation of 552 parcels which have been reported as winter cereal parcels by farmers global positioning system gps devices were used to locate the visited fields while adding descriptions on the existence or not of plantation and then if the crop is winter cereal or other only winter cereal fields were selected the spatial distribution of these parcels is presented in fig 1 2 2 2 py sebal limitations sebal open source python script or py sebal is freely available to download at https github com wateraccounting sebal this script automates et values retrieval using a computer software library specialized in vector and raster reading processing and writing this latter is surnamed geospatial data abstraction library or gdal in sebal et is calculated as a residual of the surface energy balance liou and kar 2014 further information regarding this script are available through different documents found on ihe delft website i e www un ihe org however several issues were encountered when running py sebal in our study site first soil related datasets e g saturated soil moisture content saturated soil moisture content in the subsoil residual soil moisture content field capacity wilting point are missing generally it is recommended to use the latest soil map of lebanon produced in 2003 unfortunately soil classes alone may generate inaccurate information of the above needed soil related factors these missing factors are used to produce the water stress scalar second because of the usage of an open source library i e gdal an adequate selection of the hot and cold pixels is challenging to be more specific gdal can only limit the selection to a rectangle extent this may pose a major issue in lebanon where agricultural areas are generally coarse and mixed with different land cover types such as bare and wooded lands third while sebal creators acknowledge the biases generated when using top of atmosphere toa bands and where its operators state that an internal calibration is used to correct when possible this issue allen et al 2011 the usage of bottom of atmosphere boa surface reflectance sr bands are by far recommended allen et al 2011 finally py sebal does not contain an internal cloud removal mechanism resulting in producing inaccurate and unacceptable pixel values in some shaded or cloudy areas 2 2 3 sebali proposal sebali was developed with several improvements over py sebal the enhancements concern mainly the inputs instead of requiring a dozen of factors in py sebal related to soil types and characteristics an alternative approach proposed by yuan et al 2007 was used in their paper they argue that in one hand soil moisture is difficult to be characterized over large areas from either modeling or remote sensing on the other hand vapor pressure deficit vpd which also controls the moisture availability on plant photosynthesis might change tremendously over heterogeneous landscapes rendering any linear relation between vpd and soil water availability very difficult to be achieved yuan et al 2007 they propose then a water stress ws factor which could be calculated as follows eq 1 1 w s l e l e h where le is the latent heat flux in w m 2 corresponding to the instantaneous et and h is sensible heat flux in w m 2 several other studies e g kurc and small 2004 zhang et al 2004 suleiman and crago 2004 nutini et al 2014 yuan et al 2014 alfieri et al 2017 have used this indicator to characterize vegetation moisture conditions this is related to the fact that a decreasing amount of energy partitioned into latent heat flux suggests a stronger moisture limitation yuan et al 2007 using the water stress factor has facilitated the evaluation of daily and seasonal et in lebanon where soil related data are missing furthermore in order to enable the selection of a non square study area the arcgis library was used to build the proposed model the ability to select a random shape of the area of interest could enhance the selection of the hot cold pixels within the needed fields only thus providing a better internal calibration of the model moreover to improve the selection even further as proposed by the metric system allen et al 2005 2007 2011 agricultural areas extracted from the lulc in 2013 were embedded in the system hence only pixels within these areas could be selected surface reflectance sr landsat 8 datasets were downloaded and used as inputs cloud detection and removal was based on the quality assessment qa band retrieved along the landsat 8 datasets in each selected date a simplified flowchart of sebali is found in fig 2 a snapshot of the whole system is provided in fig a1 2 3 sebali calibrations and validations as only four months of et flux tower i e bowen ratio datasets are available in lebanon datasets from five locations i e two in germany one in belgium one in italy one in united states were collected corresponding to agricultural regions where et datasets from flux towers as well as satellite imageries are available more precisely italy and united states have a similar climatic zone i e csa mediterranean hot summer climates to our study area thus a validation in these regions as well as in other selected countries i e germany and belgium having another climatic zone i e cfb oceanic climate would largely reflect the accuracy of sebali outputs in our study region et related datasets were downloaded from the official data portal of the fluxnet community available at https fluxnet fluxdata org other required datasets such as digital elevation model dem and land use cover luc maps were acquired from different sources detailed in the table 1 the 30 m landsat 8 satellite imageries were retrieved from usgs official website accessible at https earthexplorer usgs gov with both level 1 i e top of atmosphere used for thermal bands calculations and level 2 i e bottom of atmosphere used for the other required bands calculations downloaded while landsat 8 has a revisit time of 16 day some months could have two images others only one as a result one image was downloaded each month whenever possible with a priority to the image occurring at the middle of each month three regions i e two in germany one in belgium corresponding to eleven datasets were used for calibrations which is a dynamic adjustment of the et values over water bodies considering the local relative humidity and wind speed conditions more precisely calibrations were made on two levels representing the sensible heat flux as well as the evapotranspiration of water bodies the other two regions i e italy and united states were used for validations having fifty monthly et values monthly root mean square error rmse absolute mean error ame and the r squared values between sebali outputs and flux towers datasets have been calculated to remove any related estimations biases five percent of datasets were eliminated corresponding to top four large ame these four datasets could be related to a change in vegetation cover within these months that were not able to be identified through satellite imageries due to the satellite sensing period before or after such event thus 9 datasets were used for calibrations and 48 data for validations moreover buffered zones from the central location of each eddy covariance flux tower have been produced using arcgis 10 6 function corresponding to buffered areas of 250 m 500 m 1 km 2 km 5 km 10 km and 20 km the calculation of sebali et in these buffered areas will check the validity of a flux tower to provide accurate results at each distance a simplified flowchart is presented in fig 3 3 results 3 1 sebali calibrations and validations 3 1 1 calibrations as shown in table 2 the calibration value of 1 4 represented the lower rmse and ame in comparison to nine flux towers in germany and belgium errors have increased moving upward and downward this value 3 1 2 validations when using the calibrated value based on nine towers datasets rmse and ame for the remaining 48 data represented 26 52 mm and 21 32 mm respectively table 3 still when incorporating the standard deviation std of each sebali datasets the new rmse and ame have decreased to 9 56 mm and 5 mm respectively fig 4 shows the correlation between 48 et values generated by sebali and those observed in flux towers in both italy and united states the r squared is 86 39 at the calibration value of 1 4 sebali et values with their respective std usually coincide with the flux tower et values with 29 out of 48 60 of values represent this case fig 5 more specifically average ame was at his peak in january and october with values corresponding to 14 79 and 11 26 mm respectively fig 6 lowest average ame values corresponded to summer s months in addition to march 3 1 3 buffered areas as shown in table 4 buffered zones larger than 5 km have generated rmse and ame values higher than those produced by sebali at parcel level still the lowest rmse appeared to be on the 2 km buffered area with 23 24 mm even though rmse and ame at the 2 km and 5 km buffered area showed better values compared to the parcel level assessment when sebali std were added this situation is inversed with parcel level rmse and ame were lower than both 2 km and 5 km buffered regions table 5 still the correlation between the 2 km and 5 km buffered zones as well as the et flux towers data showed promising results i e r squared higher than 85 with a small edge from the 2 km buffered regions fig 7 3 2 spatial and temporal et values et values reached more than 600 mm in some regions irrespective to the location of the parcels as shown in fig 8 most cereal fields i e 74 63 corresponded to the second and third classes i e between 301 and 500 mm average et trend for 552 cereal fields showed the highest et values in may i e flowering and grain filling growth stage fig 9 the average et was low i e less than 35 mm between november and march and then increased tremendously in the following months the standard deviation was high throughout the growth stages 4 discussions while applying several calibration values added to the dynamic changes related to the actual conditions of relative humidity and wind speed the value of 1 4 had the best agreement with the flux tower datasets in different countries and crop conditions such increase in the original sebali et values coincides with previous studies suggesting an underestimating of sebal values in comparison to et ground measurements e g singh et al 2008 long and singh 2012 mkhwanazi et al 2015 the monthly rmse ame and r squared values have been generated from 30 m spatial resolution datasets at parcel level they have showed a good agreement with the flux tower datasets furthermore when considering the sebali std values the rmse showed a very promising value of 9 56 mm month or 0 318 mm day with an ame of 0 167 mm day such results represent a concrete improvement over the previous sebal related validations e g bastiaanssen et al 1998a du et al 2013 jaber et al 2016 on one hand and the validation of the newly proposed sebali model on the other the highest ame are shown in months where information could be missing from a large part of the satellite image due to bad weather conditions and to a lower extent in months where crop development changes drastically within a month thus hindering the accurate estimation of the monthly et based on one satellite imagery per month the other months have presented very low ame values i e 0 mm when trying to identify the more accurate hypothesis i e larger spatial resolution satellite imageries used will generate better correlation between seb outputs and ground measurements data bastiaanssen et al 2002 versus smaller spatial resolution satellite imageries used will generate better correlation between seb outputs and ground measurements data jaber et al 2016 it has been found that working on coarsier spatial resolution i e 250 m and lower generated instantly better rmse and ame values r squared values were acceptable as well i e higher than 85 this scenario is inversed at spatial resolutions higher than 5 km thus enabling to recommend installing flux towers within a 5 km of the needed region such tower should be placed within 2 km of the studied area for best accuracies which is aligned with previous recommendations e g allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2015 still when including seb std the 30 m spatial resolution parcel based assessment generated the lowest rmse and ame thus it was found that both hypotheses found in previous studies are true to an extent more precisely when considering a regional or national study it would be advised to work on a coarser spatial resolution satellite imageries as results will coincide more with the ground measurements saving on time and resources would also be an option when processing these small size images on the other hand when et related values are needed at parcel level for instance to assess existent nitrogen high spatial resolution satellite imageries are recommended due to their abilities to monitor small fluctuations within the field which better coincide with flux towers datasets et values fluctuate between parcels irrespective to their geographical locations main causes could be related to different agricultural practices and varied soil types within the study area while the northern part of the study area is drier a scarcity in water resources coupled with a declining groundwater tables karam and karaa 2000 mhawej et al 2014 allaw et al 2015 are pushing farmers to produce rainfed cereals this is particularly reflected in most parcels corresponding to a seasonal et lower than 400 mm which is generally close to the precipitation amount found within the study area between november and june i e 358 mm furthermore the variation of precipitations within the sub regions has led to an et as low as 150 mm the low et values shown in november as presented in fig 9 are mainly related to the lack of vegetation thus resulting in very low transpiration values moreover the low temperatures coupled with a low incoming radiation generate low soil evaporation values following the dormancy period i e february and march cereals development continues combined with high consumption of water leading to an increase in the total et as the canopy reaches its maximum vegetative growth in may the crop actual et is at its highest levels requiring a significant amount of water karam et al 2009b starting the reproductive stage the canopy dries up and the transpiration decreases to reach very low levels until the cultivar is harvested the soil evaporation at these growth stages is generally masked by the much higher transpiration values even though that temperatures are rising days are longer and incoming solar radiations are more intense the importance of such study lies in calibrating and validating the newly proposed sebali et calculation model in an improved spatial and temporal resolutions setting such model will enable the generation of et values in an automated way without the need of specialized personnel and in a country with many missing datasets when applied in different country sebali validations showed an r squared value of 86 and a daily ame of 0 167 mm such model could be then applied in distinct climatic regions containing different crop types and particularly when soil related datasets are missing while a cloud removal process was included in sebali based on bqa in landsat 8 a more sophisticated algorithm could be used in the future moreover gap filling process should be included to avoid missing pivotal datasets in some locations using a promising newly proposed normalized difference latent heat index ndli liou et al 2018 that outperformed the other existing soil related indices to assess the water availability over a variety of lulc would be an integral addition in future sebali applications crop mapping could also be included to better estimate crop related factors it is also recommended to download and process multiple satellite images per month to decrease ame in months where bad climatic conditions exist or a shift in the crop s development stage occurs when missing these images could be forecasted by applying an existent imputation method such as the maximum likelihood or the wide range of the artificial neural network techniques future studies could focus on improving the spatial resolution of the images used by processing the 10 m sentinel 2 images assessing the daily accuracy of sebali would also be an interesting path to follow enabling the monitoring at a fine scale of the crop development and providing critical information for both policy makers and local farmers identifying the et trends as well as assessing seasonal et values for winter cereal parcels in a semi arid region with missing soil related datasets is the first step towards better scheduling irrigation and water saving while maintaining an acceptable yield this could help lebanon to clearly produce future food security plans government and official entities would have now a tool to estimate winter cereal water consumption per season and thus proposing better policies and management plans 5 conclusion the broader applications of remote sensing techniques aim to increase water productivity in order to support the growing population worldwide this should be done without affecting growth and yields while genetic engineering has already produced an astonishing improvement conserving water could be also achieved via adequate agricultural practices in this context we proposed in this paper an enhancement to the existent py sebal model surnamed sebali to accurately retrieve et values sebali has its strengths over other surface balance energy models particularly in term of using a reduced number of factors other improvements include cloud detection and elimination as well as using atmospherically corrected datasets main results show that the highest et values were in may i e flowering and grain filling growth stage with seasonal et values significantly varying irrespective of the spatial locations of the parcels thus guiding farmers and landowners and helping them to adjust their practices using sebali would be aligned with national and international initiatives to conserve water resources while maintaining high yields these actions would be vital for the establishment of the food security in the country author s contribution all authors of this research paper have directly participated in the planning execution or analysis of this study all authors of

10768,water footprint wf can help understanding of how to grow more food with less water the aim of this paper is to distinguish the factors influencing the paddy rice water footprint by using path analysis of the wf its composition and distribution over 30 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions hereafter provinces in china during 1996 2015 the results show that the annual national wf was approximately 190 74 g m³ including 55 41 green 22 65 blue and 21 94 grey water respectively wf basically remained stable over time wf of the northeast increased from 16 70 g m³ to 39 19 g m³ during the observed period wf for per unit paddy rice product wfp was 995 5 m³ t in the latest 20 years provinces with high wfp and blue water proportion were located in western china and the north china plain all the low wfp values and blue water proportions were found south of the yangtze river the average temperature ate irrigation water utilization coefficient iwc and fertilizer rate per sown area fer were the parameters closely and positively to wfp both temporally and spatially keywords water footprint crop cultivation temporal spatial pattern path analysis water management 1 introduction water is the important basic resource to maintain agriculture global agricultural water use accounts for more than 70 of total water withdrawals with increasing water demands for industry domestic use and ecology as well as the challenges posed by global warming the available water resources for agriculture will be increasingly constrained in the future barnett et al 2005 misra 2014 thus water shortage has become one of the major constraints on global food production bakker 2012 whether the limited water resources can provide support for food production is the focus of governments and scholars all over the world cao et al 2018c rational evaluation of water use the quantity type and efficiency of water used in crop production is of great theoretical and practical significance to clarify the characteristics and problems of agricultural water use and to improve water management fan et al 2012 molden 2008 previous assessments of agricultural water use mainly focus on irrigation water blue water ignoring the important role of green water in food production and the need to assimilate off farm pollution cao et al 2017b jensen 2007 scott et al 2014 zwart et al 2010 the water footprint wf provides a new and comprehensive perspective for scientific evaluation of water resources utilization in agricultural production the crop wf is defined as the volume of freshwater that is consumed during the crop production process it is divided to blue green and gray components blue wf refers to the consumption of irrigation water green wf is the consumption of rainwater insofar as it does not become run off and gray wf is defined to the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards cao et al 2014 egan 2011 wf reflects the type quantity and efficiency of water resources consumed during crop growth it provides a completely new decision making basis for proper water resources utilization especially in agriculture it is estimated that more than 90 of human direct and indirect water consumption is for agriculture hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 hence scholars have carried out many crop wf studies and promoted the application of wf theory in agricultural water management lovarelli et al 2016 research on crop wf focuses on three aspects 1 crop wf theory and quantitative methods including a framework to quantify and evaluate wf chapagain and hoekstra 2011b application of geographic information systems and environmental policy integrated

resources framework cao et al 2017a the idea of a water scarcity footprint with local water resources budgets hess et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016 water footprint reduction strategies for specific regions on water stress indices cao et al 2017c b pfister and bayer 2014 reducing wf as the core target of sustainable utilization of regional water resource chukalla et al 2015 however most current studies remain on the quantitative analysis of crop wf regional differences and attribution analysis of crop wf was rare reported especially at the national scale depicting spatial and temporal patterns and their driving factors are the prerequisites for determining wf reducing priority areas and how to reduce it duan et al 2015 li et al 2018 the application of wf to improve water management still needs further theoretical and practical studies as the country with the largest population and food demand in the world china s per capita fresh water occupies is only about 2000 m³ and 1 4 of the world s level it is one of the countries with the poorest water resources in the world therefore the analysis of water resources consumption in grain crop production process is helpful to clarify the characteristics and problems of water use in food production so as to put forward corresponding strategies and improve the level of agricultural water management rice is one of the main grain crops in china accounting for more than 25 of the total sown area of grain crops the quantification of paddy rice wf will be helpful to evaluate the types of water consumption and water use efficiency and their regional differences in the rice production process it will formulate the management strategy of agricultural water resources for the country however research on rice wf in china focuses on several river basins provinces and cities cao et al 2018a zhuo et al 2014 li et al 2017 yan et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 few studies have been done on a national scale to analyze the composition change and influence trend of rice water footprint correspondingly regional differences and policy recommendations from a national perspective therefore the purposes of this paper are to quantify the wf and its blue green and grey composition for paddy rice in 30 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions provinces of china assess temporal spatial distributions and attributions of rice wf and discuss the strategies for regional wf regulation and sustainable utilization of water resources achievement 2 materials and methods 2 1 wf of paddy rice calculation method total wf of paddy rice is the sum of the blue green and grey wfs 1 w f w f b l u e w f g r e e n w f g r e y and 2 w f b l u e a i w r 3 w f g r e e n a min e t c p e where a is the actual crop area sown in ha iwr is the crop irrigation water requirement in mm pe is the effective precipitation during the crop growth period in mm and etc is crop evapotranspiration in mm the sum of evaporation from plant and soil surfaces and transpiration of water from plant tissue into the atmosphere the iwr and etc can be calculated as cao et al 2017a b c 4 i w r e t c p e e t c p e 0 e t c p e 5 e t c k c e t 0 6 e t 0 0 408 δ r n

m i n is the concentration of chemical in natural water the c m a x and c m i n for total nitrogen were assumed to be 10 mg l and 0 mg l respectively water footprint for per unit paddy rice product wfp is calculated as 9 wfp wf tot where tot is regional total output of paddy rice in ton wfp reflects water use efficiency only through reducing wfp in the process of agricultural production can the regional agricultural water footprint be controlled and water resources be used sustainably 2 2 path analysis method the path analysis pa method was used to identify the effect of various factors on wfp this method decomposes a correlation coefficient into a direct path coefficient dpc an indirect path coefficient ipc and a total correlation coefficient tcc to describe the direct effects indirect effects and comprehensive effects of a selected variable on wfp path analysis also provides an effective way to search for interrelationships between the independent variables the methods of calculating the three coefficients can be found in bhattacharyya et al and guo et al bhattacharyya et al 2018 guo xiangping et al 2018 nine factors relative humidity rhu unit average temperature ate c precipitation pre mm sunshine duration sud d fertilizer rate per sown area fer kg mu 1mu 667 m2 dosage of pesticide per sown area dps kg mu agricultural machinery power per sown area amp kw mu irrigation proportion of arable land ipa and irrigation water use coefficient iwc were selected as independent variables for the path analysis here rhu is the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at a given temperature sud sunshine hours measures duration of sunshine in a year ipa is the ratio of irrigated area to the total arable land area in a region iwc is the ratio of net irrigation water used by crops to the total imported water at the head of the source canal during the irrigation periods these nine factors are carefully selected and most closely related to rice growth and they are measured at the annual scale guo xiangping et al 2018 li et al 2017 2 3 data sources the observation period of this study is 1996 2015 the data of growth periods and kc for paddy rice are from 154 agricultural observation stations chinese academy of agricultural sciences fig 1 the meteorological parameters of 436 weather stations in 30 provinces were downloaded from the climatic data center china meteorological administration http data cma cn the data of stations in a certain province were transformed into the provincial data by weighted averaging iwc for the 30 provinces were collected from the yearly china water resources bulletins 1996 2015 finally the tot sown area irrigation area agricultural machinery power dosage of pesticide and chemical fertilizer application to the field in each province were obtained from the china statistical yearbook 1997 2016 these data were used to calculate wf and conduct the path analysis according the methods presented above 3 results 3 1 wf in china the country planted about 29 72 m ha paddy rice and obtained 191 68 mt product per year in the observed period annual average water resources appropriation was estimated to be 190 74 gm³ 109 m3 for this crop production including 105 69 gm³ irrigation water diversions 43 20 gm³ rain water evapotranspiration and 41 85 gm³ dilution water demand green water footprint dominated the wf in china s paddy rice cultivation the national wf and its composition in 1996 2015 are mapped in fig 2 the national wf ranged from 160 97 gm³ in 2003 to 205 04 gm³ in 2015 during the period wf showed a trend of first decreasing and then rising over time blue green and grey wfs fell to 34 62 91 06 and 35 29 gm³ in 2003 respectively significantly lower than the annual average values on the premise that the field water requirements of rice do not change much the trend of wf over time is mainly determined by the crop sowing area before 2000 the rice planting area was about 31 00 m ha but that decreased to 26 51 m ha in 2003 before rising continuously to more than 30 00 m ha in the latest five years agricultural policy is one of the main reasons for this fluctuation of crop planting area in the tumultuous decade 1999 2008 grain prices could not guarantee adequate reward for farmers labor which led to the decrease in farmers willingness to plant grain the chinese government has issued a series of preferential policies e g abolition of agricultural taxes to improve farmers willingness to plant grain since 2004 so that national grain production including rice achieved steady growth up to 2015 the composition of wf was stable over time the annual average share of blue green and grey water in wf was 22 63 55 43 and 21 94 respectively rain water played an irreplaceable role in paddy rice production in china the importance of the environmental effects of rice production was similar to that of irrigation demand the spatial distribution provincial rice yields and wf over the entire period 1996 2015 are exhibited in fig 3 both rice production and wf show obvious regional differences characterized by a gradual increase from northwest to southeast the central south provinces and east china produced 69 65 and 64 34 m t rice respectively and jointly contributed 69 9 of china s total rice output rice production in the other four regions 9southwest northeast northwest and north china plain accounted for only about 30 0 of the total wf in jiangsu province reached up 22 61 gm³ the highest of the 30 provinces wf exceeded 10 gm³ in six other provinces including hunan sichuan hubei anhui heilongjiang and jiangxi on the other hand wf in beijing gansu shanxi and xizang is below 0 01 gm³ large blue wf values were found in jiangsu 6 28 gm³ and heilongjiang 5 75 gm³ the provinces in which green wf exceeded 10 gm³ are jiangsu 12 36 gm³ sichuan 10 41 gm³ hunan 10 20 gm³ and anhui 10 03 gm³ the annual wf values for the six regions are shown in fig 4 there is a large difference in wf among the regions which is low in north china 1 91 g m³ and the northwest 2 59 g m³ middling in the northeast 20 80 g m³ and southwest 33 42 g m³ and high in east china 64 43 g m³ and the central south 60 60 g m³ east china and the central south provinces together accounted for 65 5 of china s rice water footprint compared to only 2 4 for north china and the north west there are also differences in the trend of wf over time in the regions north and north west provinces did not show a significant trend over time both east china and central south provinces showed a trend of decreasing first and then increasing consistent with the national wf shown in fig 2 the paddy rice water footprint of china is dominated by these two regions the wf of northeast provinces increased steadily over time from 16 70 gm³ in 1996 to 39 19 gm³ in 2015 directly caused by the expansion of the scale of rice cultivation the total rice planting area of the three northeast provinces in 1996 was 2019 0 ha which expanded to 4454 5 in 2015 at the same time the demand for irrigation water has increased by 2 4 times in contrast the rice wf in the humid southwestern region decreased over time from nearly 40 gm³ in 1996 to 33 16 gm³ in 2015 mainly due to the western development strategy reducing the water footprint in wet areas and increasing it in dry areas is not conducive to the efficient and sustainable use of water resources at the national scale 3 2 spatial temporal distribution of wfp the national average wfp of rice in 1996 2015 was estimated to be 995 5 m³ t about 225 3 m³ irrigation water 551 5 m³ rain water and 218 4 m³ dilution water was demanded per unit of rice product wfp for each year is decomposed into blue green and grey in fig 5 the aggregate wfp is quite stable over time due to the slight changes in the total water consumption and the rice yield yet the components of wfp changed over time increase at about 0 5 per year the blue water footprint per unit of rice wfpblue increased from 211 4 m³ t to 230 8 m³ t the green wfpgreen and grey wfpgrey water footprint per unit of rice were 552 5 m³ t and 219 9m³ t at the beginning of the period but fell by 2 04 and 3 29 in the next 20 years respectively this meant that the proportion of wfp accounted for by wfpblue increased from 21 49 to 23 44 whereas the proportions for wfpgreen and wfpgrey decreased from 56 16 and 22 35 54 96 and 21 60 respectively the annual averages of wfp and its blue green and grey components are mapped in fig 6 green water dominates the paddy rice wf in all provinces except xinjiang and ningxia the proportion of green water in wf in the northwest and north china was obviously lower than that in other regions because of aridity the difference between provinces in the proportion of wf accounted for by gray water was smaller than that of blue and green water only in xizang tibet did this proportion exceed 70 all other provinces where the green water proportions were higher than the national average 55 41 were located in south china the proportion of green water in wf was less than 40 in seven provinces significantly lower in ningxia 22 5 and xinjiang 14 4 because the differences between provinces in total crop water requirement were small the spatial distribution of blue water proportion was almost the mirror image of that of green water the proportion of blue water in wf was highest in xinjiang and ningxia 71 1 and 60 7 respectively the only two provinces where the blue water footprint accounted for more than half the total wf all 13 provinces where the blue water proportion was lower than the national average 22 6 were located in southern china the proportion of grey water in wf varied from 14 3 liaoning to 30 0 hunan with most provinces ranging from 16 to 25 generally the proportion of grey water in wf was lower in northern provinces than in southern provinces fig 6 also shows the spatial distribution of aggregate water use efficiency wfp provinces with high wfp were located in the north northeast and west whereas those with high absolute water use efficiency were located in the middle south and east of the country the maximum value of wfp was found in liaoning 1531 2 m³ t and the values in 22 other provinces exceeded the national average wfp 995 5 m³ t the wfp of hunan jiangxi fujian zhejiang guangdong guangxi and hainan provinces was lower than the national average with hunan 728 5 m³ t the lowest combining figs 2 4 and 5 it can be seen that the national blue water footprint was increasing with the expansion of rice cultivation in the regions with high blue water proportions such as the northeast the spatial pattern of wfp decreasing from the northwest to the southeast was mainly determined by climatic conditions in the arid northwest where evapotranspiration is high crop water requirements are higher than in central east and south regions where rainwater resources are abundant rainfall supplied about 75 of the field evapotranspiration in some southeast provinces northeast china with its high wfp and insufficient precipitation has gradually become the main rice producing area of the country precipitation in the southwest was higher than the national average making green water dominate in paddy rice wf there the north china plain has insufficient and annually varied rainfall so rice production mainly depends on blue water resources 3 3 influences on wfp the influences of selected factors on the spatial distribution of annual provincial wfp and the temporal changes in national wfp are identified in table 1 and 2 respectively spatially the highest absolute total correlation coefficient tcc for wfp was with irrigation water use coefficient 0 405 followed by precipitation 0 380 and relative humidity 0 370 generally regions with high irrigation water use coefficient low relative humidity or low precipitation incline to high water footprint per unit of rice product there is no close total correlation coefficient between wfp and the other factors examined however the way of influence of specified factors on wfp also depends on their direct and indirect path coefficients the direct path coefficients are also shown in table 1 arranged by their absolute value high to low the factors are average temperature irrigation water use coefficient relative humidity dosage of pesticide per sown area precipitation agricultural machinery power per sown area fertilizer rate per sown area sunshine duration and irrigation proportion of arable land with direct path coefficients reaching 0 650 and 0 531 the average temperature and irrigation water use coefficient irrigation efficiency had the greatest positive impact on rice water footprint by contrast relative humidity and dosage of pesticide per sown area exhibited direct negative impacts on wfp the irrigation proportion of arable land has no direct statistical effect on wfp the direct influence of other factors on wfp including sunshine duration 0 026 fertilizer rate per sown area 0 103 agricultural machinery power per sown area 0 137 and precipitation 0 170 can almost be ignored in comparison with average temperature and irrigation water use coefficient the indirect path coefficients reveal that both meteorological parameters and agricultural production factors affect the rice water footprint through average temperature the indirect path coefficients between relative humidity precipitation fertilizer rate per sown area and dosage of pesticide per sown area on the one hand and average temperature on the other hand are 0 417 0 430 0 445 and 0 410 respectively other indirect affects also emerge among agricultural production factors such as fertilizer rate per sown area and dosage of pesticide per sown area 0 224 irrigation proportion of arable land and dosage of pesticide per sown area 0 173 and agricultural machinery power per sown area and irrigation water use coefficient 0 199 meteorological parameters negatively affected wfp through humidity and irrigation efficiency and positively affected it through temperature chemical fertilizers pesticides and irrigation proportion had positive effects on wfp through temperature however total mechanical power and irrigation efficiency had negative effects on wfp through temperature from a temporal perspective there were strong total correlations between wfp and the four factors irrigation water use coefficient sunshine duration irrigation proportion of arable land and precipitation with coefficients of 0 399 0 302 0 287 and 0 282 respectively factors with high absolute direct path coefficients are fertilizer rate per sown area 0 421 irrigation water use coefficient 0 391 average temperature 0 321 and relative humidity 0 246 in an analysis of temporal data agricultural production factors directly affect water footprint more than meteorological parameters the dosage of pesticide per sown area and irrigation proportion of arable land did not have a direct impact on wfp it is notable that the fertilizer rate per sown area is one of the main factors that directly affects wfp contrary to the results of the spatial analysis listed in table 2 controlling the excessive application of chemical fertilizer has an important effect on paddy rice water footprint reduction the indirect path coefficients indicate that precipitation and fertilizer use have negative correlations and indirect effects on the water footprint of rice production mainly through humidity and pesticide use and positive correlations and indirect effects through average temperature while sunshine hours and irrigation efficiency have positive correlations and indirect effects on the water footprint of rice production through humidity and pesticide use and negative correlations through temperature overall climate conditions largely determine crop evapotranspiration and water footprint but agricultural input factors were also related to crop water footprint both temporally and spatially 4 discussion quantifying crop water footprints are essential preparatory tasks for regional water footprint regulation or reduction the water footprints of major crops including rice have been widely reported which makes the reliability of calculations verifiable in this study like most studies we calculated paddy rice water footprint with reference to the method recommended by the water footprint manual barnett et al 2005 egan 2011 we calculate the national wfp of paddy rice during 1996 2015 as 995 5 m³ t close to the 971 m³ t in 2000 2004 estimated by chapagain and hoekstra chapagain and hoekstra 2011a liu et al and wang et al obtained national wfp values for perennial average and 2014 to be 1190 and 1390 m³ t respectively slightly higher than the results in this study liu et al 2007 wang et al 2015 blue and green water footprints were estimated with the help of the p m equation and the grey water footprint was estimated from the nitrogen fertilizer loss assumption in chapagain and hoekstra chapagain and hoekstra 2011a liu et al estimated blue and green water consumption from previous estimates of the crop water requirement of rice liu et al 2007 wang et al quantified the blue water footprint by the irrigation quota method and included irrigation water loss wang et al 2015 the different crop yields are the reason for the slight differences between the results in this paper and previous studies the calculation results in current study are thus reliable and consequently can be used to discuss the regulation or reduction of crop water footprints hoekstra et al also suggested ways of reducing wf including increases in green and blue water productivity for agricultural products and reductions in the use of fertilisers and pesticides chapagain and hoekstra 2011a previous studies have also mentioned the importance of reducing the crop water footprint to alleviate water shortages however most of these studies were limited to measurements of the crop water footprint and few explored the factors influencing the water footprint or proposed how to reduce the water footprint farmers and water resource managers need to know how to regulate agricultural water footprint by means of the path analysis method this paper analyses the influence of climate agricultural production and socio economic parameters on the crop water footprint we found that the irrigation water use coefficient iwc the fertilizer rate per sown area fer and average temperature ate are the main factors affecting rice wfp in china ate was positively correlated with wfp both in time and space higher temperature not only increases the evaporation of water surfaces but also promotes crop transpiration therefore regardless of the progress of agricultural production and water saving technology paddy rice water footprint will increase and green and blue water productivity for agricultural products will decrease under forecast future rising temperatures wang et al 2015 means of addressing climate change are also important for agricultural water use increases in irrigation efficiency and fertilizer use have a direct positive role in wfp table 1 and 2 this finding coincides with devkota s view devkota et al 2019 increasing efficiencies that will also lead to reduced environmental footprint however the increase in pesticides and fertilizers is likely to cause pollution and the amount of grey water will increase it will also increase the total water footprint conventional agricultural production and water management aim to improve irrigation efficiency and fertilizer input to increase crop yield in agricultural water management it is necessary to find a balance between increasing production and regulating the water footprint the current paper takes a tentative step in this respect however macro analysis is far from sufficient the processes of water and fertilizer transport on specific farmlands or in agricultural production systems are complex so quantifying the effects of the factors that affect crop water footprints and their composition needs to be based on data from comparative observations during crop cultivation 5 conclusion china annually produced 191 68 mt of rice which consumed about190 74 gm³ of water resources in the period 1996 2015 rain water dominated the water footprint of paddy rice production total rice output and the water footprint first decreased and then increased over time in parallel with the changes in planting area provincial water footprints were stable over time but differ greatly over space the green water footprint dominated in the humid southwest central south and east china while irrigation water consumption comprised a high proportion of the water footprint in the more arid regions of north china plain northeast and northwest china with the shift of the centre of gravity of china s grain to the north rice production in southwest and east china decreased over time but increased in northeast china this means that the proportion of blue water in the total footprint of paddy rice increased adjusting the planting structure to expand the sown area in southwest and east china would reduce blue water consumption and save water resources at a national scale in addition to meteorological elements such as humidity and temperature pesticide application irrigation project completeness and fertilizer investment were agricultural production factors that affect water use efficiency as measured by water footprint water conservancy facilities can also raise water use efficiency in rice farming the exploration of factors influencing and regulating water footprints is an important advance over previous studies nevertheless the processes of crop growth and of water and fertilizer transport are complex how to optimize irrigation fertilization and other agronomic measures to reduce the water footprint of crop production needs further more localised research declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments

10768,water footprint wf can help understanding of how to grow more food with less water the aim of this paper is to distinguish the factors influencing the paddy rice water footprint by using path analysis of the wf its composition and distribution over 30 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions hereafter provinces in china during 1996 2015 the results show that the annual national wf was approximately 190 74 g m³ including 55 41 green 22 65 blue and 21 94 grey water respectively wf basically remained stable over time wf of the northeast increased from 16 70 g m³ to 39 19 g m³ during the observed period wf for per unit paddy rice product wfp was 995 5 m³ t in the latest 20 years provinces with high wfp and blue water proportion were located in western china and the north china plain all the low wfp values and blue water proportions were found south of the yangtze river the average temperature ate irrigation water utilization coefficient iwc and fertilizer rate per sown area fer were the parameters closely and positively to wfp both temporally and spatially keywords water footprint crop cultivation temporal spatial pattern path analysis water management 1 introduction water is the important basic resource to maintain agriculture global agricultural water use accounts for more than 70 of total water withdrawals with increasing water demands for industry domestic use and ecology as well as the challenges posed by global warming the available water resources for agriculture will be increasingly constrained in the future barnett et al 2005 misra 2014 thus water shortage has become one of the major constraints on global food production bakker 2012 whether the limited water resources can provide support for food production is the focus of governments and scholars all over the world cao et al 2018c rational evaluation of water use the quantity type and efficiency of water used in crop production is of great theoretical and practical significance to clarify the characteristics and problems of agricultural water use and to improve water management fan et al 2012 molden 2008 previous assessments of agricultural water use mainly focus on irrigation water blue water ignoring the important role of green water in food production and the need to assimilate off farm pollution cao et al 2017b jensen 2007 scott et al 2014 zwart et al 2010 the water footprint wf provides a new and comprehensive perspective for scientific evaluation of water resources utilization in agricultural production the crop wf is defined as the volume of freshwater that is consumed during the crop production process it is divided to blue green and gray components blue wf refers to the consumption of irrigation water green wf is the consumption of rainwater insofar as it does not become run off and gray wf is defined to the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards cao et al 2014 egan 2011 wf reflects the type quantity and efficiency of water resources consumed during crop growth it provides a completely new decision making basis for proper water resources utilization especially in agriculture it is estimated that more than 90 of human direct and indirect water consumption is for agriculture hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 hence scholars have carried out many crop wf studies and promoted the application of wf theory in agricultural water management lovarelli et al 2016 research on crop wf focuses on three aspects 1 crop wf theory and quantitative methods including a framework to quantify and evaluate wf chapagain and hoekstra 2011b application of geographic information systems and environmental policy integrated

on water stress indices cao et al 2017c b pfister and bayer 2014 reducing wf as the core target of sustainable utilization of regional water resource chukalla et al 2015 however most current studies remain on the quantitative analysis of crop wf regional differences and attribution analysis of crop wf was rare reported especially at the national scale depicting spatial and temporal patterns and their driving factors are the prerequisites for determining wf reducing priority areas and how to reduce it duan et al 2015 li et al 2018 the application of wf to improve water management still needs further theoretical and practical studies as the country with the largest population and food demand in the world china s per capita fresh water occupies is only about 2000 m³ and 1 4 of the world s level it is one of the countries with the poorest water resources in the world therefore the analysis of water resources consumption in grain crop production process is helpful to clarify the characteristics and problems of water use in food production so as to put forward corresponding strategies and improve the level of agricultural water management rice is one of the main grain crops in china accounting for more than 25 of the total sown area of grain crops the quantification of paddy rice wf will be helpful to evaluate the types of water consumption and water use efficiency and their regional differences in the rice production process it will formulate the management strategy of agricultural water resources for the country however research on rice wf in china focuses on several river basins provinces and cities cao et al 2018a zhuo et al 2014 li et al 2017 yan et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 few studies have been done on a national scale to analyze the composition change and influence trend of rice water footprint correspondingly regional differences and policy recommendations from a national perspective therefore the purposes of this paper are to quantify the wf and its blue green and grey composition for paddy rice in 30 provinces municipalities and autonomous regions provinces of china assess temporal spatial distributions and attributions of rice wf and discuss the strategies for regional wf regulation and sustainable utilization of water resources achievement 2 materials and methods 2 1 wf of paddy rice calculation method total wf of paddy rice is the sum of the blue green and grey wfs 1 w f w f b l u e w f g r e e n w f g r e y and 2 w f b l u e a i w r 3 w f g r e e n a min e t c p e where a is the actual crop area sown in ha iwr is the crop irrigation water requirement in mm pe is the effective precipitation during the crop growth period in mm and etc is crop evapotranspiration in mm the sum of evaporation from plant and soil surfaces

m i n is the concentration of chemical in natural water the c m a x and c m i n for total nitrogen were assumed to be 10 mg l and 0 mg l respectively water footprint for per unit paddy rice product wfp is calculated as 9 wfp wf tot where tot is regional total output of paddy rice in ton wfp reflects water use efficiency only through reducing wfp in the process of agricultural production can the regional agricultural water footprint be controlled and water resources be used sustainably 2 2 path analysis method the path analysis pa method was used to identify the effect of various factors on wfp this method decomposes a correlation coefficient into a direct path coefficient dpc an indirect path coefficient ipc and a total correlation coefficient tcc to describe the direct effects indirect effects and comprehensive effects of a selected variable on wfp path analysis also provides an effective way to search for interrelationships between the independent variables the methods of calculating the three coefficients can be found in bhattacharyya et al and guo et al bhattacharyya et al 2018 guo xiangping et al 2018 nine factors relative humidity rhu unit average temperature ate c precipitation pre mm sunshine duration sud d fertilizer rate per sown area fer kg mu 1mu 667 m2 dosage of pesticide per sown area dps kg mu agricultural machinery power per sown area amp kw mu irrigation proportion of arable land ipa and irrigation water use coefficient iwc were selected as independent variables for the path analysis here rhu is the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at a given temperature sud sunshine hours measures duration of sunshine in a year ipa is the ratio of irrigated area to the total arable land area in a region iwc is the ratio of net irrigation water used by crops to the total imported water at the head of the source canal during the irrigation periods these nine factors are carefully selected and most closely related to rice growth and they are measured at the annual scale guo xiangping et al 2018 li et al 2017 2 3 data sources the observation period of this study is 1996 2015 the data of growth periods and kc for paddy rice are from 154 agricultural observation stations chinese academy of agricultural sciences fig 1 the meteorological parameters of 436 weather stations in 30 provinces were downloaded from the climatic data center china meteorological administration http data cma cn the data of stations in a certain province were transformed into the provincial data by weighted averaging iwc for the 30 provinces were collected from the yearly china water resources bulletins 1996 2015 finally the tot sown area irrigation area agricultural machinery power dosage of pesticide and chemical fertilizer application to the field in each province were obtained from the china statistical yearbook 1997 2016 these data were used to calculate wf and conduct the path analysis according the methods presented above 3 results 3 1 wf in china the country planted about 29 72 m ha paddy rice and obtained 191 68 mt product per year in the observed period annual average water resources appropriation was estimated to be 190 74 gm³ 109 m3 for this crop production including 105 69 gm³ irrigation water diversions 43 20 gm³ rain water evapotranspiration and 41 85 gm³ dilution water demand green water footprint dominated the wf in china s paddy rice cultivation the national wf and its composition in 1996 2015 are mapped in fig 2 the national wf ranged from 160 97 gm³ in 2003 to 205 04 gm³ in 2015 during the period wf showed a trend of first decreasing and then rising over time blue green and grey wfs fell to 34 62 91 06 and 35 29 gm³ in 2003 respectively significantly lower than the annual average values on the premise that the field water requirements of rice do not change much the trend of wf over time is mainly determined by the crop sowing area before 2000 the rice planting area was about 31 00 m ha but that decreased to 26 51 m ha in 2003 before rising continuously to more than 30 00 m ha in the latest five years agricultural policy is one of the main reasons for this fluctuation of crop planting area in the tumultuous decade 1999 2008 grain prices could not guarantee adequate reward for farmers labor which led to the decrease in farmers willingness to plant grain the chinese government has issued a series of preferential policies e g abolition of agricultural taxes to improve farmers willingness to plant grain since 2004 so that national grain production including rice achieved steady growth up to 2015 the composition of wf was stable over time the annual average share of blue green and grey water in wf was 22 63 55 43 and 21 94 respectively rain water played an irreplaceable role in paddy rice production in china the importance of the environmental effects of rice production was similar to that of irrigation demand the spatial distribution provincial rice yields and wf over the entire period 1996 2015 are exhibited in fig 3 both rice production and wf show obvious regional differences characterized by a gradual increase from northwest to southeast the central south provinces and east china produced 69 65 and 64 34 m t rice respectively and jointly contributed 69 9 of china s total rice output rice production in the other four regions 9southwest northeast northwest and north china plain accounted for only about 30 0 of the total wf in jiangsu province reached up 22 61 gm³ the highest of the 30 provinces wf exceeded 10 gm³ in six other provinces including hunan sichuan hubei anhui heilongjiang and jiangxi on the other hand wf in beijing gansu shanxi and xizang is below 0 01 gm³ large blue wf values were found in jiangsu 6 28 gm³ and heilongjiang 5 75 gm³ the provinces in which green wf exceeded 10 gm³ are jiangsu 12 36 gm³ sichuan 10 41 gm³ hunan 10 20 gm³ and anhui 10 03 gm³ the annual wf values for the six regions are shown in fig 4 there is a large difference in wf among the regions which is low in north china 1 91 g m³ and the northwest 2 59 g m³ middling in the northeast 20 80 g m³ and southwest 33 42 g m³ and high in east china 64 43 g m³ and the central south 60 60 g m³ east china and the central south provinces together accounted for 65 5 of china s rice water footprint compared to only 2 4 for north china and the north west there are also differences in the trend of wf over time in the regions north and north west provinces did not show a significant trend over time both east china and central south provinces showed a trend of decreasing first and then increasing consistent with the national wf shown in fig 2 the paddy rice water footprint of china is dominated by these two regions the wf of northeast provinces increased steadily over time from 16 70 gm³ in 1996 to 39 19 gm³ in 2015 directly caused by the expansion of the scale of rice cultivation the total rice planting area of the three northeast provinces in 1996 was 2019 0 ha which expanded to 4454 5 in 2015 at the same time the demand for irrigation water has increased by 2 4 times in contrast the rice wf in the humid southwestern region decreased over time from nearly 40 gm³ in 1996 to 33 16 gm³ in 2015 mainly due to the western development strategy reducing the water footprint in wet areas and increasing it in dry areas is not conducive to the efficient and sustainable use of water resources at the national scale 3 2 spatial temporal distribution of wfp the national average wfp of rice in 1996 2015 was estimated to be 995 5 m³ t about 225 3 m³ irrigation water 551 5 m³ rain water and 218 4 m³ dilution water was demanded per unit of rice product wfp for each year is decomposed into blue green and grey in fig 5 the aggregate wfp is quite stable over time due to the slight changes in the total water consumption and the rice yield yet the components of wfp changed over time increase at about 0 5 per year the blue water footprint per unit of rice wfpblue increased from 211 4 m³ t to 230 8 m³ t the green wfpgreen and grey wfpgrey water footprint per unit of rice were 552 5 m³ t and 219 9m³ t at the beginning of the period but fell by 2 04 and 3 29 in the next 20 years respectively this meant that the proportion of wfp accounted for by wfpblue increased from 21 49 to 23 44 whereas the proportions for wfpgreen and wfpgrey decreased from 56 16 and 22 35 54 96 and 21 60 respectively the annual averages of wfp and its blue green and grey components are mapped in fig 6 green water dominates the paddy rice wf in all provinces except xinjiang and ningxia the proportion of green water in wf in the northwest and north china was obviously lower than that in other regions because of aridity the difference between provinces in the proportion of wf accounted for by gray water was smaller than that of blue and green water only in xizang tibet did this proportion exceed 70 all other provinces where the green water proportions were higher than the national average 55 41 were located in south china the proportion of green water in wf was less than 40 in seven provinces significantly lower in ningxia 22 5 and xinjiang 14 4 because the differences between provinces in total crop water requirement were small the spatial distribution of blue water proportion was almost the mirror image of that of green water the proportion of blue water in wf was highest in xinjiang and ningxia 71 1 and 60 7 respectively the only two provinces where the blue water footprint accounted for more than half the total wf all 13 provinces where the blue water proportion was lower than the national average 22 6 were located in southern china the proportion of grey water in wf varied from 14 3 liaoning to 30 0 hunan with most provinces ranging from 16 to 25 generally the proportion of grey water in wf was lower in northern provinces than in southern provinces fig 6 also shows the spatial distribution of aggregate water use efficiency wfp provinces with high wfp were located in the north northeast and west whereas those with high absolute water use efficiency were located in the middle south and east of the country the maximum value of wfp was found in liaoning 1531 2 m³ t and the values in 22 other provinces exceeded the national average wfp 995 5 m³ t the wfp of hunan jiangxi fujian zhejiang guangdong guangxi and hainan provinces was lower than the national average with hunan 728 5 m³ t the lowest combining figs 2 4 and 5 it can be seen that the national blue water footprint was increasing with the expansion of rice cultivation in the regions with high blue water proportions such as the northeast the spatial pattern of wfp decreasing from the northwest to the southeast was mainly determined by climatic conditions in the arid northwest where evapotranspiration is high crop water requirements are higher than in central east and south regions where rainwater resources are abundant rainfall supplied about 75 of the field evapotranspiration in some southeast provinces northeast china with its high wfp and insufficient precipitation has gradually become the main rice producing area of the country precipitation in the southwest was higher than the national average making green water dominate in paddy rice wf there the north china plain has insufficient and annually varied rainfall so rice production mainly depends on blue water resources 3 3 influences on wfp the influences of selected factors on the spatial distribution of annual provincial wfp and the temporal changes in national wfp are identified in table 1 and 2 respectively spatially the highest absolute total correlation coefficient tcc for wfp was with irrigation water use coefficient 0 405 followed by precipitation 0 380 and relative humidity 0 370 generally regions with high irrigation water use coefficient low relative humidity or low precipitation incline to high water footprint per unit of rice product there is no close total correlation coefficient between wfp and the other factors examined however the way of influence of specified factors on wfp also depends on their direct and indirect path coefficients the direct path coefficients are also shown in table 1 arranged by their absolute value high to low the factors are average temperature irrigation water use coefficient relative humidity dosage of pesticide per sown area precipitation agricultural machinery power per sown area fertilizer rate per sown area sunshine duration and irrigation proportion of arable land with direct path coefficients reaching 0 650 and 0 531 the average temperature and irrigation water use coefficient irrigation efficiency had the greatest positive impact on rice water footprint by contrast relative humidity and dosage of pesticide per sown area exhibited direct negative impacts on wfp the irrigation proportion of arable land has no direct statistical effect on wfp the direct influence of other factors on wfp including sunshine duration 0 026 fertilizer rate per sown area 0 103 agricultural machinery power per sown area 0 137 and precipitation 0 170 can almost be ignored in comparison with average temperature and irrigation water use coefficient the indirect path coefficients reveal that both meteorological parameters and agricultural production factors affect the rice water footprint through average temperature the indirect path coefficients between relative humidity precipitation fertilizer rate per sown area and dosage of pesticide per sown area on the one hand and average temperature on the other hand are 0 417 0 430 0 445 and 0 410 respectively other indirect affects also emerge among agricultural production factors such as fertilizer rate per sown area and dosage of pesticide per sown area 0 224 irrigation proportion of arable land and dosage of pesticide per sown area 0 173 and agricultural machinery power per sown area and irrigation water use coefficient 0 199 meteorological parameters negatively affected wfp through humidity and irrigation efficiency and positively affected it through temperature chemical fertilizers pesticides and irrigation proportion had positive effects on wfp through temperature however total mechanical power and irrigation efficiency had negative effects on wfp through temperature from a temporal perspective there were strong total correlations between wfp and the four factors irrigation water use coefficient sunshine duration irrigation proportion of arable land and precipitation with coefficients of 0 399 0 302 0 287 and 0 282 respectively factors with high absolute direct path coefficients are fertilizer rate per sown area 0 421 irrigation water use coefficient 0 391 average temperature 0 321 and relative humidity 0 246 in an analysis of temporal data agricultural production factors directly affect water footprint more than meteorological parameters the dosage of pesticide per sown area and irrigation proportion of arable land did not have a direct impact on wfp it is notable that the fertilizer rate per sown area is one of the main factors that directly affects wfp contrary to the results of the spatial analysis listed in table 2 controlling the excessive application of chemical fertilizer has an important effect on paddy rice water footprint reduction the indirect path coefficients indicate that precipitation and fertilizer use have negative correlations and indirect effects on the water footprint of rice production mainly through humidity and pesticide use and positive correlations and indirect effects through average temperature while sunshine hours and irrigation efficiency have positive correlations and indirect effects on the water footprint of rice production through humidity and pesticide use and negative correlations through temperature overall climate conditions largely determine crop evapotranspiration and water footprint but agricultural input factors were also related to crop water footprint both temporally and spatially 4 discussion quantifying crop water footprints are essential preparatory tasks for regional water footprint regulation or reduction the water footprints of major crops including rice have been widely reported which makes the reliability of calculations verifiable in this study like most studies we calculated paddy rice water footprint with reference to the method recommended by the water footprint manual barnett et al 2005 egan 2011 we calculate the national wfp of paddy rice during 1996 2015 as 995 5 m³ t close to the 971 m³ t in 2000 2004 estimated by chapagain and hoekstra chapagain and hoekstra 2011a liu et al and wang et al obtained national wfp values for perennial average and 2014 to be 1190 and 1390 m³ t respectively slightly higher than the results in this study liu et al 2007 wang et al 2015 blue and green water footprints were estimated with the help of the p m equation and the grey water footprint was estimated from the nitrogen fertilizer loss assumption in chapagain and hoekstra chapagain and hoekstra 2011a liu et al estimated blue and green water consumption from previous estimates of the crop water requirement of rice liu et al 2007 wang et al quantified the blue water footprint by the irrigation quota method and included irrigation water loss wang et al 2015 the different crop yields are the reason for the slight differences between the results in this paper and previous studies the calculation results in current study are thus reliable and consequently can be used to discuss the regulation or reduction of crop water footprints hoekstra et al also suggested ways of reducing wf including increases in green and blue water productivity for agricultural products and reductions in the use of fertilisers and pesticides chapagain and hoekstra 2011a previous studies have also mentioned the importance of reducing the crop water footprint to alleviate water shortages however most of these studies were limited to measurements of the crop water footprint and few explored the factors influencing the water footprint or proposed how to reduce the water footprint farmers and water resource managers need to know how to regulate agricultural water footprint by means of the path analysis method this paper analyses the influence of climate agricultural production and socio economic parameters on the crop water footprint we found that the irrigation water use coefficient iwc the fertilizer rate per sown area fer and average temperature ate are the main factors affecting rice wfp in china ate was positively correlated with wfp both in time and space higher temperature not only increases the evaporation of water surfaces but also promotes crop transpiration therefore regardless of the progress of agricultural production and water saving technology paddy rice water footprint will increase and green and blue water productivity for agricultural products will decrease under forecast future rising temperatures wang et al 2015 means of addressing climate change are also important for agricultural water use increases in irrigation efficiency and fertilizer use have a direct positive role in wfp table 1 and 2 this finding coincides with devkota s view devkota et al 2019 increasing efficiencies that will also lead to reduced environmental footprint however the increase in pesticides and fertilizers is likely to cause pollution and the amount of grey water will increase it will also increase the total water footprint conventional agricultural production and water management aim to improve irrigation efficiency and fertilizer input to increase crop yield in agricultural water management it is necessary to find a balance between increasing production and regulating the water footprint the current paper takes a tentative step in this respect however macro analysis is far from sufficient the processes of water and fertilizer transport on specific farmlands or in agricultural production systems are complex so quantifying the effects of the factors that affect crop water footprints and their composition needs to be based on data from comparative observations during crop cultivation 5 conclusion china annually produced 191 68 mt of rice which consumed about190 74 gm³ of water resources in the period 1996 2015 rain water dominated the water footprint of paddy rice production total rice output and the water footprint first decreased and then increased over time in parallel with the changes in planting area provincial water footprints were stable over time but differ greatly over space the green water footprint dominated in the humid southwest central south and east china while irrigation water consumption comprised a high proportion of the water footprint in the more arid regions of north china plain northeast and northwest china with the shift of the centre of gravity of china s grain to the north rice production in southwest and east china decreased over time but increased in northeast china this means that the proportion of blue water in the total footprint of paddy rice increased adjusting the planting structure to expand the sown area in southwest and east china would reduce blue water consumption and save water resources at a national scale in addition to meteorological elements such as humidity and temperature pesticide application irrigation project completeness and fertilizer investment were agricultural production factors that affect water use efficiency as measured by water footprint water conservancy facilities can also raise water use efficiency in rice farming the exploration of factors influencing and regulating water footprints is an important advance over previous studies nevertheless the processes of crop growth and of water and fertilizer transport are complex how to optimize irrigation fertilization and other agronomic measures to reduce the water footprint of crop production needs further more localised research declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments

10769,maintaining soil water content within the readily available range is optimum concerning crop production and water use in this regard the continuous monitoring of soil water content is a crucial element for identifying the key parameters for sustainable agricultural water management in this study volumetric soil water content θv was monitored and analyzed in a bare soil agricultural field sakaecho experimental field of tokyo university of agriculture and technology the field consisting of volcanic ash soils was monitored from june 2016 to september 2017 using capacitance sensor cs the optimal range of readily available water for plant uptake was defined as the range between field capacity and depletion level θdep these values were determined from the soil water potentials and θv values measured using pressure plate and soil cores respectively the 16 month period monitoring result revealed substantial temporal variability in θv in response to rainfall evaporation and deep percolation the monitored values of θv were above the θdep 0 307 cm3 cm 3 measured at suction pf value of 3 0 throughout the monitoring period for the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers in contrast for the surface soil 0 10 cm the θv fell below θdep for 27 of the monitoring period despite the high rainfall during those periods owing to high evaporation and deep percolation the below θdep results for the surface soil suggests the need to conduct continuous θv monitoring to support decision for planning efficient irrigation water management to avoid yield loss of shallow rooted crops and deep rooted crops at their earliest growth stages as well as quality reductions due to moisture stresses keywords andosol capacitance sensor depletion level field capacity monitoring plant available water and soil water content 1 introduction soil water content swc varies spatially and temporally bittelli 2011 korres et al 2013 narasimhan et al 2005 temporally swc varies in responses to rainfall irrigation overland flow subsurface flow capillary rise percolation evaporation and root water uptake kutı lek and nielsen 1994 spatially it varies due to heterogeneous soil properties topography vegetation and climate wang and singh 2017 continuously monitoring the swc of soil profile offers information regarding the status of water storage and its temporal dynamics nolz and kammerer 2017 which can be used to avoid over or under irrigation hartz and hanson 2005 over irrigation results in the leaching of nutrients and pesticides from the root zone hence it ultimately ends up in undernourishment of the targeted crop substantial water consumption energy use and production costs for farmers and the potential contamination of groundwater bodies cepuder and nolz 2007 fereres et al 2003 on the other hand under irrigation leads to water stress conditions which reduces potential yield coates et al 2005 doraiswamy et al 2004 and the quality of the final product fao 2012 nolz et al 2016 van leeuwen et al 2009 by conducting swc monitoring water consumption can be optimized thompson et al 2007a resulting in increased revenue to farmers due to 1 reduction in costs and 2 increase in both crop yield and quality the status of soil water can be inferred directly from on site measurements of swc dörner et al 2015 nolz et al 2016 and or soil water potential swp masseroni et al 2016 which are among the most effective options as they offer reliable and direct information concerning the soil water of a given agricultural soil the swc is the volume of the soil water retained within the total volume of a certain soil fares et al 2006 whereas swp is the measure of work that the plant roots exert to extract the water hold by the soil particles nolz et al 2016 or alternatively is a measure of the force that the solid soil matrix applies to attract and hold water to its surface area shock and wang 2011 important swp thresholds are recognized such as the field capacity θfc depletion level θdep and permanent wilting point θpwp which all depend on soil properties soil texture organic matter content soil structure soil minerals etc and swc whalley et al 2013 owing to its straightness independence of the agricultural water threshold values on soil properties and direct relation to water stress a number of studies suggested measuring swp as the best monitoring variable over swc for ensuring optimum water for agricultural purpose in the root zone centeno et al 2010 nolz et al 2016 thompson et al 2007a among the various monitoring devices currently available on the market tensiometer migliaccio et al 2010 granular matrix sensors bilibio et al 2014 gypsum blocks smittle et al 1994 and dielectric sensors nolz et al 2016 have all been used for measuring swp in a wide variety of environments climates soil types and agricultural systems mainly to support irrigation management at the field scale alternatively monitoring of swc can be conducted using capacitance sensor cs in cases of the availability of the monitoring devises an integrated in situ measurement of both variables swp and swc enables one to determine simultaneously the hydraulic properties of a particular soil under natural condition which are basic to maintain soil water between θfc and θdep nolz and kammerer 2017 and more accurate estimate of swc respectively paraskevopoulos and singels 2014 the effectiveness of swc monitoring based decision support under different climates and soil types was proven by numerous reports santos et al 2010 used neutron probe to monitor the effect of different soil surface conditions on swc variation and the yield of rainfed beans in brazil on ultisol jacome et al 2013 used frequency domain reflectometer fdr to monitor the swc dynamics of boreal wetland ecosystems peat lands in canada wang and singh 2017 used portable diviner 2000 device sentek pty ltd stepney australia to monitor the spatiotemporal distribution of the swc in response to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration under different crop covers in china da silva et al 2015 and da silva et al 2018 used time domain reflectometry tdr probes to determine the optimum number and appropriate set up of sensors for monitoring the soil water extraction in the banana tree root zone in the profile of the xanthic ferralsol in brazil for collecting the input data for the calibration and validation of a hydrus 2d numerical model phogat et al 2018 used a 503 dr hydroprobe neutron moisture meter cpn international california usa to measure swc and soil salinity dynamics in the soil with variable texture across the monitored profile under almond orchards in australia however to our knowledge no study yet considers the continuous monitoring of the highly dynamic soil water status using 5 t m cs meter group inc usa and comparison with the swp thresholds that are adopted for the volcanic ash soils of temperate monsoon climate in order to give an irrigation advice to support farmers andosols have large area coverage and great importance for agriculture due to their high organic matter content dörner et al 2010 iuss working group wrb 2014 globally andosols account for nearly 124 million hectares which is comparable to 0 84 of the world s land area leamy 1984 about 60 of these soils are found in japan korea philippine indonesia and new zeeland where large human populations are living in the region takahashi and shoji 2002 in japan andosols cover 18 and constitute 27 of the agricultural land of the country takahashi and shoji 2002 andosols are considered among the crucial land resource and intensively cultivated soils for their high productivity takahashi and shoji 2002 the objectives of this study were therefore defined as 1 to determine critical swc thresholds based on the upper θfc and lower θdep limits of the swp that are adopted for the agricultural field originated from andosol 2 to monitor swc from bare soil and analyze its dynamics and 3 to evaluate the monitored swc data at different depths with regard to the critical swc thresholds for the purpose of decision supporting for irrigation water management in the temperate monsoon climate of japan 2 materials and method 2 1 site description the study was conducted in the experimental field of tokyo university of agriculture and technology which is located at sakaecho fuchu tokyo japan 35 41 15 81 n 139 28 41 6 e elevation of 63 m above sea level in total three monitoring plots 1 m x 5 m which had not been sown to any crop previously were prepared in the experimental field fig 1 the side boundaries of the monitoring plots were demarcated by plastic plates to prevent interactions and potential cross contaminations of surface runoff and subsurface flow the plots were maintained bare by hand weeding throughout the monitoring period the soil taxonomic order is andosol kuroboku and is characterized by being rich in humus due to the development from glass rich volcanic ejecta iuss working group wrb 2014 the soil texture is clay loam while the organic matter content is 12 jaikaew et al 2015 the measured mean dry bulk density of the surface soil was 0 53 g cm 3 whereas the saturated hydraulic conductivity was 172 cm day 1 measured from undisturbed soil samples in a constant temperature room using a falling head method reynolds and elrick 2002 the experimental site is subject to temperate monsoon climate with four distinct seasons winter december february spring march may summer june august and autumn september november 2 2 meteorological data acquisition minimum and maximum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours observed at a nearby weather station in saiwaicho approximately 400 m south east from the experimental site were freely accessed from automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas japan meteorological agency accessed 30 oct 2017 http www data jma go jp obd stats etrn index php rainfall was recorded every 30 minutes using a rain gauge decagon ecrn 50 attached to a data logger meter group inc usa the logger was also connected to the soil moisture sensors used for swc monitoring the rolling 2 3 4 and 5 days average precipitation were calculated by averaging the precipitation values for the previous 2 3 4 and 5 days respectively these values simplify the visualization of trends daily radiation and evaporation rates were calculated using fao cropwat 8 0 model martin 1996 the total annual rainfall from june 2016 to may 2017 was 1686 mm about 65 of which occurred between june and september the mean monthly minimum and maximum air temperatures were 11 1 and 20 6 c respectively the mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures varied from 6 5 c in january to 38 c in august mean monthly relative humidity data obtained from the amedas station in tokyo were above 50 throughout the monitoring period except for february 49 while september was the most humid month of the year with a mean daily relative humidity of 86 summer was overall the most humid season 77 8 average monthly wind speed varied from a minimum of 1 1 m s 1 in november to a maximum of 2 2 m s 1 in april the computed mean daily evaporation was lowest during december 1 21 mm day 1 and subsequently increased and reached at its peak value in may 4 05 mm day 1 and remained high during summer overall comparing with 10 year of meteorological data june 2006 may 2016 the monitoring period was neither identified at a wet nor dry period for instance the mean total rainfall of the 10 year period was 1645 mm which varied from 1435 mm in june 2012 to may 2013 to 1937 mm in june 2008 to may 2009 the same was true for the maximum temperature which varied from 19 8 c in june 2009 to may 2013 to 20 8 c in june 2010 to may 2011 with mean value of 20 5 c 2 3 soil water content monitoring the monitoring of the volumetric soil water content swc θv was carried out for a period of 16 months between june 2016 and september 2017 at a soil depth of 0 10 cm deeper soil layers 10 20 and 20 30 cm were monitored for 14 months between august 2016 and september 2017 the depth ranges were set to achieve better monitoring of temporal and spatial variations across the in situ soil profile multiple 5 t m capacitance sensors cs connected to a data logger namely procheck em50 meter group inc usa were installed in the field following the manufacturer s best management practice to ensure a tight contact between the cs and the surrounding soil each cs was inserted into the soil to measure θv every 30 min at 5 15 and 25 cm below the soil surface representing the 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm deep soil layers respectively measuring θv from the 3 soil depths is necessary as a unique sensor cannot precisely indicate the temporal variation of θv in the root zone of a heterogeneous soil soulis and elmaloglou 2018 a new calibration function θ 0 02504 ε 0 08249 developed for this experimental site by plotting the dielectric permittivity ε of the soil measured using the cs as a function of θv values determined by soil cores from undisturbed samples kassaye et al 2019 was employed briefly this calibration function reduced the measurement error of the surface soil 0 10 cm from 15 with manufacture s default function to 2 kassaye et al 2019 offset corrections rather than the calibration function were used to adjust the θv of the 10 20 cm measurement error of 6 16 reduced to 3 and 20 30 cm measurement error of 3 10 reduced to 3 soil layers this procedure was necessary since the calibration function developed for the surface soil could not significantly reduce the measurement errors within the 3 range differences in organic matter content bulk density and soil texture in the deeper soil layers compared to the top soil layer may be responsible for the inappropriateness of the calibration function bell et al 1987 bircher et al 2016 parvin and degre 2016 the small range of disparity in accuracy of measurement between the deeper soil layers 3 and surface soil layer 2 may be attributed to measurement errors associated with linear relationship between ε and θv additional caveats are discussed in kassaye et al 2019 2 4 determination of thresholds for agricultural water management the volume of macrospores wide coarse pores or air capacity was calculated as the difference between θv values at pf 0 and 1 77 dörner et al 2015 the field capacity θfc and the permanent wilting point θpwp of the soil are typically obtained based on swc at suction values of 10 33 kpa and 1500 kpa respectively allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 the plant available soil water paw in the root zone is further defined as paw θfc θpwp allen et al 1998 paw is considered suitable for plant growth as plants have unrestricted access to water allen et al 1998 a number of studies additionally demonstrated that generally plants could only access about half of paw depending on the plant types and their ability to extract water from various soil types allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 for instance rice was restricted to 20 of paw whereas wheat could access about 55 of paw allen et al 1998 hence an alternative range the readily available water raw can be defined using the manageable allowable depletion here after the depletion level θdep the depletion level demarcates the range that no moisture stress is supposed to occur allen et al 1998 campbell and campbell 1982 doorenbos and kassam 1979 thompson et al 2007a consequently for optimal crop production θ v needs to be maintained within raw which is defined as raw θfc θdep the suction values pf log hpa attributed to θfc θdep and θpwp for the volcanic ash soil in the temperate monsoon climate of japan were 1 5 2 0 3 0 and 4 18 respectively yamazaki 1972 the θv at the θfc θdep and θpwp of the studied soil were determined by constructing the soil water retention curve swrc by measuring swp at different points and plotting the corresponding swc values fig 2 the swc was measured from undisturbed soil core samples collected randomly within each plot at 5 cm depth using metallic cylinders with a volume 100 cm3 5 03 cm diameter and 5 03 cm height whereas the swp was measured using pressure plate apparatus and dew point potentiometer model wp4 t meter group inc usa the θv at the θfc θdep and θpwp were determined at pf values of 1 8 3 0 and 4 18 respectively 2 5 statistical analysis sas statistical software for windows version 9 0 sas institute inc 2002 was used to derive the regression equations describing the relation between the dielectric permittivity and soil water content section 2 3 the sas statistical package proc corr was used to determine the correlation coefficient and to assess the relative strength of weather variables which significantly influenced evaporation and consequently θv during the monitoring period one way anova was performed to compare the differences among the θv values measured under the four seasons similar analysis was also conducted for temperature mean separation was carried out using least significant difference test at the 5 level of probability 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of critical soil water content thresholds for agricultural water management the critical swc thresholds estimated for the top soil layer 0 10 cm using the method mentioned in section 2 4 were saturated water content θsat 0 640 θfc 0 395 θdep 0 307 and θpwp 0 167 cm3 cm 3 the swc measured using the cs in the field 24 h after the end of irrigation to the level of saturation for the top soil layer which is equivalent to θfc ranged between 0 369 and 0 421 cm3 cm 3 implying that the laboratory measured θfc gave a closer representation of the θv for the studied soil figs 2 and 3 this volcanic ash soil was therefore characterized by a large water holding capacity 23 0 23 cm3 cm 3 available water for root water uptake for the top soil layer fig 2 such soils are suitable for agriculture since paw 20 was reported to be optimal or ideal for crop production cockroft and olsson 1997 hall et al 1977 reynolds et al 2009 the critical swc thresholds for the deeper soil layers were 1 θsat 0 674 and 0 675 2 θfc 0 490 and 0 480 3 θdep 0 380 and 0 398 and 4 θpwp 0 163 and 0 180 cm3 cm 3 for the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively relative to the top soil layer the critical thresholds of the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers were therefore 24 and 22 higher θfc and 24 and 30 higher θdep respectively fig 2 the result for θpwp were more contrasted the value was 8 higher for the 20 30 cm soil layer compared to the 0 10 cm soil layer while being almost similar for 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layers the high θv retention in the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers compared to the 0 10 cm soil layer might ascribe from the decrease in the amount of macrospores see the shaded region in fig 2 the volumes of macrospores were 24 18 and 19 for the 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively implying 25 and 21 decreases in the volume of macrospores which enhanced retention of the water perceptible from the surface down to the deeper layers fig 2 the great θv retention in the deeper layers relative to the surface soil layer might also ascribe from presence of charcoal biochar like materials among other likely factors that were observed during soil sampling the occurrence of the charcoal biochar like materials at the soil surface was however limited possibly due to 1 continuous tillage and 2 degradation to finer particles due to intensive wetting and drying cycles as well as precipitation of the finer particles of charcoal and clay minerals to the deeper layers charcoal biochar like materials have high specific surface area and porosity compared to other materials biochar 3000 m2 g 1 clay 150 250 m2 g 1 which may enhance the water retention capacity of soil blanco canqui 2017 blanco canqui 2017 reviewed recent works and reported that the available θv in soil may increase by 4 130 in response to soil amendment with biochar the large water holding capacity of the studied soil can be attributed to the well aggregated structural properties such as bimodal water retention curve and large volumes of pores which were induced by the presence of allophane fe and al oxyhydroxides in volcanic ash soils armas espinel et al 2003 dörner et al 2010 tobon et al 2010 overall these findings are similar to the study by dörner et al 2015 who reported a paw higher than 24 for a volcanic ash soil in southern chile large water holding capacity of volcanic ash soils were also reported by buytaert et al 2006 and tobon et al 2010 in ecuador and costa rica respectively 3 2 soil water content monitoring 3 2 1 temporal dynamics of soil water content among soil layers the response of θv across soil layers to precipitation varied depending on the amount of rainfall fig 3 during the 16 month monitoring period there was a total of 158 rainfall events ranging from 1 0 to 179 mm 23 8 and 4 events presented rainfall amounts 30 50 and 70 mm respectively relatively high rainfall events 179 mm on august 22 2016 and 97 mm on september 20 2016 caused distinct increases in θv perceptible down to 30 cm deep figs 3 and 6a in contrast typical rainfall events such as 10 mm only caused small fluctuations in the θv curve of the 0 10 cm layer only and had no noticeable impacts on deeper layers this indicates that most of the input water was either retained in the upper most soil layer or evaporated from the soil surface during the whole 16 months of monitoring the θv of the surface layer 0 10 cm varied between a minimum of 0 210 and a maximum of 0 582 cm3 cm 3 while remaining within the plant available range see non shaded area in fig 3 as 74 of the monitored θ v data were above the θdep 0 307 cm3 cm 3 the θv of the top soil layer was even above the θfc 0 395 cm3 cm 3 for 26 of the monitoring period the θv values of the surface soil were above the θdep from mid august to third week of october 2016 from end of october 2016 to first week of february 2017 from third week of march to end of april 2017 and from mid july to the end of monitoring period fig 3 however incidences of θv below the depletion level were observed from the first week of june to mid august few days in the first and last weeks of october 2016 from the first week of february to the third week of march 2017 and from the first week of may to mid july 2017 as summarized in table 1 despite frequent rainfall events the daily averaged θv was below depletion level for at most 68 of a given month considering the entire monitoring period 26 of the monitored θv values were below θdep the major factors responsible for such patterns are discussed in sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 owing to the acute shortage of θv in the surface soil layer in the month of july 2016 table 1 this period was closely inspected fig 4 a the analysis revealed a very high temporal variability in response to rainfall fig 4b and evaporation the moving average values fig 4c showed that the contribution of precipitation was less than 0 3 mm for the last 4 consecutive days in the month of july 2016 as a consequence of the losses of soil water due to evaporation the result further revealed that that θv was below the θdep for the majority 68 of month of july fig 4a due to the high water storage capacity of the deeper soil layers θv was however substantially higher than that of the top soil layer fig 3 and 6a it varied between 0 326 and 0 503 cm3 cm 3 10 20 cm depth layer and 0 319 and 0 523 cm3 cm 3 20 30 cm depth layer for the whole 14 month period θv was above θdep implying that the soil was constantly wet and could supply enough water for the plant roots that are able to penetrate beyond 10 cm depth fig 3 and 6a compared to the deeper soil layers 10 20 and 20 30 cm depths the θv in the top soil layer 0 10 cm depth fluctuated greatly due to its direct exposure to the atmosphere yielding to intensive wetting and drying cycles because of liquid water and water vapor fluxes across the soil atmosphere interface figs 3 and 6a c the high hydraulic conductivity and the comparatively large amount of wide coarse pores could partially account for the pronounced variations of θv in the top soil layer 24 see section 3 2 4 thus in the top soil layer θv increased rapidly in response to any rainfall event but also declined rapidly due to evaporation furthermore the water that rapidly leached to the deeper layers by virtue of the high saturated hydraulic conductivity and existence of large magnitudes of macrospores 24 in the studied soil see section 3 2 4 was retained longer owing to the high water holding capacities of the 10 20 cm 33 and 20 30 cm 30 soil layers compared to the surface soil layer 23 fig 2 these mechanisms resulted in overall more stable variation of θv for the deeper soil layers compared with that of the top soil layer fig 3 the under θdep of θv values in the top soil layer implies that the soil was dry for the shallow rooted crops and for the early stages of the deep rooted crops if planted in the aforementioned periods gaiser et al 2012 consequently crops could suffer from water stress despite the deeper layers remained wet and there could be water supply by upward water flux as the surface got drier since plants could not extend their roots beyond 10 cm hence the yield could not be optimized as well as the quality also could not be maintained to the required level for crops that are sensitive to water stress unless irrigation was supplied this result signifies the need for continuous θv monitoring and planning of supplementary irrigation to refill the soil water to bring back to θfc or at least above θdep for the optimization of crop yield and its quality campbell and campbell 1982 cepuder and nolz 2007 fares et al 2006 thompson et al 2007a b 3 2 2 dynamics of soil water content among seasons for highlighting the critical periods with soil water stress all variables monitored from september 2016 and august 2017 were aggregated for the 4 seasons cumulative precipitation percentage of total precipitation accounted for 129 8 278 18 503 32 and 668 42 mm for winter spring autumn and summer seasons respectively the mean seasonal evaporations during the same period were 136 294 183 and 364 mm for winter spring autumn and summer seasons respectively meanwhile the monitored θv fell below the θdep for the surface soil for 16 37 12 and 21 of the monitored values in winter spring autumn and summer seasons respectively fig 5 highlighting the existence of soil water stress during all seasons though with varying magnitudes and the significance of continuous θv monitoring if the θv monitoring had been conducted from cropped plots the water balance would have been totally different and the dry periods with the below θdep level could even be longer than those as transpiration extracted additional water from the soil profile the highest soil water stress in spring season mostly during 2017 fig 5 was attributed to the combination of 1 low precipitation second lowest after winter see fig 6b and 2 relatively high evaporation second highest after summer see fig 6c although precipitation was the highest during summer fig 6b θv was below θdep more often times next to spring fig 5 and 6a although rainfall 129 mm was the lowest in winter θv was found within the plant available range for majority 84 of the season evaporation was low during winter 136 mm in total and the low water input from rainfall could have been compensated with the upward flux of water from deeper soil layers the under θdep of the monitored θv for 16 of the period in winter season is mainly due to a 14 day period during february 2017 when θv was below θdep fig 5 and 6a finally the monitored θv was the highest in autumn fig 5 owing to the combination of high precipitation the highest next to summer season fig 6b and relatively low evaporation the lowest next to winter season fig 6c since the majority of cropping activities are conducted from spring to autumn from march to october the below θdep of θv observed at the surface soil layer during those seasons demands a careful attention 3 2 3 influences of weather variables on the temporal dynamics of soil water content the rate of evaporation that significantly influenced the dynamics of θv is a function of weather variables martin 1996 the prevailing weather variables of the study area that considerably affected evaporation and consequently θv during the monitoring period have been examined except during winter season the effect of solar radiation on evaporation was substantial table 2 and fig 6d and consequently influenced the dynamics of θv inspection of the daily mean solar radiation revealed that it was the lowest during november and december 8 8 and 9 6 mj m 2 day 1 respectively fig 6d when evaporation was generally low fig 6c and θv was high fig 3 and 6a it gradually increased and reached to the highest value in may 19 8 mj m 2 day 1 fig 6d which also coincided with some of the highest evaporation rate 4 0 mm day 1 fig 6c and the lowest θv fig 3 and 6a seasons wise the highest solar radiations were recorded in spring and summer 17 4 and 17 mj m 2 day 1 respectively fig 6d which were highly related to the highest evaporation fig 6c and the lowest θv fig 5 and 6a the influence of sunshine hours on evaporation and consequently on θv in summer and spring seasons was also very strong and similar to the effect of solar radiation table 2 the effect of maximum air temperature was also considerable in autumn seasonal average 21 8 c and spring seasonal average 19 c seasons table 2 and fig 6e which revealed its impact on evaporation that induced the loss of θv from the vadose zone although humidity contributed greatly in reducing evaporation during summer table 2 its effect was offset by other weather variables such as solar radiation and maximum temperature among the weather variables wind had a considerable effect on evaporation and hence on dynamics of θv during winter table 2 the influence of minimum air temperature on both variables was negligible throughout the monitoring period table 2 the promotion of evaporation in response to weather variables such as sunshine hours high temperatures and large wind speed was also reported by thompson et al 2007b during the monitoring period between june 2016 and september 2017 the average soil temperature at the 0 10 cm soil depth was higher by 0 51 c to the average air temperature fig 7 a and it had very similar effect to the maximum air temperature fig 6e on the temporal dynamics of θv in which the θv was very low when the soil temperature was very high and vice versa fig 5 6a 6e and 7b significant differences p 0 001 in soil temperature among seasons were observed as opposed to the significant difference in θv in similar season fig 5 and 7b the highest 26 8 c and lowest 6 3 c soil temperatures were recorded in summer and winter seasons respectively fig 7b in summer season 73 of the soil temperature records were above the upper 25 quartile value 24 7 c between september 2016 and august 2017 hence it considerably contributed for the loss of θv during the same period from the vadose zone conversely the lowest soil temperature attributed to the observation of the highest θv in winter season in winter season 84 of the monitored soil temperatures were found below the lower 25 quartile value 8 7 c between september 2016 and august 2017 though the θv during this period were so high fig 3 and 6a crop production could be hampered owing to the low records of soil temperature fig 7b 3 2 4 influence of soil properties on soil water content dynamics among the soil properties the extremely high saturated hydraulic conductivity 172 cm day 1 is responsible for the very high temporal dynamics of θv particularly in the surface soil layer the impact of the extremely high hydraulic conductivity of the studied soil could further be observed by the short lag between the time the wetting front reached to 5 cm depth and the time of the initial rainfall the second highest rainfall at 30 minute time interval was 27 mm that was recorded on august 10 2016 at 7 00 pm it took less than 30 min for the wetting front to reach at 5 cm depth and to raise the cs reading from 0 27 to 0 32 cm3 cm 3 this observation is quite different from the 8 h lag reported by sheng et al 2011 in that study a mineral clay loam textured soil in germany was used and the time for the wetting front to reach the sensor at 16 cm was recorded regardless of the high water holding capacity 23 the studied soil could not retain the soil water for a long period particularly at its surface by virtue of large extent of macrospores 24 for the surface soil and also possibly due to the presence of inter aggregate pore structures this can be demonstrated by the dynamics of θv for the 0 10 cm soil layer during a typical non rainy period from may 27 to june 12 2017 fig 8 during that period θv increased from 0 355 to 0 385 cm3 cm 3 for the 0 10 cm soil layer owing to the 26 mm antecedent rainfall on may 26 however θv substantially dropped from being near θfc to below θdep within 3 days the θv further dropped from 0 385 to 0 270 cm3 cm 3 due to 17 consecutive days with no precipitation fig 8 that exponential decrease in θv particularly for the surface soil demonstrated the low retention capacity of andosol when θv is within the range of paw possibly due to the presence of inter and intra aggregate pore structures indeed volcanic ash soils andosols have a unique dual porosity structure due to the presence of a well defined inter and intra aggregate pore structures that result in the suddenness of water content release and also high soil water retention potential respectively armas espinel et al 2003 dörner et al 2010 in contrast to a study that confirmed the retention of macropore percentage of around 10 of the total porosity in matured andosols owing to their inter aggregated structure nanzyo 2002 the studied soil accounted for 38 of the total porosity hence this indicates that part of the large inter aggregate pores were emptied quickly after the end of rainfall event previous reports on the dynamics of swc for volcanic ash soils in southern chili dörner et al 2015 costa rica tobon et al 2010 and ecuador buytaert et al 2006 also acknowledged that these soils have the potential to reach near θpwp from θfc extremely quickly due to the presence of very high unsaturated hydraulic conductivity particularly during the summer season and at a depth of 5 cm despite their large water holding capacity dörner et al 2015 in addition to the low soil water retention property of the studied soil evaporation also had a large effect on the sharp decline in θv and water redistribution through the soil profile within vadose zone see sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 after the may 26 rainfall the average daily evaporation during may 27 june 12 2017 was 4 6 mm day 1 which was amid the highest records during the monitoring period the sharp decrease in θv reaching below θdep due to a combination of high evaporation and low water retention capacity of the studied soil could be a very good evidence to display the presence of periods with θv values far below the lower threshold level these critical periods of low water availability further stress the need to conduct continuous θv monitoring for the appropriate management and planning of irrigation given θv dynamics during may 27 june 12 2017 would have shallow rooted crops or deep rooted crops been planted they would have reached their earliest growth stages and while θv may be above the θfc for the deeper soil layers at the soil surface θv remained below θv for 14 consecutive days fig 8 this implies that such crops would certainly suffer from physiological stress due to restricted access to water 4 conclusions the continuous monitoring result revealed substantial temporal dynamics throughout the top 30 cm soil profile in volumetric soil water content θv which accounted for rainfall evaporation and high extent of hydraulic conductivity the monitoring data further revealed that the vadose zone of the studied soil presented large water holding capacity 23 33 and 30 for the 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively the determined critical soil water content thresholds were 1 θfc 0 395 0 490 and 0 480 2 θdep 0 307 0 380 and 0 398 3 θpwp 0 167 0 163 and 0 180 cm3 cm 3 for the 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively data analysis revealed that θ v values were generally above the θdep throughout the monitoring period for the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers in contrast to the abundant precipitation that falls in the study area and high water holding capacity of the studied soil the monitoring data however exposed relatively extensive dry periods for the 0 10 cm soil layer during the full monitoring period 129 days out of the 487 days were found below θdep for the surface soil layer exclusively with critical shortages identified in june and july this implies that the soil was dry from a crop management perspective consequently crops could suffer from water stress despite the deeper layers remained wet and there could be water supply by upward water flux as the surface got drier for the plant roots that could not extend beyond 10 cm though this study was conducted on bare soil plots the observation of the extensive dry periods for the surface soil layer in contrast to the abundant rainfall infers the necessity of the continuous θv monitoring to plan and adequately trigger irrigation water to refill the soil back to θfc and avoid crop yield and quality reductions due to moisture stress the θv monitoring data with upper θfc and lower θdep thresholds can provide proper information to maintain soil water within plant available range and to support decision for planning efficient irrigation water management acknowledgments this study was supported by the government of japan through japan international cooperation agency the authors would like to acknowledge colleagues who work at the pesticide fate and transport laboratory and soil physics laboratory for their technical and analytical advices during the conduct of the study 
10769,maintaining soil water content within the readily available range is optimum concerning crop production and water use in this regard the continuous monitoring of soil water content is a crucial element for identifying the key parameters for sustainable agricultural water management in this study volumetric soil water content θv was monitored and analyzed in a bare soil agricultural field sakaecho experimental field of tokyo university of agriculture and technology the field consisting of volcanic ash soils was monitored from june 2016 to september 2017 using capacitance sensor cs the optimal range of readily available water for plant uptake was defined as the range between field capacity and depletion level θdep these values were determined from the soil water potentials and θv values measured using pressure plate and soil cores respectively the 16 month period monitoring result revealed substantial temporal variability in θv in response to rainfall evaporation and deep percolation the monitored values of θv were above the θdep 0 307 cm3 cm 3 measured at suction pf value of 3 0 throughout the monitoring period for the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers in contrast for the surface soil 0 10 cm the θv fell below θdep for 27 of the monitoring period despite the high rainfall during those periods owing to high evaporation and deep percolation the below θdep results for the surface soil suggests the need to conduct continuous θv monitoring to support decision for planning efficient irrigation water management to avoid yield loss of shallow rooted crops and deep rooted crops at their earliest growth stages as well as quality reductions due to moisture stresses keywords andosol capacitance sensor depletion level field capacity monitoring plant available water

vegetation and climate wang and singh 2017 continuously monitoring the swc of soil profile offers information regarding the status of water storage and its temporal dynamics nolz and kammerer 2017 which can be used to avoid over or under irrigation hartz and hanson 2005 over irrigation results in the leaching of nutrients and pesticides from the root zone hence it ultimately ends up in undernourishment of the targeted crop substantial water consumption energy use and production costs for farmers and the potential contamination of groundwater bodies cepuder and nolz 2007 fereres et al 2003 on the other hand under irrigation leads to water stress conditions which reduces potential yield coates et al 2005 doraiswamy et al 2004 and the quality of the final product fao 2012 nolz et al 2016 van leeuwen et al 2009 by conducting swc monitoring water consumption can be optimized thompson et al 2007a resulting in increased revenue to farmers due to 1 reduction in costs and 2 increase in both crop yield and quality the status of soil water can be inferred directly from on site measurements of swc dörner et al 2015 nolz et al 2016 and or soil water potential swp masseroni et al 2016 which are among the most effective options as they offer reliable and direct information concerning the soil water of a given agricultural soil the swc is the volume of the soil water retained within the total volume of a certain soil fares et al 2006 whereas swp is the measure of work that the plant roots exert to extract the water hold by the soil particles nolz et al 2016 or alternatively is a measure of the force that the solid soil matrix applies to attract and hold water to its surface area shock and wang 2011 important swp thresholds are recognized such as the field capacity θfc depletion level θdep and permanent wilting point θpwp which all depend on soil properties soil texture organic matter content soil structure soil minerals etc and swc whalley et al 2013 owing to its straightness independence of the agricultural water threshold values on soil properties and direct relation to water stress a number of studies suggested measuring swp as the best monitoring variable over swc for ensuring optimum water for agricultural purpose in the root zone centeno et al 2010 nolz et al 2016 thompson et al 2007a among the various monitoring devices currently available on the market tensiometer migliaccio et al 2010 granular matrix sensors bilibio et al 2014 gypsum blocks smittle et al 1994 and dielectric sensors nolz et al 2016 have all been used for measuring swp in a wide variety of environments climates soil types and agricultural systems mainly to support irrigation management at the field scale alternatively monitoring of swc can be conducted using capacitance sensor cs in cases of the availability of the monitoring devises an integrated in situ measurement of both variables swp and swc enables one to determine simultaneously the hydraulic properties of a particular soil under natural condition which are basic to maintain soil water between θfc and θdep nolz and kammerer 2017 and more accurate estimate of swc respectively paraskevopoulos and singels 2014 the effectiveness of swc monitoring based decision support under different climates and soil types was proven by numerous reports santos et al 2010 used neutron probe to monitor the effect of different soil surface conditions on swc variation and the yield of rainfed beans in brazil on ultisol jacome et al 2013 used frequency domain reflectometer fdr to monitor the swc dynamics of boreal wetland ecosystems peat lands in canada wang and singh 2017 used portable diviner 2000 device sentek pty ltd stepney australia to monitor the spatiotemporal distribution of the swc in response to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration under different crop covers in china da silva et al 2015 and da silva et al 2018 used time domain reflectometry tdr probes to determine the optimum

calibration and validation of a hydrus 2d numerical model phogat et al 2018 used a 503 dr hydroprobe neutron moisture meter cpn international california usa to measure swc and soil salinity dynamics in the soil with variable texture across the monitored profile under almond orchards in australia however to our knowledge no study yet considers the continuous monitoring of the highly dynamic soil water status using 5 t m cs meter group inc usa and comparison with the swp thresholds that are adopted for the volcanic ash soils of temperate monsoon climate in order to give an irrigation advice to support farmers andosols have large area coverage and great importance for agriculture due to their high organic matter content dörner et al 2010 iuss working group wrb 2014 globally andosols account for nearly 124 million hectares which is comparable to 0 84 of the world s land area leamy 1984 about 60 of these soils are found in japan korea philippine indonesia and new zeeland where large human populations are living in the region takahashi and shoji 2002 in japan andosols cover 18 and constitute 27 of the agricultural land of the country takahashi and shoji 2002 andosols are considered among the crucial land resource and intensively cultivated soils for their high productivity takahashi and shoji 2002 the objectives of this study were therefore defined as 1 to determine critical swc thresholds based on the upper θfc and lower θdep limits of the swp that are adopted for the agricultural field originated from andosol 2 to monitor swc from bare soil and analyze its dynamics and 3 to evaluate the monitored swc data at different depths with regard to the critical swc thresholds for the purpose of decision supporting for irrigation water management in the temperate monsoon climate

iuss working group wrb 2014 the soil texture is clay loam while the organic matter content is 12 jaikaew et al 2015 the measured mean dry bulk density of the surface soil was 0 53 g cm 3 whereas the saturated hydraulic conductivity was 172 cm day 1 measured from undisturbed soil samples in a constant temperature room using a falling head method reynolds and elrick 2002 the experimental site is subject to temperate monsoon climate with four distinct seasons winter december february spring march may summer june august and autumn september november 2 2 meteorological data acquisition minimum and maximum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours observed at a nearby weather station in saiwaicho approximately 400 m south east from the experimental site were freely

minutes using a rain gauge decagon ecrn 50 attached to a data logger meter group inc usa the logger was also connected to the soil moisture sensors used for swc monitoring the rolling 2 3 4 and 5 days average precipitation were calculated by averaging the precipitation values for the previous 2 3 4 and 5 days respectively these values simplify the visualization of trends daily radiation and evaporation rates were calculated using fao cropwat 8 0 model martin 1996 the total annual rainfall from june 2016 to may 2017 was 1686 mm about 65 of which occurred between june and september the mean monthly minimum and maximum air temperatures were 11 1 and 20 6 c respectively the mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures varied from 6 5 c in january to 38 c in august mean monthly relative humidity data obtained from the amedas station in tokyo were above 50 throughout the monitoring period except for february 49 while september was the most humid month of the year with a mean daily relative humidity of 86 summer was overall the most humid season 77 8 average monthly wind speed varied from a minimum of 1 1 m s 1 in november to a maximum of 2 2 m s 1 in april the computed mean daily evaporation was lowest during december 1 21 mm day 1 and subsequently increased and reached at its peak value in may 4 05 mm day 1 and remained high during summer overall comparing with 10 year of meteorological data june 2006 may 2016 the monitoring period was neither identified at a wet nor dry period for instance the mean total rainfall of the 10 year period was 1645 mm which varied from 1435 mm in june 2012 to may 2013 to 1937 mm in june 2008 to may 2009 the same was true for the maximum temperature which varied from 19 8 c in june 2009 to may 2013 to 20 8 c in june 2010 to may 2011 with mean value of 20 5 c 2 3 soil water content monitoring the monitoring of the volumetric soil water content swc θv was carried out for a period of 16 months between june 2016 and september 2017 at a soil depth of 0 10 cm deeper soil layers 10 20 and 20 30 cm were monitored for 14 months between august 2016 and september 2017 the depth ranges were set to achieve better monitoring of temporal and spatial variations across the in situ soil profile multiple 5 t m capacitance sensors cs connected to a data logger namely procheck em50 meter group inc usa were installed in the field following the manufacturer s best management practice to ensure a tight contact between the cs and the surrounding soil each cs was inserted into the soil to measure θv every 30 min at 5 15 and 25 cm below the soil surface representing the 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm deep soil layers respectively measuring θv from the 3 soil depths is necessary as a unique sensor cannot precisely indicate the temporal variation of θv in the root zone of a heterogeneous soil soulis and elmaloglou 2018 a new calibration function θ 0 02504 ε 0 08249 developed for this experimental site by plotting the dielectric permittivity ε of the soil measured using the cs as a function of θv values determined by soil cores from undisturbed samples kassaye et al 2019 was employed briefly this calibration function reduced the measurement error of the surface soil 0 10 cm from 15 with manufacture s default function to 2 kassaye et al 2019 offset corrections rather than the calibration function were used to adjust the θv of the 10 20 cm measurement error of 6 16 reduced to 3 and 20 30 cm measurement error of 3 10 reduced to 3 soil layers this procedure was necessary since the calibration function developed for the surface soil could not significantly reduce the measurement errors within the 3 range differences in organic matter content bulk density and soil texture in the deeper soil layers compared to the top soil layer may be responsible for the inappropriateness of the calibration function bell et al 1987 bircher et al 2016 parvin and degre 2016 the small range of disparity in accuracy of measurement between the deeper soil layers 3 and surface soil layer 2 may be attributed to measurement errors associated with linear relationship between ε and θv additional caveats are discussed in kassaye et al 2019 2 4 determination of thresholds for agricultural water management the volume of macrospores wide coarse pores or air capacity was calculated as the difference between θv values at pf 0 and 1 77 dörner et al 2015 the field capacity θfc and the permanent wilting point θpwp of the soil are typically obtained based on swc at suction values of 10 33 kpa and 1500 kpa respectively allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 the plant available soil water paw in the root zone is further defined as paw θfc θpwp allen et al 1998 paw is considered suitable for plant growth as plants have unrestricted access to water allen et al 1998 a number of studies additionally demonstrated that generally plants could only access about half of paw depending on the plant types and their ability to extract water from various soil types allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 for instance rice was restricted to 20 of paw whereas wheat could access about 55 of paw allen et al 1998 hence an alternative range the readily available water raw can be defined using the manageable allowable depletion here after the depletion level θdep the depletion level demarcates the range that no moisture stress is supposed to occur allen et al 1998 campbell and campbell 1982 doorenbos and kassam 1979 thompson et al 2007a consequently for optimal crop production θ v needs to be maintained within raw which is defined as raw θfc θdep the suction values pf log hpa attributed to θfc θdep and θpwp for the volcanic ash soil in the temperate monsoon climate of japan were 1 5 2 0 3 0 and 4 18 respectively yamazaki 1972 the θv at the θfc θdep and θpwp of the studied soil were determined by constructing the soil water retention curve swrc by measuring swp at different points and plotting the corresponding swc values fig 2 the swc was measured from undisturbed soil core samples collected randomly within each plot at 5 cm depth using metallic cylinders with a volume 100 cm3 5 03 cm diameter and 5 03 cm height whereas the swp was measured using pressure plate apparatus and dew point potentiometer model wp4 t meter group inc usa the θv at the θfc θdep and θpwp were determined at pf values of 1 8 3 0 and 4 18 respectively 2 5 statistical analysis sas statistical software for windows version 9 0 sas institute inc 2002 was used to derive the regression equations describing the relation between the dielectric permittivity and soil water content section 2 3 the sas statistical package proc corr was used to determine the correlation coefficient and to assess the relative strength of weather variables which significantly influenced evaporation and consequently θv during the monitoring period one way anova was performed to compare the differences among the θv values measured under the four seasons similar analysis was also conducted for temperature mean separation was carried out using least significant difference test at the 5 level of probability 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of critical soil water content thresholds for agricultural water management the critical swc thresholds estimated for the top soil layer 0 10 cm using the method mentioned in section 2 4 were saturated water content θsat 0 640 θfc 0 395 θdep 0 307 and θpwp 0 167 cm3 cm 3 the swc measured using the cs in the field 24 h after the end of irrigation to the level of saturation for the top soil layer which is equivalent to θfc ranged between 0 369 and 0 421 cm3 cm 3 implying that the laboratory measured θfc gave a closer representation of the θv for the studied soil figs 2 and 3 this volcanic ash soil was therefore characterized by a large water holding capacity 23 0 23 cm3 cm 3 available water for root water uptake for the top soil layer fig 2 such soils are suitable for agriculture since paw 20 was reported to be optimal or ideal for crop production cockroft and olsson 1997 hall et al 1977 reynolds et al 2009 the critical swc thresholds for the deeper soil layers were 1 θsat 0 674 and 0 675 2 θfc 0 490 and 0 480 3 θdep 0 380 and 0 398 and 4 θpwp 0 163 and 0 180 cm3 cm 3 for the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively relative to the top soil layer the critical thresholds of the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers were therefore 24 and 22 higher θfc and 24 and 30 higher θdep respectively fig 2 the result for θpwp were more contrasted the value was 8 higher for the 20 30 cm soil layer compared to the 0 10 cm soil layer while being almost similar for 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layers the high θv retention in the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers compared to the 0 10 cm soil layer might ascribe from the decrease in the amount of macrospores see the shaded region in fig 2 the volumes of macrospores were 24 18 and 19 for the 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively implying 25 and 21 decreases in the volume of macrospores which enhanced retention of the water perceptible from the surface down to the deeper layers fig 2 the great θv retention in the deeper layers relative to the surface soil layer might also ascribe from presence of charcoal biochar like materials among other likely factors that were observed during soil sampling the occurrence of the charcoal biochar like materials at the soil surface was however limited possibly due to 1 continuous tillage and 2 degradation to finer particles due to intensive wetting and drying cycles as well as precipitation of the finer particles of charcoal and clay minerals to the deeper layers charcoal biochar like materials have high specific surface area and porosity compared to other materials biochar 3000 m2 g 1 clay 150 250 m2 g 1 which may enhance the water retention capacity of soil blanco canqui 2017 blanco canqui 2017 reviewed recent works and reported that the available θv in soil may increase by 4 130 in response to soil amendment with biochar the large water holding capacity of the studied soil can be attributed to the well aggregated structural properties such as bimodal water retention curve and large volumes of pores which were induced by the presence of allophane fe and al oxyhydroxides in volcanic ash soils armas espinel et al 2003 dörner et al 2010 tobon et al 2010 overall these findings are similar to the study by dörner et al 2015 who reported a paw higher than 24 for a volcanic ash soil in southern chile large water holding capacity of volcanic ash soils were also reported by buytaert et al 2006 and tobon et al 2010 in ecuador and costa rica respectively 3 2 soil water content monitoring 3 2 1 temporal dynamics of soil water content among soil layers the response of θv across soil layers to precipitation varied depending on the amount of rainfall fig 3 during the 16 month monitoring period there was a total of 158 rainfall events ranging from 1 0 to 179 mm 23 8 and 4 events presented rainfall amounts 30 50 and 70 mm respectively relatively high rainfall events 179 mm on august 22 2016 and 97 mm on september 20 2016 caused distinct increases in θv perceptible down to 30 cm deep figs 3 and 6a in contrast typical rainfall events such as 10 mm only caused small fluctuations in the θv curve of the 0 10 cm layer only and had no noticeable impacts on deeper layers this indicates that most of the input water was either retained in the upper most soil layer or evaporated from the soil surface during the whole 16 months of monitoring the θv of the surface layer 0 10 cm varied between a minimum of 0 210 and a maximum of 0 582 cm3 cm 3 while remaining within the plant available range see non shaded area in fig 3 as 74 of the monitored θ v data were above the θdep 0 307 cm3 cm 3 the θv of the top soil layer was even above the θfc 0 395 cm3 cm 3 for 26 of the monitoring period the θv values of the surface soil were above the θdep from mid august to third week of october 2016 from end of october 2016 to first week of february 2017 from third week of march to end of april 2017 and from mid july to the end of monitoring period fig 3 however incidences of θv below the depletion level were observed from the first week of june to mid august few days in the first and last weeks of october 2016 from the first week of february to the third week of march 2017 and from the first week of may to mid july 2017 as summarized in table 1 despite frequent rainfall events the daily averaged θv was below depletion level for at most 68 of a given month considering the entire monitoring period 26 of the monitored θv values were below θdep the major factors responsible for such patterns are discussed in sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 owing to the acute shortage of θv in the surface soil layer in the month of july 2016 table 1 this period was closely inspected fig 4 a the analysis revealed a very high temporal variability in response to rainfall fig 4b and evaporation the moving average values fig 4c showed that the contribution of precipitation was less than 0 3 mm for the last 4 consecutive days in the month of july 2016 as a consequence of the losses of soil water due to evaporation the result further revealed that that θv was below the θdep for the majority 68 of month of july fig 4a due to the high water storage capacity of the deeper soil layers θv was however substantially higher than that of the top soil layer fig 3 and 6a it varied between 0 326 and 0 503 cm3 cm 3 10 20 cm depth layer and 0 319 and 0 523 cm3 cm 3 20 30 cm depth layer for the whole 14 month period θv was above θdep implying that the soil was constantly wet and could supply enough water for the plant roots that are able to penetrate beyond 10 cm depth fig 3 and 6a compared to the deeper soil layers 10 20 and 20 30 cm depths the θv in the top soil layer 0 10 cm depth fluctuated greatly due to its direct exposure to the atmosphere yielding to intensive wetting and drying cycles because of liquid water and water vapor fluxes across the soil atmosphere interface figs 3 and 6a c the high hydraulic conductivity and the comparatively large amount of wide coarse pores could partially account for the pronounced variations of θv in the top soil layer 24 see section 3 2 4 thus in the top soil layer θv increased rapidly in response to any rainfall event but also declined rapidly due to evaporation furthermore the water that rapidly leached to the deeper layers by virtue of the high saturated hydraulic conductivity and existence of large magnitudes of macrospores 24 in the studied soil see section 3 2 4 was retained longer owing to the high water holding capacities of the 10 20 cm 33 and 20 30 cm 30 soil layers compared to the surface soil layer 23 fig 2 these mechanisms resulted in overall more stable variation of θv for the deeper soil layers compared with that of the top soil layer fig 3 the under θdep of θv values in the top soil layer implies that the soil was dry for the shallow rooted crops and for the early stages of the deep rooted crops if planted in the aforementioned periods gaiser et al 2012 consequently crops could suffer from water stress despite the deeper layers remained wet and there could be water supply by upward water flux as the surface got drier since plants could not extend their roots beyond 10 cm hence the yield could not be optimized as well as the quality also could not be maintained to the required level for crops that are sensitive to water stress unless irrigation was supplied this result signifies the need for continuous θv monitoring and planning of supplementary irrigation to refill the soil water to bring back to θfc or at least above θdep for the optimization of crop yield and its quality campbell and campbell 1982 cepuder and nolz 2007 fares et al 2006 thompson et al 2007a b 3 2 2 dynamics of soil water content among seasons for highlighting the critical periods with soil water stress all variables monitored from september 2016 and august 2017 were aggregated for the 4 seasons cumulative precipitation percentage of total precipitation accounted for 129 8 278 18 503 32 and 668 42 mm for winter spring autumn and summer seasons respectively the mean seasonal evaporations during the same period were 136 294 183 and 364 mm for winter spring autumn and summer seasons respectively meanwhile the monitored θv fell below the θdep for the surface soil for 16 37 12 and 21 of the monitored values in winter spring autumn and summer seasons respectively fig 5 highlighting the existence of soil water stress during all seasons though with varying magnitudes and the significance of continuous θv monitoring if the θv monitoring had been conducted from cropped plots the water balance would have been totally different and the dry periods with the below θdep level could even be longer than those as transpiration extracted additional water from the soil profile the highest soil water stress in spring season mostly during 2017 fig 5 was attributed to the combination of 1 low precipitation second lowest after winter see fig 6b and 2 relatively high evaporation second highest after summer see fig 6c although precipitation was the highest during summer fig 6b θv was below θdep more often times next to spring fig 5 and 6a although rainfall 129 mm was the lowest in winter θv was found within the plant available range for majority 84 of the season evaporation was low during winter 136 mm in total and the low water input from rainfall could have been compensated with the upward flux of water from deeper soil layers the under θdep of the monitored θv for 16 of the period in winter season is mainly due to a 14 day period during february 2017 when θv was below θdep fig 5 and 6a finally the monitored θv was the highest in autumn fig 5 owing to the combination of high precipitation the highest next to summer season fig 6b and relatively low evaporation the lowest next to winter season fig 6c since the majority of cropping activities are conducted from spring to autumn from march to october the below θdep of θv observed at the surface soil layer during those seasons demands a careful attention 3 2 3 influences of weather variables on the temporal dynamics of soil water content the rate of evaporation that significantly influenced the dynamics of θv is a function of weather variables martin 1996 the prevailing weather variables of the study area that considerably affected evaporation and consequently θv during the monitoring period have been examined except during winter season the effect of solar radiation on evaporation was substantial table 2 and fig 6d and consequently influenced the dynamics of θv inspection of the daily mean solar radiation revealed that it was the lowest during november and december 8 8 and 9 6 mj m 2 day 1 respectively fig 6d when evaporation was generally low fig 6c and θv was high fig 3 and 6a it gradually increased and reached to the highest value in may 19 8 mj m 2 day 1 fig 6d which also coincided with some of the highest evaporation rate 4 0 mm day 1 fig 6c and the lowest θv fig 3 and 6a seasons wise the highest solar radiations were recorded in spring and summer 17 4 and 17 mj m 2 day 1 respectively fig 6d which were highly related to the highest evaporation fig 6c and the lowest θv fig 5 and 6a the influence of sunshine hours on evaporation and consequently on θv in summer and spring seasons was also very strong and similar to the effect of solar radiation table 2 the effect of maximum air temperature was also considerable in autumn seasonal average 21 8 c and spring seasonal average 19 c seasons table 2 and fig 6e which revealed its impact on evaporation that induced the loss of θv from the vadose zone although humidity contributed greatly in reducing evaporation during summer table 2 its effect was offset by other weather variables such as solar radiation and maximum temperature among the weather variables wind had a considerable effect on evaporation and hence on dynamics of θv during winter table 2 the influence of minimum air temperature on both variables was negligible throughout the monitoring period table 2 the promotion of evaporation in response to weather variables such as sunshine hours high temperatures and large wind speed was also reported by thompson et al 2007b during the monitoring period between june 2016 and september 2017 the average soil temperature at the 0 10 cm soil depth was higher by 0 51 c to the average air temperature fig 7 a and it had very similar effect to the maximum air temperature fig 6e on the temporal dynamics of θv in which the θv was very low when the soil temperature was very high and vice versa fig 5 6a 6e and 7b significant differences p 0 001 in soil temperature among seasons were observed as opposed to the significant difference in θv in similar season fig 5 and 7b the highest 26 8 c and lowest 6 3 c soil temperatures were recorded in summer and winter seasons respectively fig 7b in summer season 73 of the soil temperature records were above the upper 25 quartile value 24 7 c between september 2016 and august 2017 hence it considerably contributed for the loss of θv during the same period from the vadose zone conversely the lowest soil temperature attributed to the observation of the highest θv in winter season in winter season 84 of the monitored soil temperatures were found below the lower 25 quartile value 8 7 c between september 2016 and august 2017 though the θv during this period were so high fig 3 and 6a crop production could be hampered owing to the low records of soil temperature fig 7b 3 2 4 influence of soil properties on soil water content dynamics among the soil properties the extremely high saturated hydraulic conductivity 172 cm day 1 is responsible for the very high temporal dynamics of θv particularly in the surface soil layer the impact of the extremely high hydraulic conductivity of the studied soil could further be observed by the short lag between the time the wetting front reached to 5 cm depth and the time of the initial rainfall the second highest rainfall at 30 minute time interval was 27 mm that was recorded on august 10 2016 at 7 00 pm it took less than 30 min for the wetting front to reach at 5 cm depth and to raise the cs reading from 0 27 to 0 32 cm3 cm 3 this observation is quite different from the 8 h lag reported by sheng et al 2011 in that study a mineral clay loam textured soil in germany was used and the time for the wetting front to reach the sensor at 16 cm was recorded regardless of the high water holding capacity 23 the studied soil could not retain the soil water for a long period particularly at its surface by virtue of large extent of macrospores 24 for the surface soil and also possibly due to the presence of inter aggregate pore structures this can be demonstrated by the dynamics of θv for the 0 10 cm soil layer during a typical non rainy period from may 27 to june 12 2017 fig 8 during that period θv increased from 0 355 to 0 385 cm3 cm 3 for the 0 10 cm soil layer owing to the 26 mm antecedent rainfall on may 26 however θv substantially dropped from being near θfc to below θdep within 3 days the θv further dropped from 0 385 to 0 270 cm3 cm 3 due to 17 consecutive days with no precipitation fig 8 that exponential decrease in θv particularly for the surface soil demonstrated the low retention capacity of andosol when θv is within the range of paw possibly due to the presence of inter and intra aggregate pore structures indeed volcanic ash soils andosols have a unique dual porosity structure due to the presence of a well defined inter and intra aggregate pore structures that result in the suddenness of water content release and also high soil water retention potential respectively armas espinel et al 2003 dörner et al 2010 in contrast to a study that confirmed the retention of macropore percentage of around 10 of the total porosity in matured andosols owing to their inter aggregated structure nanzyo 2002 the studied soil accounted for 38 of the total porosity hence this indicates that part of the large inter aggregate pores were emptied quickly after the end of rainfall event previous reports on the dynamics of swc for volcanic ash soils in southern chili dörner et al 2015 costa rica tobon et al 2010 and ecuador buytaert et al 2006 also acknowledged that these soils have the potential to reach near θpwp from θfc extremely quickly due to the presence of very high unsaturated hydraulic conductivity particularly during the summer season and at a depth of 5 cm despite their large water holding capacity dörner et al 2015 in addition to the low soil water retention property of the studied soil evaporation also had a large effect on the sharp decline in θv and water redistribution through the soil profile within vadose zone see sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 after the may 26 rainfall the average daily evaporation during may 27 june 12 2017 was 4 6 mm day 1 which was amid the highest records during the monitoring period the sharp decrease in θv reaching below θdep due to a combination of high evaporation and low water retention capacity of the studied soil could be a very good evidence to display the presence of periods with θv values far below the lower threshold level these critical periods of low water availability further stress the need to conduct continuous θv monitoring for the appropriate management and planning of irrigation given θv dynamics during may 27 june 12 2017 would have shallow rooted crops or deep rooted crops been planted they would have reached their earliest growth stages and while θv may be above the θfc for the deeper soil layers at the soil surface θv remained below θv for 14 consecutive days fig 8 this implies that such crops would certainly suffer from physiological stress due to restricted access to water 4 conclusions the continuous monitoring result revealed substantial temporal dynamics throughout the top 30 cm soil profile in volumetric soil water content θv which accounted for rainfall evaporation and high extent of hydraulic conductivity the monitoring data further revealed that the vadose zone of the studied soil presented large water holding capacity 23 33 and 30 for the 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively the determined critical soil water content thresholds were 1 θfc 0 395 0 490 and 0 480 2 θdep 0 307 0 380 and 0 398 3 θpwp 0 167 0 163 and 0 180 cm3 cm 3 for the 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers respectively data analysis revealed that θ v values were generally above the θdep throughout the monitoring period for the 10 20 and 20 30 cm soil layers in contrast to the abundant precipitation that falls in the study area and high water holding capacity of the studied soil the monitoring data however exposed relatively extensive dry periods for the 0 10 cm soil layer during the full monitoring period 129 days out of the 487 days were found below θdep for the surface soil layer exclusively with critical shortages identified in june and july this implies that the soil was dry from a crop management perspective consequently crops could suffer from water stress despite the deeper layers remained wet and there could be water supply by upward water flux as the surface got drier for the plant roots that could not extend beyond 10 cm though this study was conducted on bare soil plots the observation of the extensive dry periods for the surface soil layer in contrast to the abundant rainfall infers the necessity of the continuous θv monitoring to plan and adequately trigger irrigation water to refill the soil back to θfc and avoid crop yield and quality reductions due to moisture stress the θv monitoring data with upper θfc and lower θdep thresholds can provide proper information to maintain soil water within plant available range and to support decision for planning efficient irrigation water management acknowledgments this study was supported by the government of japan through japan international cooperation agency the authors would like to acknowledge colleagues who work at the pesticide fate and transport laboratory and soil physics laboratory for their technical
