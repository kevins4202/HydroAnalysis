3255,submarine groundwater discharge sgd is a predominant component of chemical fluxes in the solute budgets in coastal ecosystems because of its large flux and the corresponding concentrated constituents a quantitative study regarding the mass balance model of 226ra and 228ra was performed to assess sgd and associated nutrient inputs in xiangshan bay xsb a typical chinese aquaculture bay based on these mass balance models the sgd rates in the xsb channel were 8 9 13 2 cm d 1 the sgd rates in the three corresponding embayments were 3 5 3 7 cm d 1 in embayment i 5 6 5 8 cm d 1 in embayment ii and 4 5 5 8 cm d 1 in embayment iii significant spatial variabilities in sgd rates were observed in the different xsb districts reflecting that ocean dynamics and anthropogenic activities play significant roles at different scales sgd derived nutrient fluxes in xsb were the dominant sources of nutrient loading and their magnitudes were approximately 1 2 orders larger than those of riverine input sgd rates in the xsb channel were approximately three times higher than those in the three embayments but the sgd derived nutrient rates in the xsb channel were comparable with those in the three embayments even significantly lower than that for no3 n in the inner regions of the embayment these results imply that aquaculture activities and urbanization jointly influence sgd when combined with the results of other studies our observations demonstrate the significant comprehensive effects of multiple factors on sgd a critical but overlooked nutrient source keywords submarine groundwater discharge nutrients marine aquaculture ocean dynamics xiangshan bay 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon and is a crucial component in integrating physiochemical processes fluid compositions and origins moore 2010 rodellas et al 2017 garcia orellana et al 2021 it typically consists of both fresh meteoric groundwater which is principally driven by land hydrological gradients and recirculated seawater which is commonly driven by tides and waves robinson et al 2006 taniguchi et al 2019 santos et al 2021 it has been shown to play a critical role in water transport and terrestrial solute fluxes in global coastal regions burnett et al 2006 moore 2010 santos et al 2021 numerous studies have reported that sgd is a comprehensive source of nutrients rodellas et al 2015 correa et al 2020 greenhouse gases santos et al 2008 sadat noori et al 2018 carbon moore et al 2011 liu et al 2017a and heavy metals coynel et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a in several locations worldwide subsequently sgd has been quantified in a broader range of marine habitats such as mangroves gleeson et al 2013 lagoons mcmahon and santos 2017 estuaries douglas et al 2020 and harbors cheng et al 2020 numerous studies have determined that large amounts of solutes particularly enriched nutrients in sgd influence the dynamics and structure of microbial communities in the coastal ecosystem and can contribute to eutrophication hypoxia events and the occurrence of red tides in estuarine coastal zones hu et al 2006 liu et al 2017b guo et al 2020 ruiz gonzález et al 2021 sanial et al 2021 xiangshan bay xsb is one of china s largest semi enclosed areas used for aquaculture on the coastline of the east china sea with the primary aquaculture involved in cage culture of fish such as large yellow croaker larimichthys crocea and japanese seabass lateolabrax japonicus and the suspended aquaculture of chinese oysters ostrea plicatula and kelp laminaria japonica liao et al 2019 over the past decade the cultivation of marine fish and shellfish in xsb has been part of the most rapidly growing segment of aquaculture in 2013 the total area of aquaculture expanded to 100 km2 accounting for approximately 17 of the total area of xsb with an annual aquaculture production of approximately 1 03 105 t chen et al 2018a recently the aquaculture areas for oyster kelp and fish in three inner bays have been substantially expanding accounting for over 68 of the total aquaculture area liao et al 2019 as is the case in most coastal regions of china xsb is now facing increasing environmental issues because of the release of various chemicals and particularly nutrient loading which is attributable to accelerated urbanization and population growth and the simultaneous construction of docks and seafood processing factories jiang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the frequent occurrence of serious eutrophication and algal blooms has substantially reduced aquaculture production increasing the need to address the problem of nutrient loading although the distribution and sources of nutrients have previously been investigated yang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019a the scant studies regarding sgd have not sufficiently evaluated nutrient balance or the critical ecosystem services that are necessary for maintaining and improving the cultivation environment in this region sgd and mixing processes in various coastal systems have been effectively assessed using geochemical tracers such as radium isotopes which can be subject to the activity of highly concentrated radium in coastal groundwater relative to rivers and seawater the radium isotopes consist of 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra the use of short lived 223ra t1 2 11 4 d and 224ra t1 2 3 66 d is the typical approach for evaluating water ages and the exchange mixing of water solutes by tidal processes moore et al 2006 tamborski et al 2017 liu et al 2021 in addition the long lived 226ra t1 2 1600 y and 228ra t1 2 5 75 y provide an ideal insight for tracing the processes of spatially large or long time scales luo and jiao 2016 rodellas et al 2017 the objectives of this study were to quantify sgd fluxes and the associated nutrient inputs in xsb with high resolution for xsb channel and three small embayments namely embayment i embayment ii and embayment iii using the mass balance model with radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra we simultaneously explored the various factors influencing sgd characteristics to obtain a more accurate evaluation of the role of sgd in the accelerated development of aquaculture and the importance of sgd derived nutrients occurring at various spatiotemporal scales this will improve our understanding of aquaculture production and development associated with high urbanization and industrialization and the coastal ecosystem structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xsb is a heavily eutrophic large semi enclosed subtropical bay adjacent to the east china sea and covers an area of 560 km2 wu et al 2013 yang et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 1 the xsb consists of four regions including three branched embayments namely tie bay embayment i huangdun bay embayment ii and xihu bay embayment iii chen et al 2018a and the xsb channel the xsb has a length of approximately 60 km with an estimated minimum width of 4 km which is representative of particularly long and narrow tidal inlets the annual mean precipitation is approximately 1500 mm more than 80 of which occurs from june to september which is defined as the wet season wu et al 2013 there are multiple key rivers and streams around the bay including fuxi fx stream yangong yg river dasongjiang dsj river and xianyanghe xyh river detailed descriptions of the streams and several small seasonal rivers around xsb have been presented in previous studies wu et al 2013 yuan et al 2014 with a total annual discharge of approximately 1 30 109 m3 the tides in xsb are semi diurnal with an average tidal range of 3 3 m jiang et al 2019b the fish cage and shellfish cultures in xsb generate extensive amounts of biodeposits that consist of feces and pseudofeces these biodeposits are organically concentrated and can potentially intensify the massive amounts of nutrients released from aquaculture activity and exacerbate eutrophication and the occurrence of vast phytoplankton blooms in the bay jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019b 2 2 sampling and analysis fieldwork was conducted in xsb in november 2019 fig 1 water samples were collected from the rivers 30 l coastal groundwater 10 l or 30 l and surface water 50 l samples of the seawater n 23 and rivers n 4 were collected at a depth of approximately 0 5 m groundwater n 30 along the coastal aquifers was collected from well water and porewater the physicochemical parameters salinity temperature and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a multi wtw multi 3630 ids set g with a multiple parameter probe radium isotopes were extracted by filtering samples through a column filled with 20 g of mn fibers with a stable flow rate 1 l min 1 prior to the measurement all the fibers were then rinsed with radium free deionized water and stored for later analysis which was to be conducted after they had partially dried corresponding to radium samples approximately 60 ml of the samples were collected in situ for nutrient analysis and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm nuclepore filter and stored in acid washed pre conditioned hdpe bottles after a saturated hgcl2 solution was added liu et al 2017b all samples were stored at 4 c until analysis liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2020a the short lived radium isotopes 223ra and 224ra were immediately measured using a radium delayed coincidence counting system radecc moore and arnold 1996 subsequently the mn fibers were ashed 850 c for 8 h homogenized and sealed in a plastic vial using an epoxy sealant eventually the long lived radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra were determined with calibrated gamma spectrometry ortec gwl 120 15xlb awt using a high purity well type ge detector after aging for at least three weeks to allow ingrowth of 222rn 226ra and 228ra the counting time for each sample was approximately 24 48 h the 226ra activity was determined using 214pb 295 and 352 kev and 214bi 609 kev peaks while the 228ra activity was determined using 228ac 338 and 911 kev peaks van beek et al 2010 liu et al 2021 the measurement errors for radium were related to the sample volume decay and counting time and were expected to be approximately 20 and 5 for 223ra and 224ra respectively and 10 for 226ra and 228ra all analytical errors were determined based on error propagation rules tamborski et al 2017 the concentrations of nutrients including dissolved inorganic nitrogen din which is the sum of no3 no2 and nh4 dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and dissolved inorganic silicate dsi were measured in the laboratory using a skalar quaatro auto analyzer 2 3 desorbable radium from resuspended particulate matter to assess the desorbable radium from the resuspended particles a detailed evaluation of the desorption experiment was conducted following rodellas et al 2012 and correa et al 2020 approximately 1 kg of sediment was collected from xsb during the fieldwork and approximately 26 l of ra free seawater was added salinity 25 which is the maximum salinity in all measured waters the sample was stirred several times for no 2 days and subsequently processed into another pre cleaned container the radium isotopes of the decanted water were extracted using 20 g of mn fibers at a flow rate 1 l min 1 after removing the suspended particles the content of the desorbable radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra of this sample were analyzed as described in section 2 2 2 4 water ages the ages of water mass at several locations of the small embayments large estuarine coastal oceans and continental shelves were analyzed based on underlying two radium isotopes 224ra and 228ra moore et al 2006 rodellas et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b peng et al 2021 further detailed assumptions were characterized in a steady state in which the radium species added were equivalent to the radium species lost there are no other dominant radium sources except for groundwater borne radium loading into the system the equation for 224ra and 228ra is expressed as follows 1 τ f ra 224 ra 228 i ra 224 ra 228 λ 224 i ra 224 ra 228 where τ represents the water age and f 224 ra 228 ra and i 224 ra 228 ra represent the 224ra 228ra ratio in the groundwater and xsb seawater respectively λ 224 is the 224ra decay constant eq 1 indicates that the age of the water mass is a function of f 224 ra 228 ra and i 224 ra 228 ra which are equivalent to the 224ra 228ra ratio in the groundwater and bay water respectively 2 5 radium mass balance model a mass balance model of long lived radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra was built to quantify sgd radium sources in xsb include sgd local rivers benthic sediment diffusion and resuspended particulate matter desorption conversely radium sinks predominantly originate from losses due to radioactive decay and tidal mixing the content of radium from parent isotope decay can be ignored because of the lower activities and longer half lives of the parent isotopes 230th and 232th compared with those of 226ra and 228ra in seawater santos et al 2010 luo and jiao 2016 zhang et al 2020a consequently the mass balance model for 226ra and 228ra can be expressed as follows 2 q sgd f mix d decay f r f dif f des 22 i r a g w where i represents 6 and 8 and qsgd in eq 2 are the sgd fluxes m3 d 1 fmix and fdecay represent the loss of radium via mixing and radioactive decay respectively and fr fdif and fdes represent the gain from local rivers benthic sediment diffusion and the desorption of resuspended particulates respectively dpm d 1 22 iragw is the activity of the radium nuclide i in the coastal groundwater dpm 100 l 1 therefore sgd fluxes can be determined by the difference between other known sources and sinks in the mass balance model and sgd rates cm d 1 can be estimated by dividing the fluxes m3 d 1 of sgd by the corresponding area m2 3 results 3 1 hydrogeological environment salinity distribution in the xsb seawater is presented in fig 2 a the salinity of the surface seawaters in xsb varied from 21 to 25 average 24 throughout the bay and the highest salinity was observed in the bay mouth table s1 a horizontal gradient of salinity decreased from the outer bay to the bay channel because multiple rivers discharge substantial amounts of freshwater into the inner xsb fig 1 3 2 radium the activities of the radium isotopes 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra in the surface seawater of xsb varied significantly table s1 fig 2b e the isotope activities in the surface seawater in the xsb channel ranged from 1 1 to 4 5 dpm 100 l 1 average 3 2 dpm 100 l 1 for 223ra from 24 to 57 dpm 100 l 1 average 38 dpm 100 l 1 for 224ra from 27 to 46 dpm 100 l 1 average 34 dpm 100 l 1 for 226ra and from 91 to 168 dpm 100 l 1 average 119 dpm 100 l 1 for 228ra the activities of the four radium isotopes in the surface seawater had a similar horizontal distribution with distinct variations increasing from the outer bay to the inner bay except for 224ra the activities of the radium isotopes in the surface seawater of the three embayments varied considerably and ranged from 0 5 to 6 4 dpm 100 l 1 average 3 3 dpm 100 l 1 for 223ra from 27 to 62 dpm 100 l 1 average 43 dpm 100 l 1 for 224ra from 36 to 52 dpm 100 l 1 average 43 dpm 100 l 1 for 226ra and from 112 to 168 dpm 100 l 1 average 145 dpm 100 l 1 for 228ra the highest values of 223ra and 224ra were observed in embayment iii and the highest values of 226ra and 228ra were found near embayment i fig 2b e the horizontal distribution of the four radium isotopes indicated that the substantial amount of groundwater characterized by the enrichment of radium represents a novel and abundant input within the coastal area preferentially in the inner bay radium isotope activities in coastal groundwater samples were substantially higher than those in surface seawater and river water table s2 fig 3 the results indicated that the activities of the radium isotopes in the coastal groundwater in the xsb channel and three embayments exceeded those of the seawater by factors of approximately 1 5 6 14 1 2 and 1 2 for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra respectively demonstrating radium enrichment in the coastal groundwater throughout xsb fig 3 3 3 nutrients the spatial distributions of the nutrients in the surface seawater in xsb are described in fig 2f j within the din pools of the xsb channel table s1 fig 3 concentrations of no3 n varied substantially ranging from 46 to 53 μmol l 1 average 50 μmol l 1 similar to no3 n concentrations the concentrations of no2 n varied from 0 2 to 1 2 μmol l 1 average 0 7 μmol l 1 conversely the concentrations of nh4 n were less variable ranging from 2 3 to 4 6 μmol l 1 average 2 9 μmol l 1 the percentages of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n in the din pools were less variable and din was predominantly comprised of no3 n with low nh4 n and variable no2 n with average proportions of 93 5 and 2 respectively the concentrations of dip and dsi in the xsb channel varied from 1 6 to 2 1 μmol l 1 average 1 9 μmol l 1 and 56 to 64 μmol l 1 average 61 μmol l 1 respectively similar variability trends were observed for the dominant nutrients except for nh4 n decreasing from the upper to lower bays in the three embayments the maximum concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n ranged from 45 to 65 μmol l 1 average 54 μmol l 1 0 6 to 2 4 μmol l 1 average 1 6 μmol l 1 and 2 1 to 3 5 μmol l 1 average 2 6 μmol l 1 respectively reflecting that no3 n was the predominant dissolved n species comprising 93 of the din the concentrations of dip and dsi varied from 1 9 to 2 6 μmol l 1 average 2 2 μmol l 1 and 61 to 70 μmol l 1 average 65 μmol l 1 respectively fig 2f j illustrates that the maximum concentration of the dissolved nutrients except for nh4 n was observed in embayment ii followed by embayment i embayment iii and the xsb channel higher concentrations of nutrients were observed in the coastal groundwater samples table s2 fig 3 the concentrations of nutrients in the xsb channel were highly variable and averaged 102 μmol l 1 0 7 μmol l 1 40 μmol l 1 9 8 μmol l 1 and 356 μmol l 1 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively the concentrations of nutrients in the groundwater of the three embayments were also highly variable and averaged 285 μmol l 1 0 3 μmol l 1 24 μmol l 1 3 9 μmol l 1 and 394 μmol l 1 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively 3 4 water ages estimation the apparent water ages determined using the radium ratios 224ra 228ra were classified as average minimum and maximum table 1 the water ages calculated in the xsb channel varied from 5 2 to 29 11 days with an average of 17 8 days for the three embayments the water ages varied from 25 6 to 41 13 days with an average of 32 8 days in embayment i from 16 8 to 21 10 days with an average of 19 6 days in embayment ii and from 20 5 to 38 10 days with an average of 32 8 days in embayment iii jin et al 2020 combining their data with that from previous studies calculated the water ages in xsb based on the numerical model yielding values of 5 15 days for the lower xsb 15 25 days for the adjacent district of embayment iii 30 35 days for the upper xsb and 35 40 days for embayment i the water ages in xsb that were calculated according to the radium ratio in our study agree well with those of jin et al 2020 which were calculated according to the numerical model suggesting that water age calculation using the radium ratio is suitable 3 5 estimation of sgd in xsb channel and three embayments the long lived radium isotope 226ra and 228ra mass balance models were used to quantify sgd in xsb the calculated parameters were substituted into eq 2 and further details regarding the gain and loss of radium isotopes are presented in table 2 the sources of the gains of 226ra and 228ra include rivers benthic sediment diffusion and resuspended particulate matter desorption and the losses of 228ra can be attributed to radioactive decay and tidal mixing with the east china sea while that of 226ra can be attributed to tidal mixing with the east china sea the sgd derived radium fluxes in the xsb channel and three embayments can be calculated by subtracting the radium flux gains from the losses in general ra isotopes are highly enriched in coastal porewaters relative to their concentrations in seawater and are geochemically conservative once released into saline waters rodellas et al 2017 garcia orellana et al 2021 therefore for a conservative estimation of the groundwater flux we selected coastal porewater with a higher concentration of radium relative to that of coastal seawater as the groundwater endmember in our study after normalizing to the entire study area the radium derived estimated sgd rate in the xsb channel depending on the 226ra and 228ra mass balance model ranged from 8 9 4 4 to 13 2 6 5 cm d 1 with an average of 11 0 5 5 cm d 1 table 2 the sgd rates of the three embayments varied from 3 5 1 0 to 3 7 0 9 cm d 1 with an average of 3 6 1 0 cm d 1 in embayment i 5 6 1 7 to 5 8 1 7 cm d 1 with an average of 5 7 1 7 cm d 1 in embayment ii and 4 5 1 5 to 5 8 1 5 cm d 1 with an average of 5 2 1 5 cm d 1 in embayment iii table 2 4 discussion 4 1 variabilities in sgd sgd fluxes are expected to change according to different spatial and temporal scales swarzenski et al 2006 rodellas et al 2012 taniguchi et al 2019 correa et al 2020 garcia orellana et al 2021 two scales regarding the bay and embayment were evaluated in our study namely the entire bay scale in the order of tens of kilometers and the embayment scale on the scale of kilometers bratton 2010 generally the flux of the sgd is compared with that of the river on a global scale radium derived sgd has been determined to exceed river inputs into the ocean taniguchi et al 2019 in our study the estimated sgd flux exceeded the average total river discharge 2 1 106 m3 d 1 by a factor of approximately 25 for the xsb channel for the three embayments the average sgd flux of embayment i embayment ii and embayment iii were 9 2 105 m3 d 1 9 7 105 m3 d 1 and 24 105 m3 d 1 respectively the sgd flux of the three embayments exceeded the local river discharge 2 7 105 m3 d 1 in embayment i and 8 1 104 m3 d 1 in embayment ii by factors of approximately 3 and 12 respectively when normalizing the sgd fluxes to the respective area the highest sgd rate in xsb was observed in the xsb channel at 11 0 5 5 cm d 1 followed by the three embayments in the three embayments the maximum and minimum sgd rate occurred in embayment ii and embayment i at 5 7 1 7 cm d 1 and 3 6 1 0 cm d 1 respectively however the average sgd rate in the three embayments was within the same order of magnitude as that in the xsb channel in general sgd rates are expected to be mainly influenced by the complex hydrogeological characteristics of coastal aquifers and oceanic conditions the permeability of coastal aquifers could regulate the hydraulic gradient and have a considerable impact on fresh groundwater luijendijk et al 2020 however recirculated seawater dominates the sgd component in most regions worldwide burnett et al 2006 taniguchi et al 2019 santos et al 2021 and according to our observations a similar scenario occurs in xsb as well the factors influencing the sgd variations in xsb are supposed to be oceanic conditions such as tides and waves that may be more substantial for groundwater dynamics robinson et al 2006 xin et al 2011 santos et al 2012 the roles of tidal dynamics waves and their interactions in xsb have a significant impact on seawater circulation across the nearshore sediment water interface in xsb the regular semi diurnal tide was characterized by relatively large tidal fluctuations the averaged tidal fluctuations were 3 74 m 3 39 m 3 36 m and 5 65 m in embayment i embayment ii embayment iii and lower xsb respectively china oceanic information network http www nmdis org cn we observed that significantly greater tidal fluctuations occurring near the ocean led to a higher sgd rate in the lower xsb powerful tidal dynamics drive seawater circulation at the sediment water interface changing the hydraulic gradient and subsequently resulting in more groundwater discharge along the coastline santos et al 2012 the distinct topographical characteristics of the longer and larger scales of the coastline in the lower xsb also induce more substantial porewater and seawater circulation and the only beach morphology with a high aquifer permeability was observed in the lower xsb as a result the estimated higher rates of sgd in xsb were in proximity to the ocean with relatively lower rates observed in the upper bay due to the significant impact of multiple superimposed factors however the sgd rate in embayment ii was significantly higher than that in embayment i reverse tidal pumping and similar industrial development imply that other parameters may influence sgd anthropogenic activities also play a significant role in groundwater properties correa et al 2020 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 hayashi et al 2009 demonstrated that human activities and urbanization had a marked impact on the aquifer system of tokyo in particular groundwater flow is vulnerable to urbanization groundwater withdrawals and human activities human activities reduce groundwater resource quality and deteriorate ecosystems providing human habitat alorda kleinglass et al 2021 as a typical historic aquaculture bay located in the central part of the southern coastline of ningbo xsb has several typical industrial districts that function primarily as shipbuilding and power enterprises zhao et al 2018 substantial urbanization and industrial construction concentrated in the three embayments can significantly lower the infiltration capacity of its soils and aquifer recharge hayashi et al 2009 zeng et al 2011 feng et al 2018 potentially altering and regulating sgd intensified human activities particularly for artificial landform processes along the coast of xsb have markedly transformed the shoreline of the port and affected the entire natural landform process of xsb liu 2017 in conclusion the construction of artificial coastal landforms and the superimposed effects of various projects seriously threaten the coastal ecosystem of xsb highly concentrated industrialization and urbanization in the three embayments have a pronounced role in modulating sgd rates bishop et al 2017 correa et al 2020 therefore changes in soil characteristics may considerably alter groundwater flow paths and trigger different responses in the aquifer the sandy beaches in the lower bay are more exposed to tides and waves increasing the groundwater discharge substantially anwar et al 2014 robinson et al 2018 furthermore the spatial trend of the sgd rates in the three embayments indicated that the significant role played by oceanic forcing was more substantial on a small scale the sgd rate of embayment iii was slightly lower than that of embayment ii this phenomenon may be ascribed to the accelerated artificial landforms in embayment iii that seriously threaten the aquifer liu 2017 geological geomorphological factors such as the narrow mouth and shortage of surface freshwater may also play a critical role in the sgd rate the relatively long water ages at 32 8 days in embayment iii also verified these influences the establishment of sgd at two different spatial scales is instructive for studying the groundwater environment at various scales and can also be valid for many other regions such as the tolo harbor in hong kong cheng et al 2020 and some river estuaries liu et al 2018 chen et al 2022 the sgd rates at multiple scales have demonstrated that anthropogenic constructions and ocean dynamics were key factors for the spatial variability of sgd however studies mediating mechanistic models to research the dynamics of sgd in similar ecosystems are limited a general understanding of the two mobilization mechanisms is necessary to determine the factors that play a predominant role in xsb care must be taken regarding the trajectory of these factors and may be observed in future studies 4 2 nutrient fluxes derived by sgd in the xsb channel and three embayments the nutrients in groundwater themselves are concerning but they can also impact the receptors surface water baseflow and groundwater dependent ecosystem and submarine freshwater discharge with consequences for coastal waters lee and kim 2007 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 santos et al 2021 groundwater is a vast and slowly changing nutrient store that plays a significant role in controlling nutrient dynamics and delivery the ratio of n p within nutrient sensitive ecosystems the sources of nutrients in groundwater include fertilizers owing to the intensification of agriculture and aquaculture atmospheric pollution and septic effluents a typical calculation method for determining sgd nutrient fluxes is by multiplying sgd flux by the concentration of the measured nutrients in the groundwater endmember slomp and van cappellen 2004 kim et al 2011 liu et al 2017c chen et al 2020 sgd derived nutrient rates were estimated by multiplying the average groundwater nutrient concentration μmol l 1 for each sub region of xsb xsb channel embayment i embayment ii embayment iii by the sgd rate cm d 1 for that sub region hwang et al 2005 moore et al 2006 chen et al 2018b zhang et al 2020a the sgd derived nutrient rates in the xsb channel were estimated to be 11 3 5 6 mmol m 2 d 1 0 08 0 04 mmol m 2 d 1 4 4 2 2 mmol m 2 d 1 1 1 0 5 mmol m 2 d 1 and 39 3 19 4 mmol m 2 d 1 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively table 3 the results were then systematically combined with extensive data from the literature to provide insights for evaluating the nutrient fluxes of the total river discharge the results indicated that nutrient concentrations in the river were comparable to those in the groundwater endmembers but the magnitudes of sgd derived nutrient fluxes were 1 2 orders higher than those of riverine inputs specifically the nutrient fluxes of sgd exceeded those of the total river discharge by factors of approximately 29 2 210 257 and 44 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively table 3 the sgd fluxes in embayments i and ii were slightly higher than those in the river fluxes but the magnitude of sgd derived nutrient fluxes exceeded that of the river fluxes by one order of magnitude the spatial difference of sgd and the corresponding nutrient fluxes with spatial and temporal variability showed that sgd played multiple roles in the local nutrient budget and ecosystem at different scales the sgd rates in the xsb channel were approximately three times higher than those in the other three embayments but the sgd derived nutrient rate in the xsb channel was comparable with those in the three embayments in addition sgd derived nutrient rate of no3 n in the xsb channel was significantly lower than that in embayments i and ii one possible reason is that aquaculture induced more nutrient loading into the coastal aquifers further influencing sgd nutrient concentrations with over 68 of the aquaculture industry concentrated in the three embayments tal et al 2017 kang et al 2019 liao et al 2019 in particular the nutrient concentrations in the three embayments were 1 4 5 times those in the xsb channel for no3 n and were comparable for the other nutrients such as dip and dsi in addition the shellfish culture was predominantly concentrated in embayments i and ii the fish cage culture was observed in embayment iii and the kelp culture was mostly farmed near the outside of embayment iii compared to shellfish farming fish cage farming produces more nutrient discharge into the marine environment liao et al 2019 however the specific conditions demonstrated that higher groundwater nutrient concentrations were observed in the oyster culture area than in the fish culture area the nutrient concentrations in the coastal groundwater in embayments i and ii which are characterized by a dense shellfish culture were 527 and 379 μmol l 1 for din 3 4 and 2 7 μmol l 1 for dip and 572 and 335 μmol l 1 for dsi respectively which were higher than those in embayment iii a general understanding is that the abundant nutrient loading from coastal wastewater originated from industrial and domestic wastewater through surface runoff such as the fx stream wastewater occurs concurrently with considerable contamination loading from cultivated land and sewer pipes particularly nutrient enrichment eventually more nutrients either in soluble or particle forms are discharged into coastal groundwater via surface pathways considerably enhancing nutrient concentrations of the groundwater in embayments i and ii and may exceed the direct influence of aquaculture liao et al 2019 to gain a clear understanding of the role of sgd fluxes on nutrients correlation analyses were conducted for the seawater of the entire xsb fig 4 these results further support our previous assumption that nutrients and tracers of sgd hotspots are positively correlated radium 226ra and 228ra and the four nutrient species no3 n no2 n dip and dsi were significantly positively correlated figs 2 and 4 this positive correlation indicated that the abundant nutrients and the radium isotopes had similar sources and were consistent with geochemical characteristics the negative correlations between radium and nh4 n that shifted between 2 1 and 4 6 μmol l 1 were likely due to the higher concentrations of other inputs and or the biochemical transformation process the higher concentration of nh4 n originated from benthic sediment through saline sgd entering the system or the substantial nh4 n in discharging groundwater was removed by nitrification with the subsequent oxidation of nh4 to no3 brooks et al 2021 numerous studies have demonstrated that the ecological environment of aquaculture is influenced by groundwater hwang et al 2005 taniguchi et al 2019 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 the results demonstrate the impact of sgd and the corresponding nutrients on xsb which is dominated by intensive aquaculture activities therefore sgd derived nutrients and marine aquaculture activities should be further explored endeavors that integrate multiple cooperative disciplines are also necessary for the management and improvement of the xsb ecological environment 4 3 environmental impact of sgd long term intensive economic aquaculture activities have also caused the challenging problems of pollution from nutrients as well as other contaminants that not only influence the marine environment but also trigger a potential risk to cultured seafood hu et al 2006 zhang et al 2020a peng et al 2021 in this study the din dip and dsi dip of 27 1 and 31 1 respectively for the surface seawater are higher than the typical redfield ratio c n si p 106 16 15 1 indicating a phosphate limited environment in xsb table s1 the distinctive nutrient structure significantly influences the phytoplankton size structure biomass and predominant species jiang et al 2019b the spatial trends and distributions of the nutrient inputs via sgd are critical factors in the occurrence of red tides in xsb wu et al 2013 in the last decade frequent red tide outbreaks coupled with phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity have increased with increasing nutrients and temperatures directly leading to the nutrient contamination in the cultured seafood jiang et al 2019a in addition numerous studies have revealed that phytoplankton biomass total chl a concentration in xsb is closely associated with nutrient concentrations particularly din and dip jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 liao et al 2019 a significant positive correlation was found between phytoplankton biomass and din and dip concentrations niencheski et al 2007 gonzález garcía et al 2018 jiang et al 2019b cheng et al 2020 phytoplankton biomass was positively and significantly correlated with a suitable ecosystem characterized by abundant nutrients a relatively lower din dip ratio and a higher dsi din ratio because of eco physiological trade offs jiang et al 2013 jiang et al 2019b in this study the sgd derived nutrient fluxes occupied the dominant sources in the nutrient budget since its abundant discharge and higher concentrations relative to other traditional sources such as riverine input and atmospheric deposition etc it is also vital to assess the potential effects of sgd on the ratios of din dip and dsi din in coastal areas which can influence the dominant types of phytoplankton growth the din dip ratio 95 in coastal groundwater is significantly higher than the requirements for phytoplankton growth din dip 16 with p in groundwater more efficiently immobilized than n slomp and van cappellen 2004 wu et al 2013 this is reasonable for an environment in which phosphate was the limiting factor in regulating the growth of fish and phytoplankton xsb is an important aquaculture region in china where the scale of cultured seafood production has peaked in the last decade however the accelerated development and extensive exploitation of aquaculture are deeply affected by nutrient pollution in coastal seawaters which in turn damages carrying capacity of aquaculture jiang et al 2013 liao et al 2019 in the presence of aquaculture xsb in ningbo has suffered frequent algal blooms in the last decade the ningbo government implemented integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta to reduce the input of anthropogenic nutrients and improve water quality the imta system is a cultivation system for aquatic species from different trophic levels within the same water body bostock et al 2010 serious actions were implemented to diversify marine aquaculture mitigate the environmental impacts of fish farming and provide compatible social and economic benefits and environmental stability bostock et al 2010 liao et al 2019 however reducing point nutrient sources did not prevent the occurrence of algal blooms in coastal areas where nutrient loading did not correlate well with the fluctuation of red tide events and phytoplankton biomass this unexpected phenomenon indicates that nutrient sources other than aquaculture such as groundwater loading nutrient input from the watershed and tidal exchange with nutrient enriched coastal waters may exacerbate the eutrophication of xsb wu et al 2013 liao et al 2019 consequently more endeavors that integrate aquaculture activities and other extraneous nutrient sources are urgently needed to further explore nutrient dynamics and prevent eutrophication and red tide outbreaks 4 4 response of global aquaculture bay of sgd and associated nutrient rates sgd has been shown to significantly impact marine aquaculture in various coastal ecosystems liu and du 2022 and numerous studies regarding sgd and associated nutrient in aquaculture bays worldwide have been conducted table 4 sgd was calibrated to provide the associated unit area for a convenient comparison at different scales sgd and the corresponding rates in coastal aquaculture bays vary considerably worldwide and range from 0 09 to 156 cm d 1 0 08 to 150 mmol m 2 d 1 0 to 10 5 mmol m 2 d 1 and 0 08 to 220 mmol m 2 d 1 for sgd din dip and dsi respectively in the context of previous studies sgd in this study is compared based on geo tracers with that of embayments and bays elsewhere the results of this study are consistent with the range of many other sgd estimations indicating the applicability of sgd in this study furthermore the difference in sgd based on different geo tracer models may reflect differences in the components originating from the water that supplies the geo tracers to the harbor luo and jiao 2016 the sgd rate in the xsb channel was comparable with those of gamak bay 8 12 cm d 1 and sanggou bay 13 15 cm d 1 and the nutrient rates in the xsb channel derived from sgd were comparable with those in bangdu bay and zhenzhu bay and higher than those in other regions high sgd and nutrient rates were generally closest to coastal regions classified as highly industrialized urbanized and agriculturalized the water quality deterioration and water eutrophication are attributable to the occurrence of red tides in xsb which is similar to that in daya and sanggou bays wang et al 2014 wang et al 2018a therefore the ecosystem structure and sgd in xsb should be considered jointly to manage environmental problems and predict red tide outbreaks endeavors that integrate physical chemical biological cooperative studies are necessary to further explore red tide outbreak mechanisms and protect aquaculture activities 5 summary sgd and the associated nutrients in xsb which is characterized by historically important aquaculture bays that are experiencing excessive urbanization were quantified during the winter of 2019 using a geo tracer model 226ra and 228ra mass balance model the average water ages based on the radium ratios were estimated as 17 8 days 32 8 days 19 6 days and 32 8 days for the xsb channel embayment i embayment ii and embayment iii respectively larger sgd flux magnitudes were observed in the xsb channel which were approximately two orders larger than those of the three embayments the sgd rates varied significantly with 11 0 5 5 cm d 1 3 6 1 0 cm d 1 5 7 1 7 cm d 1 and 5 2 1 5 cm d 1 in xsb channel embayment i embayment ii and embayment iii respectively the estimated sgd rates in the xsb channel were approximately three times higher than those in the three embayments and were comparable with those in gamak bay korea table 4 the sgd rates increased from the inner bay towards the ocean indicating that the ocean factor coupled with wave and tidal effects significantly promoted groundwater discharge however intensive urbanization underlying specific geographical characteristics also mediate sgd such as in embayment iii the sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the xsb channel were estimated as 5 3 2 6 106 mol d 1 3 7 1 8 104 mol d 1 2 1 1 0 106 mol d 1 5 1 2 5 105 mol d 1 and 1 9 0 9 107 mol d 1 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively the sgd driven nutrient fluxes in the xsb channel exceed those of the river discharge by factors of approximately 29 2 210 257 and 44 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively the magnitude of sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the three embayments was more than one order greater than those of the river in addition the sgd derived nutrient rate in the xsb channel was comparable with that in the three embayments and significantly lower than that for the no3 n of embayments i and ii which may be ascribed to aquaculture activities and or anthropogenic disturbance by combining these results with previous literature data the sgd derived nutrients provided insights for studying the groundwater environment at various scales including the entire bay and the embayments as an extraneous nonpoint source the sgd derived nutrient rates in xsb are at a high level worldwide the relatively higher din dip ratio in coastal groundwater may strongly affect primary production and nutrient structure and cause algal blooms our results suggest that a new perspective regarding the correlation between sgd and aquaculture activities as well as urbanization is required for coastal ecosystems furthermore studies focusing on the predominant mechanism regulating the spatial variability of sgd should be conducted credit authorship contribution statement tong peng conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing

3255,submarine groundwater discharge sgd is a predominant component of chemical fluxes in the solute budgets in coastal ecosystems because of its large flux and the corresponding concentrated constituents a quantitative study regarding the mass balance model of 226ra and 228ra was performed to assess sgd and associated nutrient inputs in xiangshan bay xsb a typical chinese aquaculture bay based on these mass balance models the sgd rates in the xsb channel were 8 9 13 2 cm d 1 the sgd rates in the three corresponding embayments were 3 5 3 7 cm d 1 in embayment i 5 6 5 8 cm d 1 in embayment ii and 4 5 5 8 cm d 1 in embayment iii significant spatial variabilities in sgd rates were observed in the different xsb districts reflecting that ocean dynamics and anthropogenic activities play significant roles at different scales sgd derived nutrient fluxes in xsb were the dominant sources of nutrient loading and their magnitudes were approximately 1 2 orders larger than those of riverine input sgd rates in the xsb channel were approximately three times higher than those in the three embayments but the sgd derived nutrient rates in the xsb channel were comparable with those in the three embayments even significantly lower than that for no3 n in the inner regions of the embayment these results imply that aquaculture activities and urbanization jointly influence sgd when combined with the results of other studies our observations demonstrate the significant comprehensive effects of multiple factors on sgd a critical but overlooked nutrient source keywords submarine groundwater discharge nutrients marine aquaculture ocean dynamics xiangshan bay 1 introduction submarine groundwater discharge sgd is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon and is a crucial component in integrating physiochemical processes fluid compositions and origins moore 2010 rodellas et al 2017 garcia orellana et al 2021 it typically consists of both fresh meteoric groundwater which is principally driven by land hydrological gradients and recirculated seawater which is commonly driven by tides and waves robinson et al 2006 taniguchi et al 2019 santos et al 2021 it has been shown to play a critical role in water transport and terrestrial solute fluxes in global coastal regions burnett et al 2006 moore 2010 santos et al 2021 numerous studies have reported that sgd is a comprehensive source of nutrients rodellas et al 2015 correa et al 2020 greenhouse gases santos et al 2008 sadat noori et al 2018 carbon moore et al 2011 liu et al 2017a and heavy metals coynel et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a in several locations worldwide subsequently sgd has been quantified in a broader range of marine habitats such as mangroves gleeson et al 2013 lagoons mcmahon and santos 2017 estuaries douglas et al 2020 and harbors cheng et al 2020 numerous studies have determined that large amounts of solutes particularly enriched nutrients in sgd influence the dynamics and structure of microbial communities in the coastal ecosystem and can contribute to eutrophication hypoxia events and the occurrence of red tides in estuarine coastal zones hu et al 2006 liu et al 2017b guo et al 2020 ruiz gonzález et al 2021 sanial et al 2021 xiangshan bay xsb is one of china s largest semi enclosed areas used for aquaculture on the coastline of the east china sea with the primary aquaculture involved in cage culture of fish such as large yellow croaker larimichthys crocea and japanese seabass lateolabrax japonicus and the suspended aquaculture of chinese oysters ostrea plicatula and kelp laminaria japonica liao et al 2019 over the past decade the cultivation of marine fish and shellfish in xsb has been part of the most rapidly growing segment of aquaculture in 2013 the total area of aquaculture expanded to 100 km2 accounting for approximately 17 of the total area of xsb with an annual aquaculture production of approximately 1 03 105 t chen et al 2018a recently the aquaculture areas for oyster kelp and fish in three inner bays have been substantially expanding accounting for over 68 of the total aquaculture area liao et al 2019 as is the case in most coastal regions of china xsb is now facing increasing environmental issues because of the release of various chemicals and particularly nutrient loading which is attributable to accelerated urbanization and population growth and the simultaneous construction of docks and seafood processing factories jiang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the frequent occurrence of serious eutrophication and algal blooms has substantially reduced aquaculture production increasing the need to address the problem of nutrient loading although the distribution and sources of nutrients have previously been investigated yang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019a the scant studies regarding sgd have not sufficiently evaluated nutrient balance or the critical ecosystem services that are necessary for maintaining and improving the cultivation environment in this region sgd and mixing processes in various coastal systems have been effectively assessed using geochemical tracers such as radium isotopes which can be subject to the activity of highly concentrated radium in coastal groundwater relative to rivers and seawater the radium isotopes consist of 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra the use of short lived 223ra t1 2 11 4 d and 224ra t1 2 3 66 d is the typical approach for evaluating water ages and the exchange mixing of water solutes by tidal processes moore et al 2006 tamborski et al 2017 liu et al 2021 in addition the long lived 226ra t1 2 1600 y and 228ra t1 2 5 75 y provide an ideal insight for tracing the processes of spatially large or long time scales luo and jiao 2016 rodellas et al 2017 the objectives of this study were to quantify sgd fluxes and the associated nutrient inputs in xsb with high resolution for xsb channel and three small embayments namely embayment i embayment ii and embayment iii using the mass balance model with radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra we simultaneously explored the various factors influencing sgd characteristics to obtain a more accurate evaluation of the role of sgd in the accelerated development of aquaculture and the importance of sgd derived nutrients occurring at various spatiotemporal scales this will improve our understanding of aquaculture production and development associated with high urbanization and industrialization and the coastal ecosystem structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xsb is a heavily eutrophic large semi enclosed subtropical bay adjacent to the east china sea and covers an area of 560 km2 wu et al 2013 yang et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 1 the xsb consists of four regions including three branched embayments namely tie bay embayment i huangdun bay embayment ii and xihu bay embayment iii chen et al 2018a and the xsb channel the xsb has a length of approximately 60 km with an estimated minimum width of 4 km which is representative of particularly long and narrow tidal inlets the annual mean precipitation is approximately 1500 mm more than 80 of which occurs from june to september which is defined as the wet season wu et al 2013 there are multiple key rivers and streams around the bay including fuxi fx stream yangong yg river dasongjiang dsj river and xianyanghe xyh river detailed descriptions of the streams and several small seasonal rivers around xsb have been presented in previous studies wu et al 2013 yuan et al 2014 with a total annual discharge of approximately 1 30 109 m3 the tides in xsb are semi diurnal with an average tidal range of 3 3 m jiang et al 2019b the fish cage and shellfish cultures in xsb generate extensive amounts of biodeposits that consist of feces and pseudofeces these biodeposits are organically concentrated and can potentially intensify the massive amounts of nutrients released from aquaculture activity and exacerbate eutrophication and the occurrence of vast phytoplankton blooms in the bay jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019b 2 2 sampling and analysis fieldwork was conducted in xsb in november 2019 fig 1 water samples were collected from the rivers 30 l coastal groundwater 10 l or 30 l and surface water 50 l samples of the seawater n 23 and rivers n 4 were collected at a depth of approximately 0 5 m groundwater n 30 along the coastal aquifers was collected from well water and porewater the physicochemical parameters salinity temperature and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a multi wtw multi 3630 ids set g with a multiple parameter probe radium isotopes were extracted by filtering samples through a column filled with 20 g of mn fibers with a stable flow rate 1 l min 1 prior to the measurement all the fibers were then rinsed with radium free deionized water and stored for later analysis which was to be conducted after they had partially dried corresponding to radium samples approximately 60 ml of the samples were collected in situ for nutrient analysis and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm nuclepore filter and stored in acid washed pre conditioned hdpe bottles after a saturated hgcl2 solution was added liu et al 2017b all samples were stored at 4 c until analysis liu et al 2017b zhang et al 2020a the short lived radium isotopes 223ra and 224ra were immediately measured using a radium delayed coincidence counting system radecc moore and arnold 1996 subsequently the mn fibers were ashed 850 c for 8 h homogenized and sealed in a plastic vial using an epoxy sealant eventually the long lived radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra were determined with calibrated gamma spectrometry ortec gwl 120 15xlb awt using a high purity well type ge detector after aging for at least three weeks to allow ingrowth of 222rn 226ra and 228ra the counting time for each sample was approximately 24 48 h the 226ra activity was determined using 214pb 295 and 352 kev and 214bi 609 kev peaks while the 228ra activity was determined using 228ac 338 and 911 kev peaks van beek et al 2010 liu et al 2021 the measurement errors for radium were related to the sample volume decay and counting time and were expected to be approximately 20 and 5 for 223ra and 224ra respectively and 10 for 226ra and 228ra all analytical errors were determined based on error propagation rules tamborski et al 2017 the concentrations of nutrients including dissolved inorganic nitrogen din which is the sum of no3 no2 and nh4 dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and dissolved inorganic silicate dsi were measured in the laboratory using a skalar quaatro auto analyzer 2 3 desorbable radium from resuspended particulate matter to assess the desorbable radium from the resuspended particles a detailed evaluation of the desorption experiment was conducted following rodellas et al 2012 and correa et al 2020 approximately 1 kg of sediment was collected from xsb during the fieldwork and approximately 26 l of ra free seawater was added salinity 25 which is the maximum salinity in all measured waters the sample was stirred several times for no 2 days and subsequently processed into another pre cleaned container the radium isotopes of the decanted water were extracted using 20 g of mn fibers at a flow rate 1 l min 1 after removing the suspended particles the content of the desorbable radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra of this sample were analyzed as described in section 2 2 2 4 water ages the ages of water mass at several locations of the small embayments large estuarine coastal oceans and continental shelves were analyzed based on underlying two radium isotopes 224ra and 228ra moore et al 2006 rodellas et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b peng et al 2021 further detailed assumptions were characterized in a steady state in which the radium species added were equivalent to the radium species lost there are no other dominant radium sources except for groundwater borne radium loading into the system the equation for 224ra and 228ra is expressed as follows 1 τ f ra 224 ra 228 i ra 224 ra 228 λ 224 i ra 224 ra 228 where τ represents the water age and f 224 ra 228 ra and i 224 ra 228 ra represent the 224ra 228ra ratio in the groundwater and xsb seawater respectively λ 224 is the 224ra decay constant eq 1 indicates that the age of the water mass is a function of f 224 ra 228 ra and i 224 ra 228 ra which are equivalent to the 224ra 228ra ratio in the groundwater and bay water respectively 2 5 radium mass balance model a mass balance model of long lived radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra was built to quantify sgd radium sources in xsb include sgd local rivers benthic sediment diffusion and resuspended particulate matter desorption conversely radium sinks predominantly originate from losses due to radioactive decay and tidal mixing the content of radium from parent isotope decay can be ignored because of the lower activities and longer half lives of the parent isotopes 230th and 232th compared with those of 226ra and 228ra in seawater santos et al 2010 luo and jiao 2016 zhang et al 2020a consequently the mass balance model for 226ra and 228ra can be expressed as follows 2 q sgd f mix d decay f r f dif f des 22 i r a g w where i represents 6 and 8 and qsgd in eq 2 are the sgd fluxes m3 d 1 fmix and fdecay represent the loss of radium via mixing and radioactive decay respectively and fr fdif and fdes represent the gain from local rivers benthic sediment diffusion and the desorption of resuspended particulates respectively dpm d 1 22 iragw is the activity of the radium nuclide i in the coastal groundwater dpm 100 l 1 therefore sgd fluxes can be determined by the difference between other known sources and sinks in the mass balance model and sgd rates cm d 1 can be estimated by dividing the fluxes m3 d 1 of sgd by the corresponding area m2 3 results 3 1 hydrogeological environment salinity distribution in the xsb seawater is presented in fig 2 a the salinity of the surface seawaters in xsb varied from 21 to 25 average 24 throughout the bay and the highest salinity was observed in the bay mouth table s1 a horizontal gradient of salinity decreased from the outer bay to the bay channel because multiple rivers discharge substantial amounts of freshwater into the inner xsb fig 1 3 2 radium the activities of the radium isotopes 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra in the surface seawater of xsb varied significantly table s1 fig 2b e the isotope activities in the surface seawater in the xsb channel ranged from 1 1 to 4 5 dpm 100 l 1 average 3 2 dpm 100 l 1 for 223ra from 24 to 57 dpm 100 l 1 average 38 dpm 100 l 1 for 224ra from 27 to 46 dpm 100 l 1 average 34 dpm 100 l 1 for 226ra and from 91 to 168 dpm 100 l 1 average 119 dpm 100 l 1 for 228ra the activities of the four radium isotopes in the surface seawater had a similar horizontal distribution with distinct variations increasing from the outer bay to the inner bay except for 224ra the activities of the radium isotopes in the surface seawater of the three embayments varied considerably and ranged from 0 5 to 6 4 dpm 100 l 1 average 3 3 dpm 100 l 1 for 223ra from 27 to 62 dpm 100 l 1 average 43 dpm 100 l 1 for 224ra from 36 to 52 dpm 100 l 1 average 43 dpm 100 l 1 for 226ra and from 112 to 168 dpm 100 l 1 average 145 dpm 100 l 1 for 228ra the highest values of 223ra and 224ra were observed in embayment iii and the highest values of 226ra and 228ra were found near embayment i fig 2b e the horizontal distribution of the four radium isotopes indicated that the substantial amount of groundwater characterized by the enrichment of radium represents a novel and abundant input within the coastal area preferentially in the inner bay radium isotope activities in coastal groundwater samples were substantially higher than those in surface seawater and river water table s2 fig 3 the results indicated that the activities of the radium isotopes in the coastal groundwater in the xsb channel and three embayments exceeded those of the seawater by factors of approximately 1 5 6 14 1 2 and 1 2 for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra respectively demonstrating radium enrichment in the coastal groundwater throughout xsb fig 3 3 3 nutrients the spatial distributions of the nutrients in the surface seawater in xsb are described in fig 2f j within the din pools of the xsb channel table s1 fig 3 concentrations of no3 n varied substantially ranging from 46 to 53 μmol l 1 average 50 μmol l 1 similar to no3 n concentrations the concentrations of no2 n varied from 0 2 to 1 2 μmol l 1 average 0 7 μmol l 1 conversely the concentrations of nh4 n were less variable ranging from 2 3 to 4 6 μmol l 1 average 2 9 μmol l 1 the percentages of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n in the din pools were less variable and din was predominantly comprised of no3 n with low nh4 n and variable no2 n with average proportions of 93 5 and 2 respectively the concentrations of dip and dsi in the xsb channel varied from 1 6 to 2 1 μmol l 1 average 1 9 μmol l 1 and 56 to 64 μmol l 1 average 61 μmol l 1 respectively similar variability trends were observed for the dominant nutrients except for nh4 n decreasing from the upper to lower bays in the three embayments the maximum concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n ranged from 45 to 65 μmol l 1 average 54 μmol l 1 0 6 to 2 4 μmol l 1 average 1 6 μmol l 1 and 2 1 to 3 5 μmol l 1 average 2 6 μmol l 1 respectively reflecting that no3 n was the predominant dissolved n species comprising 93 of the din the concentrations of dip and dsi varied from 1 9 to 2 6 μmol l 1 average 2 2 μmol l 1 and 61 to 70 μmol l 1 average 65 μmol l 1 respectively fig 2f j illustrates that the maximum concentration of the dissolved nutrients except for nh4 n was observed in embayment ii followed by embayment i embayment iii and the xsb channel higher concentrations of nutrients were observed in the coastal groundwater samples table s2 fig 3 the concentrations of nutrients in the xsb channel were highly variable and averaged 102 μmol l 1 0 7 μmol l 1 40 μmol l 1 9 8 μmol l 1 and 356 μmol l 1 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively the concentrations of nutrients in the groundwater of the three embayments were also highly variable and averaged 285 μmol l 1 0 3 μmol l 1 24 μmol l 1 3 9 μmol l 1 and 394 μmol l 1 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively 3 4 water ages estimation the apparent water ages determined using the radium ratios 224ra 228ra were classified as average minimum and maximum table 1 the water ages calculated in the xsb channel varied from 5 2 to 29 11 days with an average of 17 8 days for the three embayments the water ages varied from 25 6 to 41 13 days with an average of 32 8 days in embayment i from 16 8 to 21 10 days with an average of 19 6 days in embayment ii and from 20 5 to 38 10 days with an average of 32 8 days in embayment iii jin et al 2020 combining their data with that from previous studies calculated the water ages in xsb based on the numerical model yielding values of 5 15 days for the lower xsb 15 25 days for the adjacent district of embayment iii 30 35 days for the upper xsb and 35 40 days for embayment i the water ages in xsb that were calculated according to the radium ratio in our study agree well with those of jin et al 2020 which were calculated according to the numerical model suggesting that water age calculation using the radium ratio is suitable 3 5 estimation of sgd in xsb channel and three embayments the long lived radium isotope 226ra and 228ra mass balance models were used to quantify sgd in xsb the calculated parameters were substituted into eq 2 and further details regarding the gain and loss of radium isotopes are presented in table 2 the sources of the gains of 226ra and 228ra include rivers benthic sediment diffusion and resuspended particulate matter desorption and the losses of 228ra can be attributed to radioactive decay and tidal mixing with the east china sea while that of 226ra can be attributed to tidal mixing with the east china sea the sgd derived radium fluxes in the xsb channel and three embayments can be calculated by subtracting the radium flux gains from the losses in general ra isotopes are highly enriched in coastal porewaters relative to their concentrations in seawater and are geochemically conservative once released into saline waters rodellas et al 2017 garcia orellana et al 2021 therefore for a conservative estimation of the groundwater flux we selected coastal porewater with a higher concentration of radium relative to that of coastal seawater as the groundwater endmember in our study after normalizing to the entire study area the radium derived estimated sgd rate in the xsb channel depending on the 226ra and 228ra mass balance model ranged from 8 9 4 4 to 13 2 6 5 cm d 1 with an average of 11 0 5 5 cm d 1 table 2 the sgd rates of the three embayments varied from 3 5 1 0 to 3 7 0 9 cm d 1 with an average of 3 6 1 0 cm d 1 in embayment i 5 6 1 7 to 5 8 1 7 cm d 1 with an average of 5 7 1 7 cm d 1 in embayment ii and 4 5 1 5 to 5 8 1 5 cm d 1 with an average of 5 2 1 5 cm d 1 in embayment iii table 2 4 discussion 4 1 variabilities in sgd sgd fluxes are expected to change according to different spatial and temporal scales swarzenski et al 2006 rodellas et al 2012 taniguchi et al 2019 correa et al 2020 garcia orellana et al 2021 two scales regarding the bay and embayment were evaluated in our study namely the entire bay scale in the order of tens of kilometers and the embayment scale on the scale of kilometers bratton 2010 generally the flux of the sgd is compared with that of the river on a global scale radium derived sgd has been determined to exceed river inputs into the ocean taniguchi et al 2019 in our study the estimated sgd flux exceeded the average total river discharge 2 1 106 m3 d 1 by a factor of approximately 25 for the xsb channel for the three embayments the average sgd flux of embayment i embayment ii and embayment iii were 9 2 105 m3 d 1 9 7 105 m3 d 1 and 24 105 m3 d 1 respectively the sgd flux of the three embayments exceeded the local river discharge 2 7 105 m3 d 1 in embayment i and 8 1 104 m3 d 1 in embayment ii by factors of approximately 3 and 12 respectively when normalizing the sgd fluxes to the respective area the highest sgd rate in xsb was observed in the xsb channel at 11 0 5 5 cm d 1 followed by the three embayments in the three embayments the maximum and minimum sgd rate occurred in embayment ii and embayment i at 5 7 1 7 cm d 1 and 3 6 1 0 cm d 1 respectively however the average sgd rate in the three embayments was within the same order of magnitude as that in the xsb channel in general sgd rates are expected to be mainly influenced by the complex hydrogeological characteristics of coastal aquifers and oceanic conditions the permeability of coastal aquifers could regulate the hydraulic gradient and have a considerable impact on fresh groundwater luijendijk et al 2020 however recirculated seawater dominates the sgd component in most regions worldwide burnett et al 2006 taniguchi et al 2019 santos et al 2021 and according to our observations a similar scenario occurs in xsb as well the factors influencing the sgd variations in xsb are supposed to be oceanic conditions such as tides and waves that may be more substantial for groundwater dynamics robinson et al 2006 xin et al 2011 santos et al 2012 the roles of tidal dynamics waves and their interactions in xsb have a significant impact on seawater circulation across the nearshore sediment water interface in xsb the regular semi diurnal tide was characterized by relatively large tidal fluctuations the averaged tidal fluctuations were 3 74 m 3 39 m 3 36 m and 5 65 m in embayment i embayment ii embayment iii and lower xsb respectively china oceanic information network http www nmdis org cn we observed that significantly greater tidal fluctuations occurring near the ocean led to a higher sgd rate in the lower xsb powerful tidal dynamics drive seawater circulation at the sediment water interface changing the hydraulic gradient and subsequently resulting in more groundwater discharge along the coastline santos et al 2012 the distinct topographical characteristics of the longer and larger scales of the coastline in the lower xsb also induce more substantial porewater and seawater circulation and the only beach morphology with a high aquifer permeability was observed in the lower xsb as a result the estimated higher rates of sgd in xsb were in proximity to the ocean with relatively lower rates observed in the upper bay due to the significant impact of multiple superimposed factors however the sgd rate in embayment ii was significantly higher than that in embayment i reverse tidal pumping and similar industrial development imply that other parameters may influence sgd anthropogenic activities also play a significant role in groundwater properties correa et al 2020 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 hayashi et al 2009 demonstrated that human activities and urbanization had a marked impact on the aquifer system of tokyo in particular groundwater flow is vulnerable to urbanization groundwater withdrawals and human activities human activities reduce groundwater resource quality and deteriorate ecosystems providing human habitat alorda kleinglass et al 2021 as a typical historic aquaculture bay located in the central part of the southern coastline of ningbo xsb has several typical industrial districts that function primarily as shipbuilding and power enterprises zhao et al 2018 substantial urbanization and industrial construction concentrated in the three embayments can significantly lower the infiltration capacity of its soils and aquifer recharge hayashi et al 2009 zeng et al 2011 feng et al 2018 potentially altering and regulating sgd intensified human activities particularly for artificial landform processes along the coast of xsb have markedly transformed the shoreline of the port and affected the entire natural landform process of xsb liu 2017 in conclusion the construction of artificial coastal landforms and the superimposed effects of various projects seriously threaten the coastal ecosystem of xsb highly concentrated industrialization and urbanization in the three embayments have a pronounced role in modulating sgd rates bishop et al 2017 correa et al 2020 therefore changes in soil characteristics may considerably alter groundwater flow paths and trigger different responses in the aquifer the sandy beaches in the lower bay are more exposed to tides and waves increasing the groundwater discharge substantially anwar et al 2014 robinson et al 2018 furthermore the spatial trend of the sgd rates in the three embayments indicated that the significant role played by oceanic forcing was more substantial on a small scale the sgd rate of embayment iii was slightly lower than that of embayment ii this phenomenon may be ascribed to the accelerated artificial landforms in embayment iii that seriously threaten the aquifer liu 2017 geological geomorphological factors such as the narrow mouth and shortage of surface freshwater may also play a critical role in the sgd rate the relatively long water ages at 32 8 days in embayment iii also verified these influences the establishment of sgd at two different spatial scales is instructive for studying the groundwater environment at various scales and can also be valid for many other regions such as the tolo harbor in hong kong cheng et al 2020 and some river estuaries liu et al 2018 chen et al 2022 the sgd rates at multiple scales have demonstrated that anthropogenic constructions and ocean dynamics were key factors for the spatial variability of sgd however studies mediating mechanistic models to research the dynamics of sgd in similar ecosystems are limited a general understanding of the two mobilization mechanisms is necessary to determine the factors that play a predominant role in xsb care must be taken regarding the trajectory of these factors and may be observed in future studies 4 2 nutrient fluxes derived by sgd in the xsb channel and three embayments the nutrients in groundwater themselves are concerning but they can also impact the receptors surface water baseflow and groundwater dependent ecosystem and submarine freshwater discharge with consequences for coastal waters lee and kim 2007 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 santos et al 2021 groundwater is a vast and slowly changing nutrient store that plays a significant role in controlling nutrient dynamics and delivery the ratio of n p within nutrient sensitive ecosystems the sources of nutrients in groundwater include fertilizers owing to the intensification of agriculture and aquaculture atmospheric pollution and septic effluents a typical calculation method for determining sgd nutrient fluxes is by multiplying sgd flux by the concentration of the measured nutrients in the groundwater endmember slomp and van cappellen 2004 kim et al 2011 liu et al 2017c chen et al 2020 sgd derived nutrient rates were estimated by multiplying the average groundwater nutrient concentration μmol l 1 for each sub region of xsb xsb channel embayment i embayment ii embayment iii by the sgd rate cm d 1 for that sub region hwang et al 2005 moore et al 2006 chen et al 2018b zhang et al 2020a the sgd derived nutrient rates in the xsb channel were estimated to be 11 3 5 6 mmol m 2 d 1 0 08 0 04 mmol m 2 d 1 4 4 2 2 mmol m 2 d 1 1 1 0 5 mmol m 2 d 1 and 39 3 19 4 mmol m 2 d 1 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively table 3 the results were then systematically combined with extensive data from the literature to provide insights for evaluating the nutrient fluxes of the total river discharge the results indicated that nutrient concentrations in the river were comparable to those in the groundwater endmembers but the magnitudes of sgd derived nutrient fluxes were 1 2 orders higher than those of riverine inputs specifically the nutrient fluxes of sgd exceeded those of the total river discharge by factors of approximately 29 2 210 257 and 44 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively table 3 the sgd fluxes in embayments i and ii were slightly higher than those in the river fluxes but the magnitude of sgd derived nutrient fluxes exceeded that of the river fluxes by one order of magnitude the spatial difference of sgd and the corresponding nutrient fluxes with spatial and temporal variability showed that sgd played multiple roles in the local nutrient budget and ecosystem at different scales the sgd rates in the xsb channel were approximately three times higher than those in the other three embayments but the sgd derived nutrient rate in the xsb channel was comparable with those in the three embayments in addition sgd derived nutrient rate of no3 n in the xsb channel was significantly lower than that in embayments i and ii one possible reason is that aquaculture induced more nutrient loading into the coastal aquifers further influencing sgd nutrient concentrations with over 68 of the aquaculture industry concentrated in the three embayments tal et al 2017 kang et al 2019 liao et al 2019 in particular the nutrient concentrations in the three embayments were 1 4 5 times those in the xsb channel for no3 n and were comparable for the other nutrients such as dip and dsi in addition the shellfish culture was predominantly concentrated in embayments i and ii the fish cage culture was observed in embayment iii and the kelp culture was mostly farmed near the outside of embayment iii compared to shellfish farming fish cage farming produces more nutrient discharge into the marine environment liao et al 2019 however the specific conditions demonstrated that higher groundwater nutrient concentrations were observed in the oyster culture area than in the fish culture area the nutrient concentrations in the coastal groundwater in embayments i and ii which are characterized by a dense shellfish culture were 527 and 379 μmol l 1 for din 3 4 and 2 7 μmol l 1 for dip and 572 and 335 μmol l 1 for dsi respectively which were higher than those in embayment iii a general understanding is that the abundant nutrient loading from coastal wastewater originated from industrial and domestic wastewater through surface runoff such as the fx stream wastewater occurs concurrently with considerable contamination loading from cultivated land and sewer pipes particularly nutrient enrichment eventually more nutrients either in soluble or particle forms are discharged into coastal groundwater via surface pathways considerably enhancing nutrient concentrations of the groundwater in embayments i and ii and may exceed the direct influence of aquaculture liao et al 2019 to gain a clear understanding of the role of sgd fluxes on nutrients correlation analyses were conducted for the seawater of the entire xsb fig 4 these results further support our previous assumption that nutrients and tracers of sgd hotspots are positively correlated radium 226ra and 228ra and the four nutrient species no3 n no2 n dip and dsi were significantly positively correlated figs 2 and 4 this positive correlation indicated that the abundant nutrients and the radium isotopes had similar sources and were consistent with geochemical characteristics the negative correlations between radium and nh4 n that shifted between 2 1 and 4 6 μmol l 1 were likely due to the higher concentrations of other inputs and or the biochemical transformation process the higher concentration of nh4 n originated from benthic sediment through saline sgd entering the system or the substantial nh4 n in discharging groundwater was removed by nitrification with the subsequent oxidation of nh4 to no3 brooks et al 2021 numerous studies have demonstrated that the ecological environment of aquaculture is influenced by groundwater hwang et al 2005 taniguchi et al 2019 alorda kleinglass et al 2021 the results demonstrate the impact of sgd and the corresponding nutrients on xsb which is dominated by intensive aquaculture activities therefore sgd derived nutrients and marine aquaculture activities should be further explored endeavors that integrate multiple cooperative disciplines are also necessary for the management and improvement of the xsb ecological environment 4 3 environmental impact of sgd long term intensive economic aquaculture activities have also caused the challenging problems of pollution from nutrients as well as other contaminants that not only influence the marine environment but also trigger a potential risk to cultured seafood hu et al 2006 zhang et al 2020a peng et al 2021 in this study the din dip and dsi dip of 27 1 and 31 1 respectively for the surface seawater are higher than the typical redfield ratio c n si p 106 16 15 1 indicating a phosphate limited environment in xsb table s1 the distinctive nutrient structure significantly influences the phytoplankton size structure biomass and predominant species jiang et al 2019b the spatial trends and distributions of the nutrient inputs via sgd are critical factors in the occurrence of red tides in xsb wu et al 2013 in the last decade frequent red tide outbreaks coupled with phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity have increased with increasing nutrients and temperatures directly leading to the nutrient contamination in the cultured seafood jiang et al 2019a in addition numerous studies have revealed that phytoplankton biomass total chl a concentration in xsb is closely associated with nutrient concentrations particularly din and dip jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 liao et al 2019 a significant positive correlation was found between phytoplankton biomass and din and dip concentrations niencheski et al 2007 gonzález garcía et al 2018 jiang et al 2019b cheng et al 2020 phytoplankton biomass was positively and significantly correlated with a suitable ecosystem characterized by abundant nutrients a relatively lower din dip ratio and a higher dsi din ratio because of eco physiological trade offs jiang et al 2013 jiang et al 2019b in this study the sgd derived nutrient fluxes occupied the dominant sources in the nutrient budget since its abundant discharge and higher concentrations relative to other traditional sources such as riverine input and atmospheric deposition etc it is also vital to assess the potential effects of sgd on the ratios of din dip and dsi din in coastal areas which can influence the dominant types of phytoplankton growth the din dip ratio 95 in coastal groundwater is significantly higher than the requirements for phytoplankton growth din dip 16 with p in groundwater more efficiently immobilized than n slomp and van cappellen 2004 wu et al 2013 this is reasonable for an environment in which phosphate was the limiting factor in regulating the growth of fish and phytoplankton xsb is an important aquaculture region in china where the scale of cultured seafood production has peaked in the last decade however the accelerated development and extensive exploitation of aquaculture are deeply affected by nutrient pollution in coastal seawaters which in turn damages carrying capacity of aquaculture jiang et al 2013 liao et al 2019 in the presence of aquaculture xsb in ningbo has suffered frequent algal blooms in the last decade the ningbo government implemented integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta to reduce the input of anthropogenic nutrients and improve water quality the imta system is a cultivation system for aquatic species from different trophic levels within the same water body bostock et al 2010 serious actions were implemented to diversify marine aquaculture mitigate the environmental impacts of fish farming and provide compatible social and economic benefits and environmental stability bostock et al 2010 liao et al 2019 however reducing point nutrient sources did not prevent the occurrence of algal blooms in coastal areas where nutrient loading did not correlate well with the fluctuation of red tide events and phytoplankton biomass this unexpected phenomenon indicates that nutrient sources other than aquaculture such as groundwater loading nutrient input from the watershed and tidal exchange with nutrient enriched coastal waters may exacerbate the eutrophication of xsb wu et al 2013 liao et al 2019 consequently more endeavors that integrate aquaculture activities and other extraneous nutrient sources are urgently needed to further explore nutrient dynamics and prevent eutrophication and red tide outbreaks 4 4 response of global aquaculture bay of sgd and associated nutrient rates sgd has been shown to significantly impact marine aquaculture in various coastal ecosystems liu and du 2022 and numerous studies regarding sgd and associated nutrient in aquaculture bays worldwide have been conducted table 4 sgd was calibrated to provide the associated unit area for a convenient comparison at different scales sgd and the corresponding rates in coastal aquaculture bays vary considerably worldwide and range from 0 09 to 156 cm d 1 0 08 to 150 mmol m 2 d 1 0 to 10 5 mmol m 2 d 1 and 0 08 to 220 mmol m 2 d 1 for sgd din dip and dsi respectively in the context of previous studies sgd in this study is compared based on geo tracers with that of embayments and bays elsewhere the results of this study are consistent with the range of many other sgd estimations indicating the applicability of sgd in this study furthermore the difference in sgd based on different geo tracer models may reflect differences in the components originating from the water that supplies the geo tracers to the harbor luo and jiao 2016 the sgd rate in the xsb channel was comparable with those of gamak bay 8 12 cm d 1 and sanggou bay 13 15 cm d 1 and the nutrient rates in the xsb channel derived from sgd were comparable with those in bangdu bay and zhenzhu bay and higher than those in other regions high sgd and nutrient rates were generally closest to coastal regions classified as highly industrialized urbanized and agriculturalized the water quality deterioration and water eutrophication are attributable to the occurrence of red tides in xsb which is similar to that in daya and sanggou bays wang et al 2014 wang et al 2018a therefore the ecosystem structure and sgd in xsb should be considered jointly to manage environmental problems and predict red tide outbreaks endeavors that integrate physical chemical biological cooperative studies are necessary to further explore red tide outbreak mechanisms and protect aquaculture activities 5 summary sgd and the associated nutrients in xsb which is characterized by historically important aquaculture bays that are experiencing excessive urbanization were quantified during the winter of 2019 using a geo tracer model 226ra and 228ra mass balance model the average water ages based on the radium ratios were estimated as 17 8 days 32 8 days 19 6 days and 32 8 days for the xsb channel embayment i embayment ii and embayment iii respectively larger sgd flux magnitudes were observed in the xsb channel which were approximately two orders larger than those of the three embayments the sgd rates varied significantly with 11 0 5 5 cm d 1 3 6 1 0 cm d 1 5 7 1 7 cm d 1 and 5 2 1 5 cm d 1 in xsb channel embayment i embayment ii and embayment iii respectively the estimated sgd rates in the xsb channel were approximately three times higher than those in the three embayments and were comparable with those in gamak bay korea table 4 the sgd rates increased from the inner bay towards the ocean indicating that the ocean factor coupled with wave and tidal effects significantly promoted groundwater discharge however intensive urbanization underlying specific geographical characteristics also mediate sgd such as in embayment iii the sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the xsb channel were estimated as 5 3 2 6 106 mol d 1 3 7 1 8 104 mol d 1 2 1 1 0 106 mol d 1 5 1 2 5 105 mol d 1 and 1 9 0 9 107 mol d 1 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively the sgd driven nutrient fluxes in the xsb channel exceed those of the river discharge by factors of approximately 29 2 210 257 and 44 for no3 n no2 n nh4 n dip and dsi respectively the magnitude of sgd derived nutrient fluxes in the three embayments was more than one order greater than those of the river in addition the sgd derived nutrient rate in the xsb channel was comparable with that in the three embayments and significantly lower than that for the no3 n of embayments i and ii which may be ascribed to aquaculture activities and or anthropogenic disturbance by combining these results with previous literature data the sgd derived nutrients provided insights for studying the groundwater environment at various scales including the entire bay and the embayments as an extraneous nonpoint source the sgd derived nutrient rates in xsb are at a high level worldwide the relatively higher din dip ratio in coastal groundwater may strongly affect primary production and nutrient structure and cause algal blooms our results suggest that a new perspective regarding the correlation between sgd and aquaculture activities as well as urbanization is required for coastal ecosystems furthermore studies focusing on the predominant mechanism regulating the spatial variability of sgd should be conducted credit authorship contribution statement tong peng conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing review editing

3256,in a complex water rock system that contains clay or and organic matter and carbonates multiple factors can affect specific isotopic compositions or ratios of fluids such as the adsorption desorption ion exchange and dissolution precipitation of the related minerals in this situation the rayleigh model is inappropriate for simulating the pore fluid isotopic data and the ultimate mechanism causing isotopic fractionation has not yet been resolved besides the endmembers including concentration and isotopic composition ratio related to geochemical processes have not been well identified shale is enriched in clay and organic matter and usually contains carbonates comprehensive adsorption desorption and ion exchange occurs within a short time accordingly the flowback water following hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs is a unique material for studying the mechanism affecting the specific isotopic composition ratio lithium boron and strontium this study aims to investigate the mechanism of changes in the isotopic compositions ratios following the hydraulic fracturing of a shale gas reservoir by obtaining high quality flowback water determining all potential endmembers concentration and isotopic composition ratio for water soluble fraction exchangeable fraction and carbonate minerals and conducting laboratory water rock interactions to confirm the trends observed in the field the results indicated that desorption adsorption or and ion change was a critical factor controlling the concentration and isotopic compositions δ7li and δ11b and radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratios in this complex water rock system the contribution from the dissolution of carbonates to li b and sr in the flowback water beyond the mixing between fracturing water and formation water was estimated to be less than 16 desorption of b from shale would result in higher b cl ratios and changes in δ11b values of fluids rely on the exchangeable b in shale δ11b values decreased in this study another new finding demonstrates that the increased 87sr 86sr values of flowback water beyond mixing was inferred from the re equilibrium between the dissolved sr and exchangeable sr rather than dissolution of silicates with a high 87sr 86sr value which suggests a more complex process than previously expected while clay minerals or and organic matter are commonly distributed in groundwater systems the findings are also beneficial for tracing water rock interactions and the sources sinks of a specific solute in a groundwater system that may be impacted by adsorption desorption or and ion exchange keywords desorption adsorption isotopes flowback water hydraulic fracturing water rock interaction 1 introduction the solute isotopes such as lithium δ7li boron δ11b and strontium 87sr 86sr are commonly used to trace hydrogeochemical processes and water contamination because of the large isotopic variation of the potential sources cook and herczeg 2000 shand et al 2009 warner et al 2014 marschall and foster 2018 for example sea water and marine derived brines are characterized by high δ11b values typically from 40 to 60 and in contrast domestic wastewater with relatively high boron concentrations and relatively low δ11b values typically from 0 to 13 vengosh and spivack 2000 weathering of marine carbonates always results in a low radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratio of water typically less than 0 709 and weathering of continental silicates results in a relatively high ratio without evident isotopic fractionation during the dissolution of minerals mcnutt 2000 therefore spatial patterns in 87sr 86sr can be used to constrain the movement of groundwater and the changes in 87sr 86sr ratios along the flow path in different rocks can provide important information on the fluid flow rate johnson and depaolo 1994 however besides dissolution precipitation processes relatively rapid adsorption desorption or and ion exchange between solute and certain minerals can also influence the solute concentration and isotopic composition ratio of fluids in a water rock system that contains clay johnson and depaolo 1997 pennisi et al 2006 warner et al 2014 owen et al 2020 phan et al 2020 for example johnson and depaolo 1997 measured the radiogenic 87sr 86sr values of the whole rock and exchange extracts from a clay rich groundwater system and determined that the increases in 87sr 86sr of the groundwater sr along the flow paths were caused by the cation exchange with the exchangeable sr in the clays combined with the dissolution of minerals with relatively high 87sr 86sr values however in most studies the increase in the 87sr 86sr ratios of fluid is commonly interpreted as the dissolution of silicate minerals with relatively high 87sr 86sr ratios e g cui et al 2020 at present the information on solute isotopic fractionation associated with adsorption desorption or and ion exchange on clays or and organic matter is limited tipper et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 one of the most important reasons is a lack of accurate samples in field and information on potential endmembers especially the exchangeable component the exchangeable solutes on clay could vary largely due to different mineral composition hydrodynamic conditions and hydrochemical conditions in natural water rock systems fantle and tipper 2014 in addition in natural water rock systems the information on adsorption desorption or and ion exchange can be overwhelmed by dissolution precipitation of certain minerals due to relatively slow flow rate and small fraction of clay in most aquifers flowback water following hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs is unique material to study the mechanism impacting the solute isotopic compositions ratios of complex water rock systems due to clay and organic matter enriched in shale at present the role of water rock interactions especially the desorption and adsorption in the geochemical evolution of flowback water with respect to li δ7li b δ11b and sr 87sr 86sr remains unclear the decrease in the δ7li and δ11b values in the flowback water in the early stages were speculated to be derived from the desorption of shale warner et al 2014 phan et al 2020 phan et al 2020 measured the total concentration of the whole rock and of each fraction water soluble fraction exchangeable fraction and carbonate minerals of li b and sr however the isotopic compositions δ7li and δ11b and 87sr 86sr ratios of these endmembers were not measured to this end this study investigated the role of water rock interactions in the geochemical evolution of flowback water following hydraulic fracturing of a shale gas reservoir focusing on the role of desorption adsorption or and ion exchange in isotopic and chemical evolution of li b and sr by 1 obtaining high resolution flowback water data with hourly sampling during the early stages of flowback 2 simplifying the fracturing endmembers by using fresh water without any additives 3 determining all the potential endmembers in the laboratory that could impact water rock interactions not only concentration but also isotopic composition ratio and 4 analyzing the laboratory water rock interactions between deionized water fracturing water and shale samples from fracturing depth to confirm the field trend the first three measures were unique compared with previous evaluations while clay minerals or and organic matter are commonly distributed in most groundwater systems such as loess alluvium sandstone and siltstone aquifers the findings would be useful for tracing water rock interactions and sources of specific solutes in groundwater systems that could be impacted by adsorption desorption or and ion exchange tipper et al 2021 2 materials and methods 2 1 background for hydraulic fracturing fracturing water water mixed with small amounts of sand and additives is used to open existing and produce new fractures in the shale formation under high pressure typically 45 70 mpa to release natural gas which is called hydraulic fracturing king 2012 the fracturing fluid is composed of water more than 90 and multiple additives king 2012 after hydraulic fracturing the fluid flowing back to the surface to relieve the well pressure is called the flowback water and the produced water refers to the fluid that is co produced with the gas at the surface once the well is placed into production and may be present over the lifetime of the well vidic et al 2013 the in situ shale formation water refers to water produced at a later stage and has not been mixed with any fracturing water which commonly has high salinity with total dissolved solids tds of up to 10 times that of seawater 400 g l hayes 2009 kharaka et al 2020 bondu et al 2021 in this study we did not discriminate between flowback water and produced water which was collectively identified as flowback water increasing evidence has demonstrated that flowback water is a mixture of fracturing water and formation water and flowback water in the late stage is mostly derived from the formation water haluszczak et al 2013 birkle 2016 kondash et al 2017 owen et al 2020 2 2 principle for a specific solute of flowback water composed of x fracturing water and 1 x in situ formation water the specific solute concentration c derived only from the mixing of fracturing water with a concentration of c fr and formation water with a concentration of cfw can be obtained as follows 1 c x c fr 1 x c fw if c is the observed concentration of the flowback water a c c ratio larger than 1 would suggest that there were additional sources of water rock interactions such as dissolution of minerals desorption and ion exchange and a c c ratio less than 1 suggests that water rock interactions decreased the concentration in the flowback water such as precipitation of minerals adsorption and ion exchange for a specific isotopic composition ratio of the flowback water δ derived only from the mixing of fracturing water and formation water can be obtained as follows 2 δ δ fr x c fr δ fw 1 x c fw c where δfr and δfw are the isotopic compositions ratios of fracturing water and formation water respectively a comparison of δ and δ observed value of flowback water would also provide valuable information on the sources sinks of the specific solute beyond mixing to confirm the trend of the field flowback water changes in concentration and isotopic composition ratio and explore the water rock interactions following hydraulic fracturing the endmembers that would potentially impact water rock interactions were determined in the laboratory laboratory water rock interaction experiments were also conducted in parallel pure adsorption desorption or ion exchange is hardly observed in nature jørgensen 1989 and they are considered together because they share many common features couper et al 2005 therefore desorption adsorption was used in this study to represent both processes thereinafter 2 3 field experiment the field hydraulic fracturing experiment was introduced in our previous study huang et al 2020a which focused on the general geochemical evolution of flowback water and the potential oxidation of pyrite in the laboratory and field the target shale was the lower silurian longmaxi marine formation which was used for the current commercial production of shale gas in the sichuan basin sw china our team drilled a vertical shale gas well depth of 704 m for scientific research and fractured at a depth of 640 660 m on march 21 2019 using 500 m3 of surface water from a local stream that was stored in a water pond near the site without adding any additives this fracturing water had a relatively low salinity with tds of 0 49 g l and ph of 8 4 table s1 after hydraulic fracturing flowback was initiated on the 1st day of flowback the flowback water was sampled approximately every 2 h on the 2nd day two additional samples were obtained subsequently approximately daily sampling was conducted until the end of the flowback on the 38th day the volume of the cumulative water returned was 267 m3 the rock cores of the shale at the fracturing depth were also sampled after drilling was completed the field experiment was unique and of high value and the high quality flowback water samples following hydraulic fracturing were obtained in addition only fresh fracturing water was used to simplify the endmembers that could impact the water rock interactions during hydraulic fracturing 2 4 laboratory experiment a series of laboratory water rock interaction experiments were conducted to determine the endmembers for li b and sr concentrations and to confirm the field trend of concentrations and isotopic compositions ratios of the flowback waters the shale core sample from the fracturing depth was crushed and sieved to grain sizes of less than 74 μm using a sieve shaker then three endmembers water soluble exchangeable fraction on clay minerals or and organic matter and carbonate fractions that could potentially affect the flowback water were determined using the procedures basically described by phan et al 2015 and stewart et al 2015 however phan et al 2015 mainly focused on four fractions water soluble exchangeable sites on clay minerals or and organic matter carbonate minerals and oxidizable fraction for u ba and as because the oxidation process was not evident in the field huang et al 2020a oxidizable fraction was ignored in this study in this study isopropyl alcohol was used in some steps to remove the remaining fluids which could potentially impact the subsequent extraction the temperature for all the laboratory experiments was set to 28 c the measured reservoir temperature at the fracturing depth we did not vary the pressure in the experiments because of the inconsistency in pressure during hydraulic fracturing birdsell et al 2015 edwards and celia 2018 mcintosh and ferguson 2019 huang et al 2020a and the minimal impact of pressure on the wetness parameters harrison et al 2017 morel and hering 1993 zolfaghari et al 2019 1 li to measure the water soluble fraction of li a water rock ratio of 8 1 was achieved by adding 40 ml of deionized water to 5 g of the shale sample in a tube and shaking for 5 min after the reaction the tube was centrifuged at 4 500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the li in the supernatant solution was considered to be the water soluble fraction the shale was then washed using 40 ml of deionized water centrifuged and pulled out then 1 n i e 1 mol l of an ammonium chloride solution 40 ml adjusted to a ph of approximately 8 7 by adding ammonia to eliminate the possibility of carbonate dissolution was added with a fluid rock ratio of 8 1 and the solution was shaken for 4 h to desorb li from the shale sample and then centrifuged the li in this solution was considered to be the exchangeable fraction the solution in the remaining shale was removed by adding isopropyl alcohol shaken centrifuged and removed three times the shale sample was then transferred to a 500 ml beaker 100 ml of 0 5 n acetic acid was added a fluid rock ratio of 20 1 and the sample was shaken for 1 d and then centrifuged the li in the supernatant solution was considered to be the carbonate fraction the li concentrations and δ7li of all the solutions were measured for the endmember analyses 2 b the procedure for extracting b from the shale sample was similar to that for li a 1 n mannitol solution was used to desorb b ishikawa and nakamura 1990 xiao et al 1997 williams et al 2001 then 15 g of each new shale sample was placed into a centrifuge tube with 30 ml of deionized water with a water rock ratio of 2 1 to match our previous laboratory experiments huang et al 2020a and then shaken for 5 min 1 d and 7 d to study the processes that would impact the changes in concentration and isotopic composition ratio in addition 30 ml of fracturing water was reacted with 15 g of shale for 1 d after the reaction the tube was centrifuged at 4 500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the b concentrations and δ11b values of all the solutions were measured 3 sr the procedure for extracting sr from the shale sample was similar to that of li ammonium acetate 1 n was used to desorb sr johnson and depaolo 1997 capo et al 1998 phan et al 2015 after being dissolved in acetic acid the residue mainly silicates was washed three times using deionized water and then dried for the 87sr 86sr analyses then each new 15 g shale sample was placed into a centrifuge tube with deionized water 30 ml at a water rock ratio of 2 1 and then shaken for 5 min 1 d and 7 d to confirm the processes affecting the changes in concentration and isotopic composition ratio in addition 30 ml of fracturing water was reacted with 15 g shale for 5 min 6 h 1 d and 7 d after the reaction the tube was centrifuged at 4 500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the sr major cations ca mg na and k and 87sr 86sr for all the solutions were measured adsorption desorption experiments were conducted to study the potential impact of cation exchange on the sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr values to eliminate the impact of the dissolution of carbonates on the experiment an excess of 1 n hydrochloric acid solution was used to flush the shale sample to remove all the carbonates the sample was then rinsed more than 15 times using deionized water to ensure that the electrical conductivity and ph were close to those of deionized water then 4 g of the washed shale sample was placed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 40 ml of 1 n ammonium acetate at a fluid rock ratio of 10 1 and then shaken for 1 d the sr in the solution could be regarded as adsorbed sr in the washed shale sample additionally 4 g and 8 g of the washed shale samples were placed into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and equilibrated in fracturing water based on the method described by ockert et al 2013 fracturing water 40 ml for each run was exchanged 10 times by centrifuging the mixture and removing the supernatant before adding fresh fracturing water in the 11th run 40 ml of fresh fracturing water was added again with water rock ratios of 10 1 and 5 1 respectively and the mixture was constantly stirred at 150 rpm at 28 c for 24 h to guarantee chemical equilibration between the cations in the solution and cations adsorbed to the exchangeable sites of the clay minerals and organic matter after the adsorption experiments were completed a desorption experiment was conducted isopropyl alcohol was used to remove the fluids in the shale sample that remained after centrifugation each 30 ml for 5 times to eliminate their impact on the subsequent desorption experiment next 10 ml of 1 n ammonium acetate was used 4 times to desorb the sr in the shale samples finally 40 ml of the ammonium acetate solution was collected the sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr values of the ammonium acetate solution were measured and compared with those of fracturing water the change in the 87sr 86sr values during adsorption could then be determined δ solution shale 87sr 86srfracturing water 87sr 86srammonium acetate solution a nonequilibrium experiment was conducted to confirm the possible contribution of adsorbed sr to the flowback water in the field decarbonated shale samples 18 g were added to 36 ml of the flowback water water rock ratio of 2 1 in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and the solution was shaken at 28 c for 24 h after the reaction the tube was centrifuged at 4 500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the remaining shale was washed with isopropyl alcohol to remove any remaining fluids next 36 ml of 1 n ammonium acetate was used to desorb sr from the shale samples the sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr values for the reacted fracturing water and ammonium acetate solution were analyzed 2 5 analyses the

aliquot of each filtered water sample was dried and dissolved in 1 1 ml of 2 5 n hcl for sr separation chemistry the strontium was separated from the matrix using ag50w 12 cation exchange resin 200 400 mesh based on published methodologies li et al 2015 whole rock powders for sr isotopic analyses were dissolved in savillex teflon screw top capsule using hf hno3 hclo4 dissolution sr was separated using the classical two step ion exchange chromatographic method sr isotopes were measured using a thermofisher triton plus multi collector thermal ionization mass spectrometer tims at the institute of geology and geophysics chinese academy of sciences the whole procedure blank was lower than 250 pg for sr the isotopic ratios were corrected for mass fractionation by normalizing to 88sr 86sr 8 375209 the international standard sample nbs 987 was employed to evaluate instrument stability during the period of data collection the measured values for the nbs 987 sr standard were 87sr 86sr 0 710245 0 000021 n 8 2 sd respectively usgs reference material bcr 2 was measured to monitor the accuracy of the analytical procedures with the following results 87sr 86sr 0 705019 0 000012 the 87sr 86sr data of bcr 2 show good agreement with previously published data by the tims technique li et al 2016 3 results 3 1 field flowback water fracturing water had a low salinity tds of 0 49 g l with a tritium concentration of 9 8 tu and radiocarbon activity of 93 3 pmc i e modern water recharged since the 1950 s after hydraulic fracturing the flowback started and the tds cl and br concentrations increased rapidly and subsequently to more moderate levels huang et al 2020a on the 37th 38th day the flowback waters were tritium free and had low radiocarbon activities less than 6 5 pmc and high tds of 11 5 11 9 g l suggesting that the flowback water was paleowater that was not mixed with any fracturing water and could be considered as in situ formation water if the 3h free flowback waters at the end of flowback i e on the 37th 38th day were taken as the end member formation water then the mixing ratios can be estimated based on the two end members fracturing water and formation water using the two independent conservation tracers cl warner et al 2014 osselin et al 2018 huang et al 2020a and 3h the fraction of fracturing water in flowback water x can be obtained as follows 3 x c cl f r 1 x c cl f w c cl 4 x c 3 h f r 1 x c 3 h f w c 3 h where c cl fr was the cl concentration of fracturing water 12 5 mg l c cl fw was the cl concentration of formation water 4376 mg l c cl was the cl concentration of flowback water c3h fr was the 3h concentration of fracturing water 9 8 tu c3h fw was the 3h concentration of formation water less than 0 4 tu c 3h was the 3h concentration of flowback water respectively based on chloride mass balance the fraction of fracturing water in the flowback water was 100 within 0 2 d 97 80 from 0 2 to 1 d 71 after 1 2 d 48 after 4 d 30 after 10 d and 10 after 24 d fig 1 and table s1 because the chloride concentration in our shale sample was exceptionally low less than 35 mg kg the impact of cl dissolution on the fraction calculation was minor less than 0 7 the water isotope 3h was a tracer from the water itself therefore the results obtained from 3h can be used to calibrate these from cl the results showed that the fraction obtained using the water isotope 3h mass balance was close to that obtained using chloride fig 1 and table s1 3 1 1 li and δ7li the li concentration in fracturing water was extremely low with a value of 0 008 mg l than the high concentrations in the formation water samples 11 22 11 63 mg l table s1 fig 2 a based on the fractions of fracturing water and formation water in the flowback water the contributions of fracturing water and formation water to the li concentrations of the flowback water were determined table s1 in fig 2a the mixing line is the li concentration only derived from fracturing water and formation water the observed li concentrations were significantly higher than those derived from the mixing within 1 d suggesting that additional sources other than mixing contributed li to the flowback water fig 2a for example after 0 3 d the estimated concentration from mixing was only 0 38 mg l but the observed concentration in the flowback water was as high as 0 65 mg l suggesting that 0 27 mg l was added to the flowback water from a process other than mixing after 1 d of flowback the observed values were close to the mixing values with c c ratios of approximately 1 fig 2a the δ7li value of fracturing water was 27 0 within the variable values of aqueous li in the changjiang river watershed ranging from 7 to 43 wang et al 2015 and in global rivers ranging from 1 to 44 penniston dorland et al 2017 murphy et al 2019 steinhoefel et al 2021 and similar to the global average value of 23 huh et al 1998 the values for the formation water samples were both 17 3 table s1 there has been no δ7li value for the flowback water or formation water reported for the chinese shale for comparison with different marine shale reservoirs the δ7li value from the marcellus shale formation water ranged from 9 to 15 warner et al 2014 phan et al 2016 slightly lower than 17 3 obtained in this study the observed δ7li values of flowback water were consistent with the values from the mixing fig 2b suggesting that additional sources that contributed li to the flowback water had similar δ7li values to those of the mixture 3 1 2 b and δ11b the b concentrations in fracturing water was low 0 072 mg l than the high concentrations in the formation water samples 5 88 5 91 mg l table s1 fig 3 a based on the fractions of fracturing water and formation water in the flowback water the contribution of b from fracturing water and formation water to the concentration in the flowback water was determined and is presented in table s1 in fig 3a the mixing line is the b concentration which was derived only from fracturing water and formation water the results indicated that the observed b concentrations were significantly higher than those derived from mixing especially within 1 d for example at 0 4 d the estimated concentration from mixing was only 0 36 mg l but the observed concentration in the flowback water was as high as 1 50 mg l the results suggested that there were additional sources other than mixing that greatly contributed b to the flowback water beyond the mixing fig 3a after 10 d of flowback the observed values were similar to the mixing values with a c c of approximately 1 fig 3a the δ11b value of fracturing water was 8 1 which is within the boron isotopic composition of dissolved boron in large rivers with a wide range of values from 6 to 44 marschall and foster 2018 and in the main stream of the changjiang river ranging from 3 to 9 chetelat et al 2009 the values for the formation water samples were 28 5 29 4 within the range 22 5 33 5 from the deep formation waters flowback times greater than 400 d in the commercial production wells in the sichuan basin with the same reservoirs ni et al 2018 huang et al 2020b and close to the value from produced waters greater than 400 d from the marcellus shale that ranged from 29 5 to 30 1 phan et al 2020 the results demonstrated that the observed δ11b values of the flowback water deviated from the mixing values within 1 d the maximum difference between the mixture and observed values was as large as 3 6 at 0 8 d fig 3b suggesting that additional sources contributing b to the flowback water had different δ11b values compared with the mixture 3 1 3 sr and 87sr 86sr the sr concentration in fracturing water was low 0 87 mg l than the high concentrations in the formation water samples 5 39 5 67 mg l table s1 fig 4 a in fig 4a the mixing line is the sr concentration which was derived only from fracturing water and formation water the results demonstrated that the observed sr concentrations were significantly lower than those derived from mixing especially within 1 d and up to 10 d from 0 3 d to 0 8 d the estimated concentration from mixing was 1 02 1 36 mg l but the observed concentration in the flowback water was as low as 0 33 0 43 mg l suggesting 64 70 of the sr was removed all the flowback waters within 10 d were undersaturated with respect to sr containing minerals such as celestite and strontianite the 87sr 86sr value of fracturing water was 0 70745 the values for the formation water samples were 0 71681 0 71686 table s1 within the ranges 0 71663 0 72413 from the produced water flowback times greater than 400 d in the sichuan basin ni et al 2018 huang et al 2020b the results indicated that the observed 87sr 86sr values of the flowback water deviated from the mixing values fig 4b from 0 5 d to 1 1 d the estimated 87sr 86sr value was 0 70992 0 71366 however the observed values were 0 71362 0 71578 fig 4b which were significantly higher than the mixing values 3 2 endmembers and laboratory water rock interactions the organic rich shale sample was composed of quartz 39 3 plagioclase 6 6 carbonate 10 1 predominantly calcite pyrite 3 8 and clay minerals 40 2 with a total organic content of 3 4 huang et al 2020a the clay minerals were primarily composed of illite 72 and an illite smectite mixed layer 28 the mineral compositions at the fracturing depth are relatively homogeneous sui et al 2019 3 2 1 li and δ7li the li concentration of the shale sample was 24 70 mg kg with a δ7li value of 4 1 table 1 similar to values reported for other shales in the literature for example marcellus shale in the appalachian basin with the concentration ranging from 19 to 85 mg kg and with δ7li ranging from 2 3 to 4 3 phan et al 2016 and global shale samples with δ7li values ranging from 3 2 to 5 2 teng et al 2004 steinhoefel et al 2021 water soluble li accounted for 0 99 of the total li in the shale sample 0 24 mg kg with a δ7li value of 26 8 the concentration of exchangeable li was relatively higher 0 67 mg kg accounting for 2 70 with a δ7li value of 17 5 the li in the carbonates of the shale sample 0 86 mg kg had a similar isotopic composition 4 9 to that of the whole rock table 1 the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate fractions were compared with the values in the marcellus shale 0 60 mg kg 0 53 mg kg and 0 82 mg kg respectively phan et al 2020 and the water soluble fraction in our shale sample was relatively low 0 24 mg kg the three components had considerably different li isotopic compositions table 1 making it possible to determine the potential sources from the water rock interactions that contributed li to the flowback water following hydraulic fracturing 3 2 2 b and δ11b the δ11b composition of the whole rock was 3 2 table 2 which was more enriched than of the bedrock and soil samples from 5 9 to 4 2 from the shale hills located in central pennsylvania noireaux et al 2021 the concentration of water soluble b was 0 64 mg kg with a δ11b value of 14 9 the concentration of exchangeable b was 3 6 times higher 2 32 mg kg than the water soluble fraction with a δ11b value of 21 1 the b in the carbonates of the shale sample 4 20 mg kg had an isotopic composition of 18 4 table 2 the δ11b values for the exchangeable and carbonate fraction components were compared with the reported ranges of 13 16 for the desorbable component of marine sediments spivack et al 1987 and 10 23 for marine carbonate hemming and hanson 1992 vengosh and spivack 2000 the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate fractions were compared with the values in the marcellus shale 2 6 mg kg 2 3 mg kg and 4 0 mg kg respectively phan et al 2020 and the water soluble fraction in our shale sample was relatively low 0 64 mg kg during the shale deionized water interactions with time from 5 min to 7 d the b concentration and δ11b values both increased table 2 suggesting that b was released from the shale through desorption or the dissolution of carbonates here these two components were considered as integrated components as desorption dissolution if the b in the solution within 5 min was the water soluble fraction b concentration of 0 29 mg l and δ11b of 14 9 then the increased b could be regarded as the fraction from desorption dissolution the estimation indicated that the b from desorption dissolution had a δ11b value of 21 5 which was similar to the desorption fraction δ11b value of 21 1 during the shale fracturing water interaction for 1 d the b concentration increased from 0 03 mg l to 0 77 mg l and δ11b values increased from 8 1 to 18 6 with the same water rock ratio 2 1 if the additional b sources were from the soluble fraction and desorption then the estimated δ11b value of the solution f2 3 would be 18 3 which is extremely close to the measured value of 18 6 if the additional b sources were from the soluble fraction and dissolution of carbonates then the estimated δ11b value of the solution f2 3 would be 16 7 approximately 2 less than the measured value of 18 6 3 2 3 sr and 87sr 86sr the sr concentration of the whole rock was 148 mg kg with an 87sr 86sr value of 0 72315 table 3 the concentrations of the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate fraction were 0 66 mg kg 15 2 mg kg and 101 mg kg respectively with 87sr 86sr values of 0 72038 0 71803 and 0 71392 respectively the residue predominately silicates had a high 87sr 86sr value of 0 75402 table 3 the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate fractions were compared with the values in the marcellus shale 7 6 mg kg 43 mg kg and 52 mg kg respectively phan et al 2020 and the water soluble fraction in our shale sample was low 0 66 mg kg the sr associated with the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate components accounted for 79 of the total sr in the whole rock shale sample which was similar to the upper value of 77 obtained from the marcellus shale stewart et al 2015 phan et al 2018 the results also demonstrated that the exchangeable sr which was more mobile accounted for a significant part of the total sr 10 compared with the reported values of 31 48 in the callovian oxfordian clay samples in the paris basin france lerouge et al 2010 the 87sr 86sr value of the exchangeable sr was larger than that of carbonates which is consistent with the previous evaluation of the marcellus shale stewart et al 2015 and the callovian oxfordian clay in the paris basin france lerouge et al 2010 the exchangeable sr on the clay minerals or and organic matter had a high 87sr 86sr ratio ranging from 0 7103 to 0 7280 e g johnson and depaolo 1997 vengosh et al 2002 in addition the water soluble sr had the highest 87sr 86sr value among the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate components which is consistent with the previous evaluation of the marcellus shale stewart et al 2015 during the shale deionized water interactions over time from 5 min to 7 d the sr concentration increased from 0 33 mg l to 0 81 mg l but the 87sr 86sr values decreased from 0 72038 to 0 71946 table 3 during the shale fracturing water interactions over time from 5 min to 7 d the sr concentration firstly decreased from 0 96 mg l fracturing water to 0 76 mg l solution at 5 min then increased to 1 35 mg l 7 d unlike the sr concentration except for the initial solution 0 71926 following the interaction between fracturing water 0 70745 and shale at 5 min the 87sr 86sr values for the subsequent solution exhibited a decreasing trend over time table 3 and fig 5 however if the increased concentration was due to the dissolution of carbonates with an 87sr 86sr value of 0 71392 then the expected 87sr 86sr values would be lower than the observed values fig 5 if the increased sr content was forced to match the observed values the average 87sr 86sr value of the contributing sr would be 0 71808 fig 5 which is exceptionally similar to that of the exchangeable fraction with an 87sr 86sr value of 0 71803 table 3 the 1 n hydrochloric acid washed shale sample was free of water soluble and carbonate sr and was used to react with fracturing water the equilibrium experiment determined that during the adsorption of sr from the solution to the shale the 87sr 86sr value of the adsorbed sr on the shale 0 70803 0 70852 was approximately that of fracturing water 0 70745 table 4 with the δ solution shale of approximately 0 001 suggesting that sr isotopic fractionation was not evident during adsorption there was no water soluble sr or carbonate sr in the decarbonated shale sample then 1 n ammonium acetate was used to extract any adsorbed sr water rock ratio of 10 1 in the decarbonated shale sample the results indicated that sr was desorbed from the shale with a solution concentration of 0 23 mg l under the water rock ratio of 10 1 2 3 mg kg of shale and with an 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 71805 table 4 the 87sr 86sr ratio was consistent with the estimated value 0 71808 from the water rock interaction between deionized water or fracturing water and shale which caused an increase in the sr concentration and a smooth decrease in 87sr 86sr fig 5 and was near the measured exchange value 0 71803 table 3 during the nonequilibrium experiment water rock ratio of 2 1 the sr concentration decreased from 0 96 mg l of fracturing water to 0 21 mg l however the 87sr 86sr value increased from 0 70745 to 0 71162 suggesting that the additional contribution had a relatively high 87sr 86sr value 4 discussion oxidation could have occurred during the hydraulic fracturing period and continued to occur in the early stage of flow back phan et al 2020 which could induce the release of some trace elements however our previous study demonstrated that the oxidation of pyrite was not evident in these field flowback samples based on the isotopic composition δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 and element concentrations so4 and fe huang et al 2020a and even in commercial horizontal wells when a strong oxidizer such as persulfate breaker was used during hydraulic fracturing osselin et al 2019 therefore the release of li b and sr from the oxidation reduction reactions was ignored in this study for li the concentrations increased in the field flowback water within 1 d fig 2a four potential endmembers were presumed 1 water soluble with the δ7li of 26 8 2 water soluble and desorption with the δ7li of 20 determined using the concentration fraction in the shale 0 24 mg kg and 0 67 mg kg 3 desorption from the shale with the δ7li of 17 5 and 4 dissolution of carbonates with the δ7li of 4 9 table 1 the simulated results determined that the endmember of desorption was mostly consistent with the observed values fig 2b suggesting that desorbed li from the shale mainly contributed additional li to the flowback water however the simulated values also suggested that the dissolution of carbonates may have contributed a minor portion fig 2b if the simulated value was forced to fit the observed value the additional source beyond mixing would have a δ7li value of 15 5 simulated 5 fig 2b if this additional source was derived only from desorption and the dissolution of carbonates then the simulated results established that 84 li was from the desorption and 16 li was from the dissolution of carbonates the exchangeable li 0 67 mg kg of the shale sample accounted for 2 7 of the total li this exchangeable portion could be more easily desorbed into the solution compared with the dissolution of carbonate or silicate minerals with a water rock ratio of 2 1 desorbed li can contribute 0 34 mg l li in the solution whereas in the field flowback water the maximum increase in the li concentration was 0 27 mg l 0 3 d table s1 in field hydraulic fracturing the water rock ratios were believed to be exceptionally low for example estimated as 0 01 by renock et al 2016 which is lower than most laboratory water rock interaction experiments ranging from 0 01 to 23 paukert vankeuren et al 2017 pearce et al 2018 therefore desorption from shale could potentially contribute additional li to the flowback water for b the concentrations greatly increased in the field flowback water within 1 d fig 3a five potential endmembers were presumed 1 water soluble with the δ11b of 14 9 2 water soluble and desorption with the δ11b of 19 8 determined using the concentration fraction in the shale 0 64 mg kg and 2 32 mg kg 3 desorption from the shale with the δ11b of 21 1 4 dissolution of carbonates with the δ11b of 18 4 table 1 and 5 desorption and dissolution of carbonates with the δ11b of 20 7 determined using the fraction obtained from li 84 and 16 the simulated results indicated that the endmember of desorption was the closest to the observed values simulated 3 fig 3b suggesting that desorption of b from the shale contributed additional b to the flowback water however simulated 5 desorption and dissolution of carbonates also approximately fit the observed value fig 3b there were two possible reasons 1 dissolution of carbonates could indeed contribute a minor source for b in field flowback water or 2 the δ11b values for the endmember of desorption 21 1 and carbonates 18 4 were relatively similar based on the laboratory water rock interaction experiments with the fracturing water and shale samples section 3 2 2 desorption was a substantial source of b in the field flowback water this study did not support the viewpoint that the dissolution of silicates such as feldspar with δ11b from 30 1 to 10 2 induces a decrease in δ11b cui et al 2020 such conditions would significantly decrease the δ11b value in the field flowback water in this well which is inconsistent with the observed value fig 3b in addition the laboratory water rock interaction experiments with the deionized water fracturing water and shale demonstrated that the δ11b value increased from 8 1 to 18 6 due to desorption without the dissolution of carbonates or silicate minerals indeed the laboratory water rock interaction experiments with deionized water and shale indicated a minimal dissolution of silicate minerals with an increase in the al and si concentrations during the period of 2 min to 7 d huang et al 2020a however the limited dissolution of silicate minerals scarcely influenced the b concentration and isotopic compositions because the exchangeable b with a relatively high concentration 2 32 mg kg was more reactive during the water rock interactions the geochemical processes of sr in the field flowback are more complex first in the field there was comprehensive cation exchange during the water rock interactions following hydraulic fracturing zolfaghari et al 2016 huang et al 2020a during which ca was adsorbed on the exchangeable sites and na and k were desorbed sr and ca are geochemically similar in terms of ionic radius and ionic charge and can be substituted for each other in mineral lattices mcnutt 2000 therefore sr can be adsorbed on the exchange sites of shale which was confirmed by the 1 high cation exchange capacity of the shale sample 54 meq kg huang et al 2020a 2 laboratory fracturing water and original shale interactions from 0 96 mg l to 0 76 mg l with water rock ratio of 2 1 table 3 3 laboratory fracturing water and the decarbonated shale interactions from 0 96 mg l to 0 21 mg l with water rock ratio of 2 1 table 4 and 4 decrease in the sr concentrations from sources other than mixing in the field flowback water table s1 because there is a minimal sr isotopic fractionation during the cation exchange mcnutt 2000 also confirmed by laboratory adsorption experiments with the δ solution shale of approximately 0 001 pure adsorption from the solution to the shale following hydraulic fracturing cannot induce an increase in 87sr 86sr value beyond mixing the 87sr 86sr value of the carbonates in the shale was 0 71392 the dissolution of the shale carbonates would decrease the 87sr 86sr value of the flowback water beyond mixing fig 4b and laboratory solution table 3 which was opposite to the observed value this suggests that the contribution of carbonate dissolution to the solution field flowback water and fluids from laboratory water rock interactions was not evident our previous study demonstrated that there was indeed carbonate dissolution during the laboratory water rock interaction experiments which could potentially contribute additional sr huang et al 2020a however the contribution of sr from carbonate dissolution was estimated to be lower than 14 when fitting the observed 87sr 86sr values although the water soluble sr had a relatively high 87sr 86sr ratio 0 72038 the amount was only 4 of the exchangeable sr table 3 the dissolution of silicates was unlikely due to the short reaction time based on the findings from the laboratory results section 3 2 3 the increased 87sr 86sr value of flowback beyond mixing was inferred primarily from re equilibrium between the dissolved sr and exchangeable sr fig 6 confirmed by laboratory experiments using the decarbonated shale sample table 4 in the end the li b and sr desorbed from the shale were critical factors in increasing the li and b concentrations and changing the isotopic composition δ7li and δ11b and 87sr 86sr ratio of the flowback water following hydraulic fracturing table 5 this was primarily because the exchangeable fractions of li b and sr were sufficient in the rock samples the cation exchange is a very common geochemistry process in a water rock system containing clay or and organic matter appelo and postma 2005 weil and brady 2017 the order of strength of adsorption for selected cations is 5 al 3 sr 2 ca 2 mg 2 cs k nh 4 na li in our previous study huang et al 2020a we have shown very clear cation exchange between ca2 mg2 and na k for sr2 and li the adsorption and desorption can be considered as cation exchange as the same processes as the exchange between ca2 mg2 and na k 6 ca 2 mg 2 sr 2 2 na k li x ca mg sr x 2 2 na k li these processes resulted in decreases in sr2 concentration and increases in li concentration of flowback water for sr2 the subsequent isotopic re equilibrium between exchangeable sr on the shale and sr in water resulted in an increase in 87sr 86sr the exchangeable sr had a higher 87sr 86sr value though the sr isotope fractionation during cation exchange itself was not evident for b the desorption was evident both in the field and laboratory and was also reported in other studies e g warner et al 2014 phan et al 2020 however the information on detailed processes is little marschall and foster 2018 previous studies showed that during adsorption of boron onto clay minerals or and organic matter 10b trends to be preferential adsorbed resulting in 11b enrichment in the residual fluids i e higher δ11b values and lower b cl ratios spivack et al 1987 vengosh and spivack 2000 lemarchand et al 2005 this study showed that desorption of b would result in higher b cl ratios and changes in δ11b values of fluids rely on the exchangeable b in shale δ11b values decreased in this study in these cases some previously used ion ratios such as sr na ca na li cl and b cl warner et al 2014 harkness et al 2017 would be significantly affected by adsorption desorption or and ion exchange decrease in sr na and ca na and increase in li cl and b cl fig 7 although in the field hydraulic fracturing experiment of this study fresh water was used to fracture the shale rather than other fluids such as hydrochloric acid that are commonly added to industrial fracturing water to induce carbonate dissolution the geochemical processes identified in this study are useful and can occur in the field because of the substantial existence of clay and organic matter in the shale heller and zoback 2014 in addition the leachates can be considered to be a reasonable approximation of the hydraulic fracturing fluid interacting with shale for the majority of the hydraulic fracturing process stewart et al 2015 because the acid appears to be neutralized early and subsequent stages are carried out without adding more hydrochloric acid this study determined all the potential endmembers including concentration and isotopic composition ratio and conducted the corresponding laboratory experiments providing an example to study water rock interactions in detail 5 conclusions the combined evaluations of theunique field water rock interaction experiments detailed determination of the potential endmembers both for concentration and isotopic composition ratio and corresponding laboratory experiments have provided novel and detailed insights into the water rock interactions with respect to li b and sr following hydraulic fracturing of a shale gas reservoir the results emphasize the role of desorption adsorption or and ion exchange in controlling the concentration and isotopic compositions δ7li and δ11b and radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratios in this complex water rock system that contains clay or and organic matter and carbonate the contribution from carbonate dissolution to li b and sr concentrations in the flowback water beyond the mixing between fracturing water and in situ formation water was estimated to be less than 16 another new finding demonstrates that even if there is a general adsorption phenomenon resulting in a decrease in the solution concentration i e a specific solute has been adsorbed on the rock there is also an instantaneous desorption process during the reaction which could change the isotopic composition ratio of the solute leading a different interpretation for the mechanism of changes in solute isotopic compositions ratios this study showed that detailed studies on water rock interactions require the determination of all the possible endmembers including concentration and isotopic composition ratio that could impact the geochemical processes credit authorship contribution statement tianming huang conceptualization methodology

3256,in a complex water rock system that contains clay or and organic matter and carbonates multiple factors can affect specific isotopic compositions or ratios of fluids such as the adsorption desorption ion exchange and dissolution precipitation of the related minerals in this situation the rayleigh model is inappropriate for simulating the pore fluid isotopic data and the ultimate mechanism causing isotopic fractionation has not yet been resolved besides the endmembers including concentration and isotopic composition ratio related to geochemical processes have not been well identified shale is enriched in clay and organic matter and usually contains carbonates comprehensive adsorption desorption and ion exchange occurs within a short time accordingly the flowback water following hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs is a unique material for studying the mechanism affecting the specific isotopic composition ratio lithium boron and strontium this study aims to investigate the mechanism of changes in the isotopic compositions ratios following the hydraulic fracturing of a shale gas reservoir by obtaining high quality flowback water determining all potential endmembers concentration and isotopic composition ratio for water soluble fraction exchangeable fraction and carbonate minerals and conducting laboratory water rock interactions to confirm the trends observed in the field the results indicated that desorption adsorption or and ion change was a critical factor controlling the concentration and isotopic compositions δ7li and δ11b and radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratios in this complex water rock system the contribution from the dissolution of carbonates to li b and sr in the flowback water beyond the mixing between fracturing water and formation water was estimated to be less than 16 desorption of b from shale would result in higher b cl ratios and changes in δ11b values of fluids rely on the exchangeable b in shale δ11b values decreased in this study another new finding demonstrates that the increased 87sr 86sr values of flowback water beyond mixing was inferred from the re equilibrium between the dissolved sr and exchangeable sr rather than dissolution of silicates with a high 87sr 86sr value which suggests a more complex process than previously expected while clay minerals or and organic matter are commonly distributed in groundwater systems the findings are also beneficial for tracing water rock interactions and the sources sinks of a specific solute in a groundwater system that may be impacted by adsorption desorption or and ion exchange keywords desorption adsorption isotopes flowback water hydraulic fracturing water rock interaction 1 introduction the solute isotopes such as lithium δ7li boron δ11b and strontium 87sr 86sr are commonly used to trace hydrogeochemical processes and water contamination because of the large isotopic variation of the potential sources cook and herczeg 2000 shand et al 2009 warner et al 2014 marschall and foster 2018 for example sea water and marine derived brines are characterized by high δ11b values typically from 40 to 60 and in contrast domestic wastewater with relatively high boron concentrations and relatively low δ11b values typically from 0 to 13 vengosh and spivack 2000 weathering of marine carbonates always results in a low radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratio of water typically less than 0 709 and weathering of continental silicates results in a relatively high ratio without evident isotopic fractionation during the dissolution of minerals mcnutt 2000 therefore spatial patterns in 87sr 86sr can be used to constrain the movement of groundwater and the changes in 87sr 86sr ratios along the flow path in different rocks can provide important information on the fluid flow rate johnson and depaolo 1994 however besides dissolution precipitation processes relatively rapid adsorption desorption or and ion exchange between solute and certain minerals can also influence the solute concentration and isotopic composition ratio of fluids in a water rock system that contains clay johnson and depaolo 1997 pennisi et al 2006 warner et al 2014 owen et al 2020 phan et al 2020 for example johnson and depaolo 1997 measured the radiogenic 87sr 86sr values of the whole rock and exchange extracts from a clay rich groundwater system and determined that the increases in 87sr 86sr of the groundwater sr along the flow paths were caused by the cation exchange with the exchangeable sr in the clays combined with the dissolution of minerals with relatively high 87sr 86sr values however in most studies the increase in the 87sr 86sr ratios of fluid is commonly interpreted as the dissolution of silicate minerals with relatively high 87sr 86sr ratios e g cui et al 2020 at present the information on solute isotopic fractionation associated with adsorption desorption or and ion exchange on clays or and organic matter is limited tipper et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 one of the most important reasons is a lack of accurate samples in field and information on potential endmembers especially the exchangeable component the exchangeable solutes on clay could vary largely due to different mineral composition hydrodynamic conditions and hydrochemical conditions in natural water rock systems fantle and tipper 2014 in addition in natural water rock systems the information on adsorption desorption or and ion exchange can be overwhelmed by dissolution precipitation of certain minerals due to relatively slow flow rate and small fraction of clay in most aquifers flowback water following hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs is unique material to study the mechanism impacting the solute isotopic compositions ratios of complex water rock systems due to clay and organic matter enriched in shale at present the role of water rock interactions especially the desorption and adsorption in the geochemical evolution of flowback water with respect to li δ7li b δ11b and sr 87sr 86sr remains unclear the decrease in the δ7li and δ11b values in the flowback water in the early stages were speculated to be derived from the desorption of shale warner et al 2014 phan et al 2020 phan et al 2020 measured the total concentration of the whole rock and of each fraction water soluble fraction exchangeable fraction and carbonate minerals of li b and sr however the isotopic compositions δ7li and δ11b and 87sr 86sr ratios of these endmembers were not measured to this end this study investigated the role of water rock interactions in the geochemical evolution of flowback water following hydraulic fracturing of a shale gas reservoir focusing on the role of desorption adsorption or and ion exchange in isotopic and chemical evolution of li b and sr by 1 obtaining high resolution flowback water data with hourly sampling during the early stages of flowback 2 simplifying the fracturing endmembers by using fresh water without any additives 3 determining all the potential endmembers in the laboratory that could impact water rock interactions not only concentration but also isotopic composition ratio and 4 analyzing the laboratory water rock interactions between deionized water fracturing water and shale samples from fracturing depth to confirm the field trend the first three measures were unique compared with previous evaluations while clay minerals or and organic matter are commonly distributed in most groundwater systems such as loess alluvium sandstone and siltstone aquifers the findings would be useful for tracing water rock interactions and sources of specific solutes in groundwater systems that could be impacted by adsorption desorption or and ion exchange tipper et al 2021 2 materials and methods 2 1 background for hydraulic fracturing fracturing water water mixed with small amounts of sand and additives is used to open existing and produce new fractures in the shale formation under high pressure typically 45 70 mpa to release natural gas which is called hydraulic fracturing king 2012 the fracturing fluid is composed of water more than 90 and multiple additives king 2012 after hydraulic fracturing the fluid flowing back to the surface to relieve the well pressure is called the flowback water and the produced water refers to the fluid that is co produced with the gas at the surface once the well is placed into production and may be present over the lifetime of the well vidic et al 2013 the in situ shale formation water refers to water produced at a later stage and has not been mixed with any fracturing water which commonly has high salinity with total dissolved solids tds of up to 10 times that of seawater 400 g l hayes 2009 kharaka et al 2020 bondu et al 2021 in this study we did not discriminate between flowback water and produced water which was collectively identified as flowback water increasing evidence has demonstrated that flowback water is a mixture of fracturing water and formation water and flowback water in the late stage is mostly derived from the formation water haluszczak et al 2013 birkle 2016 kondash et al 2017 owen et al 2020 2 2 principle for a specific solute of flowback water composed of x fracturing water and 1 x in situ formation water the specific solute concentration c derived only from the mixing of fracturing water with a concentration of c fr and formation water with a concentration of cfw can be obtained as follows 1 c x c fr 1 x c fw if c is the observed concentration of the flowback water a c c ratio larger than 1 would suggest that there were additional sources of water rock interactions such as dissolution of minerals desorption and ion exchange and a c c ratio less than 1 suggests that water rock interactions decreased the concentration in the flowback water such as precipitation of minerals adsorption and ion exchange for a specific isotopic composition ratio of the flowback water δ derived only from the mixing of fracturing water and formation water can be obtained as follows 2 δ δ fr x c fr δ fw 1 x c fw c where δfr and δfw are the isotopic compositions ratios of fracturing water and formation water respectively a comparison of δ and δ observed value of flowback water would also provide valuable information on the sources sinks of the specific solute beyond mixing to confirm the trend of the field flowback water changes in concentration and isotopic composition ratio and explore the water rock interactions following hydraulic fracturing the endmembers that would potentially impact water rock interactions were determined in the laboratory laboratory water rock interaction experiments were also conducted in parallel pure adsorption desorption or ion exchange is hardly observed in nature jørgensen 1989 and they are considered together because they share many common features couper et al 2005 therefore desorption adsorption was used in this study to represent both processes thereinafter 2 3 field experiment the field hydraulic fracturing experiment was introduced in our previous study huang et al 2020a which focused on the general geochemical evolution of flowback water and the potential oxidation of pyrite in the laboratory and field the target shale was the lower silurian longmaxi marine formation which was used for the current commercial production of shale gas in the sichuan basin sw china our team drilled a vertical shale gas well depth of 704 m for scientific research and fractured at a depth of 640 660 m on march 21 2019 using 500 m3 of surface water from a local stream that was stored in a water pond near the site without adding any additives this fracturing water had a relatively low salinity with tds of 0 49 g l and ph of 8 4 table s1 after hydraulic fracturing flowback was initiated on the 1st day of flowback the flowback water was sampled approximately every 2 h on the 2nd day two additional samples were obtained subsequently approximately daily sampling was conducted until the end of the flowback on the 38th day the volume of the cumulative water returned was 267 m3 the rock cores of the shale at the fracturing depth were also sampled after drilling was completed the field experiment was unique and of high value and the high quality flowback water samples following hydraulic fracturing were obtained in addition only fresh fracturing water was used to simplify the endmembers that could impact the water rock interactions during hydraulic fracturing 2 4 laboratory experiment a series of laboratory water rock interaction experiments were conducted to determine the endmembers for li b and sr concentrations and to confirm the field trend of concentrations and isotopic compositions ratios of the flowback waters the shale core sample from the fracturing depth was crushed and sieved to grain sizes of less than 74 μm using a sieve shaker then three endmembers water soluble exchangeable fraction on clay minerals or and organic matter and carbonate fractions that could potentially affect the flowback water were determined using the procedures basically described by phan et al 2015 and stewart et al 2015 however phan et al 2015 mainly focused on four fractions water soluble exchangeable sites on clay minerals or and organic matter carbonate minerals and oxidizable fraction for u ba and as because the oxidation process was not evident in the field huang et al 2020a oxidizable fraction was ignored in this study in this study isopropyl alcohol was used in some steps to remove the remaining fluids which could potentially impact the subsequent extraction the temperature for all the laboratory experiments was set to 28 c the measured reservoir temperature at the fracturing depth we did not vary the pressure in the experiments because of the inconsistency in pressure during hydraulic fracturing birdsell et al 2015 edwards and celia 2018 mcintosh and ferguson 2019 huang et al 2020a and the minimal impact of pressure on the wetness parameters harrison et al 2017 morel and hering 1993 zolfaghari et al 2019 1 li to measure the water soluble fraction of li a water rock ratio of 8 1 was achieved by adding 40 ml of deionized water to 5 g of the shale sample in a tube and shaking for 5 min after the reaction the tube was centrifuged at 4 500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the li in the supernatant solution was considered to be the water soluble fraction the shale was then washed using 40 ml of deionized water centrifuged and pulled out then 1 n i e 1 mol l of an ammonium chloride solution 40 ml adjusted to a ph of approximately 8 7 by adding ammonia to eliminate the possibility of carbonate dissolution was added with a fluid rock ratio of 8 1 and the solution was shaken for 4 h to desorb li from the shale sample and then centrifuged the li in this solution was considered to be the exchangeable fraction the solution in the remaining shale was removed by adding isopropyl alcohol shaken centrifuged and removed three times the shale sample was then transferred to a 500 ml beaker 100 ml of 0 5 n acetic acid was added a fluid rock ratio of 20 1 and the sample was shaken for 1 d and then centrifuged the li in the supernatant solution was considered to be the carbonate fraction the li concentrations and δ7li of all the solutions were measured for the endmember analyses 2 b the procedure for extracting b from the shale sample was similar to that for li a 1 n mannitol solution was used to desorb b ishikawa and nakamura 1990 xiao et al 1997 williams et al 2001 then 15 g of each new shale sample was placed into a centrifuge tube with 30 ml of deionized water with a water rock ratio of 2 1 to match our previous laboratory experiments huang et al 2020a and then shaken for 5 min 1 d and 7 d to study the processes that would impact the changes in concentration and isotopic composition ratio in addition 30 ml of fracturing water was reacted with 15 g of shale for 1 d after the reaction the tube was centrifuged at 4 500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the b concentrations and δ11b values of all the solutions were measured 3 sr the procedure for extracting sr from the shale sample was similar to that of li ammonium acetate 1 n was used to desorb sr johnson and depaolo 1997 capo et al 1998 phan et al 2015 after being dissolved in acetic acid the residue mainly silicates was washed three times using deionized water and then dried for the 87sr 86sr analyses then each new 15 g shale sample was placed into a centrifuge tube with deionized water 30 ml at a water rock ratio of 2 1 and then shaken for 5 min 1 d and 7 d to confirm the processes affecting the changes in concentration and isotopic composition ratio in addition 30 ml of fracturing water was reacted with 15 g shale for 5 min 6 h 1 d and 7 d after the reaction the tube was centrifuged at 4 500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the sr major cations ca mg na and k and 87sr 86sr for all the solutions were measured adsorption desorption experiments were conducted to study the potential impact of cation exchange on the sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr values to eliminate the impact of the dissolution of carbonates on the experiment an excess of 1 n hydrochloric acid solution was used to flush the shale sample to remove all the carbonates the sample was then rinsed more than 15 times using deionized water to ensure that the electrical conductivity and ph were close to those of deionized water then 4 g of the washed shale sample was placed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 40 ml of 1 n ammonium acetate at a fluid rock ratio of 10 1 and then shaken for 1 d the sr in the solution could be regarded as adsorbed sr in the washed shale sample additionally 4 g and 8 g of the washed shale samples were placed into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and equilibrated in fracturing water based on the method described by ockert et al 2013 fracturing water 40 ml for each run was exchanged 10 times by centrifuging the mixture and removing the supernatant before adding fresh fracturing water in the 11th run 40 ml of fresh fracturing water was added again with water rock ratios of 10 1 and 5 1 respectively and the mixture was constantly stirred at 150 rpm at 28 c for 24 h to guarantee chemical equilibration between the cations in the solution and cations adsorbed to the exchangeable sites of the clay minerals and organic matter after the adsorption experiments were completed a desorption experiment was conducted isopropyl alcohol was used to remove the fluids in the shale sample that remained after centrifugation each 30 ml for 5 times to eliminate their impact on the subsequent desorption experiment next 10 ml of 1 n ammonium acetate was used 4 times to desorb the sr in the shale samples finally 40 ml of the ammonium acetate solution was collected the sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr values of the ammonium acetate solution were measured and compared with those of fracturing water the change in the 87sr 86sr values during adsorption could then be determined δ solution shale 87sr 86srfracturing water 87sr 86srammonium acetate solution a nonequilibrium experiment was conducted to confirm the possible contribution of adsorbed sr to the flowback water in the field decarbonated shale samples 18 g were added to 36 ml of the flowback water water rock ratio of 2 1 in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and the solution was shaken at 28 c for 24 h after the reaction the tube was centrifuged at 4 500 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was filtered through 0 45 μm filters the remaining shale was washed with isopropyl alcohol to remove any remaining fluids next 36 ml of 1 n ammonium acetate was used to desorb sr from the shale samples the sr concentrations and 87sr 86sr values for the reacted fracturing water and ammonium acetate solution were analyzed 2 5 analyses the major cations na k ca and mg were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 5300dv perkin elmer and the elements li b and sr were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms element xr thermo fisher at the beijing research institute of uranium geology the li isotopic compositions of the rock solution samples from the laboratory

aliquot of each filtered water sample was dried and dissolved in 1 1 ml of 2 5 n hcl for sr separation chemistry the strontium was separated from the matrix using ag50w 12 cation exchange resin 200 400 mesh based on published methodologies li et al 2015 whole rock powders for sr isotopic analyses were dissolved in savillex teflon screw top capsule using hf hno3 hclo4 dissolution sr was separated using the classical two step ion exchange chromatographic method sr isotopes were measured using a thermofisher triton plus multi collector thermal ionization mass spectrometer tims at the institute

86sr data of bcr 2 show good agreement with previously published data by the tims technique li et al 2016 3 results 3 1 field flowback water fracturing water had a low salinity tds of 0 49 g l with a tritium concentration of 9 8 tu and radiocarbon activity of 93 3 pmc i e modern water recharged since the 1950 s after hydraulic fracturing the flowback started and the tds cl and br concentrations increased rapidly and subsequently to more moderate levels huang et al 2020a on the 37th 38th day the flowback waters were tritium free and had low radiocarbon activities less than 6 5 pmc and high tds of 11 5 11 9 g l suggesting that the flowback water was paleowater that was not mixed with any fracturing water and could be considered as in situ formation water if the 3h free flowback waters at the end of flowback i e on the 37th 38th day were taken as the end member formation water then the mixing ratios can be estimated based on the two end members fracturing water and formation water using the two independent conservation tracers cl warner et al 2014 osselin et al 2018 huang et al 2020a and 3h the fraction of fracturing water in flowback water x can be obtained as follows 3 x c cl f r 1 x c cl f w c cl 4 x c 3 h f r 1 x c 3 h f w c 3 h where c cl fr was the cl concentration of fracturing water 12 5 mg l c cl fw was the cl concentration of formation water 4376 mg l c cl was the cl concentration of flowback water c3h fr was the 3h concentration of fracturing water 9 8 tu c3h fw was the 3h concentration of formation water less than 0 4 tu c 3h was the 3h concentration of flowback water respectively based on chloride mass balance the fraction of fracturing water in the flowback water was 100 within 0 2 d 97 80 from 0 2 to 1 d 71 after 1 2 d 48 after 4 d 30 after 10 d and 10 after 24 d fig 1 and table s1 because the chloride concentration in our shale sample was exceptionally low less than 35 mg kg the impact of cl dissolution on the fraction calculation was minor less than 0 7 the water isotope 3h was a tracer from the water itself therefore the results obtained from 3h can be used to calibrate these from cl the results showed that the fraction obtained using the water isotope 3h mass balance was close to that obtained using chloride fig 1 and table s1 3 1 1 li and δ7li the li concentration in fracturing water was extremely low with a value of 0 008 mg l than the high concentrations in the formation water samples 11 22 11 63 mg l table s1 fig 2 a based on the fractions of fracturing water and formation water in the flowback water the contributions of fracturing water and formation water to the li concentrations of the flowback water were determined table s1 in fig 2a the mixing line is the li concentration only derived from fracturing water and formation water the observed li concentrations were significantly higher than those derived from the mixing within 1 d suggesting that additional sources other than mixing contributed li to the flowback water fig 2a for example after 0 3 d the estimated concentration from mixing was only 0 38 mg l but the observed concentration in the flowback water was as high as 0 65 mg l suggesting that 0 27 mg l was added to the flowback water from a process other than mixing after 1 d of flowback the observed values were close to the mixing values with c c ratios of approximately 1 fig 2a the δ7li value of fracturing water was 27 0 within the variable values of aqueous li in the changjiang river watershed ranging from 7 to 43 wang et al 2015 and in global rivers ranging from 1 to 44 penniston dorland et al 2017 murphy et al 2019 steinhoefel et al 2021 and similar to the global average value of 23 huh et al 1998 the values for the formation water samples were both 17 3 table s1 there has been no δ7li value for the flowback water or formation water reported for the chinese shale for comparison with different marine shale reservoirs the δ7li value from the marcellus shale formation water ranged from 9 to 15 warner et al 2014 phan et al 2016 slightly lower than 17 3 obtained in this study the observed δ7li values of flowback water were consistent with the values from the mixing fig 2b suggesting that additional sources that contributed li to the flowback water had similar δ7li values to those of the mixture 3 1 2 b and δ11b the b concentrations in fracturing water was low 0 072 mg l than the high concentrations in the formation water samples 5 88 5 91 mg l table s1 fig 3 a based on the fractions of fracturing water and formation water in the flowback water the contribution of b from fracturing water and formation water to the concentration in the flowback water was determined and is presented in table s1 in fig 3a the mixing line is the b concentration which was derived only from fracturing water and formation water the results indicated that the observed b concentrations were significantly higher than those derived from mixing especially within 1 d for example at 0 4 d the estimated concentration from mixing was only 0 36 mg l but the observed concentration in the flowback water was as high as 1 50 mg l the results suggested that there were additional sources other than mixing that greatly contributed b to the flowback water beyond the mixing fig 3a after 10 d of flowback the observed values were similar to the mixing values with a c c of approximately 1 fig 3a the δ11b value of fracturing water was 8 1 which is within the boron isotopic composition of dissolved boron in large rivers with a wide range of values from 6 to 44 marschall and foster 2018 and in the main stream of the changjiang river ranging from 3 to 9 chetelat et al 2009 the values for the formation water samples were 28 5 29 4 within the range 22 5 33 5 from the deep formation waters flowback times greater than 400 d in the commercial production wells in the sichuan basin with the same reservoirs ni et al 2018 huang et al 2020b and close to the value from produced waters greater than 400 d from the marcellus shale that ranged from 29 5 to 30 1 phan et al 2020 the results demonstrated that the observed δ11b values of the flowback water deviated from the mixing values within 1 d the maximum difference between the mixture and observed values was as large as 3 6 at 0 8 d fig 3b suggesting that additional sources contributing b to the flowback water had different δ11b values compared with the mixture 3 1 3 sr and 87sr 86sr the sr concentration in fracturing water was low 0 87 mg l than the high concentrations in the formation water samples 5 39 5 67 mg l table s1 fig 4 a in fig 4a the mixing line is the sr concentration which was derived only from fracturing water and formation water the results demonstrated that the observed sr concentrations were significantly lower than those derived from mixing especially within 1 d and up to 10 d from 0 3 d to 0 8 d the estimated concentration from mixing was 1 02 1 36 mg l but the observed concentration in the flowback water was as low as 0 33 0 43 mg l suggesting 64 70 of the sr was removed all the flowback waters within 10 d were undersaturated with respect to sr containing minerals such as celestite and strontianite the 87sr 86sr value of fracturing water was 0 70745 the values for the formation water samples were 0 71681 0 71686 table s1 within the ranges 0 71663 0 72413 from the produced water flowback times greater than 400 d in the sichuan basin ni et al 2018 huang et al 2020b the results indicated that the observed 87sr 86sr values of the flowback water deviated from the mixing values fig 4b from 0 5 d to 1 1 d the estimated 87sr 86sr value was 0 70992 0 71366 however the observed values were 0 71362 0 71578 fig 4b which were significantly higher than the mixing values 3 2 endmembers and laboratory water rock interactions the organic rich shale sample was composed of quartz 39 3 plagioclase 6 6 carbonate 10 1 predominantly calcite pyrite 3 8 and clay minerals 40 2 with a total organic content of 3 4 huang et al 2020a the clay minerals were primarily composed of illite 72 and an illite smectite mixed layer 28 the mineral compositions at the fracturing depth are relatively homogeneous sui et al 2019 3 2 1 li and δ7li the li concentration of the shale sample was 24 70 mg kg with a δ7li value of 4 1 table 1 similar to values reported for other shales in the literature for example marcellus shale in the appalachian basin with the concentration ranging from 19 to 85 mg kg and with δ7li ranging from 2 3 to 4 3 phan et al 2016 and global shale samples with δ7li values ranging from 3 2 to 5 2 teng et al 2004 steinhoefel et al 2021 water soluble li accounted for 0 99 of the total li in the shale sample 0 24 mg kg with a δ7li value of 26 8 the concentration of exchangeable li was relatively higher 0 67 mg kg accounting for 2 70 with a δ7li value of 17 5 the li in the carbonates of the shale sample 0 86 mg kg had a similar isotopic composition 4 9 to that of the whole rock table 1 the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate fractions were compared with the values in the marcellus shale 0 60 mg kg 0 53 mg kg and 0 82 mg kg respectively phan et al 2020 and the water soluble fraction in our shale sample was relatively low 0 24 mg kg the three components had considerably different li isotopic compositions table 1 making it possible to determine the potential sources from the water rock interactions that contributed li to the flowback water following hydraulic fracturing 3 2 2 b and δ11b the δ11b composition of the whole rock was 3 2 table 2 which was more enriched than of the bedrock and soil samples from 5 9 to 4 2 from the shale hills located in central pennsylvania noireaux et al 2021 the concentration of water soluble b was 0 64 mg kg with a δ11b value of 14 9 the concentration of exchangeable b was 3 6 times higher 2 32 mg kg than the water soluble fraction with a δ11b value of 21 1 the b in the carbonates of the shale sample 4 20 mg kg had an isotopic composition of 18 4 table 2 the δ11b values for the exchangeable and carbonate fraction components were compared with the reported ranges of 13 16 for the desorbable component of marine sediments spivack et al 1987 and 10 23 for marine carbonate hemming and hanson 1992 vengosh and spivack 2000 the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate fractions were compared with the values in the marcellus shale 2 6 mg kg 2 3 mg kg and 4 0 mg kg respectively phan et al 2020 and the water soluble fraction in our shale sample was relatively low 0 64 mg kg during the shale deionized water interactions with time from 5 min to 7 d the b concentration and δ11b values both increased table 2 suggesting that b was released from the shale through desorption or the dissolution of carbonates here these two components were considered as integrated components as desorption dissolution if the b in the solution within 5 min was the water soluble fraction b concentration of 0 29 mg l and δ11b of 14 9 then the increased b could be regarded as the fraction from desorption dissolution the estimation indicated that the b from desorption dissolution had a δ11b value of 21 5 which was similar to the desorption fraction δ11b value of 21 1 during the shale fracturing water interaction for 1 d the b concentration increased from 0 03 mg l to 0 77 mg l and δ11b values increased from 8 1 to 18 6 with the same water rock ratio 2 1 if the additional b sources were from the soluble fraction and desorption then the estimated δ11b value of the solution f2 3 would be 18 3 which is extremely close to the measured value of 18 6 if the additional b sources were from the soluble fraction and dissolution of carbonates then the estimated δ11b value of the solution f2 3 would be 16 7 approximately 2 less than the measured value of 18 6 3 2 3 sr and 87sr 86sr the sr concentration of the whole rock was 148 mg kg with an 87sr 86sr value of 0 72315 table 3 the concentrations of the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate fraction were 0 66 mg kg 15 2 mg kg and 101 mg kg respectively with 87sr 86sr values of 0 72038 0 71803 and 0 71392 respectively the residue predominately silicates had a high 87sr 86sr value of 0 75402 table 3 the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate fractions were compared with the values in the marcellus shale 7 6 mg kg 43 mg kg and 52 mg kg respectively phan et al 2020 and the water soluble fraction in our shale sample was low 0 66 mg kg the sr associated with the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate components accounted for 79 of the total sr in the whole rock shale sample which was similar to the upper value of 77 obtained from the marcellus shale stewart et al 2015 phan et al 2018 the results also demonstrated that the exchangeable sr which was more mobile accounted for a significant part of the total sr 10 compared with the reported values of 31 48 in the callovian oxfordian clay samples in the paris basin france lerouge et al 2010 the 87sr 86sr value of the exchangeable sr was larger than that of carbonates which is consistent with the previous evaluation of the marcellus shale stewart et al 2015 and the callovian oxfordian clay in the paris basin france lerouge et al 2010 the exchangeable sr on the clay minerals or and organic matter had a high 87sr 86sr ratio ranging from 0 7103 to 0 7280 e g johnson and depaolo 1997 vengosh et al 2002 in addition the water soluble sr had the highest 87sr 86sr value among the water soluble exchangeable and carbonate components which is consistent with the previous evaluation of the marcellus shale stewart et al 2015 during the shale deionized water interactions over time from 5 min to 7 d the sr concentration increased from 0 33 mg l to 0 81 mg l but the 87sr 86sr values decreased from 0 72038 to 0 71946 table 3 during the shale fracturing water interactions over time from 5 min to 7 d the sr concentration firstly decreased from 0 96 mg l fracturing water to 0 76 mg l solution at 5 min then increased to 1 35 mg l 7 d unlike the sr concentration except for the initial solution 0 71926 following the interaction between fracturing water 0 70745 and shale at 5 min the 87sr 86sr values for the subsequent solution exhibited a decreasing trend over time table 3 and fig 5 however if the increased concentration was due to the dissolution of carbonates with an 87sr 86sr value of 0 71392 then the expected 87sr 86sr values would be lower than the observed values fig 5 if the increased sr content was forced to match the observed values the average 87sr 86sr value of the contributing sr would be 0 71808 fig 5 which is exceptionally similar to that of the exchangeable fraction with an 87sr 86sr value of 0 71803 table 3 the 1 n hydrochloric acid washed shale sample was free of water soluble and carbonate sr and was used to react with fracturing water the equilibrium experiment determined that during the adsorption of sr from the solution to the shale the 87sr 86sr value of the adsorbed sr on the shale 0 70803 0 70852 was approximately that of fracturing water 0 70745 table 4 with the δ solution shale of approximately 0 001 suggesting that sr isotopic fractionation was not evident during adsorption there was no water soluble sr or carbonate sr in the decarbonated shale sample then 1 n ammonium acetate was used to extract any adsorbed sr water rock ratio of 10 1 in the decarbonated shale sample the results indicated that sr was desorbed from the shale with a solution concentration of 0 23 mg l under the water rock ratio of 10 1 2 3 mg kg of shale and with an 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 71805 table 4 the 87sr 86sr ratio was consistent with the estimated value 0 71808 from the water rock interaction between deionized water or fracturing water and shale which caused an increase in the sr concentration and a smooth decrease in 87sr 86sr fig 5 and was near the measured exchange value 0 71803 table 3 during the nonequilibrium experiment water rock ratio of 2 1 the sr concentration decreased from 0 96 mg l of fracturing water to 0 21 mg l however the 87sr 86sr value increased from 0 70745 to 0 71162 suggesting that the additional contribution had a relatively high 87sr 86sr value 4 discussion oxidation could have occurred during the hydraulic fracturing period and continued to occur in the early stage of flow back phan et al 2020 which could induce the release of some trace elements however our previous study demonstrated that the oxidation of pyrite was not evident in these field flowback samples based on the isotopic composition δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 and element concentrations so4 and fe huang et al 2020a and even in commercial horizontal wells when a strong oxidizer such as persulfate breaker was used during hydraulic fracturing osselin et al 2019 therefore the release of li b and sr from the oxidation reduction reactions was ignored in this study for li the concentrations increased in the field flowback water within 1 d fig 2a four potential endmembers were presumed 1 water soluble with the δ7li of 26 8 2 water soluble and desorption with the δ7li of 20 determined using the concentration fraction in the shale 0 24 mg kg and 0 67 mg kg 3 desorption from the shale with the δ7li of 17 5 and 4 dissolution of carbonates with the δ7li of 4 9 table 1 the simulated results determined that the endmember of desorption was mostly consistent with the observed values fig 2b suggesting that desorbed li from the shale mainly contributed additional li to the flowback water however the simulated values also suggested that the dissolution of carbonates may have contributed a minor portion fig 2b if the simulated value was forced to fit the observed value the additional source beyond mixing would have a δ7li value of 15 5 simulated 5 fig 2b if this additional source was derived only from desorption and the dissolution of carbonates then the simulated results established that 84 li was from the desorption and 16 li was from the dissolution of carbonates the exchangeable li 0 67 mg kg of the shale sample accounted for 2 7 of the total li this exchangeable portion could be more easily desorbed into the solution compared with the dissolution of carbonate or silicate minerals with a water rock ratio of 2 1 desorbed li can contribute 0 34 mg l li in the solution whereas in the field flowback water the maximum increase in the li concentration was 0 27 mg l 0 3 d table s1 in field hydraulic fracturing the water rock ratios were believed to be exceptionally low for example estimated as 0 01 by renock et al 2016 which is lower than most laboratory water rock interaction experiments ranging from 0 01 to 23 paukert vankeuren et al 2017 pearce et al 2018 therefore desorption from shale could potentially contribute additional li to the flowback water for b the concentrations greatly increased in the field flowback water within 1 d fig 3a five potential endmembers were presumed 1 water soluble with the δ11b of 14 9 2 water soluble and desorption with the δ11b of 19 8 determined using the concentration fraction in the shale 0 64 mg kg and 2 32 mg kg 3 desorption from the shale with the δ11b of 21 1 4 dissolution of carbonates with the δ11b of 18 4 table 1 and 5 desorption and dissolution of carbonates with the δ11b of 20 7 determined using the fraction obtained from li 84 and 16 the simulated results indicated that the endmember of desorption was the closest to the observed values simulated 3 fig 3b suggesting that desorption of b from the shale contributed additional b to the flowback water however simulated 5 desorption and dissolution of carbonates also approximately fit the observed value fig 3b there were two possible reasons 1 dissolution of carbonates could indeed contribute a minor source for b in field flowback water or 2 the δ11b values for the endmember of desorption 21 1 and carbonates 18 4 were relatively similar based on the laboratory water rock interaction experiments with the fracturing water and shale samples section 3 2 2 desorption was a substantial source of b in the field flowback water this study did not support the viewpoint that the dissolution of silicates such as feldspar with δ11b from 30 1 to 10 2 induces a decrease in δ11b cui et al 2020 such conditions would significantly decrease the δ11b value in the field flowback water in this well which is inconsistent with the observed value fig 3b in addition the laboratory water rock interaction experiments with the deionized water fracturing water and shale demonstrated that the δ11b value increased from 8 1 to 18 6 due to desorption without the dissolution of carbonates or silicate minerals indeed the laboratory water rock interaction experiments with deionized water and shale indicated a minimal dissolution of silicate minerals with an increase in the al and si concentrations during the period of 2 min to 7 d huang et al 2020a however the limited dissolution of silicate minerals scarcely influenced the b concentration and isotopic compositions because the exchangeable b with a relatively high concentration 2 32 mg kg was more reactive during the water rock interactions the geochemical processes of sr in the field flowback are more complex first in the field there was comprehensive cation exchange during the water rock interactions following hydraulic fracturing zolfaghari et al 2016 huang et al 2020a during which ca was adsorbed on the exchangeable sites and na and k were desorbed sr and ca are geochemically similar in terms of ionic radius and ionic charge and can be substituted for each other in mineral lattices mcnutt 2000 therefore sr can be adsorbed on the exchange sites of shale which was confirmed by the 1 high cation exchange capacity of the shale sample 54 meq kg huang et al 2020a 2 laboratory fracturing water and original shale interactions from 0 96 mg l to 0 76 mg l with water rock ratio of 2 1 table 3 3 laboratory fracturing water and the decarbonated shale interactions from 0 96 mg l to 0 21 mg l with water rock ratio of 2 1 table 4 and 4 decrease in the sr concentrations from sources other than mixing in the field flowback water table s1 because there is a minimal sr isotopic fractionation during the cation exchange mcnutt 2000 also confirmed by laboratory adsorption experiments with the δ solution shale of approximately 0 001 pure adsorption from the solution to the shale following hydraulic fracturing cannot induce an increase in 87sr 86sr value beyond mixing the 87sr 86sr value of the carbonates in the shale was 0 71392 the dissolution of the shale carbonates would decrease the 87sr 86sr value of the flowback water beyond mixing fig 4b and laboratory solution table 3 which was opposite to the observed value this suggests that the contribution of carbonate dissolution to the solution field flowback water and fluids from laboratory water rock interactions was not evident our previous study demonstrated that there was indeed carbonate dissolution during the laboratory water rock interaction experiments which could potentially contribute additional sr huang et al 2020a however the contribution of sr from carbonate dissolution was estimated to be lower than 14 when fitting the observed 87sr 86sr values although the water soluble sr had a relatively high 87sr 86sr ratio 0 72038 the amount was only 4 of the exchangeable sr table 3 the dissolution of silicates was unlikely due to the short reaction time based on the findings from the laboratory results section 3 2 3 the increased 87sr 86sr value of flowback beyond mixing was inferred primarily from re equilibrium between the dissolved sr and exchangeable sr fig 6 confirmed by laboratory experiments using the decarbonated shale sample table 4 in the end the li b and sr desorbed from the shale were critical factors in increasing the li and b concentrations and changing the isotopic composition δ7li and δ11b and 87sr 86sr ratio of the flowback water following hydraulic fracturing table 5 this was primarily because the exchangeable fractions of li b and sr were sufficient in the rock samples the cation exchange is a very common geochemistry process in a water rock system containing clay or and organic matter appelo and postma 2005 weil and brady 2017 the order of strength of adsorption for selected cations is 5 al 3 sr 2 ca 2 mg 2 cs k nh 4 na li in our previous study huang et al 2020a we have shown very clear cation exchange between ca2 mg2 and na k for sr2 and li the adsorption and desorption can be considered as cation exchange as the same processes as the exchange between ca2 mg2 and na k 6 ca 2 mg 2 sr 2 2 na k li x ca mg sr x 2 2 na k li these processes resulted in decreases in sr2 concentration and increases in li concentration of flowback water for sr2 the subsequent isotopic re equilibrium between exchangeable sr on the shale and sr in water resulted in an increase in 87sr 86sr the exchangeable sr had a higher 87sr 86sr value though the sr isotope fractionation during cation exchange itself was not evident for b the desorption was evident both in the field and laboratory and was also reported in other studies e g warner et al 2014 phan et al 2020 however the information on detailed processes is little marschall and foster 2018 previous studies showed that during adsorption of boron onto clay minerals or and organic matter 10b trends to be preferential adsorbed resulting in 11b enrichment in the residual fluids i e higher δ11b values and lower b cl ratios spivack et al 1987 vengosh and spivack 2000 lemarchand et al 2005 this study showed that desorption of b would result in higher b cl ratios and changes in δ11b values of fluids rely on the exchangeable b in shale δ11b values decreased in this study in these cases some previously used ion ratios such as sr na ca na li cl and b cl warner et al 2014 harkness et al 2017 would be significantly affected by adsorption desorption or and ion exchange decrease in sr na and ca na and increase in li cl and b cl fig 7 although in the field hydraulic fracturing experiment of this study fresh water was used to fracture the shale rather than other fluids such as hydrochloric acid that are commonly added to industrial fracturing water to induce carbonate dissolution the geochemical processes identified in this study are useful and can occur in the field because of the substantial existence of clay and organic matter in the shale heller and zoback 2014 in addition the leachates can be considered to be a reasonable approximation of the hydraulic fracturing fluid interacting with shale for the majority of the hydraulic fracturing process stewart et al 2015 because the acid appears to be neutralized early and subsequent stages are carried out without adding more hydrochloric acid this study determined all the potential endmembers including concentration and isotopic composition ratio and conducted the corresponding laboratory experiments providing an example to study water rock interactions in detail 5 conclusions the combined evaluations of theunique field water rock interaction experiments detailed determination of the potential endmembers both for concentration and isotopic composition ratio and corresponding laboratory experiments have provided novel and detailed insights into the water rock interactions with respect to li b and sr following hydraulic fracturing of a shale gas reservoir the results emphasize the role of desorption adsorption or and ion exchange in controlling the concentration and isotopic compositions δ7li and δ11b and radiogenic 87sr 86sr ratios in this complex water rock system that contains clay or and organic matter and carbonate the contribution from carbonate dissolution to li b and sr concentrations in the flowback water beyond the mixing between fracturing water and in situ formation water was estimated to be less than 16 another new finding demonstrates that even if there is a general adsorption phenomenon resulting in a decrease in the solution concentration i e a specific solute has been adsorbed on the rock there is also an instantaneous desorption process during the reaction which could change the isotopic composition ratio of the solute leading a different interpretation for the mechanism of changes in solute isotopic compositions ratios this study showed that detailed studies on water rock interactions require the determination of all the possible endmembers including concentration and isotopic composition ratio that could impact the geochemical processes credit authorship contribution statement tianming huang conceptualization methodology

chengdu sichuan 610065 china this manuscript was handled by emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief actual evapotranspiration aet is a crucial variable linking water cycle energy balance and carbon cycle accurate regional aet estimation is a prerequisite for investigating its spatio temporal characteristics and is critical to climate change assessment and hydrological cycle eddy covariance ec measurements are usually regarded as the ground truth to verify the reliability of other aet estimation models however ec flux towers are usually distributed sparsely and cannot fully reflect the actual spatial features of aet this study proposes a hybrid machine learning model called the hybrid convolutional neural network and random forests cnn rf model and applies it to the regional aet estimation over the tuojiang river basin the results demonstrate the excellent performance of the cnn rf model at the site level and the superiority of the cnn rf model over hybrid convolutional neural network and support vector machine cnn svm cnn svm and rf models the aet modeled by the cnn rf model shows the highest correlation correlation coefficient 0 97 with the target value moreover the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse for the cnn rf based modeling are the lowest only 4 02 mm and 6 29 mm respectively additionally the cnn rf estimated aet shows good agreement with the aet simulated by the swat over the tuojiang river basin further illustrating that the cnn rf model based on remotely sensed variables has a strong generalization ability in space the aet shows a high correlation with the air temperature and the precipitation the correlation coefficients are 0 925 and 0 79 respectively the evolution characteristics of these two meteorological variables govern the overall rise in annual aet during 1981 2020 1 59 mm year over tuojiang river basin this result may yield some insights into the interaction between various meteorological factors in the context of global warming and provide evidence for the impact of climate change on water and energy cycles keywords actual evapotranspiration hydrological cycle convolutional neural network random forests swat remotely sensed variables 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration hereafter referred to as aet connects the soil vegetationatmosphere system through water vapor or and lehmann 2019 wu et al 2017 it is an essential component of hydrological cycle evaporation land surface energy balance latent heat and carbon cycle vegetation photosynthesis ryu et al 2019 nearly 60 of the global precipitation will eventually evaporate into the atmosphere through different terrestrial ecosystems silva et al 2019 this process consumes 12 of solar radiation to maintain the relative stability of the air temperature affecting the changes in the earth s climate system or and lehmann 2019 developing reliable inexpensive and generally accessible methods for estimating regional aet can improve our understanding of aet s role in hydrological processes as well as reveal the evolution and interaction mechanisms of water cycle components moreover global climate change directly affects the moisture content in the atmosphere and influences the water circulating processes evapotranspiration precipitation and streamflow accurate estimation of aet is conducive to global climate change research water resources management farmland irrigation and hydrological modeling fisher et al 2017 ma et al 2019b the eddy covariance ec technique is generally considered the most accurate approach for measuring aet du and song 2018 liu et al 2017 this approach calculates water vapor flux or aet by measuring the vertical wind speed and specific humidity pulsation generated by atmospheric turbulence compared with bowen ratio energy balance and aerodynamic methods the ec technique features few theoretical assumptions the ec measured aet is usually regarded as the ground truth to assess the reliability of other aet estimation models a reliable ec measurement requires high precision devices such as ultrasonic anemometers and gas density analyzers to respond fast to climate conditions however this field observation is susceptible to terrain and bad weather leading to errors and missing data and the equipment is costly and challenging to maintain moreover the distribution of the global ec flux towers is very sparse in space especially in some developing countries fisher et al 2020 pastorello et al 2020 among the global flux network eleven flux tower sites are located in china covering typical ecological types including forest grassland farmland and wetland some other flux sites supported by private institutions or projects are not publicly available in china in addition the observation period of flux stations is very short and the missing data requires specific gap filling techniques ma et al 2019a these factors limit the practical application of the ec flux observations especially for temporal and spatial characteristic analysis compared with ec flux observations the aet estimated by the complementary relationship based model is practical the principle of the original complementary relationship cr proposed by bouchet 1963 is based on the symmetric complementarity between potential evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration and apparent potential evapotranspiration brutsaert and stricker 1979 gave the formula expression for calculating each component of the cr model and proposed the advection aridity model also called the brutsaert stricker model granger and gray 1989 developed an asymmetric cr model called the granger gray model to present the unequal changes in potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration by introducing a ratio γ δ to replace the constant 1 assumed by bouchet 1963 szilagyi 2007 emphasized that this asymmetric cr was intrinsically connected with the definition of potential evapotranspiration and put forward a variant brutsaert stricker model further modifying the brutsaert stricker szilagyi and jozsa 2008 proposed the szilagyi jozsa model estimations based on a reliable cr model can be used as an important supplement to aet it is particularly true for regions with zero or few ec flux sites the most significant advantage of the cr model is that it only requires conventional ground meteorological data the cr model providing a long term aet sequence is helpful for the aet spatio temporal evolution study at the regional scale the performance of the cr models has been tested around the world through ec observations or water balanced aet estimations on different land covers and climate conditions at different spatial and temporal scales ai et al 2017 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 compared the monthly aet estimated by the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration model the brutsaert stricker model and the granger gray model with the field observations at 34 flux sites worldwide the results showed that the three models worked satisfyingly and different climatic conditions might impact model performance zhu et al 2016 tested the granger gray model on 12 flux sites in china on a half hour scale and a daily scale the results showed that the granger gray model was applicable to different chinese ecosystems the cr model can obtain long term aet at the site level with the meteorological data however the aet based on discontinuously distributed weather stations cannot fully present the actual spatial characteristics of aet in addition expanding site level aet to regional aet through spatial interpolation algorithms may cause errors many remotely sensed aet products have been launched such as the global land evaporation model baik et al 2018 martens et al 2017 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mu et al 2007 ramoelo et al 2014 and the surface energy balance algorithm for land bastiaanssen et al 2009 laipelt et al 2021 silva et al 2019 these products observe related variables or parameters through remote sensing techniques and retrieve the aet based on physical or mathematical equations it can provide real time large scale regional observations and is less restricted by ground observation conditions however the physical models involved in remotely sensed aet products require many parameters e g surface heat radiation parameters vegetation index and soil moisture index and meteorological variables anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 the accuracies of these parameters and meteorological data obtained through multi spectral remote sensing may be reduced due to cloud cover purdy et al 2018 xu et al 2018 it is necessary to verify the reliability of remotely sensed aet using site observations before watershed application compared with remote sensing based or physics based models machine learning methods have significant advantages in processing big data and recognizing nonlinear patterns they can map the relationship between the aet and other meteorological variables efficiently many scholars have applied these approaches to estimate regional aet by scaling up site level aet bodesheim et al 2018 estimated the global aet by applying random forests rf to establish the relationship between latent heat and remote sensing variables wang et al 2017 proved that artificial neural network support vector machine svm and multivariate adaptive regression spline were reliable for predicting the aet in north america over most plants types on daily and annual scales xu et al 2018 concluded that rf artificial neural network cubist and svm performed the same in estimating the aet of the heihe river basin and rf had lower uncertainty than the other three machine learning algorithms fang et al 2020 applied svm to upscale site scale aet measurements to regional scale aet in north china plain the results showed that svm performed well at the site scale which guaranteed its potential ability for the regional aet application tramontana et al 2016 conducted an experiment to predict the aet across different ecosystem types using 11 machine learning methods selected from four different families kernel methods neural networks tree methods and regression splines the machine learning methods presented in their study have shown an excellent performance in contrast to traditional machine learning methods convolutional neural network cnn can extract target features automatically and is widely used in image recognition and classification including applications in the aet estimation gebrehiwot et al 2019 huang et al 2018 panahi et al 2020 dong et al 2022 assessed three machine learning models for calculating reference evapotranspiration on different spatiotemporal scales in china including cnn extreme learning machine and multiple adaptive regression splines they concluded that cnn outperformed extreme learning machine and multiple adaptive regression splines in terms of the modeling accuracy and robustness both on a daily and monthly scale ferreira and da cunha 2020 explored the potential of cnn and three other machine learning methods for estimating daily reference evapotranspiration in regional and local scenarios their results showed that cnn offered the most accurate evapotranspiration estimations when using hourly data as input although general machine learning methods have been used to estimate the aet in large watersheds the methods have not considered the mismatch problem between in situ measurements and the remote sensing pixel scale data propagating great uncertainty cao et al 2021 li et al 2018 moreover previous works involved many explanatory variables in the model which may hinder their application due to difficulties in data acquisition in addition existing cnn applications in the aet estimation focused on one dimensional or two dimensional multivariate models that is they did not consider the spatial correlation of variable information on this basis we propose a hybrid cnn rf model in this study to estimate watershed aet using fewer remote sensing variables the combination of cnn and rf can keep a fast calculation efficiency and reduce uncertainty caused by the scale mismatch problem by using multiple sub grid features instead of the features from a specific pixel the hybrid cnn rf model can improve the accuracy of regional aet estimation by taking advantage of the area characteristics of multi source remote sensing information and has broad application prospects in the following sections the performance of the cnn rf model is compared with that of rf cnn svm and cnn svm methods followed by a variable sensitivity analysis since the ec flux sites in the study basin are not adequate and the monitoring period is relatively short the cr model with reasonable accuracy proved by the ec observations is employed to estimate site level aet notably it is an alternative way to obtain site level aet through a cr model since there are no flux stations within the study basin to reduce error propagation we use the nearest flux station to evaluate the reliability of the cr models forced by its measured meteorological data the most suitable cr model was selected based on the evaluation results in this way the accuracy of the estimated aet is improved the alternative way used herein is a good reference for estimating regional aet in areas with sparse flux sites as it stands the whole premise of the modeling output relies on the input data which is very sparse in other words this is as much a theoretical exercise as a real world simulation the employment of ec observations in regions with sufficient flux sites can increase the confidence in accurately estimating regional aet when applying the proposed method the specific objectives of this study are 1 to estimate regional aet for the tuojiang river basin based on the cnn rf model 2 to assess the comparability between the cnn rf estimated aet and the swat modeled aet in this way the applicability of the cnn rf is further examined 3 to analyze the spatial and temporal variations of the aet over the tuojiang river basin 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the tuojiang river basin is located in southwestern china between 102 5 and 106 e 28 5 and 32 n fig 1 the whole drainage area is 27860 km2 with a 502 km total river length the terrain is dominated by mountains and plains with the elevation ranging from 300 m to 5000 m the land cover is primarily farmland the climate is semi humid with four distinct seasons and abundant rainfall in a year the annual precipitation is about 800 1300 mm and 60 of the total precipitation occurs in the summer the average air temperature is 17 5 and the wind speed is 2 1 m s a hydrological station called the lijiawan hydrological station sits downstream of the main river the average annual streamflow measured at there is 400 m3 s the monthly streamflow measured at the lijiawan hydrological station from 1980 to 2018 is collected an ec flux tower site hongyuan 102 59 e 32 84 n is located in the northern part of the region it also works as a meteorological station the ec site belongs to the upland ecosystem and is classified as alpine meadows delwiche et al 2021 niu and chen 2020 this article will use the ec flux observation data to verify the reliability of the cr estimated aet based on meteorological data 2 2 precipitation data and other data three meteorological variables precipitation wind speed and temperature and one geographic variable elevation are included as the spatial field precipitation and ten meter wind speed are obtained from the terraclimate which is a monthly dataset with a spatial resolution of 4 km and is a global multi source dataset based on high spatial resolution normals from the worldclim database and other data sources the air temperature at a distance of 2 m from the land surface is provided by the fifth generation ecmwf land era5 land dataset it combines ground observations and global scale modeled data compared with era5 the spatial resolution of era5 land is enhanced from 0 25 to 0 1 elevation comes from the digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 90 m obtained by the shuttle radar topography mission all the spatial data of the four variables is resampled to 0 05 in preparation for sub grid feature extraction in situ climate data measured at 24 meteorological stations over the tuojiang river basin is collected from the china meteorological data service center including maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed precipitation and sunshine hours the in situ meteorological data is used to calculate the site level aet based on the cr model the basic information of all the data used in this study is summarized in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 complimentary relationship models the concept of complementary relationship cr was initially proposed by bouchet 1963 assuming little energy exchange and advection as well as thoroughly moist land surface the actual evapotranspiration aet and the potential evapotranspiration ep are equal to the apparent potential evapotranspiration epo in this state as the surface dries out the energy required for the latent heat decreases aet decreases and the excess energy leads to an increase in sensible heat resulting in an increase in ep the feedback of aet to ep is called the complementary relationship the basic equation is as follows 1 e p e po b a e t e po where epo is the evapotranspiration in a wet environment also termed apparent potential evapotranspiration and b is the ratio coefficient when b 1 the increase in aet equals the decrease in ep that is the symmetric cr three commonly used models based on the cr namely the brutsaert strickler model the szilagyi jozsa model and the granger gray model are evaluated by comparing their modeling values with the ec observations at the hongyuan flux site the brutsaert strickler model is based on the research of penman 1948 and priestley and taylor 1972 to calculate ep and epo respectively and derives aet according to eq 1 the szilagyi jozsa model is a modified brutsaert strickler model using the rome wind function to calculate true epo the granger gray model modified the cr to a general equation based on non saturated surfaces by introducing relative evaporation aet ep the specific formulae and derivation process can be found in the literature brutsaert and stricker 1979 granger and gray 1989 szilagyi and jozsa 2008 these three cr models forced by the same daily scale meteorological data are parameterized by the station latitude longitude elevation height of wind instruments etc the cr model with the best performance is used to calculate the site level aet at the 24 meteorological stations over the tuojiang river basin the three models can be implemented in the evapotranspiration package of the r software guo et al 2016 3 2 machine learning models this article compares the performance of the hybrid convolutional neural network and random forests cnn rf with that of the other four machine learning models namely the hybrid convolutional neural network and support vector machine cnn svm the convolutional neural network cnn the random forests rf and the support vector machine svm the architectures of the five machine learning models are nearly the same except for the differences in their spatial information extraction patterns all the five models are constructed using precipitation wind speed air temperature and dem as input variables and the monthly aet as the output variable the data samples from the 24 meteorological stations are split into two datasets the training and the testing datasets spatial information extraction patterns differ in the models because of the non uniform model structures between the cnn based and other traditional machine learning methods thus two patterns are established herein for the models the area to point and the pixel to point patterns the area to point pattern refers to the 11 11 sub grids spatial information corresponding to the aet at the center point and is adopted for the cnn rf the cnn svm and the cnn models in contrast the pixel to point pattern uses the sub grid or pixel closest to the site and is applied to the rf and the svm models a detailed construction process of the cnn rf model is shown below in addition the other four models are also introduced briefly 3 2 1 convolutional neural network the convolutional neural network cnn is a bionic deep learning network that mimics the brain s visual cortex to process and recognize images the cnn applies a mathematical operation called convolution to extract features by sliding along the input matrix automatically as shown in fig 2 the cnn consists of the input layer the convolutional layer the pooling layer the fully connected layer and the output layer panahi et al 2020 zuo et al 2019 the convolutional and pooling layers are alternately connected to form the core module of cnn the size of the feature map is determined by the input matrix of the previous layer the number and size of the convolution kernel the moving strides and the padding method the parameters of each convolution unit are optimized through the backpropagation algorithm each neuron in the same feature map shares weights and is only connected to local neurons in the previous layer the shared weight architecture and local connectivity significantly simplify the networks and reduce the risk of overfitting after the convolution operation an activation function is introduced to transform the linear convolved feature to non linearity in the decision function the basic formula of convolution calculation is as follows 2 z j l i m x i l 1 k ij l b j l 3 x j l f z j l where i and j represent the ith input neuron and the jth output neuron respectively z j l represents the jth output of the convolution operation l is the lth convolutional layer x i l 1 denotes the input to the lth convolutional layer m is the number of input feature maps or the number of image channels if it is the first convolutional layer k ij l is the convolution kernel b j l is the bias value for the jth neuron in layer l x j l is the output of neuron j f represents the activation function f can be the sigmod tanh or relu function rectified linear unit or linear rectification function the relu function is commonly used in deep neural networks due to its faster calculation and good generalization ability the definition of the relu function is shown below 4 f z j l max 0 z j l after feature extraction from the convolutional layer the obtained feature maps are usually down sampled by a pooling layer downsampling layer to reduce computation downsampling does not change the number of feature maps but can reduce the size and prevent overfitting downsampling methods include average sampling maximum sampling overlap sampling normalized sampling random sampling etc the formula of pooling calculation is as follows 5 o j l 1 d o w n x j l where o j l 1 is the output of the l 1 th layer after pooling operation down is the pooling function a fully connected layer is located at the end of cnn in this layer the feature map loses its spatial structure the features extracted from the previous layers are flattened into a one dimensional feature vector and nonlinearly combined to obtain input for the next layer 6 y k w k x k 1 b k where yk denotes the output of the kth fully connected layer xk 1 is the input of the kth fully connected layer wk and bk are the weight and bias respectively 3 2 2 random forests in 2001 breiman 2001 proposed the random forests rf the core idea of rf is the decision tree and bootstrap aggregating bagging the decision tree is a tree like classifier bagging is an ensemble technique of training the decision tree classifier by resampling n new subsets from the original dataset with replacement every tree is independently grown by the sampling dataset in the training process and each node is split using the best variable in the subset for regression problems the predicted result is the average of the predictions from all trees compared with other machine learning methods the rf algorithm significantly improves the calculation efficiency with a lower error and reduces the noise out of bag oob error estimation is used to determine the optimal parameter set that is the number of variables at each split mty and the number of decision trees ntree these two parameters directly influence the performance of the rf algorithm the rf can manage big data and high dimensional data effectively this advantage makes it a suitable tool for handling remotely sensed information the modeling process can be expressed as 7 g rf t x 1 t t 1 t m t x θ t where mt is the prediction result of decision tree t t is the number of the ensemble trees x is the input features θ t characterizes the terminal node values split variables and other parameters in decision tree t 3 2 3 hybrid cnn rf model the hybrid cnn rf model mainly comprises two modules the cnn spatial feature extraction module and the rf estimation module the fully connected and output layers at the end of the cnn are removed and replaced with the rf module the cnn module acts as an information extractor the rf module mainly regresses the feature vectors extracted by the cnn and the site level aet and performs regional aet estimation the proposed hybrid cnn rf uses an area to point pattern to extract the spatial characteristics of various geographical and meteorological variables associated with aet around the target area this area to point pattern takes 11 11 sub grids centered at the meteorological station to obtain the area characteristics the 11 11 sub grids ensure that they cover the same number of sub grids here five sub grids on all four sides when centered on each weather station also the 11 11 sub grids can provide enough information without being too redundant as we mentioned above the remotely sensed data is resampled to the spatial resolution of 0 05 that is to say the area information with a radius of 0 25 can be used as a reference for the site level aet this area to point pattern provides more spatial auxiliary information around the site and reduces the uncertainty caused by the scale mismatch problem the specific steps for applying this method are as follows 1 first normalization is performed for all the input data including precipitation dem temperature and wind speed to accelerate convergence then an image extraction area with a dimension of 11 11 4 is constructed at each meteorological site to obtain spatial information 11 11 represents the feature width and height and 4 is the image channel number of variables as shown in fig 3 the architecture of the cnn module is mainly composed of three convolutional layers and one pooling layer in addition two dropout layers are added to improve the generalization ability and prevent overfitting the kernel size is 3 3 and the pooling window is 2 2 the max pooling and relu are selected as the pooling function and the activation function respectively 2 after one dense layer the output features from the cnn module are fed into the rf module based on the minimum oob error principle the optimal parameters are obtained which are 10 for mtry and 200 for ntree respectively 3 seventy percent of the data at the 24 sites are randomly sampled as the training dataset the remaining thirty percent are the test dataset to train and test the cnn rf model respectively the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse the correlation coefficient cc and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used to evaluate the modeling performance finally the trained model is applied to the entire watershed to obtain regional aet 3 2 4 support vector machine and hybrid cnn support vector machine as a general machine learning algorithm the support vector machine svm was initially proposed by vapnik 1963 drucker et al 1997 developed it for regression and prediction analysis the basic principle of svm is to find an optimal classification line or hyperplane that can separate the samples without error and maximize the classification margin for nonlinearly separable samples the input variables can be mapped to a high dimensional space hilbert space through nonlinear transformation the svm finds the best compromise between model complexity and learning ability according to limited sample information so as to minimize the structural risk and obtain the best learning generalization ability therefore this method can be applied to solve small sample nonlinear and high dimensional problems and is often used for identification and prediction a more detailed introduction of the svm can be found in the literature chia et al 2020 zendehboudi et al 2018 the cnn svm algorithm consists of a cnn based feature extraction module and an svm based regression module the cnn module comprises three convolutional layers a pooling layer and a fully connected layer which extracts the spatial information and flattens it into a one dimensional feature vector the svm module regresses the feature vector extracted from the cnn module with the target site level aet the area to point feature extraction pattern is adopted in the cnn svm model established in this study whose input data and main structure are consistent with the cnn rf model 3 3 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed physical model it simulates the water cycle process according to the water balance equation the tuojiang river basin is delineated into 116 sub basins and each sub basin is aggregated from 1 to 10 hydrological response units the data required for driving the swat modeling comprises meteorological data air temperature wind speed precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation and geographic data dem land use and soil the swat simulated aet consists of three components free water evapotranspiration intercepted by the canopy vegetation transpiration and sublimation or soil evapotranspiration the canopy evapotranspiration is mainly determined by the free water intercepted by the canopy the transpiration and soil evaporation are set to be proportional to the potential evapotranspiration and are related to the vegetation cover leaf area index or soil property soil cover index the swat model is calibrated and validated by the monthly streamflow measured at the lijiawan hydrological station four indices namely cc bias rmse and mae are used to assess the correlation and deviation between the aet estimated using the cnn rf model and the swat simulated aet based on the water balance principle the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliff efficiency nse and percent bias pbias are introduced to evaluate the hydrological performance of the swat model values of r 2 and nse range between 0 and 1 the higher their values the better the modeling the index pbias is used to measure the deviation of the modeled streamflow from the observations if pbias 0 the streamflow is underestimated and vice versa 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the modeling performance between machine learning methods the hongyuan flux site with a total of 876 daily measurements 21 may 2015 to 21 november 2015 and 10 february 2016 to 31 december 2017 is used as ground truth to identify the appropriate cr model note that the missing data of ec observations is from 22 november 2015 to 9 february 2016 and the comparison in fig 4 is made when the ec observations are available as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the granger gray model performs the best among the three empirical models with the highest cc 0 85 and lowest values of mae and rmse 0 55 mm and 0 76 mm respectively in addition the granger gray model estimated aet is all positive zero means no evapotranspiration which is more meaningful than the estimations from the szilagyi jozsa model and the brutsaert stricker model with negative values thus this study chooses the granger gray model to calculate the site level aet the daily aet estimated by the granger gray model is then aggregated into the monthly aet note that if there are enough ec flux sites in the area the ec observations are preferred rather than the cr based estimations the performance metrics for the machine learning models driven by all the four input variables are summarized in fig 5 and tables 3 6 fig 5 presents the minimum the first quartile the median the third quartile and the maximum of the granger gray model estimated aet and the predicted aet along with the corresponding probability density distribution one can find that the cnn rf model performs the best according to the evaluation metrics and the comparison of the probability density distribution between the model estimated values and the target values the cc and nse for the cnn rf model are the highest 0 97 and 0 95 respectively and the corresponding mae and rmse are the lowest 4 02 mm and 6 29 mm respectively the performance of the rf model ranks second followed by the svm compared with the mae and rmse for the cnn rf model those for the rf model increase by 10 and 30 respectively and those for the svm model increase by 64 and 46 respectively the cnn is poor at estimating extreme values the mae and rmse for the cnn model are 7 87 mm and 10 30 mm respectively nearly twice those for the cnn rf model the cnn svm model performs the worst with the cc and nse of only 0 85 and 0 69 respectively the corresponding mae and rmse 13 09 and 16 12 respectively are almost three times those for the cnn rf model then we analyzed the sensitivity of the models performance in estimating the aet to the input variables by comparing the original models performances with those of new models using only three input variables the modeling results from the original models and the new ones are shown in fig 6 and tables 3 6 the numbers in the parentheses in tables 3 6 are percentage changes in the performance metrics when the aet estimation model is driven by three input variables instead of the original four input variables all models show a decline in the ability to estimate the aet due to information loss it is indicated by increases in the rmse and mae and decreases in the cc and nse the variables may impact the models differently for example the mae for the cnn rf model increases by 15 9 due to the loss of precipitation information by contrast the mae for the cnn rf model increases by 37 in the absence of air temperature compared with the other three meteorological factors the geographic factor dem has less influence on the five models this is probably because the dem is not a time varying variable it only provides static geographic information among the models cnn and cnn svm show higher sensitivity to the dem for example the rmse for the cnn model increases by 18 83 without using the dem as the input while the rmse for the rf model only increases by 1 6 air temperature is a critical meteorological variable in the models for example when the air temperature is omitted from the input variables the rmse for cnn rf cnn svm cnn rf and svm increased by 39 58 36 78 18 45 4 31 and 34 35 respectively these increases are more than twice those caused by omitting the dem the robustness of the aet estimation model is sensitive to whether air temperature is used as an input variable this makes sense in physics as the air temperature rises the movement of water molecules becomes active and the energy exchange also intensifies accordingly that is to say the potential evapotranspiration capacity increases the conversion process of liquid water to vapor is accelerated increasing the aet the cnn rf model integrates the advantages of cnn and rf modules consequently behaving superior to the other models in recognizing remote sensing information compared with the rf and cnn models the mae for the cnn rf model reduces by 10 and 48 and the rmse reduces by 22 and 38 respectively the area to point information extraction pattern adopted in the cnn rf model can provide more regional features around the site for reference which is helpful to correct the deviation of modeling results in addition the rf module is good at processing high dimensional data extracted from the cnn module and has strong resistance to over fitting the cnn rf model overcomes the shortcomings of the cnn on extreme values estimation fig 5c when the cnn is coupled with the rf the cnn module extracts more spatial features and is fed into the rf model enabling the variable information to be reflected in the cnn rf model moreover the cnn rf differentiates the features from the diverse information sources while the rf shows less sensitivity to the variables fig 6 the cnn svm is inferior to the cnn rf in processing big data as the sample size or the number of features increases the dimensionality obtained through the kernel function mapping in the svm increases significantly especially when the cnn hybridizes with the svm more feature information is fed into the svm which can easily lead to over fitting and increase the computation cost this may be why the performance of cnn svm is significantly lower than that of svm 4 2 comparison between the cnn rf estimated aet and the swat modeled aet at the sub basin scale regional aet can be acquired by applying the cnn rf model to the entire watershed the swat modeled aet is used as the reference to evaluate the rationality of the spatial distribution of the cnn rf estimated aet forced by in situ meteorological data the swat based hydrological model of the tuojiang river basin is established calibration and validation are performed using the monthly streamflow measured at the lijiawan hydrological station as shown in fig 7 the performance is good in the calibration period 1980 1999 with r 2 and nse equaling 0 94 and 0 97 respectively and the pbias at only 5 9 the simulation ability declines during the validation period 2000 2018 for example r 2 and nse drop to 0 79 and 0 71 respectively and the pbias rises to 25 7 the levene s test is conducted to assess the equality of variances between the observed streamflow and the swat simulated streamflow in the validation period the p value 0 0433 is below 5 the null hypothesis of equal variances is rejected and it is concluded that there is a difference between the variances in the two series in 2000 2018 the mean of the observed streamflow was 412 67 m3 s and that of the simulated streamflow was 306 30 m3 s according to the variance calculation result the fluctuation magnitude of the simulated streamflow is lower than that of the observed streamflow the swat model assumes that factors such as river shape land cover soil properties etc remain constant and boil down to one set of parameters that is the parameters derived from the calibration phase are stationary however the external environment is very complex and has many uncertainties the parameters obtained in the calibration phase may not fully reproduce the real world for the future period this is probably the main reason for the reduced performance in the validation phase nevertheless the validation performance is still satisfactory according to the evaluation criteria in the literature duan et al 2019 the swat modeled aet after streamflow calibration can be used to assess the aet estimated by other models chun et al 2018 dash et al 2021 the swat modeled aet and the cnn rf estimated aet are compared using different indices at the 116 sub basins note that the nearest grid value to the sub basin center and the average value of all hydrological response units in the sub basin represent the sub basin aet of cnn rf and swat respectively as shown in fig 8 there is no significant difference between the swat modeled aet and the cnn rf estimated aet across the entire basin specifically the correlation coefficient of the two products ranges between 0 84 and 0 94 the bias over most sub basins is within 10 the rmse is mainly below 20 mm and the mae is between 10 mm and 20 mm in other words the aet results estimated by the two methods are close in the watershed and the difference in magnitude is acceptable these results demonstrate that the cnn rf has relatively high generalization ability in space and the estimated aet has excellent potential in hydrological applications 4 3 spatial temporal variations of the cnn rf estimated aet fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the multi year 1981 2020 average monthly aet over the tuojiang river basin and the inter monthly distribution of the domain averaged aet the difference in monthly aet across the watershed is minor it is between 42 mm month and 54 mm month over the basin with less aet in the high latitudes and more aet in the low latitudes the domain averaged aet varies significantly throughout the year with the highest of 120 mm in july and the lowest of 10 mm in december this variation is consistent with trends in the precipitation and temperature changes fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of seasonal aet the aet gradually increases from north to south in the four seasons this spatial difference in the aet amount is most intense in summer june to august reaching 80 mm spring march to may comes second with a difference of 60 mm between north and south in autumn september to november the aet difference over the entire basin is half of that in summer the spatial difference almost disappears in winter december to february the total aet in spring is about 150 190 mm and it peaks in summer reaching 220 300 mm in autumn the aet falls back to 100 140 mm lower than that in spring the aet in winter is less than 100 mm on the annual scale as shown in fig 11 the spatial difference of annual aet from north to south is about 140 mm which is equivalent to the total aet in autumn the average annual aet in the watershed is 600 mm this means that approximately 16 716 km3 of water evaporates from the land surface every year considering the basin area of 27860 km2 the trends in seasonal and annual aet changes during 1981 2020 are depicted in figs 12 and 13 overall the upward trend dominates the most area the rate of change is different in the four seasons and it is not completely synchronized in space in spring and summer nearly 82 3 and 67 9 of the basin area respectively show a significant upward trend especially in the south of 30 n the highest upward trend can reach 1 2 mm year in contrast the seasonal aet in autumn and winter increases slightly in the basin s southern part with the rate between 0 2 and 0 7 mm year the central area 30 n 31 n in these two seasons even shows a downward trend on the annual scale as shown in fig 13 a b nearly 83 6 pass the t test p 0 05 of the catchment area shows a significant increasing trend except that a small portion of the middle area shows an insignificant downward trends the average rate of increase in the north is between 1 0 and 2 0 mm year while the increasing trend is more dramatic in the south reaching 3 5 mm year the domain averaged aet fluctuated around 580 mm from 1981 to 1997 and significantly increased after 1997 with a 3 37 mm year growth rate fig 13c overall the aet increased slightly at 1 59 mm year from 1981 to 2020 pass the t test p 0 05 the mean of annual aet is 583 40 mm in 1981 1997 and 609 69 mm in 1998 2020 the levene s test is performed to identify whether the variances of the annual aet in the two periods are equal the p value 0 025 is below 5 this test result supports the conclusion that there is a significant difference between the two variances the fluctuation of annual aet is less in 1981 1997 than 1998 2020 global climate change may raise the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events this might be the reason for the increased fluctuation in aet the spatial and seasonal variation of the aet is closely related to changes in meteorological factors such as precipitation air temperature and wind speed fig 14 shows the distribution of monthly aet air temperature wind speed and precipitation in the four seasons from 1981 to 2020 the changes in temperature and precipitation over four seasons are consistent with the aet with the largest in summer and the smallest in winter the seasonal distribution of wind speed is not similar to the aet however wind speed is an essential factor in adjusting the aet distribution in the seasons as observed in fig 14 precipitation and air temperature in spring are no more than that in autumn however the aet is higher in spring than autumn it is probably due to the highest wind speed in spring fig 15 shows the probability density distributions of monthly aet air temperature and precipitation as well as their correlations in four seasons air temperature is the most related variable to the aet and no significant correlation is found between wind speed and the aet in summer and autumn the cc between air temperature and aet reaches 0 925 the cc between precipitation and the aet in spring and autumn is 0 65 and 0 71 respectively and can reach 0 79 in the whole year the changes in precipitation and air temperature control the variation of annual aet from 1981 to 2020 as shown in fig 16 the air temperature in the entire watershed presents a significant upward trend the growth rate is 0 3 0 4 per decade air temperature in the middle and south increased faster than in the north at the same time the annual precipitation fig 17 showed a significant downward trend from 1981 to 1997 with an average rate of around 13 21 mm year by contrast a significant upward trend with an average rate of 9 59 mm year appeared in 1998 2020 moreover the upward trend of annual precipitation from 1998 to 2020 is dramatic in the north and south and slows down in the middle consistent with the spatial change of annual aet no evident trend was found in wind speed during this period the domain averaged annual aet shows a consistent response to precipitation and temperature changes 5 conclusions this study proposed a hybrid cnn rf model for estimating regional aet based on several explanatory variables and applied it to the tuojiang river basin the explanatory variables include remotely sensed meteorological information precipitation wind speed and air temperature and geographic data the dem the estimated monthly aet with a high spatial resolution of 0 5 was consistent with the swat modeled aet over sub basins air temperature and precipitation were identified as two governing factors that influenced the variations of aet on the basin the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the cnn rf model shows significant superiorities in estimating regional aet over cnn rf svm and svm rf models the cc and nse between the cnn rf estimated aet and the target values are the highest 0 97 and 0 95 respectively and the corresponding mae and rmse are the lowest 4 02 mm and 6 29 mm respectively the cnn rf model can better capture spatial information using the cnn module and converge fast while maintaining good sensitivity to explanatory variables the variable sensitivity analysis of the aet estimation models shows that the dem has less influence on the model performance than the other three meteorological factors in addition air temperature plays an essential role in the models 2 the cnn rf estimated aet shows good agreement with the swat modeled aet over the tuojiang river basin the correlation coefficients of the two aet products in 116 sub basins range between 0 84 and 0 94 the bias values are mainly distributed within 10 the rmse values are 20 mm and the mae values are between 10 mm and 20 mm these results indicate that the cnn rf has a good generalization ability in space based on continuously distributed variables and demonstrate the accuracy of the estimated aet therefore the cnn rf estimated aet has excellent potential in hydrological applications 3 the aet estimated by the cnn rf model shows an increasing trend from north to south over the tuojiang river basin this spatial difference is intensified in summer and virtually disappears in winter in addition a significant upward trend for seasonal and annual aet during 1981 2020 is observed the aet has a relatively strong correlation with air temperature and precipitation with the cc of 0 925 and 0 79 respectively changing characteristics of these two meteorological variables govern the overall increase in annual aet during 1981 2020 1 59 mm year this

chengdu sichuan 610065 china this manuscript was handled by emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief actual evapotranspiration aet is a crucial variable linking water cycle energy balance and carbon cycle accurate regional aet estimation is a prerequisite for investigating its spatio temporal characteristics and is critical to climate change assessment and hydrological cycle eddy covariance ec measurements are usually regarded as the ground truth to verify the reliability of other aet estimation models however ec flux towers are usually distributed sparsely and cannot fully reflect the actual spatial features of aet this study proposes a hybrid machine learning model called the hybrid convolutional neural network and random forests cnn rf model and applies it to the regional aet estimation over the tuojiang river basin the results demonstrate the excellent performance of the cnn rf model at the site level and the superiority of the cnn rf model over hybrid convolutional neural network and support vector machine cnn svm cnn svm and rf models the aet modeled by the cnn rf model shows the highest correlation correlation coefficient 0 97 with the target value moreover the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse for the cnn rf based modeling are the lowest only 4 02 mm and 6 29 mm respectively additionally the cnn rf estimated aet shows good agreement with the aet simulated by the swat over the tuojiang river basin further illustrating that the cnn rf model based on remotely sensed variables has a strong generalization ability in space the aet shows a high correlation with the air temperature and the precipitation the correlation coefficients are 0 925 and 0 79 respectively the evolution characteristics of these two meteorological variables govern the overall rise in annual aet during 1981 2020 1 59 mm year over tuojiang river basin this result may yield some insights into the interaction between various meteorological factors in the context of global warming and provide evidence for the impact of climate change on water and energy cycles keywords actual evapotranspiration hydrological cycle convolutional neural network random forests swat remotely sensed variables 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration hereafter referred to as aet connects the soil vegetationatmosphere system through water vapor or and lehmann 2019 wu et al 2017 it is an essential component of hydrological cycle evaporation land surface energy balance latent heat and carbon cycle vegetation photosynthesis ryu et al 2019 nearly 60 of the global precipitation will eventually evaporate into the atmosphere through different terrestrial ecosystems silva et al 2019 this process consumes 12 of solar radiation to maintain the relative stability of the air temperature affecting the changes in the earth s climate system or and lehmann 2019 developing reliable inexpensive and generally accessible methods for estimating regional aet can improve our understanding of aet s role in hydrological processes as well as reveal the evolution and interaction mechanisms of water cycle components moreover global climate change directly affects the moisture content in the atmosphere and influences the water circulating processes evapotranspiration precipitation and streamflow accurate estimation of aet is conducive to global climate change research water resources management farmland irrigation and hydrological modeling fisher et al 2017 ma et al 2019b the eddy covariance ec technique is generally considered the most accurate approach for measuring aet du and song 2018 liu et al 2017 this approach calculates water vapor flux or aet by measuring the vertical wind speed and specific humidity pulsation generated by atmospheric turbulence compared with bowen ratio energy balance and aerodynamic methods the ec technique features few theoretical assumptions the ec measured aet is usually regarded as the ground truth to assess the reliability of other aet estimation models a reliable ec measurement requires high precision devices such as ultrasonic anemometers and gas density analyzers to respond fast to climate conditions however this field observation is susceptible to terrain and bad weather leading to errors and missing data and the equipment is costly and challenging to maintain moreover the distribution of the global ec flux towers is very sparse in space especially in some developing countries fisher et al 2020 pastorello et al 2020 among the global flux network eleven flux tower sites are located in china covering typical ecological types including forest grassland farmland and wetland some other flux sites supported by private institutions or projects are not publicly available in china in addition the observation period of flux stations is very short and the missing data requires specific gap filling techniques ma et al 2019a these factors limit the practical application of the ec flux observations especially for temporal and spatial characteristic analysis compared with ec flux observations the aet estimated by the complementary relationship based model is practical the principle of the original complementary relationship cr proposed by bouchet 1963 is based on the symmetric complementarity between potential evapotranspiration actual evapotranspiration and apparent potential evapotranspiration brutsaert and stricker 1979 gave the formula expression for calculating each component of the cr model and proposed the advection aridity model also called the brutsaert stricker model granger and gray 1989 developed an asymmetric cr model called the granger gray model to present the unequal changes in potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration by introducing a ratio γ δ to replace the constant 1 assumed by bouchet 1963 szilagyi 2007 emphasized that this asymmetric cr was intrinsically connected with the definition of potential evapotranspiration and put forward a variant brutsaert stricker model further modifying the brutsaert stricker szilagyi and jozsa 2008 proposed the szilagyi jozsa model estimations based on a reliable cr model can be used as an important supplement to aet it is particularly true for regions with zero or few ec flux sites the most significant advantage of the cr model is that it only requires conventional ground meteorological data the cr model providing a long term aet sequence is helpful for the aet spatio temporal evolution study at the regional scale the performance of the cr models has been tested around the world through ec observations or water balanced aet estimations on different land covers and climate conditions at different spatial and temporal scales ai et al 2017 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 compared the monthly aet estimated by the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration model the brutsaert stricker model and the granger gray model with the field observations at 34 flux sites worldwide the results showed that the three models worked satisfyingly and different climatic conditions might impact model performance zhu et al 2016 tested the granger gray model on 12 flux sites in china on a half hour scale and a daily scale the results showed that the granger gray model was applicable to different chinese ecosystems the cr model can obtain long term aet at the site level with the meteorological data however the aet based on discontinuously distributed weather stations cannot fully present the actual spatial characteristics of aet in addition expanding site level aet to regional aet through spatial interpolation algorithms may cause errors many remotely sensed aet products have been launched such as the global land evaporation model baik et al 2018 martens et al 2017 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mu et al 2007 ramoelo et al 2014 and the surface energy balance algorithm for land bastiaanssen et al 2009 laipelt et al 2021 silva et al 2019 these products observe related variables or parameters through remote sensing techniques and retrieve the aet based on physical or mathematical equations it can provide real time large scale regional observations and is less restricted by ground observation conditions however the physical models involved in remotely sensed aet products require many parameters e g surface heat radiation parameters vegetation index and soil moisture index and meteorological variables anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 the accuracies of these parameters and meteorological data obtained through multi spectral remote sensing may be reduced due to cloud cover purdy et al 2018 xu et al 2018 it is necessary to verify the reliability of remotely sensed aet using site observations before watershed application compared with remote sensing based or physics based models machine learning methods have significant advantages in processing big data and recognizing nonlinear patterns they can map the relationship between the aet and other meteorological variables efficiently many scholars have applied these approaches to estimate regional aet by scaling up site level aet bodesheim et al 2018 estimated the global aet by applying random forests rf to establish the relationship between latent heat and remote sensing variables wang et al 2017 proved that artificial neural network support vector machine svm and multivariate adaptive regression spline were reliable for predicting the aet in north america over most plants types on daily and annual scales xu et al 2018 concluded that rf artificial neural network cubist and svm performed the same in estimating the aet of the heihe river basin and rf had lower uncertainty than the other three machine learning algorithms fang et al 2020 applied svm to upscale site scale aet measurements to regional scale aet in north china plain the results showed that svm performed well at the site scale which guaranteed its potential ability for the regional aet application tramontana et al 2016 conducted an experiment to predict the aet across different ecosystem types using 11 machine learning methods selected from four different families kernel methods neural networks tree methods and regression splines the machine learning methods presented in their study have shown an excellent performance in contrast to traditional machine learning methods convolutional neural network cnn can extract target features automatically and is widely used in image recognition and classification including applications in the aet estimation gebrehiwot et al 2019 huang et al 2018 panahi et al 2020 dong et al 2022 assessed three machine learning models for calculating reference evapotranspiration on different spatiotemporal scales in china including cnn extreme learning machine and multiple adaptive regression splines they concluded that cnn outperformed extreme learning machine and multiple adaptive regression splines in terms of the modeling accuracy and robustness both on a daily and monthly scale ferreira and da cunha 2020 explored the potential of cnn and three other machine learning methods for estimating daily reference evapotranspiration in regional and local scenarios their results showed that cnn offered the most accurate evapotranspiration estimations when using hourly data as input although general machine learning methods have been used to estimate the aet in large watersheds the methods have not considered the mismatch problem between in situ measurements and the remote sensing pixel scale data propagating great uncertainty cao et al 2021 li et al 2018 moreover previous works involved many explanatory variables in the model which may hinder their application due to difficulties in data acquisition in addition existing cnn applications in the aet estimation focused on one dimensional or two dimensional multivariate models that is they did not consider the spatial correlation of variable information on this basis we propose a hybrid cnn rf model in this study to estimate watershed aet using fewer remote sensing variables the combination of cnn and rf can keep a fast calculation efficiency and reduce uncertainty caused by the scale mismatch problem by using multiple sub grid features instead of the features from a specific pixel the hybrid cnn rf model can improve the accuracy of regional aet estimation by taking advantage of the area characteristics of multi source remote sensing information and has broad application prospects in the following sections the performance of the cnn rf model is compared with that of rf cnn svm and cnn svm methods followed by a variable sensitivity analysis since the ec flux sites in the study basin are not adequate and the monitoring period is relatively short the cr model with reasonable accuracy proved by the ec observations is employed to estimate site level aet notably it is an alternative way to obtain site level aet through a cr model since there are no flux stations within the study basin to reduce error propagation we use the nearest flux station to evaluate the reliability of the cr models forced by its measured meteorological data the most suitable cr model was selected based on the evaluation results in this way the accuracy of the estimated aet is improved the alternative way used herein is a good reference for estimating regional aet in areas with sparse flux sites as it stands the whole premise of the modeling output relies on the input data which is very sparse in other words this is as much a theoretical exercise as a real world simulation the employment of ec observations in regions with sufficient flux sites can increase the confidence in accurately estimating regional aet when applying the proposed method the specific objectives of this study are 1 to estimate regional aet for the tuojiang river basin based on the cnn rf model 2 to assess the comparability between the cnn rf estimated aet and the swat modeled aet in this way the applicability of the cnn rf is further examined 3 to analyze the spatial and temporal variations of the aet over the tuojiang river basin 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the tuojiang river basin is located in southwestern china between 102 5 and 106 e 28 5 and 32 n fig 1 the whole drainage area is 27860 km2 with a 502 km total river length the terrain is dominated by mountains and plains with the elevation ranging from 300 m to 5000 m the land cover is primarily farmland the climate is semi humid with four distinct seasons and abundant rainfall in a year the annual precipitation is about 800 1300 mm and 60 of the total precipitation occurs in the summer the average air temperature is 17 5 and the wind speed is 2 1 m s a hydrological station called the lijiawan hydrological station sits downstream of the main river the average annual streamflow measured at there is 400 m3 s the monthly streamflow measured at the lijiawan hydrological station from 1980 to 2018 is collected an ec flux tower site hongyuan 102 59 e 32 84 n is located in the northern part of the region it also works as a meteorological station the ec site belongs to the upland ecosystem and is classified as alpine meadows delwiche et al 2021 niu and chen 2020 this article will use the ec flux observation data to verify the reliability of the cr estimated aet based on meteorological data 2 2 precipitation data and other data three meteorological variables precipitation wind speed and temperature and one geographic variable elevation are included as the spatial field precipitation and ten meter wind speed are obtained from the terraclimate which is a monthly dataset with a spatial resolution of 4 km and is a global multi source dataset based on high spatial resolution normals from the worldclim database and other data sources the air temperature at a distance of 2 m from the land surface is provided by the fifth generation ecmwf land era5 land dataset it combines ground observations and global scale modeled data compared with era5 the spatial resolution of era5 land is enhanced from 0 25 to 0 1 elevation comes from the digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 90 m obtained by the shuttle radar topography mission all the spatial data of the four variables is resampled to 0 05 in preparation for sub grid feature extraction in situ climate data measured at 24 meteorological stations over the tuojiang river basin is collected from the china meteorological data service center including maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed precipitation and sunshine hours the in situ meteorological data is used to calculate the site level aet based on the cr model the basic information of all the data used in this study is summarized in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 complimentary relationship models the concept of complementary relationship cr was initially proposed by bouchet 1963 assuming little energy exchange and advection as well as thoroughly moist land surface the actual evapotranspiration aet and the potential evapotranspiration ep are equal to the apparent potential evapotranspiration epo in this state as the surface dries out the energy required for the latent heat decreases aet decreases and the excess energy leads to an increase in sensible heat resulting in an increase in ep the feedback of aet to ep is called the complementary relationship the basic equation is as follows 1 e p e po b a e t e po where epo is the evapotranspiration in a wet environment also termed apparent potential evapotranspiration and b is the ratio coefficient when b 1 the increase in aet equals the decrease in ep that is the symmetric cr three commonly used models based on the cr namely the brutsaert strickler model the szilagyi jozsa model and the granger gray model are evaluated by comparing their modeling values with the ec observations at the hongyuan flux site the brutsaert strickler model is based on the research of penman 1948 and priestley and taylor 1972 to calculate ep and epo respectively and derives aet according to eq 1 the szilagyi jozsa model is a modified brutsaert strickler model using the rome wind function to calculate true epo the granger gray model modified the cr to a general equation based on non saturated surfaces by introducing relative evaporation aet ep the specific formulae and derivation process can be found in the literature brutsaert and stricker 1979 granger and gray 1989 szilagyi and jozsa 2008 these three cr models forced by the same daily scale meteorological data are parameterized by the station latitude longitude elevation height of wind instruments etc the cr model with the best performance is used to calculate the site level aet at the 24 meteorological stations over the tuojiang river basin the three models can be implemented in the evapotranspiration package of the r software guo et al 2016 3 2 machine learning models this article compares the performance of the hybrid convolutional neural network and random forests cnn rf with that of the other four machine learning models namely the hybrid convolutional neural network and support vector machine cnn svm the convolutional neural network cnn the random forests rf and the support vector machine svm the architectures of the five machine learning models are nearly the same except for the differences in their spatial information extraction patterns all the five models are constructed using precipitation wind speed air temperature and dem as input variables and the monthly aet as the output variable the data samples from the 24 meteorological stations are split into two datasets the training and the testing datasets spatial information extraction patterns differ in the models because of the non uniform model structures between the cnn based and other traditional machine learning methods thus two patterns are established herein for the models the area to point and the pixel to point patterns the area to point pattern refers to the 11 11 sub grids spatial information corresponding to the aet at the center point and is adopted for the cnn rf the cnn svm and the cnn models in contrast the pixel to point pattern uses the sub grid or pixel closest to the site and is applied to the rf and the svm models a detailed construction process of the cnn rf model is shown below in addition the other four models are also introduced briefly 3 2 1 convolutional neural network the convolutional neural network cnn is a bionic deep learning network that mimics the brain s visual cortex to process and recognize images the cnn applies a mathematical operation called convolution to extract features by sliding along the input matrix automatically as shown in fig 2 the cnn consists of the input layer the convolutional layer the pooling layer the fully connected layer and the output layer panahi et al 2020 zuo et al 2019 the convolutional and pooling layers are alternately connected to form the core module of cnn the size of the feature map is determined by the input matrix of the previous layer the number and size of the convolution kernel the moving strides and the padding method the parameters of each convolution unit are optimized through the backpropagation algorithm each neuron in the same feature map shares weights and is only connected to local neurons in the previous layer the shared weight architecture and local connectivity significantly simplify the networks and reduce the risk of overfitting after the convolution operation an activation function is introduced to transform the linear convolved feature to non linearity in the decision function the basic formula of convolution calculation is as follows 2 z j l i m x i l 1 k ij l b j l 3 x j l f z j l where i and j represent the ith input neuron and the jth output neuron respectively z j l represents the jth output of the convolution operation l is the lth convolutional layer x i l 1 denotes the input to the lth convolutional layer m is the number of input feature maps or the number of image channels if it is the first convolutional layer k ij l is the convolution kernel b j l is the bias value for the jth neuron in layer l x j l is the output of neuron j f represents the activation function f can be the sigmod tanh or relu function rectified linear unit or linear rectification function the relu function is commonly used in deep neural networks due to its faster calculation and good generalization ability the definition of the relu function is shown below 4 f z j l max 0 z j l after feature extraction from the convolutional layer the obtained feature maps are usually down sampled by a pooling layer downsampling layer to reduce computation downsampling does not change the number of feature maps but can reduce the size and prevent overfitting downsampling methods include average sampling maximum sampling overlap sampling normalized sampling random sampling etc the formula of pooling calculation is as follows 5 o j l 1 d o w n x j l where o j l 1 is the output of the l 1 th layer after pooling operation down is the pooling function a fully connected layer is located at the end of cnn in this layer the feature map loses its spatial structure the features extracted from the previous layers are flattened into a one dimensional feature vector and nonlinearly combined to obtain input for the next layer 6 y k w k x k 1 b k where yk denotes the output of the kth fully connected layer xk 1 is the input of the kth fully connected layer wk and bk are the weight and bias respectively 3 2 2 random forests in 2001 breiman 2001 proposed the random forests rf the core idea of rf is the decision tree and bootstrap aggregating bagging the decision tree is a tree like classifier bagging is an ensemble technique of training the decision tree classifier by resampling n new subsets from the original dataset with replacement every tree is independently grown by the sampling dataset in the training process and each node is split using the best variable in the subset for regression problems the predicted result is the average of the predictions from all trees compared with other machine learning methods the rf algorithm significantly improves the calculation efficiency with a lower error and reduces the noise out of bag oob error estimation is used to determine the optimal parameter set that is the number of variables at each split mty and the number of decision trees ntree these two parameters directly influence the performance of the rf algorithm the rf can manage big data and high dimensional data effectively this advantage makes it a suitable tool for handling remotely sensed information the modeling process can be expressed as 7 g rf t x 1 t t 1 t m t x θ t where mt is the prediction result of decision tree t t is the number of the ensemble trees x is the input features θ t characterizes the terminal node values split variables and other parameters in decision tree t 3 2 3 hybrid cnn rf model the hybrid cnn rf model mainly comprises two modules the cnn spatial feature extraction module and the rf estimation module the fully connected and output layers at the end of the cnn are removed and replaced with the rf module the cnn module acts as an information extractor the rf module mainly regresses the feature vectors extracted by the cnn and the site level aet and performs regional aet estimation the proposed hybrid cnn rf uses an area to point pattern to extract the spatial characteristics of various geographical and meteorological variables associated with aet around the target area this area to point pattern takes 11 11 sub grids centered at the meteorological station to obtain the area characteristics the 11 11 sub grids ensure that they cover the same number of sub grids here five sub grids on all four sides when centered on each weather station also the 11 11 sub grids can provide enough information without being too redundant as we mentioned above the remotely sensed data is resampled to the spatial resolution of 0 05 that is to say the area information with a radius of 0 25 can be used as a reference for the site level aet this area to point pattern provides more spatial auxiliary information around the site and reduces the uncertainty caused by the scale mismatch problem the specific steps for applying this method are as follows 1 first normalization is performed for all the input data including precipitation dem temperature and wind speed to accelerate convergence then an image extraction area with a dimension of 11 11 4 is constructed at each meteorological site to obtain spatial information 11 11 represents the feature width and height and 4 is the image channel number of variables as shown in fig 3 the architecture of the cnn module is mainly composed of three convolutional layers and one pooling layer in addition two dropout layers are added to improve the generalization ability and prevent overfitting the kernel size is 3 3 and the pooling window is 2 2 the max pooling and relu are selected as the pooling function and the activation function respectively 2 after one dense layer the output features from the cnn module are fed into the rf module based on the minimum oob error principle the optimal parameters are obtained which are 10 for mtry and 200 for ntree respectively 3 seventy percent of the data at the 24 sites are randomly sampled as the training dataset the remaining thirty percent are the test dataset to train and test the cnn rf model respectively the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse the correlation coefficient cc and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse are used to evaluate the modeling performance finally the trained model is applied to the entire watershed to obtain regional aet 3 2 4 support vector machine and hybrid cnn support vector machine as a general machine learning algorithm the support vector machine svm was initially proposed by vapnik 1963 drucker et al 1997 developed it for regression and prediction analysis the basic principle of svm is to find an optimal classification line or hyperplane that can separate the samples without error and maximize the classification margin for nonlinearly separable samples the input variables can be mapped to a high dimensional space hilbert space through nonlinear transformation the svm finds the best compromise between model complexity and learning ability according to limited sample information so as to minimize the structural risk and obtain the best learning generalization ability therefore this method can be applied to solve small sample nonlinear and high dimensional problems and is often used for identification and prediction a more detailed introduction of the svm can be found in the literature chia et al 2020 zendehboudi et al 2018 the cnn svm algorithm consists of a cnn based feature extraction module and an svm based regression module the cnn module comprises three convolutional layers a pooling layer and a fully connected layer which extracts the spatial information and flattens it into a one dimensional feature vector the svm module regresses the feature vector extracted from the cnn module with the target site level aet the area to point feature extraction pattern is adopted in the cnn svm model established in this study whose input data and main structure are consistent with the cnn rf model 3 3 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed physical model it simulates the water cycle process according to the water balance equation the tuojiang river basin is delineated into 116 sub basins and each sub basin is aggregated from 1 to 10 hydrological response units the data required for driving the swat modeling comprises meteorological data air temperature wind speed precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation and geographic data dem land use and soil the swat simulated aet consists of three components free water evapotranspiration intercepted by the canopy vegetation transpiration and sublimation or soil evapotranspiration the canopy evapotranspiration is mainly determined by the free water intercepted by the canopy the transpiration and soil evaporation are set to be proportional to the potential evapotranspiration and are related to the vegetation cover leaf area index or soil property soil cover index the swat model is calibrated and validated by the monthly streamflow measured at the lijiawan hydrological station four indices namely cc bias rmse and mae are used to assess the correlation and deviation between the aet estimated using the cnn rf model and the swat simulated aet based on the water balance principle the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliff efficiency nse and percent bias pbias are introduced to evaluate the hydrological performance of the swat model values of r 2 and nse range between 0 and 1 the higher their values the better the modeling the index pbias is used to measure the deviation of the modeled streamflow from the observations if pbias 0 the streamflow is underestimated and vice versa 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the modeling performance between machine learning methods the hongyuan flux site with a total of 876 daily measurements 21 may 2015 to 21 november 2015 and 10 february 2016 to 31 december 2017 is used as ground truth to identify the appropriate cr model note that the missing data of ec observations is from 22 november 2015 to 9 february 2016 and the comparison in fig 4 is made when the ec observations are available as shown in table 2 and fig 4 the granger gray model performs the best among the three empirical models with the highest cc 0 85 and lowest values of mae and rmse 0 55 mm and 0 76 mm respectively in addition the granger gray model estimated aet is all positive zero means no evapotranspiration which is more meaningful than the estimations from the szilagyi jozsa model and the brutsaert stricker model with negative values thus this study chooses the granger gray model to calculate the site level aet the daily aet estimated by the granger gray model is then aggregated into the monthly aet note that if there are enough ec flux sites in the area the ec observations are preferred rather than the cr based estimations the performance metrics for the machine learning models driven by all the four input variables are summarized in fig 5 and tables 3 6 fig 5 presents the minimum the first quartile the median the third quartile and the maximum of the granger gray model estimated aet and the predicted aet along with the corresponding probability density distribution one can find that the cnn rf model performs the best according to the evaluation metrics and the comparison of the probability density distribution between the model estimated values and the target values the cc and nse for the cnn rf model are the highest 0 97 and 0 95 respectively and the corresponding mae and rmse are the lowest 4 02 mm and 6 29 mm respectively the performance of the rf model ranks second followed by the svm compared with the mae and rmse for the cnn rf model those for the rf model increase by 10 and 30 respectively and those for the svm model increase by 64 and 46 respectively the cnn is poor at estimating extreme values the mae and rmse for the cnn model are 7 87 mm and 10 30 mm respectively nearly twice those for the cnn rf model the cnn svm model performs the worst with the cc and nse of only 0 85 and 0 69 respectively the corresponding mae and rmse 13 09 and 16 12 respectively are almost three times those for the cnn rf model then we analyzed the sensitivity of the models performance in estimating the aet to the input variables by comparing the original models performances with those of new models using only three input variables the modeling results from the original models and the new ones are shown in fig 6 and tables 3 6 the numbers in the parentheses in tables 3 6 are percentage changes in the performance metrics when the aet estimation model is driven by three input variables instead of the original four input variables all models show a decline in the ability to estimate the aet due to information loss it is indicated by increases in the rmse and mae and decreases in the cc and nse the variables may impact the models differently for example the mae for the cnn rf model increases by 15 9 due to the loss of precipitation information by contrast the mae for the cnn rf model increases by 37 in the absence of air temperature compared with the other three meteorological factors the geographic factor dem has less influence on the five models this is probably because the dem is not a time varying variable it only provides static geographic information among the models cnn and cnn svm show higher sensitivity to the dem for example the rmse for the cnn model increases by 18 83 without using the dem as the input while the rmse for the rf model only increases by 1 6 air temperature is a critical meteorological variable in the models for example when the air temperature is omitted from the input variables the rmse for cnn rf cnn svm cnn rf and svm increased by 39 58 36 78 18 45 4 31 and 34 35 respectively these increases are more than twice those caused by omitting the dem the robustness of the aet estimation model is sensitive to whether air temperature is used as an input variable this makes sense in physics as the air temperature rises the movement of water molecules becomes active and the energy exchange also intensifies accordingly that is to say the potential evapotranspiration capacity increases the conversion process of liquid water to vapor is accelerated increasing the aet the cnn rf model integrates the advantages of cnn and rf modules consequently behaving superior to the other models in recognizing remote sensing information compared with the rf and cnn models the mae for the cnn rf model reduces by 10 and 48 and the rmse reduces by 22 and 38 respectively the area to point information extraction pattern adopted in the cnn rf model can provide more regional features around the site for reference which is helpful to correct the deviation of modeling results in addition the rf module is good at processing high dimensional data extracted from the cnn module and has strong resistance to over fitting the cnn rf model overcomes the shortcomings of the cnn on extreme values estimation fig 5c when the cnn is coupled with the rf the cnn module extracts more spatial features and is fed into the rf model enabling the variable information to be reflected in the cnn rf model moreover the cnn rf differentiates the features from the diverse information sources while the rf shows less sensitivity to the variables fig 6 the cnn svm is inferior to the cnn rf in processing big data as the sample size or the number of features increases the dimensionality obtained through the kernel function mapping in the svm increases significantly especially when the cnn hybridizes with the svm more feature information is fed into the svm which can easily lead to over fitting and increase the computation cost this may be why the performance of cnn svm is significantly lower than that of svm 4 2 comparison between the cnn rf estimated aet and the swat modeled aet at the sub basin scale regional aet can be acquired by applying the cnn rf model to the entire watershed the swat modeled aet is used as the reference to evaluate the rationality of the spatial distribution of the cnn rf estimated aet forced by in situ meteorological data the swat based hydrological model of the tuojiang river basin is established calibration and validation are performed using the monthly streamflow measured at the lijiawan hydrological station as shown in fig 7 the performance is good in the calibration period 1980 1999 with r 2 and nse equaling 0 94 and 0 97 respectively and the pbias at only 5 9 the simulation ability declines during the validation period 2000 2018 for example r 2 and nse drop to 0 79 and 0 71 respectively and the pbias rises to 25 7 the levene s test is conducted to assess the equality of variances between the observed streamflow and the swat simulated streamflow in the validation period the p value 0 0433 is below 5 the null hypothesis of equal variances is rejected and it is concluded that there is a difference between the variances in the two series in 2000 2018 the mean of the observed streamflow was 412 67 m3 s and that of the simulated streamflow was 306 30 m3 s according to the variance calculation result the fluctuation magnitude of the simulated streamflow is lower than that of the observed streamflow the swat model assumes that factors such as river shape land cover soil properties etc remain constant and boil down to one set of parameters that is the parameters derived from the calibration phase are stationary however the external environment is very complex and has many uncertainties the parameters obtained in the calibration phase may not fully reproduce the real world for the future period this is probably the main reason for the reduced performance in the validation phase nevertheless the validation performance is still satisfactory according to the evaluation criteria in the literature duan et al 2019 the swat modeled aet after streamflow calibration can be used to assess the aet estimated by other models chun et al 2018 dash et al 2021 the swat modeled aet and the cnn rf estimated aet are compared using different indices at the 116 sub basins note that the nearest grid value to the sub basin center and the average value of all hydrological response units in the sub basin represent the sub basin aet of cnn rf and swat respectively as shown in fig 8 there is no significant difference between the swat modeled aet and the cnn rf estimated aet across the entire basin specifically the correlation coefficient of the two products ranges between 0 84 and 0 94 the bias over most sub basins is within 10 the rmse is mainly below 20 mm and the mae is between 10 mm and 20 mm in other words the aet results estimated by the two methods are close in the watershed and the difference in magnitude is acceptable these results demonstrate that the cnn rf has relatively high generalization ability in space and the estimated aet has excellent potential in hydrological applications 4 3 spatial temporal variations of the cnn rf estimated aet fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the multi year 1981 2020 average monthly aet over the tuojiang river basin and the inter monthly distribution of the domain averaged aet the difference in monthly aet across the watershed is minor it is between 42 mm month and 54 mm month over the basin with less aet in the high latitudes and more aet in the low latitudes the domain averaged aet varies significantly throughout the year with the highest of 120 mm in july and the lowest of 10 mm in december this variation is consistent with trends in the precipitation and temperature changes fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of seasonal aet the aet gradually increases from north to south in the four seasons this spatial difference in the aet amount is most intense in summer june to august reaching 80 mm spring march to may comes second with a difference of 60 mm between north and south in autumn september to november the aet difference over the entire basin is half of that in summer the spatial difference almost disappears in winter december to february the total aet in spring is about 150 190 mm and it peaks in summer reaching 220 300 mm in autumn the aet falls back to 100 140 mm lower than that in spring the aet in winter is less than 100 mm on the annual scale as shown in fig 11 the spatial difference of annual aet from north to south is about 140 mm which is equivalent to the total aet in autumn the average annual aet in the watershed is 600 mm this means that approximately 16 716 km3 of water evaporates from the land surface every year considering the basin area of 27860 km2 the trends in seasonal and annual aet changes during 1981 2020 are depicted in figs 12 and 13 overall the upward trend dominates the most area the rate of change is different in the four seasons and it is not completely synchronized in space in spring and summer nearly 82 3 and 67 9 of the basin area respectively show a significant upward trend especially in the south of 30 n the highest upward trend can reach 1 2 mm year in contrast the seasonal aet in autumn and winter increases slightly in the basin s southern part with the rate between 0 2 and 0 7 mm year the central area 30 n 31 n in these two seasons even shows a downward trend on the annual scale as shown in fig 13 a b nearly 83 6 pass the t test p 0 05 of the catchment area shows a significant increasing trend except that a small portion of the middle area shows an insignificant downward trends the average rate of increase in the north is between 1 0 and 2 0 mm year while the increasing trend is more dramatic in the south reaching 3 5 mm year the domain averaged aet fluctuated around 580 mm from 1981 to 1997 and significantly increased after 1997 with a 3 37 mm year growth rate fig 13c overall the aet increased slightly at 1 59 mm year from 1981 to 2020 pass the t test p 0 05 the mean of annual aet is 583 40 mm in 1981 1997 and 609 69 mm in 1998 2020 the levene s test is performed to identify whether the variances of the annual aet in the two periods are equal the p value 0 025 is below 5 this test result supports the conclusion that there is a significant difference between the two variances the fluctuation of annual aet is less in 1981 1997 than 1998 2020 global climate change may raise the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events this might be the reason for the increased fluctuation in aet the spatial and seasonal variation of the aet is closely related to changes in meteorological factors such as precipitation air temperature and wind speed fig 14 shows the distribution of monthly aet air temperature wind speed and precipitation in the four seasons from 1981 to 2020 the changes in temperature and precipitation over four seasons are consistent with the aet with the largest in summer and the smallest in winter the seasonal distribution of wind speed is not similar to the aet however wind speed is an essential factor in adjusting the aet distribution in the seasons as observed in fig 14 precipitation and air temperature in spring are no more than that in autumn however the aet is higher in spring than autumn it is probably due to the highest wind speed in spring fig 15 shows the probability density distributions of monthly aet air temperature and precipitation as well as their correlations in four seasons air temperature is the most related variable to the aet and no significant correlation is found between wind speed and the aet in summer and autumn the cc between air temperature and aet reaches 0 925 the cc between precipitation and the aet in spring and autumn is 0 65 and 0 71 respectively and can reach 0 79 in the whole year the changes in precipitation and air temperature control the variation of annual aet from 1981 to 2020 as shown in fig 16 the air temperature in the entire watershed presents a significant upward trend the growth rate is 0 3 0 4 per decade air temperature in the middle and south increased faster than in the north at the same time the annual precipitation fig 17 showed a significant downward trend from 1981 to 1997 with an average rate of around 13 21 mm year by contrast a significant upward trend with an average rate of 9 59 mm year appeared in 1998 2020 moreover the upward trend of annual precipitation from 1998 to 2020 is dramatic in the north and south and slows down in the middle consistent with the spatial change of annual aet no evident trend was found in wind speed during this period the domain averaged annual aet shows a consistent response to precipitation and temperature changes 5 conclusions this study proposed a hybrid cnn rf model for estimating regional aet based on several explanatory variables and applied it to the tuojiang river basin the explanatory variables include remotely sensed meteorological information precipitation wind speed and air temperature and geographic data the dem the estimated monthly aet with a high spatial resolution of 0 5 was consistent with the swat modeled aet over sub basins air temperature and precipitation were identified as two governing factors that influenced the variations of aet on the basin the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the cnn rf model shows significant superiorities in estimating regional aet over cnn rf svm and svm rf models the cc and nse between the cnn rf estimated aet and the target values are the highest 0 97 and 0 95 respectively and the corresponding mae and rmse are the lowest 4 02 mm and 6 29 mm respectively the cnn rf model can better capture spatial information using the cnn module and converge fast while maintaining good sensitivity to explanatory variables the variable sensitivity analysis of the aet estimation models shows that the dem has less influence on the model performance than the other three meteorological factors in addition air temperature plays an essential role in the models 2 the cnn rf estimated aet shows good agreement with the swat modeled aet over the tuojiang river basin the correlation coefficients of the two aet products in 116 sub basins range between 0 84 and 0 94 the bias values are mainly distributed within 10 the rmse values are 20 mm and the mae values are between 10 mm and 20 mm these results indicate that the cnn rf has a good generalization ability in space based on continuously distributed variables and demonstrate the accuracy of the estimated aet therefore the cnn rf estimated aet has excellent potential in hydrological applications 3 the aet estimated by the cnn rf model shows an increasing trend from north to south over the tuojiang river basin this spatial difference is intensified in summer and virtually disappears in winter in addition a significant upward trend for seasonal and annual aet during 1981 2020 is observed the aet has a relatively strong correlation with air temperature and precipitation with the cc of 0 925 and 0 79 respectively changing characteristics of these two meteorological variables govern the overall increase in annual aet during 1981 2020 1 59 mm year this result may help understand the interaction between various meteorological factors in the context of global warming credit authorship contribution statement yao li conceptualization visualization

3258,remote sensing based evapotranspiration et products have been evaluated primarily using data from northern middle latitudes therefore little is known about their performance at low latitudes to address this bias an evaluation dataset was compiled using eddy covariance data from 40 sites between latitudes 30 s and 30 n the flux data were obtained from the emerging network in mexico mexflux and from openly available databases of fluxnet asiaflux and ozflux this unique reference dataset was then used to evaluate remote sensing based et products in environments that have been underrepresented in earlier studies the evaluated products were modis et mod16 both the discontinued collection 5 c5 and the latest collection c6 global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam et and atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi et products were compared with unadjusted fluxes etorig and with fluxes corrected for the lack of energy balance closure etebc three common statistical metrics were used coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias the effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on product evaluation results was investigated by examining the relationship between the statistical metrics and product specific vegetation match indexes evaluation results of this study and those published in the literature were used to examine the performance of the products across latitudes differences between the mod16 collection 5 and 6 datasets were generally smaller than differences with the other products performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether etorig or etebc was used when using etorig gleam generally had the highest r2 smallest pbias and best rmse values across the studied land cover types and climate zones neither mod16 nor alexi performed consistently better than the other when using etebc none of the products stood out in terms of both low bias and strong correlations the use of etebc instead of etorig affected the biases more than the correlations the product evaluation results showed no significant relationship with the degree of match between the vegetation at the pixel and site scale the latitudinal comparison showed tendencies of lower r2 all products but better pbias and normalized rmse values mod16 and gleam for forests at low latitudes than for forests at northern middle latitudes for non forest vegetation the products showed no clear latitudinal differences in performance keywords mod16 gleam alexi tropics subtropics 1 introduction the low latitudes 30 s 30 n are characterized by large contrasts in terrestrial evapotranspiration et they are home to tropical rainforests and other ecosystems with abundant rainfall where energy radiation is the main constraint to et see for example fisher et al 2009 bruijnzeel et al 2011 they are also home to tropical and subtropical arid and semi arid ecosystems where et is limited by water supply see for example eamus et al 2013 delgado balbuena et al 2019 estimates of et for this region are needed for local and regional applications such as water resource management and drought monitoring and for global applications such as climate change studies wang and dickinson 2012 fisher et al 2017 the spatial and temporal scale of these applications require other methods than those used to study et at the plot to ecosystem scale i e lysimeter sap flow and micrometeorological methods recently the potential of remote sensing based et estimates for these purposes has been recognized dolman et al 2014 fisher et al 2017 sheffield et al 2018 since the 1990s numerous remote sensing based et models have been developed see zhang et al 2016a for an overview these models can be broadly divided into three categories in no specific order models based on the 1 penman monteith monteith 1965 or 2 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 equations and 3 models that determine the sensible heat flux h and calculate et or latent heat flux le as the residual of the surface energy balance i e so called seb models wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016a chen and liu 2020 of interest to the user community is the development of global et products from these models that are readily available to the public and regularly updated to include the latest data two such datasets have been produced since the early 2010s 1 the modis et product based on the mod16 algorithm penman monteith type model mu et al 2007 2011 running et al 2019 and 2 the et product from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam priestley taylor type model miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 more recently global et datasets based on the seb model of senay et al 2013 senay et al 2020 and the penman monteith leuning pml model of zhang et al 2016b zhang et al 2019b have become available efforts are also underway to develop a global et product based on the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model another seb based approach anderson et al 2011 hain and anderson 2017 holmes et al 2018 measurements of et from eddy covariance flux towers have been used as the standard reference data against which remote sensing based et products are evaluated miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2011 holmes et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b senay et al 2020 despite the problems related to the lack of energy balance closure observed at eddy covariance sites and the scale difference between the flux footprint and the model pixels see below broadly speaking two different types of evaluation studies can be distinguished 1 those that evaluate the published et datasets hereafter referred to as product evaluation studies and 2 those that evaluate the performance of the underlying models model evaluation studies in the latter type of study all models are run with the same input data to isolate the effect of different modeling approaches from differences in forcing data vinukollu et al 2011a b mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 melo et al 2021 because remote sensing et models are sensitive to changes in input data vinukollu et al 2011b badgley et al 2015 the results of model evaluation studies do not necessarily apply to the actual products the performance of remote sensing based et products at low latitudes is largely unknown because most evaluation studies have focused on the northern middle latitudes 30 n 60 n miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2011 kim et al 2012 hu et al 2015 velpuri et al 2013 tang et al 2015 reitz et al 2017 holmes et al 2018 khan et al 2018 the few studies that evaluated et products at low latitudes did this at a small number two to five of eddy covariance sites ruhoff et al 2013 ramoelo et al 2014 aguilar et al 2018 souza et al 2019 the bias toward the northern middle latitudes can be explained by geographic differences in the availability of eddy covariance data schimel et al 2015 villarreal and vargas 2021 because of the lack of evaluation results from the low latitudes it is unknown whether global remote sensing based et products perform equally well at all latitudes one can think of several reasons why this might not be the case for example the mod16 et algorithm was calibrated using eddy covariance data from sites located primarily in the us and canada mu et al 2011 hence it is possible that the model is less accurate in other regions of the world including the low latitudes zhang et al 2019a similarly gleam uses constant values for the priestley taylor coefficient α miralles et al 2011 while α varies with climate shuttleworth 1993 and forest type komatsu 2005 because the distribution of climate and forest types is related to latitude the use of constant values for α may result in apparent latitude dependent biases in et latitudinal differences in product performance can also be caused by regional differences in input data quality vinukollu et al 2011b or cloud cover running et al 2019 while eddy covariance observations of et are probably the best option to evaluate remote sensing datasets there are two problems to consider 1 the energy balance observed at eddy covariance sites is usually not closed and 2 the footprint of the eddy covariance observations and the pixels of the et products have different spatial scales the degree of energy balance closure is quantified by the energy balance ratio ebr which is the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes h le to available energy a wilson et al 2002 available energy is the difference between net radiation r n and changes in energy storage the average ebr observed at eddy covariance sites is about 0 8 wilson et al 2002 stoy et al 2013 while the cause of the energy imbalance is still being investigated there are several plausible explanations including the systematic underestimation of the eddy covariance fluxes frank et al 2016 gao et al 2017 mauder et al 2020 as a practical solution to the closure problem the energy surplus is added to h and le because it is unknown in what proportion the energy should be divided between the fluxes mauder et al 2020 the surplus is usually distributed in proportion to the magnitude of h and le which preserves the bowen ratio twine et al 2000 comparisons with independent estimates of et have yielded contrasting results with some studies finding better agreement for energy balance closure corrected et barr et al 2012 mauder et al 2018 and others for unadjusted et denager et al 2020 although the energy balance closure problem has been recognized for many years wilson et al 2002 foken et al 2011 its effect on the evaluation results of remote sensing based et products or models has rarely been examined michel et al 2016 melton et al 2021 the evaluation results can also be affected by the scale difference between the footprint of the eddy covariance observations and the pixels of the et products the flux footprint is typically smaller than 1 km2 chu et al 2021 while the pixel sizes of et products are as small as 0 25 km2 mod16 and as large as 750 km2 gleam the scale difference can result in a mismatch in vegetation between pixel and site hobeichi et al 2018 jiménez et al 2018 such a mismatch may also result from errors in the vegetation input data used by the models due to for example incorrect classification because most models calculate et using land cover specific parameters anderson et al 2007 miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2011 a mismatch between the actual vegetation of the observation site and that detected in the model pixel could potentially affect the evaluation results hu et al 2015 however the few studies that have examined this issue found no clear effect hobeichi et al 2018 jiménez et al 2018 the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the performance of the mod16 and gleam global et products as well as of et based on the alexi model at 40 eddy covariance sites in the low latitudes 2 examine the effect of the energy balance closure problem on product evaluation results 3 examine the dependence of product evaluation results on the vegetation match between pixel and site and 4 investigate potential latitudinal dependence of product performance the mod16 and gleam products were chosen because they are the longest regularly produced remote sensing based et datasets from mod16 both the discontinued collection 5 c5 and the latest collection c6 were evaluated mu et al 2011 running et al 2019 in the case of gleam the v3 3a dataset was evaluated martens et al 2017 while most applications of alexi have focused on the continental us recent efforts have paved the way for routine global implementation of alexi hain and anderson 2017 the reference dataset compiled in this study provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate the performance of alexi at low latitudes the products were evaluated using a reference dataset of eddy covariance observations including data from the emerging flux network in mexico mexflux vargas et al 2013 delgado balbuena et al 2018 and from openly available databases of fluxnet pastorello et al 2020 asiaflux and ozflux beringer et al 2016 2 methods 2 1 data the remote sensing based et products evaluated in this study have different spatial and temporal resolutions table 1 the comparisons with the eddy covariance et observations were made at the original spatial resolution of each product except in the case of mod16 c6 for which the 500 m data were resampled to a 1 km resolution to match mod16 c5 using the original spatial resolution is the common practice when evaluating these products against eddy covariance data see references in table s4 an exception was made for mod16 c6 to allow for a more direct comparison with the previous c5 version the effect of the scale mismatch between product pixel and flux footprint on the evaluation results was examined using the vegetation match index section 2 3 for each product et data were obtained from the pixels matching the location of the flux towers velpuri et al 2013 hu et al 2015 to evaluate all products at the same temporal resolution some performance statistics depend on the temporal resolution of the data the daily gleam and alexi data were averaged over the 8 day modis interval this was the highest common temporal resolution possible among the evaluated datasets likewise the eddy covariance data were averaged to yield mean daily et for each modis interval section 2 1 4 the remote sensing et products were evaluated by grouping the data by land cover type and climate zone section 2 2 the eddy covariance data from the various sites were collected during different periods between 2000 and 2019 with the length of the data records ranging from 1 to 11 years table 2 hence the flux datasets for a given land cover type or climate zone may not coincide in time in addition data availability varied among the evaluated products mod16 c5 was discontinued in 2015 and gleam data for 2019 were not available at the time of download table 1 for gleam and alexi seven and four sites respectively were omitted from the analysis because the fraction of open water in the corresponding pixels was too high due to proximity to the coast sections 2 1 2 and 2 1 3 this problem did not affect mod16 because of the smaller pixel size as a result the amount of data available for each of the comparisons by land cover type and climate zone often varied from product to product table 3 ideally one would compare the products using a common reference dataset i e same sites and same modis intervals however this would reduce the amount of available data by about one third 12 fewer sites and about 36 fewer modis intervals therefore it was decided to perform the regression analysis of observations versus product estimates section 2 2 1 and the comparison of the performance statistics by land cover type and climate zone sections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 using the complete dataset the extent to which the two approaches all data or a common reference dataset may have influenced the results was examined through a sensitivity analysis section 2 2 4 the seasonal trend analysis section 2 2 5 was performed using the common reference dataset the mod16 and gleam et data were extracted from the published global et datasets because detailed information about the models and datasets used to generate these products can be found in the references listed in table 1 only a brief explanation is provided below the alexi et data were calculated specifically for this study the methodology is described in anderson et al 2011 and hain and anderson 2017 for completeness the main features of the model and the specific input datasets used are briefly described below 2 1 1 modis et data the mod16 et product is derived using a three source penman monteith model which estimates et as the sum of evaporation from the dry canopy transpiration wet canopy interception loss and soil mu et al 2007 2011 separate calculations are performed for the day and night the model uses modis retrievals of albedo for the calculation of r n fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fpar to partition r n between canopy and soil land cover type to assign the physiological parameters needed to calculate the leaf stomatal and aerodynamic resistances and leaf area index to calculate the bulk canopy resistances the land cover specific parameters in the mod16 algorithm were obtained by comparison with eddy covariance flux data from 46 sites located primarily in the us and canada mod16 c5 used c4 mod12q1 land cover type 2 data while mod16 c6 uses the mcdlchkm product running et al 2019 the meteorological data incoming shortwave radiation and air temperature and humidity are obtained from reanalysis products modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 for c5 and goddard earth observing system model version 5 geos 5 for c6 transpiration and soil evaporation are constrained by vapor pressure deficit vpd i e there is no soil moisture control the c5 data were downloaded from the university of montana s numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg website https www ntsg umt edu project modis mod16 php the c6 data were obtained from nasa s land processes distributed active archive center lp daac https lpdaac usgs gov the gap filled version of the c6 dataset was used the gap filling method is the same as that used for mod16 c5 running et al 2019 apart from the difference in resolution the c5 and c6 datasets were produced using different reanalysis datasets and different modis vegetation and albedo products 2 1 2 gleam et data in gleam et is defined as the sum of the following processes transpiration from short and tall vegetation bare soil evaporation rainfall interception loss from tall vegetation open water evaporation and snow sublimation miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 the rainfall interception loss module is based on the gash 1979 analytical rainfall interception model miralles et al 2010 gleam v3 3a used the measures vcf5kyrv001 product hansen et al 2018 to determine the fractions of bare soil short vegetation and tall vegetation the model first calculates potential et with the priestley taylor equation using r n and air temperature from reanalysis data era interim for bare soil and short vegetation the typical value of 1 26 is used for the priestley taylor α coefficient while for tall vegetation α 0 97 martens et al 2017 actual et is calculated by multiplying potential evaporation with land cover dependent stress functions the stress functions simulate soil water constraints on transpiration and soil evaporation soil water content is estimated using a multilayer running water balance model that uses a merged precipitation product et from the previous time step and microwave surface soil moisture as the main inputs the soil is divided in three layers shallow 0 10 cm intermediate 10 100 cm and deep 100 250 cm tall vegetation can extract water from all three layers short vegetation can extract water from the shallow and intermediate layers and for bare soil evaporation only water from the shallow layer is available the stress functions for vegetation also simulate the effect of phenology using microwave vegetation optical depth the data were accessed through the gleam website https www gleam eu gleam pixels containing more than 20 open water were excluded this concerned a total of seven sites table s2 the open water fraction owf was obtained from the mod44b product section 2 3 this filtering was performed only for gleam in the case of alexi sites affected by the presence of open water were filtered out during production of the dataset section 2 1 3 while in the case of mod16 no sites were affected because of the smaller pixel size 2 1 3 alexi et data the alexi algorithm consists of a two source seb model coupled with an atmospheric boundary layer model anderson et al 1997 2007 the latent heat flux is calculated separately for the canopy and soil an initial estimate of the canopy le is obtained using the priestley taylor equation with α 1 26 assuming potential transpiration next the soil le is calculated as the residual of the energy balance if the resulting soil le is negative the actual canopy le must be less than the potential value which may indicate an effect of soil water limitation on transpiration the α coefficient is then reduced until the residual soil le is non negative the calculated le represents the instantaneous flux at approximately one hour before local noon this time corresponds to the end of the time span over which h is calculated see below the instantaneous latent heat fluxes are extrapolated to daily et values by multiplying by the ratio of daily total to instantaneous shortwave radiation and dividing by the latent heat of vaporization the alexi algorithm calculates h from the morning rise in the radiometric surface temperature hain and anderson 2017 by using the temporal change in surface temperature the effect of bias in the temperature retrievals on h is minimized this alexi implementation uses the modis land surface temperature product myd11c1 retrieved using a generalized split window atmospheric compensation technique wan et al 2004 the composite values of surface temperature are partitioned between canopy and soil using estimates of vegetation cover fraction from leaf area index the leaf area index data were obtained from the 8 day modis mod15a3 product myneni et al 2002 instead of using absolute values of air temperature alexi uses the slope of the vertical temperature profile lapse rate in the boundary layer the lapse rate profile as well as the surface longwave radiation flux and wind speed were obtained from the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis product cfs r cfsrv2 saha et al 2011 incoming shortwave radiation fluxes were obtained from the ceres syn1deg product doelling 2012 soil heat flux is calculated as a diurnal varying function of net radiation santanello and friedl 2003 the alexi model uses land cover data to assign canopy parameters such as canopy height to calculate the aerodynamic resistances to h and leaf absorptivity to estimate r n for the canopy and soil the land cover data were obtained from the modis mcd12c1 product land cover type 2 since the thermal infrared based surface temperature observations are only available during clear sky conditions alexi employs a gap filling technique to generate estimates of weekly totals the clear sky fraction of actual et to incoming radiation is interpolated to a daily record and then multiplied by the daily incoming radiation to generate a complete record along the coast the coarse scale meteorological inputs result in limited retrievals this is why four coastal sites table s2 are not included in the alexi dataset 2 1 4 eddy covariance et data data from four different flux networks mexflux fluxnet asiaflux ozflux were used to evaluate the et products the data from mexflux were obtained directly from the site pis 12 sites because they were not available through a repository the data from the other networks were obtained through the respective web based portals fluxnet data available under the open data policy tier 1 of the fluxnet2015 dataset were used pastorello et al 2020 this dataset includes a total of 28 sites between latitudes 30 s and 30 n from ozflux and asiaflux openly available data from sites not included in fluxnet2015 were considered three and nine sites respectively prior to the more extensive data quality control see below sites for which the data record was too short 1 year latent heat flux data were not available or the degree of energy balance closure was too low ebr 0 5 were excluded one site from mexflux four sites from fluxnet and seven sites from asiaflux this left a total of 40 sites for further analysis fig 1 table 2 information needed for the correction of the soil heat flux g data or for the calculation of the sensible and latent heat storage terms s see below was obtained from the metadata accompanying the datasets from articles or other publications or directly from the site pis the remote sensing et products were evaluated using the mean daily eddy covariance et mm day 1 calculated for each modis interval the comparisons were made using the unadjusted eddy covariance fluxes etorig and those corrected for the lack of energy balance closure etebc fluxnet2015 includes corrected fluxes pastorello et al 2020 but the datasets from the other networks do not for consistency the fluxes were corrected using the same method for all datasets including fluxnet2015 after filling the missing half hourly or hourly values see below a correction factor was calculated for each modis interval as a h le where each term is the average daytime flux in w m 2 see above for definition of terms daytime was defined as having solar radiation greater than 10 w m 2 this method is based on the assumption that h and le were underestimated by the same percentage twine et al 2000 the available energy was calculated as r n g s the correction was only applied to the daytime data because in absolute terms the missing energy is small during the night stoy et al 2013 mauder et al 2020 so that the correction will have little effect on total daily et in addition this eliminated the need to ensure the completeness and consistency of the energy balance data for the nighttime period the daytime and nighttime le as well as the other energy balance terms only daytime data were converted from energy units w m 2 to millimetres mm using a constant value for the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 the unadjusted nighttime fluxes were added to daytime etorig and etebc to give daily etorig and etebc data on g were available for 24 of the 40 sites at all these sites g was measured using the soil heat flux plate method sauer 2002 for six sites the measurements were not corrected for heat storage above the plates mayocchi and bristow 1995 this correction was applied retrospectively using the method of wang and bou zeid 2012 this method calculates g at the soil surface which is required in the energy balance calculations from the time series of g at any depth it requires the thermal diffusivity of the soil which was calculated as the ratio of soil thermal conductivity to soil volumetric heat capacity the thermal conductivity was calculated following lu et al 2014 using site specific soil physical data the volumetric heat capacity was calculated from soil bulk density and soil moisture for sites without data on g but with data on soil temperature seven sites g was estimated using the method of hsieh et al 2009 estimates of g derived from temperature measurements at depths 2 cm were corrected for heat storage using the method of wang and bou zeid 2012 for the remaining nine sites g was estimated using the method of mu et al 2011 using in situ air temperature and r n and vegetation cover estimated from the modis fpar product mcd15a2h see section 2 1 5 for more details about this dataset the sensible and latent heat storage terms are generally not included in the flux datasets stoy et al 2013 pastorello et al 2020 in this study s was estimated from the half hourly changes in air temperature and humidity measured at the reference level brutsaert 1982 this estimate did not include heat storage in the vegetation biomass the data from the 40 sites were carefully screened for inconsistencies these checks were in addition to those performed by the site pis teams and by some of the networks fluxnet pastorello et al 2014 2020 ozflux isaac et al 2017 for the daytime period all data needed for the energy balance calculations were checked for the nighttime period only the le data were screened the quality checks were similar to those performed by pastorello et al 2014 for fluxnet2015 where possible errors in the radiation air temperature and relative humidity data were corrected with the help of the site pis using calculated clear sky radiation in the case of the radiation data or using data from another sensor or from a nearby station allen 2008 pastorello et al 2014 no attempts were made to correct questionable eddy covariance flux data h le or soil data g temperature moisture gap filling of the data was carried out in two steps in the first step gaps in the half hourly or hourly data were filled on a daily basis for the daytime period missing values of any energy balance term x where x le h g s on a particular day were filled using x r n r n i where x r n is the average daytime ratio of x to r n and r n i the net radiation during time step i with missing data for any x the maximum allowed percentage of missing values was 30 for the nighttime period missing values of le on a particular day were replaced by the mean nighttime le for that day also using an upper threshold of 30 for the percentage of missing data for consistency the same method was used for all datasets i e the gap filled data in fluxnet2015 were not used in the second step missing daily values of etorig and etebc were replaced by the mean of the available observations for individual modis intervals the maximum allowed percentage of missing values was 25 i e two days for an 8 day modis interval hu et al 2015 energy balance closure was analyzed for each site individually by summing the 8 day mean daytime totals of h etorig and a and calculating the energy balance ratio as ebr h etorig a with all terms in mm wilson et al 2002 energy balance closure was also analyzed by grouping the data according to land cover type and climate zone section 2 2 for the pooled data in each group the 8 day mean daytime totals of h etorig were plotted against a and the corresponding linear regression line and ebr were calculated geographic coordinates and land cover type data for each site were obtained from the metadata accompanying the datasets or from the literature table 2 the classification scheme of the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp was followed this classification system is adopted by most flux networks it is also used in most evaluation studies of remote sensing et models see e g velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 for each site the evaporative fraction ef was calculated as shuttleworth et al 1989 ef etorig h etorig where etorig and h are the mean daytime latent and sensible heat fluxes for each modis interval not corrected for the lack of energy balance closure the obtained values are listed in table 2 2 1 5 other datasets the köppen geiger climate class of each site was obtained using the 1 km resolution global map of beck et al 2018 the map was downloaded from https www gloh2o org koppen each site was assigned the climate class of the pixel where the flux tower was located the 40 sites represented a total of 10 different climate classes table 2 for the evaluation of the remote sensing et products these were grouped into four main climate zones section 2 2 for each of these climate zones the average ef was calculated using the site specific values listed in table 2 to investigate the match between the actual vegetation type at the flux tower site and the vegetation class or category used in the remote sensing et models section 2 3 the yearly modis land cover mcd12q1 500 m resolution and vegetation cover mod44b 250 m resolution products were used the data were downloaded from the nasa lp daac website from mcd12q1 the land cover type 2 data were used from mod44b the data layers containing percent tree cover and percent nontree vegetation were used for each site the following three subsets were generated for the years with eddy covariance data subset 1 four pixels of mcd12q1 data corresponding to the 1 km mod16 pixel subset 2 all pixels of mod44b data falling within the 0 25 gleam pixel and subset 3 all pixels of mcd12q1 data corresponding to the 5 km alexi pixel these subsets were used in the analysis described in section 2 3 finally fpar data from the mcd15a2h product were used to calculate g with the method of mu et al 2011 section 2 1 4 this product is an 8 day composite dataset with a spatial resolution of 500 m the data were again obtained from nasa s lp daac the pixels matching the location of the flux towers were used data with a cloud flag or retrieved by the backup algorithm were replaced by interpolated values zhao et al 2005 2 2 evaluation of product performance the remote sensing et products were evaluated by grouping the data by igbp land cover type and köppen geiger climate zone velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 to avoid groups with only one site the woody savanna site was included in the group with the savanna sites and the closed shrubland site was left out of the evaluations by land cover type but included in the evaluations by climate zone this resulted in the following five groups of vegetation cover types evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf evergreen needleleaf forest enf savanna sav and grassland gra likewise the sites were grouped into the following four main climate zones i af am tropical fully humid and tropical monsoon respectively from now on referred to as tropical wet ii aw tropical savanna iii b dry and iv c mild temperate sites assigned the mild temperate c climate were either located on tropical or subtropical mountains five sites or in lowland areas in the subtropics three sites see also richter 2016 table 3 shows the number of sites and the number of site years available in the complete dataset for each product by land cover type and climate zone 2 2 1 scatter plots and regression analysis scatter plots allow visual evaluation of the match between the remote sensing based and the observed et data velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 see also chang and hanna 2004 in addition the slope intercept and coefficient of determination r2 of the fitted linear regression line provide a quantitative way to evaluate product performance willmott 1982 velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 most studies evaluating remote sensing et products perform the regression analysis with the product estimates on the y axis and the observations on the x axis see e g mu et al 2011 velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 however piñeiro et al 2008 showed that this can lead to erroneous estimates of the regression coefficients therefore in this study the observations were used as the y variable and the product estimates as the x variable piñeiro et al 2008 for each land cover type and climate zone in table 3 the eddy covariance observations were plotted against the et estimates of each product and the corresponding linear regression lines were calculated using the pooled data from the different sites in each group this analysis was performed using both etorig and etebc 2 2 2 statistical performance metrics in addition to visual inspection of the scatter plots and examination of the regression results three commonly used statistics in evaluation studies of remote sensing et products were calculated root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and the coefficient of determination r2 see references in table s4 the use of these common statistics allowed for comparison with evaluation results from other latitudes section 2 4 the selected metrics provide complementary information about product performance the rmse is a measure of total error i e both random and systematic errors and is defined by 1 rmse n 1 et prod et obs 2 where et prod is the product et et obs the eddy covariance et and n the total number of data points i e the number of modis intervals the pbias is the systematic bias error in percent of the average of the observations 2 pbias n 1 et prod et obs n 1 et obs 100 third in addition to the r2 calculated from the pooled data section 2 2 1 the r2 of the linear regression between product et and observed et was calculated for each site separately besides being a measure of correlation r2 indicates how much of the variation in observed et is explained by the product et the three metrics were calculated using both etorig and etebc averages of both sets of rmse pbias and r2 values were calculated for each land cover type and climate zone in table 3 the average metrics by land cover type and climate zone were displayed graphically in plots for each product mccabe et al 2016 for etorig and etebc the results for the individual sites can be found in tables s2 and s3 2 2 3 combining the different performance metrics into a single score to facilitate comparison of the overall performance of the different et products the individual metrics r2 rmse pbias were combined into the ideal point error ipe score elshorbagy et al 2010 dawson et al 2012 the ipe score takes values between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating perfect performance i e all metrics are at their optimum values and 1 being assigned to the worst performing product in practice no product and no observation is without error therefore the best performing product will usually have an ipe greater than 0 the ipe values were calculated for each of the comparisons by land cover type and climate zone the calculation of ipe consists of two steps in the first step each performance metric is standardized to the worst score for that metric dawson et al 2012 provides expressions for this standardization step for different categories of performance measures denoted by s1 s5 their table 1 pbias is not listed in this table however as mentioned by dawson et al 2012 the flexibility of this method allows other metrics to be included pbias classifies as an s4 category metric and was standardized using the corresponding expression in the second step the ipe is calculated from the standardized metrics using equation 2 in dawson et al 2012 the results were plotted as heatmaps for etorig and etebc 2 2 4 sensitivity to the choice of reference dataset the statistical metrics r2 rmse pbias and the ipe scores were calculated as explained above but now using the common reference dataset this direct comparison approach included 12 fewer sites and about 36 fewer modis intervals than when using all data see table s1 for the number of sites and site years by land cover type and climate zone the sensitivity analysis was performed for etorig only differences in the ranking of products for each of the comparisons by land cover type and climate zone were determined by comparing the ipe scores from both approaches changes in ranking were indicated by adding an asterisk to the ipe scores in the heatmap for etorig 2 2 5 evaluation of seasonal trends in et from products the ability of the products to capture seasonal changes in et was examined by plotting the average monthly et for each product together with the average monthly etorig and etebc this was again done for each land cover type and climate zone in table 3 to account for the different timing of the rainy seasons separate plots were made for sites located in the northern and southern hemispheres 2 3 vegetation match index vmi and open water fraction owf the effect of a mismatch between the vegetation at the flux tower site and that detected in the model pixel on the product evaluation results was examined by calculating a vegetation match index vmi the models underlying the investigated et products differ in the level of detail with which they distinguish between different vegetation types both mod16 and alexi assign land cover specific parameters to a wide range of cover types while gleam only considers two vegetation categories i e tall and short vegetation however also for mod16 and alexi the largest differences between the land cover specific parameters occur between tall and short or forest and non forest vegetation types anderson et al 2007 mu et al 2011 therefore for all three products vmi was calculated based on these two vegetation categories the datasets used to calculate the vmis are described in section 2 1 5 as explained in section 1 a mismatch in vegetation can be caused by scale differences or inaccuracies in the vegetation input data to account for the latter vegetation data were selected that were as similar as possible to those used to generate the products sections 2 1 1 2 1 3 for mod16 and alexi mcd12q1 land cover type 2 data were used subsets 1 and 3 respectively the data from subsets 1 and 3 were aggregated into forest and non forest categories for sites with a forest land cover ebf dbf enf table 2 vmimod16 or vmialexi was calculated as the proportion of forest vegetation present in the 1 km mod16 or 5 km alexi pixel for sites with a non forest land cover sav gra the vmis were calculated as the proportion of non forest vegetation for gleam mod44b vegetation cover data were used subset 2 these data were assumed to be similar to those of the vcf5kyr product used as input to gleam v3 3a section 2 1 2 the vcf5kyr product is based on avhrr observations calibrated with modis data hansen et al 2018 in each data layer of the mod44b product pixels with water are masked out with a fill value of 200 hence vmigleam was calculated as either the average percent tree cover for sites with forest vegetation or the average percent nontree vegetation for sites with non forest vegetation multiplied by the fraction of land pixels in addition the open water fraction owf was calculated this index was used to filter out sites for which the pixel contained more than 20 water section 2 1 2 the dependence of product performance on the vegetation match between pixel and site was examined by plotting the performance metrics r2 rmse pbias against vmi individual site values for the metrics were bin averaged into four evenly spaced intervals of 0 25 vmi units wide in the case of gleam and alexi or for each of the five discrete vmi values in the case of mod16 for each metric vmi combination the linear regression line was calculated in addition to visual inspection of the scatter plots the p values of the calculated regression slopes were used to evaluate whether there was a relationship between vmi and product performance for this analysis performance statistics obtained for etorig were used 2 4 latitudinal comparison of product performance to investigate latitudinal dependence of the performance of the et products examined here a literature search was conducted to find studies that evaluated these products to allow for direct comparison only studies that evaluated the products with eddy covariance based et were considered furthermore a study needed to report at least one of the three performance metrics used in this study r2 rmse pbias or provide the data from which these metrics could be calculated the performance statistics depend on the averaging time used hence ideally only studies using the same time average as used here 8 day should be considered this would however drastically reduce the number of evaluation results available therefore studies using daily or monthly time averages were also included in the initial search in the end a total of 15 studies were found table s4 as will be shown below the evaluation results were different for etorig and etebc of the 15 studies found in the literature 13 used etorig and only two used etebc no studies were found that used both for the final analysis only studies using etorig were considered the study of miralles et al 2011 was also excluded because i gleam et was calculated using in situ measured r n ii comparisons were made using modelled et for the vegetation type i e tall or short vegetation matching that at the tower site and iii days with rainfall were excluded likewise the study of mu et al 2011 was excluded because their evaluation results are in fact calibration results this yielded a total of 12 studies including the current one most studies used mod16 c5 because mod16 c6 was only recently released therefore the results obtained here for c5 were used to account for latitudinal differences in et rmse was normalized by mean etorig nrmse not all studies reported etorig table s4 the studies evaluated product performance at a minimum of two eddy covariance sites to a maximum of 119 sites most studies reported evaluation results for individual sites but some reported averages for land cover classes e g velpuri et al 2013 reitz et al 2017 the latter were treated as if they were results for individual sites performance results were grouped into results for forest and non forest vegetation there were not enough performance data available to create more specific subgroups the results were further grouped into three latitudinal bands southern low latitudes 30 s 0 northern low latitudes 0 30 n and northern middle latitudes 30 n 60 n for latitudes outside these regions there were not enough data available table s4 table 4 summarizes the number of evaluation results n er available broken down into results for r2 nrmse and pbias and grouped by latitudinal zone product and vegetation category averages of each performance metric for each product vegetation category combination were plotted as a function of latitude 3 results 3 1 energy balance closure of eddy covariance data table 2 shows the daytime energy balance ratio ebr for each of the 40 individual sites the average daytime ebr for the 40 sites was 0 83 with a standard deviation sd of 0 10 and with values ranging from 0 63 to 1 03 figs 2 and 3 show scatter plots between the sum of the daytime turbulent heat fluxes and available energy grouped by land cover type and climate zone respectively the daytime ebr values calculated from the pooled data were similar across land cover types ranging from 0 79 to 0 87 and climate zones ranging from 0 77 to 0 85 the slopes and intercepts of the regression lines ranged from 0 67 to 0 80 and 0 01 to 0 67 mm day 1 respectively across land cover types and from 0 72 to 0 81 and 0 00 to 0 69 mm day 1 respectively across climate zones the coefficient of determination r2 ranged from 0 64 and 0 82 across land cover types and from 0 59 and 0 82 across climate zones 3 2 evaluation of et products by land cover type figures 4 and s1 show scatter plots comparing eddy covariance based and remote sensing based et by land cover type for each of the evaluated products for etorig and etebc respectively first the results for etorig will be examined although the scatter plots and the regression results for mod16 c5 and mod16 c6 show some differences these were generally smaller than the differences with the other products see also below hence from now on the two collections will be referred to as mod16 when necessary a distinction will be made between the two overall gleam et showed the best agreement with etorig this follows from the results of the regression analysis i e slope closer to 1 intercept closer to 0 higher r2 and can be observed visually as a narrower distribution of data points around the 1 1 line for dbf and sav the correlations between gleam et and etorig were strong r2 of 0 81 and 0 73 respectively a weak correlation was observed for ebf r2 0 32 the agreement with etorig was generally poorer for mod16 and alexi neither of these products consistently outperformed the other the scatter plots show a clear overestimation of etorig by mod16 for enf and a clear underestimation for sav although both products showed weaker correlations with etorig than gleam this was most pronounced for alexi also mod16 and alexi had the strongest correlations for dbf and sav and the weakest for ebf when evaluating the products with etebc the regression slopes and intercepts increased while changes in r2 were generally small figure s1 fig 5 shows the mean r2 rmse and pbias by land cover type for each of the evaluated products for etorig and etebc again the results for etorig will be examined first as already observed in fig 4 the mean performance statistics show that the differences between mod16 c5 and mod16 c6 are generally smaller than the differences with the other products one exception is enf this group however included a relatively small number of sites and site years table 3 which may have affected the comparisons fig 5 confirms the superior performance of gleam overall gleam had the strongest correlations the lowest rmses and the smallest pbias values in agreement with the graphical analysis neither mod16 nor alexi was second best over all land covers both gleam and mod16 tended to overestimate etorig for forest vegetation and underestimate etorig for non forest vegetation however biases were smaller for gleam alexi tended to overestimate etorig for all land cover types the variation in pbias across land cover types was smaller for gleam and alexi than for mod16 as seen in the scatter plots alexi had the weakest correlations with etorig all et products had the strongest correlations for dbf and sav and the weakest for ebf as expected pbias shifted to more negative values when the products were evaluated with etebc fig 5 depending on whether pbias decreased or increased the corresponding rmse became smaller or larger although not for all products see below the use of etebc generally had little effect on the correlations as also seen in the scatter plots for gleam pbias values were negative for all land cover types when using etebc and were generally greater in absolute terms than when using etorig as a result the rmses were larger and closer to those of the other products when using etebc than when using etorig for mod16 pbias values were also negative for most land cover types when using etebc the corresponding rmses were either somewhat larger e g sav gra or smaller e g ebf enf than when using etorig in the case of alexi pbias values decreased for all land cover types except sav however only in the case of ebf this was accompanied by a decrease in rmse for enf dbf and gra the rmse actually increased a partial explanation for this is the tendency of alexi to overestimate low etebc and underestimate high etebc dbf gra figure s1 fig 6 shows the ipe scores for the different et products by land cover type as obtained using etorig or etebc for evaluation the ipe scores confirm that gleam et best matched etorig across all land cover types the ipe scores also support the earlier observations that i the differences in performance between the two mod16 collections were generally smaller than the differences with the other products and ii neither mod16 nor alexi consistently outperformed the other fig 6 shows that the ipe values of the products converged when using etebc for evaluation this largely reflects the changes in pbias and rmse mentioned above when using etebc there is no product that stands out in terms of both small pbias and high r2 across all land cover types fig 7 compares the seasonal trends in et from the products with those from the observations by land cover type by hemisphere note that these curves were calculated using the common reference dataset only curves calculated with data from at least two sites are shown clear differences in the seasonality and timing of rainfall can be observed in both hemispheres et of ebf was characterized by weak seasonality with constant high values throughout the year yet mod16 c5 seemed to capture the small variations in et quite well this was also the case for gleam except during the wet season in the southern hemisphere when it showed a strong positive bias a closer look at the data showed that this involved the two brazilian rainforests table 2 fig 1 similarly alexi had a strong positive bias at the end of the dry season in the southern hemisphere this could be traced mainly to ebf in northeastern australia table 2 fig 1 for enf all products seemed to represent the observed seasonal trend in et fairly well for dbf gleam closely followed the observed seasonal trend in et mod16 had a negative bias during the dry season conversely alexi had a positive bias during the transition from the wet to dry season for sav and gra both gleam and mod16 had a strong negative bias during the dry season conversely alexi seemed to have a positive bias during the dry period in these cover types 3 3 evaluation of et products by climate zone the performance of the et products was also examined across four main climate zones table 3 for each climate zone an average evaporative fraction ef was calculated from the site specific values in table 2 yielding ranked from wet to dry 0 73 0 04 sd for af am tropical wet 0 60 0 10 for c mild temperate 0 50 0 11 for aw tropical savanna and 0 35 0 11 for b dry the tropical wet climate zone included mainly ebf sites seven in total table 3 the mild temperate climate zone included all enf sites and for the rest mainly ebf sites the savanna and dry climate zones included mostly sav dbf and gra sites the results of this analysis were presented in the same way as in the previous section i e scatter plots figures 8 and s2 average performance statistics r2 rmse pbias fig 9 heatmaps of ipe scores fig 6 and average seasonal trends in et fig 10 the comparisons by climate zone confirmed many of the findings in the previous section again the differences in performance between the two mod16 et collections were usually smaller than the differences with the other products figs 8 and 9 furthermore the performance and ranking of the products depended on whether etorig or etebc was used for evaluation when using etorig gleam again showed the strongest correlations and best agreement i e closeness to observations figs 8 and 9 as a result gleam had the smallest rmses and best ipe scores across all climate zones figs 9 and 6 respectively again neither mod16 nor alexi performed consistently better than the other that is mod16 showed better agreement with etorig for the aw climate zone whereas alexi gave better results for the b and c climate zones as summarized by the ipe scores in fig 6 finally there was no clear ranking among the products when etebc was used for evaluation fig 6 this mainly reflected the underestimation of gleam et with respect to etebc leading to higher i e more negative pbias values and larger rmses than when using etorig fig 9 for mod16 pbias and rmse values both decreased e g c climate zone and increased aw climate zone for alexi pbias decreased to values close to zero c aw b however instead of decreasing the corresponding rmses increased the use of etebc generally had little effect on the correlations figures 8 s2 and 9 all products had the weakest correlations in the wet tropical climate zone and the strongest in the tropical savanna and dry climate zones fig 9 this is consistent with the results in section 3 2 weakest correlations for ebf and strongest correlations for sav and dbf overall alexi had again the weakest correlations the biases of mod16 et varied markedly across climate zones fig 9 when compared with etorig mod16 tended to overestimate et in the wet tropical and mild temperate climate zones and underestimate et in the dry climate zone this result is consistent with the positive biases observed in fig 5 for forest vegetation dominating the wet tropical and mild temperate climate zones and the negative biases for non forest vegetation dominating the dry climate zone biases in gleam showed the same tendency but were generally much smaller in size for alexi the bias with respect to etorig was practically zero in the wet tropical climate zone but positive in the other climate zones the seasonal trend analysis fig 10 revealed the same patterns as found earlier in section 3 2 again reflecting the close correspondence between climate and vegetation for the tropical wet climate zone mod16 c5 et closely followed the observed seasonal changes in et this was also the case for gleam except for the positive bias during the wet season in the southern hemisphere traced back mainly to the brazilian rainforests section 3 2 the positive bias of alexi et at the end of the dry season in the southern hemisphere can also be observed again traced back mainly to ebf in northeastern australia section 3 2 in addition alexi et showed large seemingly erratic variations in the northern hemisphere for the mild temperate climate zone all products represented the observed seasonal trend in et fairly well for the tropical savanna climate both mod16 and gleam had a strong negative bias during the dry season which was also observed in the plots for gra and sav in fig 7 the positive bias for alexi during the dry period can also be observed again for the dry climate zone gleam et closely followed the observed seasonal trend in et alexi had again a positive bias during the dry period mod16 had a strong negative bias during the wet season in the southern hemisphere 3 4 sensitivity to the choice of reference dataset the ipe scores based on the common reference dataset figure s3 show similar results to those obtained using all data fig 6 etorig for both the comparisons by land cover type and climate zone gleam et generally showed the best agreement with etorig furthermore the differences among the two mod16 collections and alexi were generally too small to identify a second best performing product differences in ranking results between the two approaches were observed only for mod16 and alexi fig 6 3 5 product performance versus vmi fig 11 shows binned scatter plots between the performance metrics r2 rmse pbias and the vegetation match index for the different products in addition the regression lines and the p values indicating the statistical significance of the regression slopes are shown the vmis for each individual site are given in table s2 the average vmi was 0 77 0 41 for mod16 0 71 0 40 for alexi and 0 51 0 23 for gleam these results indicate a decreasing vegetation match between pixel and site with increasing pixel size although the vmis of gleam and the other products cannot be directly compared as they are based on different data for none of the products there was an improvement in performance i e increasing r2 or decreasing rmse or pbias with increasing vmi fig 11 moreover for none of the regressions the slope was statistically significant 3 6 latitudinal comparison of product performance fig 12 shows zonal averages southern and northern low latitudes and northern middle latitudes of the performance metrics grouped by forest and non forest vegetation for mod16 and gleam and alexi the averages were calculated using evaluation results from this study and from the literature tables s2 and s4 for alexi no data on nrmse and pbias were available for the northern middle latitudes table 4 fig 12 should be interpreted with caution because the number of evaluation results n er available varied considerably among latitudinal zones products and vegetation categories table 4 in the case of forest vegetation correlations all products seem to be weaker while pbias and nrmse scores mod16 and gleam seem to be better at low latitudes than at northern middle latitudes both mod16 and gleam seem to overestimate etorig in all latitudinal zones in contrast in the case of non forest vegetation the performance metrics show no clear variation with latitude moreover both mod16 and gleam seem to underestimate etorig in all latitudinal zones 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of the energy balance closure problem on product evaluation results the average energy balance ratio for the 40 sites in this study 0 83 is nearly identical to that reported by stoy et al 2013 for 173 mainly mid latitude fluxnet sites 0 84 when grouped by land cover type or climate zone the ranges of ebr values were fairly small 0 79 0 87 or 0 77 0 85 respectively a greater range was observed for the 173 fluxnet sites grouped by land cover type 0 70 0 94 table 2 in stoy et al 2013 as mentioned in section 1 the reasons for the energy balance closure problem and the extent to which it affects the et fluxes are not yet clear despite being long recognized the effect of the energy balance closure problem on the evaluation results of remote sensing based et products has rarely been examined michel et al 2016 melton et al 2021 this study found that the performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether the unadjusted or the energy balance closure corrected et fluxes were used when using etorig gleam showed the best overall performance with the strongest correlations and smallest biases however when using etebc none of the products was superior to the others not surprisingly the use of etebc instead of etorig affected the product biases more than the correlations overall mod16 and gleam underestimated et compared to etebc for alexi pbias decreased when using etebc instead of etorig but the corresponding rmses tended to increase rather than decrease for most seb approaches used in the openet project cumulative totals of et over the growing season or water year also agreed better with etebc than with etorig melton et al 2021 both mod16 and gleam include parameters that were calibrated using field observations of et mod16 was calibrated using et obtained from eddy covariance based estimates of water use efficiency wue and modis based gross primary production gpp with wue being calculated as the ratio between gpp and et fluxes not corrected for energy balance closure mu et al 2011 the use of etorig could possibly explain the negative bias of mod16 with respect to etebc michel et al 2016 however the gpp fluxes may have been underestimated for the same reason as etorig foken et al 2011 in that case the estimated wue would not or only partly be affected in gleam fixed values are used for the priestley taylor coefficient for short α 1 26 and tall α 0 97 vegetation martens et al 2017 these values are averages of α values published in the literature which in turn were obtained by comparing field measurements of et under well watered conditions with potential et some of the α values were derived with etorig but others were obtained using et estimates based on other methods such as the weighing lysimeter and bowen ratio energy balance techniques see references cited in martens et al 2017 hence also the negative bias error of gleam with respect to etebc cannot be directly linked to calibration with etorig alexi et had smaller pbias when using etebc than when using etorig in contrast to the other models alexi is not calibrated with field data however no conclusions can be drawn from this observation without a better understanding of the effect of the energy balance closure problem on etorig in addition the rmses of alexi tended to increase rather than decrease when using etebc the literature review showed that most studies evaluated the products using etorig table s4 it is recommended to use both etorig and etebc as long as the effect of the energy balance closure problem on etorig is not clear the remainder of the discussion will focus on the results obtained with etorig to facilitate comparisons with the literature 4 2 relative performance of the evaluated products similar results were obtained when grouping the data by land cover type or climate zone showing the close relationship between the two see for example cui et al 2021 therefore the results of these two analyses will be discussed together and interchangeably as explained in section 1 a distinction should be made between product and model evaluation studies the former evaluate the published et products while the latter evaluate the performance of the underlying models using a common input dataset because modeled et is sensitive to the input data the results of the model evaluation studies do not necessarily apply to the final et products see section 1 for references overall gleam had the best performance across different land cover types and climate zones in the low latitudes neither mod16 nor alexi could be identified as the second best performing product these results were obtained regardless of whether the comparisons were made using all data or a common reference dataset there are very few product evaluation studies that have compared the performance of the products assessed in this study khan et al 2018 2020 compared the performance of gleam and mod16 at nine and five eddy covariance sites respectively in both studies about one third of sites were located in the low latitudes and about two thirds in the middle latitudes see also table s4 khan et al 2018 used etorig to evaluate the products while khan et al 2020 used etebc consistent with the results of this study khan et al 2018 found that gleam generally corresponded better with etorig than mod16 also when using etebc khan et al 2020 found that gleam outperformed mod16 as opposed to this study where differences were small when using etebc in the absence of other comparative studies the compilation of product evaluation results for the latitudinal analysis fig 12 table s4 allows for an indirect comparison of product performance focusing only on the results for the northern middle latitudes to exclude the evaluation data from this study the overall better match of gleam with etorig as compared to mod16 is also evident from the studies included in this analysis see table s4 for references the stronger correlations of gleam as compared to alexi are also noticeable when comparing the r2 values from studies that evaluated these products separately an overall better performance of gleam as compared to mod16 was also observed in the model evaluation studies by mccabe et al 2016 and michel et al 2016 gleam also performed better than the surface energy balance approach evaluated in these studies i e the sebs model of su 2002 similarly vinukollu et al 2011a obtained better performance results for a priestley taylor approach developed by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl fisher et al 2008 than for mod16 and sebs however all these studies concluded that no single model was superior in all cases the same conclusion was reached in a recent model evaluation study for south america melo et al 2021 such a conclusion is not supported by the results of this study as gleam performed better than mod16 and alexi in all land cover types and climate zones it is not known whether this is a feature of the low latitudes i e the other studies focused mainly on the middle latitudes whether it is related to the differences between product and model evaluation studies discussed earlier or whether it is a result specific to the products studied here all products had the weakest correlations in the wet tropical climate zone dominated by ebf and the strongest in the tropical savanna and dry climate zones dominated by dbf and sav for the most part this reflects differences in seasonality i e the greater the variation in et the stronger the correlations miralles et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2014 rather than differences related to the performance of the products alexi generally had the weakest correlations of all products comparing the r2 values from the studies used for the latitudinal analysis shows values for alexi between those of mod16 and gleam northern middle latitudes fig 12 although this is an indirect comparison because it involves studies that evaluated the products separately it suggests that the low correlations observed in this study for alexi are not a general feature of the product a known challenge for thermal based approaches is the filtering of cloud contaminated data and the resulting gaps between successful retrievals failure to detect cloud contaminated data can lead to large errors in alexi et estimates anderson et al 2007 yilmaz et al 2014 the uncertainty in gap filled alexi et can be twice as large as that in et generated by the algorithm under clear sky conditions anderson et al 2007 these cloud related problems could be responsible for the weak correlations of alexi but that still does not explain the difference with the northern middle latitudes where the data are also affected by clouds a possible approach to solving these problems is to use cloud tolerant microwave based land surface temperature in alexi holmes et al 2018 finally holmes et al 2018 found that averaging 0 05 alexi et estimates to 0 25 spatial resolution generally improved correlations with flux tower data they attributed this to the presence of noise in the modis land surface temperature data that outweighed the benefits of the higher resolution compared to a 0 25 average however the overall effect reported in that study is too small to explain the differences in correlation with the other products observed here more work is needed to understand the reasons for the low correlations of alexi observed at the low latitude sites studied here both mod16 and gleam had a positive bias for forest vegetation and a negative bias for non forest vegetation no such land cover type dependent biases were observed for alexi the biases of mod16 and gleam are also evident from the evaluation results of other studies northern middle latitudes fig 12 both zhang et al 2019a and brust et al 2021 showed that the biases in mod16 can be significantly reduced when calibrating the algorithm with more and a greater diversity of sites than used in the original calibration brust et al 2021 found that the accuracy of mod16 can also be improved by including the effect of soil moisture on et although the apparent vegetation type dependent biases were less pronounced in gleam more work is needed to understand the causes in a model evaluation study miralles et al 2016 found the opposite pattern i e mod16 and gleam underestimated et determined from rainfall and streamflow data in wet regions dominated by forest vegetation and overestimated et in dry regions dominated by non forest vegetation types a similar pattern was observed in the model evaluation study by michel et al 2016 using etorig as reference data in the model evaluation study for south america gleam underestimated et in both wet and dry regions melo et al 2021 the biases of mod16 were small in that study this shows again that the results of model evaluation studies do not necessarily apply to the actual et products none of the products were able to correctly represent the seasonal trend in et in all land cover types and climate zones detailed analyses such as this one can help identify the causes of the biases discussed above for example the negative biases of mod16 and gleam in gra and sav seemed to occur mainly during the dry season this may indicate an overestimation of the effect of water stress on et in contrast alexi seemed to overestimate et during the dry season in some cases the differences between the product based and the observed trends could be traced to individual sites the overestimation of et of brazilian rainforest by gleam during the wet season was also observed by chen et al 2022 these authors suggested the lack of an atmospheric moisture control on transpiration as a possible cause of this overestimation it is likely that the erratic variation observed in the alexi data for the tropical wet sites was caused by the cloud related problems discussed above however to correctly identify possible seasonal biases a more comprehensive analysis that includes more sites and site years is needed the results showed that the differences between the mod16 c5 and c6 products were generally smaller than the differences with the other products differences between c5 and c6 were to be expected because of differences in input data and spatial resolutions mu et al 2013 running et al 2019 the differences persisted when using the common reference dataset figure s3 future work can focus on quantifying the level of consistency between these two collections 4 3 latitudinal comparison of product performance the literature review revealed that remote sensing based et products have been evaluated primarily in the northern middle latitudes the bias is the result of geographic differences in the availability of eddy covariance data due to uneven distribution of flux towers see for example schimel et al 2015 and regional differences in data sharing villarreal and vargas 2021 with the results of this study the availability of evaluation data for the low latitudes was significantly improved this allowed a comparison of product performance across latitudes the results of this analysis should be interpreted with caution however because the number of evaluation results available varied considerably among latitudes products and vegetation categories table 4 smaller normalized rmses and smaller pbias values suggest better performance of mod16 and gleam for low latitude forests than for northern mid latitude forests the weaker correlations at low latitudes are thought to be the result of differences in seasonality rather than differences in performance see below the similarity between the latitudinal trends in nrmse and pbias of mod16 and gleam is striking considering the different approaches forcing data and resolutions of the underlying models more work is needed to understand the causes of the apparent latitudinal dependence of these products in the case of non forest vegetation none of the performance metrics showed a clear trend with latitude noteworthy is that both mod16 and gleam seem to overestimate et of forest vegetation and underestimate et of non forest vegetation in all latitudinal bands see also discussion above a limitation of the current analysis is that regional differences were not detected because of the broad zonal bands used for example nrmses were considerably larger for seasonally dry dbf 0 36 and 0 84 for gleam and mod16 respectively data not shown than for wet tropical ebf 0 27 and 0 46 respectively similarly vinukollu et al 2011b and miralles et al 2016 found higher relative uncertainties for the subtropics than for the tropics in these studies relative uncertainty was estimated from the spread between different model outputs the weaker correlations for low latitude forests are most likely explained by the small seasonal variation in et of ebf the seasonal variation in et of temperate forests is much greater due to stronger seasonal variations in radiation and temperature baldocchi and ryu 2011 again however differences among forests in the low latitudes were large for example the r2 values for dbf were about twice as high as those for ebf fig 5 there were no clear latitudinal differences in r2 for non forest vegetation at low latitudes non forest vegetation occurs mainly in regions with high seasonality of rainfall e g savanna regions and thus large variations in et likewise temperate non forest vegetation types such as grass and crops show large variations in et due to seasonal variation in radiation and temperature e g monteith and moss 1977 4 4 product performance versus vegetation match between pixel and site the linear regression analyses across all 40 sites showed that there was no relationship between the product evaluation results and the vegetation match between pixel and site indirect evidence for this was also provided by the finding that the product with the largest pixel size and the lowest average vmi gleam performed best overall similar results were obtained by hobeichi et al 2018 and jiménez et al 2018 hobeichi et al 2018 investigated the effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on the performance of a merged et product for this they divided the eddy covariance sites in two groups those for which the igbp land cover type was the same as that of the pixel and those for which it was not they used modis land cover data at the same spatial resolution 0 5 as the merged et product no clear differences in the performance of the product were observed between the two groups of sites jiménez et al 2018 investigated the effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on the performance of the gleam pt jpl and mod16 algorithms the models were run with a common input dataset at a spatial resolution of 0 25 for all three models a single vegetation match index was used called homogeneity index this index was calculated using modis igbp land cover data mcd12q1 and modis vegetation cover data mod44b also in their study no significant relationships were found between model performance and the homogeneity index a challenge is to correctly define the vegetation match index hobeichi et al 2018 in this study only two vegetation categories were considered forest and non forest vegetation as the land cover type dependent parameters in mod16 and alexi can be broadly grouped into these two categories and gleam only distinguishes between these two categories in the other studies a match was only obtained if the specific igbp land cover type corresponded this may be too stringent if the parameters are similar among certain cover types understanding the sensitivity of the model outputs to the land cover type specific parametrizations can help determine which of these approaches is more adequate nevertheless the results obtained so far suggest that errors other than those caused by a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site are more important jiménez et al 2018 5 conclusions there is a geographical bias in the availability of evaluation data for remote sensing based et products in favor of the northern middle latitudes to address this bias three products gleam mod16 alexi were evaluated at 40 eddy covariance sites in the low latitudes from mod16 the discontinued collection 5 c5 and the latest collection c6 were evaluated two potential problems need to be considered when using eddy covariance observations of et as reference data first eddy covariance data suffer from uncertainties related to the energy balance closure problem second scale differences and classification errors can lead to a mismatch in vegetation between pixel and site which in turn can complicate the comparisons because of the geographical bias in evaluation studies it is unknown whether the products perform equally well at all latitudes the differences between mod16 c5 and c6 were generally smaller than the differences with the other products more work is needed however to determine the degree of consistency between the two collections performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether or not the eddy covariance et data were corrected for the lack of energy balance closure when using the unadjusted fluxes etorig gleam showed the best overall performance across the studied land cover types and climate zones with the strongest correlations and smallest biases neither mod16 nor alexi consistently outperformed the other when using the corrected fluxes etebc there was no product that stood out in terms of both low bias and strong correlations the uncertainty associated with the energy balance closure problem affected the product biases more than the correlations most product evaluation studies use etorig as reference data use of both etorig and etebc is recommended until a better understanding of the effect of the energy balance closure problem on et is obtained few studies have compared the performance of the products examined here however a comparison of results from studies that evaluated these products separately seems to confirm that gleam generally outperforms the other products when using etorig as reference data latitudinal dependence of product performance was examined using the results of this study and those published in the literature the comparison suggests that mod16 and gleam perform better for low latitude forests than for northern mid latitude forests however regional differences such as between the tropics and subtropics can be large and were not detected because of the broad zonal bands used in this analysis in the case of non forest vegetation the products show no clear latitudinal differences in performance no relationship was found between the product evaluation results and the degree of match between the vegetation at the flux tower site and that detected in the model pixel more work is needed to understand the effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on product performance 6 data availability the 8 day mean

3258,remote sensing based evapotranspiration et products have been evaluated primarily using data from northern middle latitudes therefore little is known about their performance at low latitudes to address this bias an evaluation dataset was compiled using eddy covariance data from 40 sites between latitudes 30 s and 30 n the flux data were obtained from the emerging network in mexico mexflux and from openly available databases of fluxnet asiaflux and ozflux this unique reference dataset was then used to evaluate remote sensing based et products in environments that have been underrepresented in earlier studies the evaluated products were modis et mod16 both the discontinued collection 5 c5 and the latest collection c6 global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam et and atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi et products were compared with unadjusted fluxes etorig and with fluxes corrected for the lack of energy balance closure etebc three common statistical metrics were used coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias the effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on product evaluation results was investigated by examining the relationship between the statistical metrics and product specific vegetation match indexes evaluation results of this study and those published in the literature were used to examine the performance of the products across latitudes differences between the mod16 collection 5 and 6 datasets were generally smaller than differences with the other products performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether etorig or etebc was used when using etorig gleam generally had the highest r2 smallest pbias and best rmse values across the studied land cover types and climate zones neither mod16 nor alexi performed consistently better than the other when using etebc none of the products stood out in terms of both low bias and strong correlations the use of etebc instead of etorig affected the biases more than the correlations the product evaluation results showed no significant relationship with the degree of match between the vegetation at the pixel and site scale the latitudinal comparison showed tendencies of lower r2 all products but better pbias and normalized rmse values mod16 and gleam for forests at low latitudes than for forests at northern middle latitudes for non forest vegetation the products showed no clear latitudinal differences in performance keywords mod16 gleam alexi tropics subtropics 1 introduction the low latitudes 30 s 30 n are characterized by large contrasts in terrestrial evapotranspiration et they are home to tropical rainforests and other ecosystems with abundant rainfall where energy radiation is the main constraint to et see for example fisher et al 2009 bruijnzeel et al 2011 they are also home to tropical and subtropical arid and semi arid ecosystems where et is limited by water supply see for example eamus et al 2013 delgado balbuena et al 2019 estimates of et for this region are needed for local and regional applications such as water resource management and drought monitoring and for global applications such as climate change studies wang and dickinson 2012 fisher et al 2017 the spatial and temporal scale of these applications require other methods than those used to study et at the plot to ecosystem scale i e lysimeter sap flow and micrometeorological methods recently the potential of remote sensing based et estimates for these purposes has been recognized dolman et al 2014 fisher et al 2017 sheffield et al 2018 since the 1990s numerous remote sensing based et models have been developed see zhang et al 2016a for an overview these models can be broadly divided into three categories in no specific order models based on the 1 penman monteith monteith 1965 or 2 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 equations and 3 models that determine the sensible heat flux h and calculate et or latent heat flux le as the residual of the surface energy balance i e so called seb models wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016a chen and liu 2020 of interest to the user community is the development of global et products from these models that are readily available to the public and regularly updated to include the latest data two such datasets have been produced since the early 2010s 1 the modis et product based on the mod16 algorithm penman monteith type model mu et al 2007 2011 running et al 2019 and 2 the et product from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam priestley taylor type model miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 more recently global et datasets based on the seb model of senay et al 2013 senay et al 2020 and the penman monteith leuning pml model of zhang et al 2016b zhang et al 2019b have become available efforts are also underway to develop a global et product based on the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model another seb based approach anderson et al 2011 hain and anderson 2017 holmes et al 2018 measurements of et from eddy covariance flux towers have been used as the standard reference data against which remote sensing based et products are evaluated miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2011 holmes et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b senay et al 2020 despite the problems related to the lack of energy balance closure observed at eddy covariance sites and the scale difference between the flux footprint and the model pixels see below broadly speaking two different types of evaluation studies can be distinguished 1 those that evaluate the published et datasets hereafter referred to as product evaluation studies and 2 those that evaluate the performance of the underlying models model evaluation studies in the latter type of study all models are run with the same input data to isolate the effect of different modeling approaches from differences in forcing data vinukollu et al 2011a b mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 melo et al 2021 because remote sensing et models are sensitive to changes in input data vinukollu et al 2011b badgley et al 2015 the results of model evaluation studies do not necessarily apply to the actual products the performance of remote sensing based et products at low latitudes is largely unknown because most evaluation studies have focused on the northern middle latitudes 30 n 60 n miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2011 kim et al 2012 hu et al 2015 velpuri et al 2013 tang et al 2015 reitz et al 2017 holmes et al 2018 khan et al 2018 the few studies that evaluated et products at low latitudes did this at a small number two to five of eddy covariance sites ruhoff et al 2013 ramoelo et al 2014 aguilar et al 2018 souza et al 2019 the bias toward the northern middle latitudes can be explained by geographic differences in the availability of eddy covariance data schimel et al 2015 villarreal and vargas 2021 because of the lack of evaluation results from the low latitudes it is unknown whether global remote sensing based et products perform equally well at all latitudes one can think of several reasons why this might not be the case for example the mod16 et algorithm was calibrated using eddy covariance data from sites located primarily in the us and canada mu et al 2011 hence it is possible that the model is less accurate in other regions of the world including the low latitudes zhang et al 2019a similarly gleam uses constant values for the priestley taylor coefficient α miralles et al 2011 while α varies with climate shuttleworth 1993 and forest type komatsu 2005 because the distribution of climate and forest types is related to latitude the use of constant values for α may result in apparent latitude dependent biases in et latitudinal differences in product performance can also be caused by regional differences in input data quality vinukollu et al 2011b or cloud cover running et al 2019 while eddy covariance observations of et are probably the best option to evaluate remote sensing datasets there are two problems to consider 1 the energy balance observed at eddy covariance sites is usually not closed and 2 the footprint of the eddy covariance observations and the pixels of the et products have different spatial scales the degree of energy balance closure is quantified by the energy balance ratio ebr which is the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes h le to available energy a wilson et al 2002 available energy is the difference between net radiation r n and changes in energy storage the average ebr observed at eddy covariance sites is about 0 8 wilson et al 2002 stoy et al 2013 while the cause of the energy imbalance is still being investigated there are several plausible explanations including the systematic underestimation of the eddy covariance fluxes frank et al 2016 gao et al 2017 mauder et al 2020 as a practical solution to the closure problem the energy surplus is added to h and le because it is unknown in what proportion the energy should be divided between the fluxes mauder et al 2020 the surplus is usually distributed in proportion to the magnitude of h and le which preserves the bowen ratio twine et al 2000 comparisons with independent estimates of et have yielded contrasting results with some studies finding better agreement for energy balance closure corrected et barr et al 2012 mauder et al 2018 and others for unadjusted et denager et al 2020 although the energy balance closure problem has been recognized for many years wilson et al 2002 foken et al 2011 its effect on the evaluation results of remote sensing based et products or models has rarely been examined michel et al 2016 melton et al 2021 the evaluation results can also be affected by the scale difference between the footprint of the eddy covariance observations and the pixels of the et products the flux footprint is typically smaller than 1 km2 chu et al 2021 while the pixel sizes of et products are as small as 0 25 km2 mod16 and as large as 750 km2 gleam the scale difference can result in a mismatch in vegetation between pixel and site hobeichi et al 2018 jiménez et al 2018 such a mismatch may also result from errors in the vegetation input data used by the models due to for example incorrect classification because most models calculate et using land cover specific parameters anderson et al 2007 miralles et al 2011 mu et al 2011 a mismatch between the actual vegetation of the observation site and that detected in the model pixel could potentially affect the evaluation results hu et al 2015 however the few studies that have examined this issue found no clear effect hobeichi et al 2018 jiménez et al 2018 the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the performance of the mod16 and gleam global et products as well as of et based on the alexi model at 40 eddy covariance sites in the low latitudes 2 examine the effect of the energy balance closure problem on product evaluation results 3 examine the dependence of product evaluation results on the vegetation match between pixel and site and 4 investigate potential latitudinal dependence of product performance the mod16 and gleam products were chosen because they are the longest regularly produced remote sensing based et datasets from mod16 both the discontinued collection 5 c5 and the latest collection c6 were evaluated mu et al 2011 running et al 2019 in the case of gleam the v3 3a dataset was evaluated martens et al 2017 while most applications of alexi have focused on the continental us recent efforts have paved the way for routine global implementation of alexi hain and anderson 2017 the reference dataset compiled in this study provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate the performance of alexi at low latitudes the products were evaluated using a reference dataset of eddy covariance observations including data from the emerging flux network in mexico mexflux vargas et al 2013 delgado balbuena et al 2018 and from openly available databases of fluxnet pastorello et al 2020 asiaflux and ozflux beringer et al 2016 2 methods 2 1 data the remote sensing based et products evaluated in this study have different spatial and temporal resolutions table 1 the comparisons with the eddy covariance et observations were made at the original spatial resolution of each product except in the case of mod16 c6 for which the 500 m data were resampled to a 1 km resolution to match mod16 c5 using the original spatial resolution is the common practice when evaluating these products against eddy covariance data see references in table s4 an exception was made for mod16 c6 to allow for a more direct comparison with the previous c5 version the effect of the scale mismatch between product pixel and flux footprint on the evaluation results was examined using the vegetation match index section 2 3 for each product et data were obtained from the pixels matching the location of the flux towers velpuri et al 2013 hu et al 2015 to evaluate all products at the same temporal resolution some performance statistics depend on the temporal resolution of the data the daily gleam and alexi data were averaged over the 8 day modis interval this was the highest common temporal resolution possible among the evaluated datasets likewise the eddy covariance data were averaged to yield mean daily et for each modis interval section 2 1 4 the remote sensing et products were evaluated by grouping the data by land cover type and climate zone section 2 2 the eddy covariance data from the various sites were collected during different periods between 2000 and 2019 with the length of the data records ranging from 1 to 11 years table 2 hence the flux datasets for a given land cover type or climate zone may not coincide in time in addition data availability varied among the evaluated products mod16 c5 was discontinued in 2015 and gleam data for 2019 were not available at the time of download table 1 for gleam and alexi seven and four sites respectively were omitted from the analysis because the fraction of open water in the corresponding pixels was too high due to proximity to the coast sections 2 1 2 and 2 1 3 this problem did not affect mod16 because of the smaller pixel size as a result the amount of data available for each of the comparisons by land cover type and climate zone often varied from product to product table 3 ideally one would compare the products using a common reference dataset i e same sites and same modis intervals however this would reduce the amount of available data by about one third 12 fewer sites and about 36 fewer modis intervals therefore it was decided to perform the regression analysis of observations versus product estimates section 2 2 1 and the comparison of the performance statistics by land cover type and climate zone sections 2 2 2 and 2 2 3 using the complete dataset the extent to which the two approaches all data or a common reference dataset may have influenced the results was examined through a sensitivity analysis section 2 2 4 the seasonal trend analysis section 2 2 5 was performed using the common reference dataset the mod16 and gleam et data were extracted from the published global et datasets because detailed information about the models and datasets used to generate these products can be found in the references listed in table 1 only a brief explanation is provided below the alexi et data were calculated specifically for this study the methodology is described in anderson et al 2011 and hain and anderson 2017 for completeness the main features of the model and the specific input datasets used are briefly described below 2 1 1 modis et data the mod16 et product is derived using a three source penman monteith model which estimates et as the sum of evaporation from the dry canopy transpiration wet canopy interception loss and soil mu et al 2007 2011 separate calculations are performed for the day and night the model uses modis retrievals of albedo for the calculation of r n fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fpar to partition r n between canopy and soil land cover type to assign the physiological parameters needed to calculate the leaf stomatal and aerodynamic resistances and leaf area index to calculate the bulk canopy resistances the land cover specific parameters in the mod16 algorithm were obtained by comparison with eddy covariance flux data from 46 sites located primarily in the us and canada mod16 c5 used c4 mod12q1 land cover type 2 data while mod16 c6 uses the mcdlchkm product running et al 2019 the meteorological data incoming shortwave radiation and air temperature and humidity are obtained from reanalysis products modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 for c5 and goddard earth observing system model version 5 geos 5 for c6 transpiration and soil evaporation are constrained by vapor pressure deficit vpd i e there is no soil moisture control the c5 data were downloaded from the university of montana s numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg website https www ntsg umt edu project modis mod16 php the c6 data were obtained from nasa s land processes distributed active archive center lp daac https lpdaac usgs gov the gap filled version of the c6 dataset was used the gap filling method is the same as that used for mod16 c5 running et al 2019 apart from the difference in resolution the c5 and c6 datasets were produced using different reanalysis datasets and different modis vegetation and albedo products 2 1 2 gleam et data in gleam et is defined as the sum of the following processes transpiration from short and tall vegetation bare soil evaporation rainfall interception loss from tall vegetation open water evaporation and snow sublimation miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 the rainfall interception loss module is based on the gash 1979 analytical rainfall interception model miralles et al 2010 gleam v3 3a used the measures vcf5kyrv001 product hansen et al 2018 to determine the fractions of bare soil short vegetation and tall vegetation the model first calculates potential et with the priestley taylor equation using r n and air temperature from reanalysis data era interim for bare soil and short vegetation the typical value of 1 26 is used for the priestley taylor α coefficient while for tall vegetation α 0 97 martens et al 2017 actual et is calculated by multiplying potential evaporation with land cover dependent stress functions the stress functions simulate soil water constraints on transpiration and soil evaporation soil water content is estimated using a multilayer running water balance model that uses a merged precipitation product et from the previous time step and microwave surface soil moisture as the main inputs the soil is divided in three layers shallow 0 10 cm intermediate 10 100 cm and deep 100 250 cm tall vegetation can extract water from all three layers short vegetation can extract water from the shallow and intermediate layers and for bare soil evaporation only water from the shallow layer is available the stress functions for vegetation also simulate the effect of phenology using microwave vegetation optical depth the data were accessed through the gleam website https www gleam eu gleam pixels containing more than 20 open water were excluded this concerned a total of seven sites table s2 the open water fraction owf was obtained from the mod44b product section 2 3 this filtering was performed only for gleam in the case of alexi sites affected by the presence of open water were filtered out during production of the dataset section 2 1 3 while in the case of mod16 no sites were affected because of the smaller pixel size 2 1 3 alexi et data the alexi algorithm consists of a two source seb model coupled with an atmospheric boundary layer model anderson et al 1997 2007 the latent heat flux is calculated separately for the canopy and soil an initial estimate of the canopy le is obtained using the priestley taylor equation with α 1 26 assuming potential transpiration next the soil le is calculated as the residual of the energy balance if the resulting soil le is negative the actual canopy le must be less than the potential value which may indicate an effect of soil water limitation on transpiration the α coefficient is then reduced until the residual soil le is non negative the calculated le represents the instantaneous flux at approximately one hour before local noon this time corresponds to the end of the time span over which h is calculated see below the instantaneous latent heat fluxes are extrapolated to daily et values by multiplying by the ratio of daily total to instantaneous shortwave radiation and dividing by the latent heat of vaporization the alexi algorithm calculates h from the morning rise in the radiometric surface temperature hain and anderson 2017 by using the temporal change in surface temperature the effect of bias in the temperature retrievals on h is minimized this alexi implementation uses the modis land surface temperature product myd11c1 retrieved using a generalized split window atmospheric compensation technique wan et al 2004 the composite values of surface temperature are partitioned between canopy and soil using estimates of vegetation cover fraction from leaf area index the leaf area index data were obtained from the 8 day modis mod15a3 product myneni et al 2002 instead of using absolute values of air temperature alexi uses the slope of the vertical temperature profile lapse rate in the boundary layer the lapse rate profile as well as the surface longwave radiation flux and wind speed were obtained from the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis product cfs r cfsrv2 saha et al 2011 incoming shortwave radiation fluxes were obtained from the ceres syn1deg product doelling 2012 soil heat flux is calculated as a diurnal varying function of net radiation santanello and friedl 2003 the alexi model uses land cover data to assign canopy parameters such as canopy height to calculate the aerodynamic resistances to h and leaf absorptivity to estimate r n for the canopy and soil the land cover data were obtained from the modis mcd12c1 product land cover type 2 since the thermal infrared based surface temperature observations are only available during clear sky conditions alexi employs a gap filling technique to generate estimates of weekly totals the clear sky fraction of actual et to incoming radiation is interpolated to a daily record and then multiplied by the daily incoming radiation to generate a complete record along the coast the coarse scale meteorological inputs result in limited retrievals this is why four coastal sites table s2 are not included in the alexi dataset 2 1 4 eddy covariance et data data from four different flux networks mexflux fluxnet asiaflux ozflux were used to evaluate the et products the data from mexflux were obtained directly from the site pis 12 sites because they were not available through a repository the data from the other networks were obtained through the respective web based portals fluxnet data available under the open data policy tier 1 of the fluxnet2015 dataset were used pastorello et al 2020 this dataset includes a total of 28 sites between latitudes 30 s and 30 n from ozflux and asiaflux openly available data from sites not included in fluxnet2015 were considered three and nine sites respectively prior to the more extensive data quality control see below sites for which the data record was too short 1 year latent heat flux data were not available or the degree of energy balance closure was too low ebr 0 5 were excluded one site from mexflux four sites from fluxnet and seven sites from asiaflux this left a total of 40 sites for further analysis fig 1 table 2 information needed for the correction of the soil heat flux g data or for the calculation of the sensible and latent heat storage terms s see below was obtained from the metadata accompanying the datasets from articles or other publications or directly from the site pis the remote sensing et products were evaluated using the mean daily eddy covariance et mm day 1 calculated for each modis interval the comparisons were made using the unadjusted eddy covariance fluxes etorig and those corrected for the lack of energy balance closure etebc fluxnet2015 includes corrected fluxes pastorello et al 2020 but the datasets from the other networks do not for consistency the fluxes were corrected using the same method for all datasets including fluxnet2015 after filling the missing half hourly or hourly values see below a correction factor was calculated for each modis interval as a h le where each term is the average daytime flux in w m 2 see above for definition of terms daytime was defined as having solar radiation greater than 10 w m 2 this method is based on the assumption that h and le were underestimated by the same percentage twine et al 2000 the available energy was calculated as r n g s the correction was only applied to the daytime data because in absolute terms the missing energy is small during the night stoy et al 2013 mauder et al 2020 so that the correction will have little effect on total daily et in addition this eliminated the need to ensure the completeness and consistency of the energy balance data for the nighttime period the daytime and nighttime le as well as the other energy balance terms only daytime data were converted from energy units w m 2 to millimetres mm using a constant value for the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 the unadjusted nighttime fluxes were added to daytime etorig and etebc to give daily etorig and etebc data on g were available for 24 of the 40 sites at all these sites g was measured using the soil heat flux plate method sauer 2002 for six sites the measurements were not corrected for heat storage above the plates mayocchi and bristow 1995 this correction was applied retrospectively using the method of wang and bou zeid 2012 this method calculates g at the soil surface which is required in the energy balance calculations from the time series of g at any depth it requires the thermal diffusivity of the soil which was calculated as the ratio of soil thermal conductivity to soil volumetric heat capacity the thermal conductivity was calculated following lu et al 2014 using site specific soil physical data the volumetric heat capacity was calculated from soil bulk density and soil moisture for sites without data on g but with data on soil temperature seven sites g was estimated using the method of hsieh et al 2009 estimates of g derived from temperature measurements at depths 2 cm were corrected for heat storage using the method of wang and bou zeid 2012 for the remaining nine sites g was estimated using the method of mu et al 2011 using in situ air temperature and r n and vegetation cover estimated from the modis fpar product mcd15a2h see section 2 1 5 for more details about this dataset the sensible and latent heat storage terms are generally not included in the flux datasets stoy et al 2013 pastorello et al 2020 in this study s was estimated from the half hourly changes in air temperature and humidity measured at the reference level brutsaert 1982 this estimate did not include heat storage in the vegetation biomass the data from the 40 sites were carefully screened for inconsistencies these checks were in addition to those performed by the site pis teams and by some of the networks fluxnet pastorello et al 2014 2020 ozflux isaac et al 2017 for the daytime period all data needed for the energy balance calculations were checked for the nighttime period only the le data were screened the quality checks were similar to those performed by pastorello et al 2014 for fluxnet2015 where possible errors in the radiation air temperature and relative humidity data were corrected with the help of the site pis using calculated clear sky radiation in the case of the radiation data or using data from another sensor or from a nearby station allen 2008 pastorello et al 2014 no attempts were made to correct questionable eddy covariance flux data h le or soil data g temperature moisture gap filling of the data was carried out in two steps in the first step gaps in the half hourly or hourly data were filled on a daily basis for the daytime period missing values of any energy balance term x where x le h g s on a particular day were filled using x r n r n i where x r n is the average daytime ratio of x to r n and r n i the net radiation during time step i with missing data for any x the maximum allowed percentage of missing values was 30 for the nighttime period missing values of le on a particular day were replaced by the mean nighttime le for that day also using an upper threshold of 30 for the percentage of missing data for consistency the same method was used for all datasets i e the gap filled data in fluxnet2015 were not used in the second step missing daily values of etorig and etebc were replaced by the mean of the available observations for individual modis intervals the maximum allowed percentage of missing values was 25 i e two days for an 8 day modis interval hu et al 2015 energy balance closure was analyzed for each site individually by summing the 8 day mean daytime totals of h etorig and a and calculating the energy balance ratio as ebr h etorig a with all terms in mm wilson et al 2002 energy balance closure was also analyzed by grouping the data according to land cover type and climate zone section 2 2 for the pooled data in each group the 8 day mean daytime totals of h etorig were plotted against a and the corresponding linear regression line and ebr were calculated geographic coordinates and land cover type data for each site were obtained from the metadata accompanying the datasets or from the literature table 2 the classification scheme of the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp was followed this classification system is adopted by most flux networks it is also used in most evaluation studies of remote sensing et models see e g velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 for each site the evaporative fraction ef was calculated as shuttleworth et al 1989 ef etorig h etorig where etorig and h are the mean daytime latent and sensible heat fluxes for each modis interval not corrected for the lack of energy balance closure the obtained values are listed in table 2 2 1 5 other datasets the köppen geiger climate class of each site was obtained using the 1 km resolution global map of beck et al 2018 the map was downloaded from https www gloh2o org koppen each site was assigned the climate class of the pixel where the flux tower was located the 40 sites represented a total of 10 different climate classes table 2 for the evaluation of the remote sensing et products these were grouped into four main climate zones section 2 2 for each of these climate zones the average ef was calculated using the site specific values listed in table 2 to investigate the match between the actual vegetation type at the flux tower site and the vegetation class or category used in the remote sensing et models section 2 3 the yearly modis land cover mcd12q1 500 m resolution and vegetation cover mod44b 250 m resolution products were used the data were downloaded from the nasa lp daac website from mcd12q1 the land cover type 2 data were used from mod44b the data layers containing percent tree cover and percent nontree vegetation were used for each site the following three subsets were generated for the years with eddy covariance data subset 1 four pixels of mcd12q1 data corresponding to the 1 km mod16 pixel subset 2 all pixels of mod44b data falling within the 0 25 gleam pixel and subset 3 all pixels of mcd12q1 data corresponding to the 5 km alexi pixel these subsets were used in the analysis described in section 2 3 finally fpar data from the mcd15a2h product were used to calculate g with the method of mu et al 2011 section 2 1 4 this product is an 8 day composite dataset with a spatial resolution of 500 m the data were again obtained from nasa s lp daac the pixels matching the location of the flux towers were used data with a cloud flag or retrieved by the backup algorithm were replaced by interpolated values zhao et al 2005 2 2 evaluation of product performance the remote sensing et products were evaluated by grouping the data by igbp land cover type and köppen geiger climate zone velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 to avoid groups with only one site the woody savanna site was included in the group with the savanna sites and the closed shrubland site was left out of the evaluations by land cover type but included in the evaluations by climate zone this resulted in the following five groups of vegetation cover types evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf evergreen needleleaf forest enf savanna sav and grassland gra likewise the sites were grouped into the following four main climate zones i af am tropical fully humid and tropical monsoon respectively from now on referred to as tropical wet ii aw tropical savanna iii b dry and iv c mild temperate sites assigned the mild temperate c climate were either located on tropical or subtropical mountains five sites or in lowland areas in the subtropics three sites see also richter 2016 table 3 shows the number of sites and the number of site years available in the complete dataset for each product by land cover type and climate zone 2 2 1 scatter plots and regression analysis scatter plots allow visual evaluation of the match between the remote sensing based and the observed et data velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 see also chang and hanna 2004 in addition the slope intercept and coefficient of determination r2 of the fitted linear regression line provide a quantitative way to evaluate product performance willmott 1982 velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 most studies evaluating remote sensing et products perform the regression analysis with the product estimates on the y axis and the observations on the x axis see e g mu et al 2011 velpuri et al 2013 mccabe et al 2016 however piñeiro et al 2008 showed that this can lead to erroneous estimates of the regression coefficients therefore in this study the observations were used as the y variable and the product estimates as the x variable piñeiro et al 2008 for each land cover type and climate zone in table 3 the eddy covariance observations were plotted against the et estimates of each product and the corresponding linear regression lines were calculated using the pooled data from the different sites in each group this analysis was performed using both etorig and etebc 2 2 2 statistical performance metrics in addition to visual inspection of the scatter plots and examination of the regression results three commonly used statistics in evaluation studies of remote sensing et products were calculated root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias and the coefficient of determination r2 see references in table s4 the use of these common statistics allowed for comparison with evaluation results from other latitudes section 2 4 the selected metrics provide complementary information about product performance the rmse is a measure of total error i e both random and systematic errors and is defined by 1 rmse n 1 et prod et obs 2 where et prod is the product et et obs the eddy covariance et and n the total number of data points i e the number of modis intervals the pbias is the systematic bias error in percent of the average of the observations 2 pbias n 1 et prod et obs n 1 et obs 100 third in addition to the r2 calculated from the pooled data section 2 2 1 the r2 of the linear regression between product et and observed et was calculated for each site separately besides being a measure of correlation r2 indicates how much of the variation in observed et is explained by the product et the three metrics were calculated using both etorig and etebc averages of both sets of rmse pbias and r2 values were calculated for each land cover type and climate zone in table 3 the average metrics by land cover type and climate zone were displayed graphically in plots for each product mccabe et al 2016 for etorig and etebc the results for the individual sites can be found in tables s2 and s3 2 2 3 combining the different performance metrics into a single score to facilitate comparison of the overall performance of the different et products the individual metrics r2 rmse pbias were combined into the ideal point error ipe score elshorbagy et al 2010 dawson et al 2012 the ipe score takes values between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating perfect performance i e all metrics are at their optimum values and 1 being assigned to the worst performing product in practice no product and no observation is without error therefore the best performing product will usually have an ipe greater than 0 the ipe values were calculated for each of the comparisons by land cover type and climate zone the calculation of ipe consists of two steps in the first step each performance metric is standardized to the worst score for that metric dawson et al 2012 provides expressions for this standardization step for different categories of performance measures denoted by s1 s5 their table 1 pbias is not listed in this table however as mentioned by dawson et al 2012 the flexibility of this method allows other metrics to be included pbias classifies as an s4 category metric and was standardized using the corresponding expression in the second step the ipe is calculated from the standardized metrics using equation 2 in dawson et al 2012 the results were plotted as heatmaps for etorig and etebc 2 2 4 sensitivity to the choice of reference dataset the statistical metrics r2 rmse pbias and the ipe scores were calculated as explained above but now using the common reference dataset this direct comparison approach included 12 fewer sites and about 36 fewer modis intervals than when using all data see table s1 for the number of sites and site years by land cover type and climate zone the sensitivity analysis was performed for etorig only differences in the ranking of products for each of the comparisons by land cover type and climate zone were determined by comparing the ipe scores from both approaches changes in ranking were indicated by adding an asterisk to the ipe scores in the heatmap for etorig 2 2 5 evaluation of seasonal trends in et from products the ability of the products to capture seasonal changes in et was examined by plotting the average monthly et for each product together with the average monthly etorig and etebc this was again done for each land cover type and climate zone in table 3 to account for the different timing of the rainy seasons separate plots were made for sites located in the northern and southern hemispheres 2 3 vegetation match index vmi and open water fraction owf the effect of a mismatch between the vegetation at the flux tower site and that detected in the model pixel on the product evaluation results was examined by calculating a vegetation match index vmi the models underlying the investigated et products differ in the level of detail with which they distinguish between different vegetation types both mod16 and alexi assign land cover specific parameters to a wide range of cover types while gleam only considers two vegetation categories i e tall and short vegetation however also for mod16 and alexi the largest differences between the land cover specific parameters occur between tall and short or forest and non forest vegetation types anderson et al 2007 mu et al 2011 therefore for all three products vmi was calculated based on these two vegetation categories the datasets used to calculate the vmis are described in section 2 1 5 as explained in section 1 a mismatch in vegetation can be caused by scale differences or inaccuracies in the vegetation input data to account for the latter vegetation data were selected that were as similar as possible to those used to generate the products sections 2 1 1 2 1 3 for mod16 and alexi mcd12q1 land cover type 2 data were used subsets 1 and 3 respectively the data from subsets 1 and 3 were aggregated into forest and non forest categories for sites with a forest land cover ebf dbf enf table 2 vmimod16 or vmialexi was calculated as the proportion of forest vegetation present in the 1 km mod16 or 5 km alexi pixel for sites with a non forest land cover sav gra the vmis were calculated as the proportion of non forest vegetation for gleam mod44b vegetation cover data were used subset 2 these data were assumed to be similar to those of the vcf5kyr product used as input to gleam v3 3a section 2 1 2 the vcf5kyr product is based on avhrr observations calibrated with modis data hansen et al 2018 in each data layer of the mod44b product pixels with water are masked out with a fill value of 200 hence vmigleam was calculated as either the average percent tree cover for sites with forest vegetation or the average percent nontree vegetation for sites with non forest vegetation multiplied by the fraction of land pixels in addition the open water fraction owf was calculated this index was used to filter out sites for which the pixel contained more than 20 water section 2 1 2 the dependence of product performance on the vegetation match between pixel and site was examined by plotting the performance metrics r2 rmse pbias against vmi individual site values for the metrics were bin averaged into four evenly spaced intervals of 0 25 vmi units wide in the case of gleam and alexi or for each of the five discrete vmi values in the case of mod16 for each metric vmi combination the linear regression line was calculated in addition to visual inspection of the scatter plots the p values of the calculated regression slopes were used to evaluate whether there was a relationship between vmi and product performance for this analysis performance statistics obtained for etorig were used 2 4 latitudinal comparison of product performance to investigate latitudinal dependence of the performance of the et products examined here a literature search was conducted to find studies that evaluated these products to allow for direct comparison only studies that evaluated the products with eddy covariance based et were considered furthermore a study needed to report at least one of the three performance metrics used in this study r2 rmse pbias or provide the data from which these metrics could be calculated the performance statistics depend on the averaging time used hence ideally only studies using the same time average as used here 8 day should be considered this would however drastically reduce the number of evaluation results available therefore studies using daily or monthly time averages were also included in the initial search in the end a total of 15 studies were found table s4 as will be shown below the evaluation results were different for etorig and etebc of the 15 studies found in the literature 13 used etorig and only two used etebc no studies were found that used both for the final analysis only studies using etorig were considered the study of miralles et al 2011 was also excluded because i gleam et was calculated using in situ measured r n ii comparisons were made using modelled et for the vegetation type i e tall or short vegetation matching that at the tower site and iii days with rainfall were excluded likewise the study of mu et al 2011 was excluded because their evaluation results are in fact calibration results this yielded a total of 12 studies including the current one most studies used mod16 c5 because mod16 c6 was only recently released therefore the results obtained here for c5 were used to account for latitudinal differences in et rmse was normalized by mean etorig nrmse not all studies reported etorig table s4 the studies evaluated product performance at a minimum of two eddy covariance sites to a maximum of 119 sites most studies reported evaluation results for individual sites but some reported averages for land cover classes e g velpuri et al 2013 reitz et al 2017 the latter were treated as if they were results for individual sites performance results were grouped into results for forest and non forest vegetation there were not enough performance data available to create more specific subgroups the results were further grouped into three latitudinal bands southern low latitudes 30 s 0 northern low latitudes 0 30 n and northern middle latitudes 30 n 60 n for latitudes outside these regions there were not enough data available table s4 table 4 summarizes the number of evaluation results n er available broken down into results for r2 nrmse and pbias and grouped by latitudinal zone product and vegetation category averages of each performance metric for each product vegetation category combination were plotted as a function of latitude 3 results 3 1 energy balance closure of eddy covariance data table 2 shows the daytime energy balance ratio ebr for each of the 40 individual sites the average daytime ebr for the 40 sites was 0 83 with a standard deviation sd of 0 10 and with values ranging from 0 63 to 1 03 figs 2 and 3 show scatter plots between the sum of the daytime turbulent heat fluxes and available energy grouped by land cover type and climate zone respectively the daytime ebr values calculated from the pooled data were similar across land cover types ranging from 0 79 to 0 87 and climate zones ranging from 0 77 to 0 85 the slopes and intercepts of the regression lines ranged from 0 67 to 0 80 and 0 01 to 0 67 mm day 1 respectively across land cover types and from 0 72 to 0 81 and 0 00 to 0 69 mm day 1 respectively across climate zones the coefficient of determination r2 ranged from 0 64 and 0 82 across land cover types and from 0 59 and 0 82 across climate zones 3 2 evaluation of et products by land cover type figures 4 and s1 show scatter plots comparing eddy covariance based and remote sensing based et by land cover type for each of the evaluated products for etorig and etebc respectively first the results for etorig will be examined although the scatter plots and the regression results for mod16 c5 and mod16 c6 show some differences these were generally smaller than the differences with the other products see also below hence from now on the two collections will be referred to as mod16 when necessary a distinction will be made between the two overall gleam et showed the best agreement with etorig this follows from the results of the regression analysis i e slope closer to 1 intercept closer to 0 higher r2 and can be observed visually as a narrower distribution of data points around the 1 1 line for dbf and sav the correlations between gleam et and etorig were strong r2 of 0 81 and 0 73 respectively a weak correlation was observed for ebf r2 0 32 the agreement with etorig was generally poorer for mod16 and alexi neither of these products consistently outperformed the other the scatter plots show a clear overestimation of etorig by mod16 for enf and a clear underestimation for sav although both products showed weaker correlations with etorig than gleam this was most pronounced for alexi also mod16 and alexi had the strongest correlations for dbf and sav and the weakest for ebf when evaluating the products with etebc the regression slopes and intercepts increased while changes in r2 were generally small figure s1 fig 5 shows the mean r2 rmse and pbias by land cover type for each of the evaluated products for etorig and etebc again the results for etorig will be examined first as already observed in fig 4 the mean performance statistics show that the differences between mod16 c5 and mod16 c6 are generally smaller than the differences with the other products one exception is enf this group however included a relatively small number of sites and site years table 3 which may have affected the comparisons fig 5 confirms the superior performance of gleam overall gleam had the strongest correlations the lowest rmses and the smallest pbias values in agreement with the graphical analysis neither mod16 nor alexi was second best over all land covers both gleam and mod16 tended to overestimate etorig for forest vegetation and underestimate etorig for non forest vegetation however biases were smaller for gleam alexi tended to overestimate etorig for all land cover types the variation in pbias across land cover types was smaller for gleam and alexi than for mod16 as seen in the scatter plots alexi had the weakest correlations with etorig all et products had the strongest correlations for dbf and sav and the weakest for ebf as expected pbias shifted to more negative values when the products were evaluated with etebc fig 5 depending on whether pbias decreased or increased the corresponding rmse became smaller or larger although not for all products see below the use of etebc generally had little effect on the correlations as also seen in the scatter plots for gleam pbias values were negative for all land cover types when using etebc and were generally greater in absolute terms than when using etorig as a result the rmses were larger and closer to those of the other products when using etebc than when using etorig for mod16 pbias values were also negative for most land cover types when using etebc the corresponding rmses were either somewhat larger e g sav gra or smaller e g ebf enf than when using etorig in the case of alexi pbias values decreased for all land cover types except sav however only in the case of ebf this was accompanied by a decrease in rmse for enf dbf and gra the rmse actually increased a partial explanation for this is the tendency of alexi to overestimate low etebc and underestimate high etebc dbf gra figure s1 fig 6 shows the ipe scores for the different et products by land cover type as obtained using etorig or etebc for evaluation the ipe scores confirm that gleam et best matched etorig across all land cover types the ipe scores also support the earlier observations that i the differences in performance between the two mod16 collections were generally smaller than the differences with the other products and ii neither mod16 nor alexi consistently outperformed the other fig 6 shows that the ipe values of the products converged when using etebc for evaluation this largely reflects the changes in pbias and rmse mentioned above when using etebc there is no product that stands out in terms of both small pbias and high r2 across all land cover types fig 7 compares the seasonal trends in et from the products with those from the observations by land cover type by hemisphere note that these curves were calculated using the common reference dataset only curves calculated with data from at least two sites are shown clear differences in the seasonality and timing of rainfall can be observed in both hemispheres et of ebf was characterized by weak seasonality with constant high values throughout the year yet mod16 c5 seemed to capture the small variations in et quite well this was also the case for gleam except during the wet season in the southern hemisphere when it showed a strong positive bias a closer look at the data showed that this involved the two brazilian rainforests table 2 fig 1 similarly alexi had a strong positive bias at the end of the dry season in the southern hemisphere this could be traced mainly to ebf in northeastern australia table 2 fig 1 for enf all products seemed to represent the observed seasonal trend in et fairly well for dbf gleam closely followed the observed seasonal trend in et mod16 had a negative bias during the dry season conversely alexi had a positive bias during the transition from the wet to dry season for sav and gra both gleam and mod16 had a strong negative bias during the dry season conversely alexi seemed to have a positive bias during the dry period in these cover types 3 3 evaluation of et products by climate zone the performance of the et products was also examined across four main climate zones table 3 for each climate zone an average evaporative fraction ef was calculated from the site specific values in table 2 yielding ranked from wet to dry 0 73 0 04 sd for af am tropical wet 0 60 0 10 for c mild temperate 0 50 0 11 for aw tropical savanna and 0 35 0 11 for b dry the tropical wet climate zone included mainly ebf sites seven in total table 3 the mild temperate climate zone included all enf sites and for the rest mainly ebf sites the savanna and dry climate zones included mostly sav dbf and gra sites the results of this analysis were presented in the same way as in the previous section i e scatter plots figures 8 and s2 average performance statistics r2 rmse pbias fig 9 heatmaps of ipe scores fig 6 and average seasonal trends in et fig 10 the comparisons by climate zone confirmed many of the findings in the previous section again the differences in performance between the two mod16 et collections were usually smaller than the differences with the other products figs 8 and 9 furthermore the performance and ranking of the products depended on whether etorig or etebc was used for evaluation when using etorig gleam again showed the strongest correlations and best agreement i e closeness to observations figs 8 and 9 as a result gleam had the smallest rmses and best ipe scores across all climate zones figs 9 and 6 respectively again neither mod16 nor alexi performed consistently better than the other that is mod16 showed better agreement with etorig for the aw climate zone whereas alexi gave better results for the b and c climate zones as summarized by the ipe scores in fig 6 finally there was no clear ranking among the products when etebc was used for evaluation fig 6 this mainly reflected the underestimation of gleam et with respect to etebc leading to higher i e more negative pbias values and larger rmses than when using etorig fig 9 for mod16 pbias and rmse values both decreased e g c climate zone and increased aw climate zone for alexi pbias decreased to values close to zero c aw b however instead of decreasing the corresponding rmses increased the use of etebc generally had little effect on the correlations figures 8 s2 and 9 all products had the weakest correlations in the wet tropical climate zone and the strongest in the tropical savanna and dry climate zones fig 9 this is consistent with the results in section 3 2 weakest correlations for ebf and strongest correlations for sav and dbf overall alexi had again the weakest correlations the biases of mod16 et varied markedly across climate zones fig 9 when compared with etorig mod16 tended to overestimate et in the wet tropical and mild temperate climate zones and underestimate et in the dry climate zone this result is consistent with the positive biases observed in fig 5 for forest vegetation dominating the wet tropical and mild temperate climate zones and the negative biases for non forest vegetation dominating the dry climate zone biases in gleam showed the same tendency but were generally much smaller in size for alexi the bias with respect to etorig was practically zero in the wet tropical climate zone but positive in the other climate zones the seasonal trend analysis fig 10 revealed the same patterns as found earlier in section 3 2 again reflecting the close correspondence between climate and vegetation for the tropical wet climate zone mod16 c5 et closely followed the observed seasonal changes in et this was also the case for gleam except for the positive bias during the wet season in the southern hemisphere traced back mainly to the brazilian rainforests section 3 2 the positive bias of alexi et at the end of the dry season in the southern hemisphere can also be observed again traced back mainly to ebf in northeastern australia section 3 2 in addition alexi et showed large seemingly erratic variations in the northern hemisphere for the mild temperate climate zone all products represented the observed seasonal trend in et fairly well for the tropical savanna climate both mod16 and gleam had a strong negative bias during the dry season which was also observed in the plots for gra and sav in fig 7 the positive bias for alexi during the dry period can also be observed again for the dry climate zone gleam et closely followed the observed seasonal trend in et alexi had again a positive bias during the dry period mod16 had a strong negative bias during the wet season in the southern hemisphere 3 4 sensitivity to the choice of reference dataset the ipe scores based on the common reference dataset figure s3 show similar results to those obtained using all data fig 6 etorig for both the comparisons by land cover type and climate zone gleam et generally showed the best agreement with etorig furthermore the differences among the two mod16 collections and alexi were generally too small to identify a second best performing product differences in ranking results between the two approaches were observed only for mod16 and alexi fig 6 3 5 product performance versus vmi fig 11 shows binned scatter plots between the performance metrics r2 rmse pbias and the vegetation match index for the different products in addition the regression lines and the p values indicating the statistical significance of the regression slopes are shown the vmis for each individual site are given in table s2 the average vmi was 0 77 0 41 for mod16 0 71 0 40 for alexi and 0 51 0 23 for gleam these results indicate a decreasing vegetation match between pixel and site with increasing pixel size although the vmis of gleam and the other products cannot be directly compared as they are based on different data for none of the products there was an improvement in performance i e increasing r2 or decreasing rmse or pbias with increasing vmi fig 11 moreover for none of the regressions the slope was statistically significant 3 6 latitudinal comparison of product performance fig 12 shows zonal averages southern and northern low latitudes and northern middle latitudes of the performance metrics grouped by forest and non forest vegetation for mod16 and gleam and alexi the averages were calculated using evaluation results from this study and from the literature tables s2 and s4 for alexi no data on nrmse and pbias were available for the northern middle latitudes table 4 fig 12 should be interpreted with caution because the number of evaluation results n er available varied considerably among latitudinal zones products and vegetation categories table 4 in the case of forest vegetation correlations all products seem to be weaker while pbias and nrmse scores mod16 and gleam seem to be better at low latitudes than at northern middle latitudes both mod16 and gleam seem to overestimate etorig in all latitudinal zones in contrast in the case of non forest vegetation the performance metrics show no clear variation with latitude moreover both mod16 and gleam seem to underestimate etorig in all latitudinal zones 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of the energy balance closure problem on product evaluation results the average energy balance ratio for the 40 sites in this study 0 83 is nearly identical to that reported by stoy et al 2013 for 173 mainly mid latitude fluxnet sites 0 84 when grouped by land cover type or climate zone the ranges of ebr values were fairly small 0 79 0 87 or 0 77 0 85 respectively a greater range was observed for the 173 fluxnet sites grouped by land cover type 0 70 0 94 table 2 in stoy et al 2013 as mentioned in section 1 the reasons for the energy balance closure problem and the extent to which it affects the et fluxes are not yet clear despite being long recognized the effect of the energy balance closure problem on the evaluation results of remote sensing based et products has rarely been examined michel et al 2016 melton et al 2021 this study found that the performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether the unadjusted or the energy balance closure corrected et fluxes were used when using etorig gleam showed the best overall performance with the strongest correlations and smallest biases however when using etebc none of the products was superior to the others not surprisingly the use of etebc instead of etorig affected the product biases more than the correlations overall mod16 and gleam underestimated et compared to etebc for alexi pbias decreased when using etebc instead of etorig but the corresponding rmses tended to increase rather than decrease for most seb approaches used in the openet project cumulative totals of et over the growing season or water year also agreed better with etebc than with etorig melton et al 2021 both mod16 and gleam include parameters that were calibrated using field observations of et mod16 was calibrated using et obtained from eddy covariance based estimates of water use efficiency wue and modis based gross primary production gpp with wue being calculated as the ratio between gpp and et fluxes not corrected for energy balance closure mu et al 2011 the use of etorig could possibly explain the negative bias of mod16 with respect to etebc michel et al 2016 however the gpp fluxes may have been underestimated for the same reason as etorig foken et al 2011 in that case the estimated wue would not or only partly be affected in gleam fixed values are used for the priestley taylor coefficient for short α 1 26 and tall α 0 97 vegetation martens et al 2017 these values are averages of α values published in the literature which in turn were obtained by comparing field measurements of et under well watered conditions with potential et some of the α values were derived with etorig but others were obtained using et estimates based on other methods such as the weighing lysimeter and bowen ratio energy balance techniques see references cited in martens et al 2017 hence also the negative bias error of gleam with respect to etebc cannot be directly linked to calibration with etorig alexi et had smaller pbias when using etebc than when using etorig in contrast to the other models alexi is not calibrated with field data however no conclusions can be drawn from this observation without a better understanding of the effect of the energy balance closure problem on etorig in addition the rmses of alexi tended to increase rather than decrease when using etebc the literature review showed that most studies evaluated the products using etorig table s4 it is recommended to use both etorig and etebc as long as the effect of the energy balance closure problem on etorig is not clear the remainder of the discussion will focus on the results obtained with etorig to facilitate comparisons with the literature 4 2 relative performance of the evaluated products similar results were obtained when grouping the data by land cover type or climate zone showing the close relationship between the two see for example cui et al 2021 therefore the results of these two analyses will be discussed together and interchangeably as explained in section 1 a distinction should be made between product and model evaluation studies the former evaluate the published et products while the latter evaluate the performance of the underlying models using a common input dataset because modeled et is sensitive to the input data the results of the model evaluation studies do not necessarily apply to the final et products see section 1 for references overall gleam had the best performance across different land cover types and climate zones in the low latitudes neither mod16 nor alexi could be identified as the second best performing product these results were obtained regardless of whether the comparisons were made using all data or a common reference dataset there are very few product evaluation studies that have compared the performance of the products assessed in this study khan et al 2018 2020 compared the performance of gleam and mod16 at nine and five eddy covariance sites respectively in both studies about one third of sites were located in the low latitudes and about two thirds in the middle latitudes see also table s4 khan et al 2018 used etorig to evaluate the products while khan et al 2020 used etebc consistent with the results of this study khan et al 2018 found that gleam generally corresponded better with etorig than mod16 also when using etebc khan et al 2020 found that gleam outperformed mod16 as opposed to this study where differences were small when using etebc in the absence of other comparative studies the compilation of product evaluation results for the latitudinal analysis fig 12 table s4 allows for an indirect comparison of product performance focusing only on the results for the northern middle latitudes to exclude the evaluation data from this study the overall better match of gleam with etorig as compared to mod16 is also evident from the studies included in this analysis see table s4 for references the stronger correlations of gleam as compared to alexi are also noticeable when comparing the r2 values from studies that evaluated these products separately an overall better performance of gleam as compared to mod16 was also observed in the model evaluation studies by mccabe et al 2016 and michel et al 2016 gleam also performed better than the surface energy balance approach evaluated in these studies i e the sebs model of su 2002 similarly vinukollu et al 2011a obtained better performance results for a priestley taylor approach developed by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl fisher et al 2008 than for mod16 and sebs however all these studies concluded that no single model was superior in all cases the same conclusion was reached in a recent model evaluation study for south america melo et al 2021 such a conclusion is not supported by the results of this study as gleam performed better than mod16 and alexi in all land cover types and climate zones it is not known whether this is a feature of the low latitudes i e the other studies focused mainly on the middle latitudes whether it is related to the differences between product and model evaluation studies discussed earlier or whether it is a result specific to the products studied here all products had the weakest correlations in the wet tropical climate zone dominated by ebf and the strongest in the tropical savanna and dry climate zones dominated by dbf and sav for the most part this reflects differences in seasonality i e the greater the variation in et the stronger the correlations miralles et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2014 rather than differences related to the performance of the products alexi generally had the weakest correlations of all products comparing the r2 values from the studies used for the latitudinal analysis shows values for alexi between those of mod16 and gleam northern middle latitudes fig 12 although this is an indirect comparison because it involves studies that evaluated the products separately it suggests that the low correlations observed in this study for alexi are not a general feature of the product a known challenge for thermal based approaches is the filtering of cloud contaminated data and the resulting gaps between successful retrievals failure to detect cloud contaminated data can lead to large errors in alexi et estimates anderson et al 2007 yilmaz et al 2014 the uncertainty in gap filled alexi et can be twice as large as that in et generated by the algorithm under clear sky conditions anderson et al 2007 these cloud related problems could be responsible for the weak correlations of alexi but that still does not explain the difference with the northern middle latitudes where the data are also affected by clouds a possible approach to solving these problems is to use cloud tolerant microwave based land surface temperature in alexi holmes et al 2018 finally holmes et al 2018 found that averaging 0 05 alexi et estimates to 0 25 spatial resolution generally improved correlations with flux tower data they attributed this to the presence of noise in the modis land surface temperature data that outweighed the benefits of the higher resolution compared to a 0 25 average however the overall effect reported in that study is too small to explain the differences in correlation with the other products observed here more work is needed to understand the reasons for the low correlations of alexi observed at the low latitude sites studied here both mod16 and gleam had a positive bias for forest vegetation and a negative bias for non forest vegetation no such land cover type dependent biases were observed for alexi the biases of mod16 and gleam are also evident from the evaluation results of other studies northern middle latitudes fig 12 both zhang et al 2019a and brust et al 2021 showed that the biases in mod16 can be significantly reduced when calibrating the algorithm with more and a greater diversity of sites than used in the original calibration brust et al 2021 found that the accuracy of mod16 can also be improved by including the effect of soil moisture on et although the apparent vegetation type dependent biases were less pronounced in gleam more work is needed to understand the causes in a model evaluation study miralles et al 2016 found the opposite pattern i e mod16 and gleam underestimated et determined from rainfall and streamflow data in wet regions dominated by forest vegetation and overestimated et in dry regions dominated by non forest vegetation types a similar pattern was observed in the model evaluation study by michel et al 2016 using etorig as reference data in the model evaluation study for south america gleam underestimated et in both wet and dry regions melo et al 2021 the biases of mod16 were small in that study this shows again that the results of model evaluation studies do not necessarily apply to the actual et products none of the products were able to correctly represent the seasonal trend in et in all land cover types and climate zones detailed analyses such as this one can help identify the causes of the biases discussed above for example the negative biases of mod16 and gleam in gra and sav seemed to occur mainly during the dry season this may indicate an overestimation of the effect of water stress on et in contrast alexi seemed to overestimate et during the dry season in some cases the differences between the product based and the observed trends could be traced to individual sites the overestimation of et of brazilian rainforest by gleam during the wet season was also observed by chen et al 2022 these authors suggested the lack of an atmospheric moisture control on transpiration as a possible cause of this overestimation it is likely that the erratic variation observed in the alexi data for the tropical wet sites was caused by the cloud related problems discussed above however to correctly identify possible seasonal biases a more comprehensive analysis that includes more sites and site years is needed the results showed that the differences between the mod16 c5 and c6 products were generally smaller than the differences with the other products differences between c5 and c6 were to be expected because of differences in input data and spatial resolutions mu et al 2013 running et al 2019 the differences persisted when using the common reference dataset figure s3 future work can focus on quantifying the level of consistency between these two collections 4 3 latitudinal comparison of product performance the literature review revealed that remote sensing based et products have been evaluated primarily in the northern middle latitudes the bias is the result of geographic differences in the availability of eddy covariance data due to uneven distribution of flux towers see for example schimel et al 2015 and regional differences in data sharing villarreal and vargas 2021 with the results of this study the availability of evaluation data for the low latitudes was significantly improved this allowed a comparison of product performance across latitudes the results of this analysis should be interpreted with caution however because the number of evaluation results available varied considerably among latitudes products and vegetation categories table 4 smaller normalized rmses and smaller pbias values suggest better performance of mod16 and gleam for low latitude forests than for northern mid latitude forests the weaker correlations at low latitudes are thought to be the result of differences in seasonality rather than differences in performance see below the similarity between the latitudinal trends in nrmse and pbias of mod16 and gleam is striking considering the different approaches forcing data and resolutions of the underlying models more work is needed to understand the causes of the apparent latitudinal dependence of these products in the case of non forest vegetation none of the performance metrics showed a clear trend with latitude noteworthy is that both mod16 and gleam seem to overestimate et of forest vegetation and underestimate et of non forest vegetation in all latitudinal bands see also discussion above a limitation of the current analysis is that regional differences were not detected because of the broad zonal bands used for example nrmses were considerably larger for seasonally dry dbf 0 36 and 0 84 for gleam and mod16 respectively data not shown than for wet tropical ebf 0 27 and 0 46 respectively similarly vinukollu et al 2011b and miralles et al 2016 found higher relative uncertainties for the subtropics than for the tropics in these studies relative uncertainty was estimated from the spread between different model outputs the weaker correlations for low latitude forests are most likely explained by the small seasonal variation in et of ebf the seasonal variation in et of temperate forests is much greater due to stronger seasonal variations in radiation and temperature baldocchi and ryu 2011 again however differences among forests in the low latitudes were large for example the r2 values for dbf were about twice as high as those for ebf fig 5 there were no clear latitudinal differences in r2 for non forest vegetation at low latitudes non forest vegetation occurs mainly in regions with high seasonality of rainfall e g savanna regions and thus large variations in et likewise temperate non forest vegetation types such as grass and crops show large variations in et due to seasonal variation in radiation and temperature e g monteith and moss 1977 4 4 product performance versus vegetation match between pixel and site the linear regression analyses across all 40 sites showed that there was no relationship between the product evaluation results and the vegetation match between pixel and site indirect evidence for this was also provided by the finding that the product with the largest pixel size and the lowest average vmi gleam performed best overall similar results were obtained by hobeichi et al 2018 and jiménez et al 2018 hobeichi et al 2018 investigated the effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on the performance of a merged et product for this they divided the eddy covariance sites in two groups those for which the igbp land cover type was the same as that of the pixel and those for which it was not they used modis land cover data at the same spatial resolution 0 5 as the merged et product no clear differences in the performance of the product were observed between the two groups of sites jiménez et al 2018 investigated the effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on the performance of the gleam pt jpl and mod16 algorithms the models were run with a common input dataset at a spatial resolution of 0 25 for all three models a single vegetation match index was used called homogeneity index this index was calculated using modis igbp land cover data mcd12q1 and modis vegetation cover data mod44b also in their study no significant relationships were found between model performance and the homogeneity index a challenge is to correctly define the vegetation match index hobeichi et al 2018 in this study only two vegetation categories were considered forest and non forest vegetation as the land cover type dependent parameters in mod16 and alexi can be broadly grouped into these two categories and gleam only distinguishes between these two categories in the other studies a match was only obtained if the specific igbp land cover type corresponded this may be too stringent if the parameters are similar among certain cover types understanding the sensitivity of the model outputs to the land cover type specific parametrizations can help determine which of these approaches is more adequate nevertheless the results obtained so far suggest that errors other than those caused by a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site are more important jiménez et al 2018 5 conclusions there is a geographical bias in the availability of evaluation data for remote sensing based et products in favor of the northern middle latitudes to address this bias three products gleam mod16 alexi were evaluated at 40 eddy covariance sites in the low latitudes from mod16 the discontinued collection 5 c5 and the latest collection c6 were evaluated two potential problems need to be considered when using eddy covariance observations of et as reference data first eddy covariance data suffer from uncertainties related to the energy balance closure problem second scale differences and classification errors can lead to a mismatch in vegetation between pixel and site which in turn can complicate the comparisons because of the geographical bias in evaluation studies it is unknown whether the products perform equally well at all latitudes the differences between mod16 c5 and c6 were generally smaller than the differences with the other products more work is needed however to determine the degree of consistency between the two collections performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether or not the eddy covariance et data were corrected for the lack of energy balance closure when using the unadjusted fluxes etorig gleam showed the best overall performance across the studied land cover types and climate zones with the strongest correlations and smallest biases neither mod16 nor alexi consistently outperformed the other when using the corrected fluxes etebc there was no product that stood out in terms of both low bias and strong correlations the uncertainty associated with the energy balance closure problem affected the product biases more than the correlations most product evaluation studies use etorig as reference data use of both etorig and etebc is recommended until a better understanding of the effect of the energy balance closure problem on et is obtained few studies have compared the performance of the products examined here however a comparison of results from studies that evaluated these products separately seems to confirm that gleam generally outperforms the other products when using etorig as reference data latitudinal dependence of product performance was examined using the results of this study and those published in the literature the comparison suggests that mod16 and gleam perform better for low latitude forests than for northern mid latitude forests however regional differences such as between the tropics and subtropics can be large and were not detected because of the broad zonal bands used in this analysis in the case of non forest vegetation the products show no clear latitudinal differences in performance no relationship was found between the product evaluation results and the degree of match between the vegetation at the flux tower site and that detected in the model pixel more work is needed to understand the effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on product performance 6 data availability the 8 day mean

3259,to better understand the river thermal regime alteration caused by anthropogenic disturbances we propose a framework to assess the alteration degree of thermal regime in a regulated river in this framework 23 temperature metrics including existing and newly developed temperature parameters are used to characterize river thermal alteration and are organized into four groups i e magnitude timing variability duration and frequency the proposed framework is then applied to assess the impacts of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regime of the hanjiang river our results show that the danjiangkou dam had a substantial impact on the thermal regime of the hanjiang river by increasing water temperature in winter and decreasing water temperature in spring and summer especially after the dam was raised the effect was greatest immediately downstream to the dam and decreased with as the distance from the dam increases start date of the critical 18 was delayed by approximately two months such effects may lead to negative ecological implications to the downstream of the danjiangkou dam the results of this study illustrate the pronounced effect of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regime of the hanjiang river the framework proposed could be a robust method to assess the impacts of reservoir operation on the thermal regime for regulated rivers keywords water temperature thermal regime

yearsley et al 2019 daniels and danner 2020 it has a great impact on the ecological chemical and biological processes in the river system the river thermal regime is strongly related to large scale climate changes isaak et al 2012 van vliet et al 2013 rice and jastram 2015 chen et al 2016a dugdale et al 2017 zhu et al 2021 and anthropogenic perturbations e g dam construction thermal pollution van vliet et al 2011 wang et al 2020 ferencz et al 2021 large dams and reservoirs impose direct impact on the thermal regime of the river downstream by inducing changes in the thermal capacity and heat load poole and berman 2001 olden and naiman 2010 the extent to which a dam affects downstream thermal regimes depends on their mode of operation and specific mechanism of water release the magnitude of thermal regime change depends largely on stratification behaviour of the reservoir i e depth profile of the thermocline and the depth at which water is released from the dam olden and naiman 2010 li et al 2021b therefore it is vitally important to understand the degree of alteration in the water temperature of dammed rivers in recent decades considerable studies have been done to investigate thermal impacts of large dams on downstream rivers worldwide wright et al 2009 hannah and garner 2015 niemeyer et al 2018 tao et al 2020 you et al 2020 shahryar et al 2021 keepit dam modified the thermal regime of the namoi river and as a result the annual maximum daily temperature was lowered by approximately 5 0 c preece and jones 2002 dickson et al 2012 illustrated some major effects that flow from hydropower storage reservoirs can have on the thermal dynamics of rivers in high altitude alpine basing alterations of hydropower to natural thermal regimes influence the key organisms in terms of survival development and behavioral thresholds of atlantic salmon and brown trout in high northern latitude stream systems heggenes et al 2021 spatial variability in water temperature of the sauce grande river regulated by the paso de las piedras dam revealed the effects of the dam on the thermal behavior of the downstream river casado et al 2013 cascading large reservoirs exert a more complex influence on the downstream water temperature disrupting the thermal spawning cues for fish species wang et al 2020 in addition some researchers are committed to studying the impact of small dams with shallow reservoirs on river water temperature maheu et al 2016 chandesris et al 2019 evaluating the impacts of dams and reservoirs in influencing the downstream thermal regimes in river systems has become a research hotspot in regulated rivers hydrological regimes of streams and rivers have been characterized e g poff et al 1997 gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 mezger et al 2021 based on previous studies similar approaches have been used in studying the thermal regimes of streams chu et al 2010 assessed the thermal characteristics of 90 stream sites throughout the great lakes basin with 13 temperature metrics indicating the existence of a regional pattern in the thermal regimes casado et al 2013 assembled a 30 day dataset at 8 water temperature gauging sites deployed along the main channel upstream and downstream from the impoundment and assessed the diurnal regimes by relative differences in the shape and magnitude of the thermographs with metrics characterizing daily water temperature regime jones and schmidt 2017 examined the influence of record length on the estimation uncertainty of commonly used thermal metrics at 19 sites from u s geological survey hydrometric stations and found that most thermal metrics can be evaluated with reasonable accuracy using approximately 12 years of daily data although these studies capture the river thermal conditions that may limit ecosystem productivity using these metrics alone ignores other ecologically relevant thermal characteristics for example the start date of critical water temperature affects the onset of spawning and hatching behavior of many organisms in streams and rivers the first date of critical temperature means the first day when water temperature reaches a critical temperature in a specific life stages e g spawning and hatching the critical temperature threshold is associated with spawning season and fish species motos et al 1996 king et al 1998 martin et al 2018 metrics that can describe these conditions the magnitude timing variability duration and frequency of thermal regimes are needed olden and naiman 2010 casado et al 2013 jones and schmidt 2018 to date limited studies exist on how to quantify the alteration degree in thermal regimes of streams and rivers the hanjiang river located between 106 and 114 e and 30 34 n is the largest tributary of the yangtze river yang et al 2012 the danjiangkou reservoir located in the middle section of the hanjiang river is the water source for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project in china the danjiangkou reservoir has influenced the hydrological processes wang et al 2015 and sediment regimes lu et al 2012 the hydrological regime of the middle and downstream sections of the hanjiang river was further significantly changed after the normal operational level was increased from 157 to 170 m in 2012 yu et al 2020 chen et al 2016b investigated the spatio temporal variability in the thermal regimes of the danjiangkou reservoir using a water temperature model zhao et al 2020 quantified the impacts of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regimes of the hanjiang river by retrieving water surface temperatures from landsat thermal infrared imageries however due to the limit of long term data quantifying thermal regime alteration of the hanjiang river has not yet been investigated especially after the dam being raised the objectives of the paper are a to present a framework to assess the impacts of dam on the thermal regime in the regulated river b to reconstruct the long term water temperature data of the hanjiang river and c to quantify the thermal regime alteration in the hanjiang river by comparing water temperature post dam construction and to analyze the possible causes the results of this study will provide a new tool for evaluating the thermal regime variations in regulated streams and rivers affected by human activities 2 study area and data the hanjiang river with a total length of 1 577 km and a catchment area of 159 000 km2 is the longest tributary of the yangtze river it passes through shanxi and hubei provinces in china and merges into the yangtze river in wuhan fig 1 the climate in this region is characterized as a subtropical monsoon with hot and humid summers and mild winters the average annual rainfall in the hanjiang river basin is 873 mm with an average annual runoff of 51 7 billion m3 a reduction of 75 between may october as a result of anthropogenic activities the flow regime has been changed especially after the completion of the danjiangkou dam yu et al 2020 li et al 2021a the danjiangkou dam is a deep release dam with an elevation of 162 m above the sea level creating one of the largest reservoirs in asia zhao et al 2020 it started to impound water in 1967 with a total storage capacity of 17 4 billion m3 as the reservoir serves as the water source for the south to north water diversion project it was raised from 162 to 176 6 m in 2012 liu et al 2018 leading to an increase in the storage capacity from 17 45 to 29 05 billion m3 the hydropower intake is at 122 5 m the limited level of reservoir during the flood season normal operational level and the highest flood regulation level of danjiangkou reservoir are 160 m 170 m and 174 34 m respectively a distinct thermocline formed in the reservoir between may and october chen et al 2016b the hydrological process has been influenced by the dam construction along the hanjiang river wang et al 2015 yu et al 2020 the hanjiang river is one of the most important freshwater fishery areas in china four famous major carp species ffmc black carp mylopharyngodon piceus grass carp ctenopharyngodon idellus silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp aristichthys nobilis are important food resources in the yangtze river basin hydrological and thermal regime alterations caused by impoundment of danjiangkou dam threaten the biodiversity and ecosystem functions of hanjang river the population of ffmc reduced sharply from 1970 s xie et al 2009 to assess the river thermal alterations associated with the operation of the danjiangkou dam four hydrological stations on the main channel of the hanjiang river were investigated 1 huangjiagang 2 xiangyang 3 huangzhuang and 4 xiantao fig 1 the huangjiagang station is located 6 km downstream of the danjiangkou dam with a catchment area of 95 217 km2 the xiangyang station is a control station in the mainstream of the middle section of the hanjiang river located 111 km below the danjiangkou dam with a catchment area of 103 261 km2 the huangzhuang station is located approximately 241 km below the dam with a catchment area of 142 056 km2 the xiantao station is in the lower section of the hanjiang river about 530 km below the dam the daily flow discharges at the four stations from 1953 to 2017 were collected from the changjiang water resources commission of china flow data at xiantao station from jan 1968 to mar 1971 are not available daily air temperature data at the four meteorological stations from 1953 to 2017 were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn daily water temperature data at the four stations from 2006 to 2017 are also from the changjiang water resources commission the analysis focuses on three time periods from 1953 to 1966 the period prior to the construction of danjiangkou dam pre dam from 1967 to 2012 the period after the dam started to impound but prior to the dam being raised post dam and from 2013 to 2017 the period after the dam being raised post dam raised 3 methodology 3 1 a framework for water temperature regime alteration assessment in this study we present a framework for assessing the river thermal regime alterations associated with dam construction the implementation consists of a series of operational steps step 1 obtain the river temperature data collect the water temperature data at the study sites or obtain data from the watershed management department if the historical observation data is too short or unavailable it can be reconstructed based on the relationship between water temperature and major influencing factors such as flow and air temperature traditional water temperature models e g physical based and data driven models for the reservoir and river can be used to simulate the water temperature the deep learning methods with higher accuracy can also be used for water temperature prediction see section 3 2 step 2 determine the impact year for the regulated rivers with dams and sluices the first impoundment time of the dam can be taken as the impact year for other human activities if the exact impact year cannot be determined like dams statistical techniques can be applied to detect the impact year such as the non parametric test pettitt test this method can detect a significant change in the mean of a time series when the exact time of the change is unknown through test for a shift in the central tendency gao et al 2011 step 3 assess the thermal alteration calculate the water temperature metrics selected in the indicators of thermal alteration see section 3 3 assess the change in the thermal regime before and after the dam construction via alteration degree see section 3 4 3 2 water temperature series reconstruction a generalized regression neural network grnn model is applied to reconstruct the river water temperature the grnn is a one pass neural network learning algorithm with a highly parallel structure specht 1991 the network has the feature of fast learning and does not require an iterative procedure which is a powerful tool for regression approximation fitting and prediction problems yuan et al 2020 we assume a vector random variable and a scalar random variable y are the input and output variables respectively which can be expressed as follows 1 x x 1 x 2 x p 2 y y 1 y 2 y n where p is the dimension of and n is the number of observations assuming that x i and y i i 1 2 n are sample values of and y respectively the regression of y on the input value x can then be estimated by grnn as 3 y x i 1 n y i k x x i i 1 n k x x i 4 k x x i e d i 2 2 σ 2 5 d i 2 x x i t x x i where k is the gaussian kernel and di is the euclidean distance between x and x i and σ is a spread constant optimization involves determining the value of σ that minimizes the mean square error when predicting the outputs based on the model developed for the training data more details about grnn can be referred to cigizoglu and alp 2006 seckin et al 2013 and yuan et al 2020 in this study data at huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuan and xiantao stations in the hanjiang ricer are divided into the calibration period 2006 2010 and the validation period 2011 2012 air temperature and discharge are used as input variables in the grnn model the daily water temperatures at the four stations prior to 2005 are reconstructed by using the model the performance of the grnn model is evaluated by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 6 nse 1 t 1 n y t y t 2 t 1 n y t y 2 where y t is the simulated value yt is the observed value and y is the mean value of observed data the minimum values of nse closest to 1 represent the highest prediction accuracy 3 3 indicators of thermal alteration adapted from casado et al 2013 jones and schmidt 2018 and poff et al 1997 we propose a set of thermal metrics to characterize natural river water temperature conditions and facilitate evaluations of human induced changes to thermal regimes referred to as the indicators of thermal alteration indicators of thermal alteration is developed to assess the river water temperature regime it is based on an analysis of water temperature data available either from field measurement within an ecosystem or model data we use 23 parameters divided into three groups namely magnitude timing variability duration and frequency to statistically characterize river thermal variation within each year these 23 parameters provide information on the ecologically significant features of river ecosystems table 1 we then assess the perturbations of river water temperature conditions associated with human activities such as dam constructions flow diversions and intensive land use conversion by comparing the central tendency and dispersion of each parameter between pre impact and post impact periods 3 4 alteration degree assessment the range of variability approach by richter et al 1996 is used to assess the alteration degree of river thermal regime the target range for each river thermal parameter is usually based on selected percentile levels or a simple multiple of the parameter standard deviations for the pre disturbance thermal regime the degree to which annual values of thermal indices do not fall within the target range is a measure of thermal alteration measurement of thermal alteration can be calculated as follows observed expected expected where observed is the number of years in which the observed value of the thermal parameter falls within the target range and expected is the number of years in which the value of the parameter is expected to be in the target range based on the frequency of occurrence in the pre disturbance thermal regime the integrated degree of thermal alteration of all parameters can be determined as follows 7 d 0 1 n i 1 n d i 2 where n is the total number of the indicators d i denotes the alteration values for the ith thermal parameter to map river thermal alteration we divide the range of thermal alteration into three equal classes and assign a distinct pattern to each class 1 0 33 l representing little or no alteration 2 34 67 m representing a moderate alteration 3 68 100 h representing a high degree of alteration 4 results 4 1 performance of the model water temperature data reconstruction at the huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations was successfully obtained by using the grnn model discharge and air temperature are used as input variables in the proposed model reconstructed river water temperatures during the validation periods at the four stations were compared to the observed river water temperature data fig 2 the rmse and nse results of the calibration and validation periods are listed in table 2 value of nse for the grnn model for each station ranges from 0 92 to 0 97 as can be seen the grnn model shows satisfactory performance for all stations for the grnn model automatically adjust the network structure and approximate nonlinear functions with high precision it has the capacity to well represent the nonlinear relationships among water temperature and its critical factors i e air temperature and discharge which produces the high prediction accuracy in the calibration set and validation set daily water temperatures at the four stations from 1953 to 2005 are reconstructed using the proposed model 4 2 changes in discharge water temperature and air temperature the annual mean flow discharges at the huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations were 1082 m3 s 1234 m3 s 1424 m3 s and 1232 m3 s respectively fig 3 from 1953 to 2017 the annual mean water temperature at the four stations was 15 8 16 5 17 3 and 17 32 respectively the water temperature at the huangjiagang station decreased significantly after 2013 fig 3a which might be primarily due to the danjiangkou reservoir enhancement the coefficient of variation cv of the annual mean water temperature during the study period followed the following order xiantao cv 0 036 huangjiagang 0 035 huangzhuang 0 027 xiangyang 0 021 compared to the cv values of 0 034 to 0 040 for air temperature 4 3 effect of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regime after the completion of the danjiangkou dam dramatical changes have taken place in the hydrological regime of the hanjiang river monthly flow at the four stations from december to march normal low flow period increased after the reservoir behind the dam began to impound water in 1967 fig 3 when the dam was raised from 162 m to 176 6 m the flow regime of the hanjiang river was further affected after 1967 high discharges during summer decreased sharply at the four stations reflecting the flood control function of the dam thermal regime changes in the hanjiang river were assessed by using the framework proposed in this study the alteration degrees in the post dam parameters against that in the pre dam parameters in the hanjiang river were calculated tables 3 6 before and after the construction of the danjiangkou dam the median monthly water temperature at the four stations throughout the year changed slightly fig 4 after the dam was raised the monthly water temperature changed significantly especially at the huangjiagang station the high degree of change in water temperature at the huangjiagang station below the dam in ten months table 3 indicates that the danjiangkou impoundment has dramatically influenced the monthly water temperature near the location compared with the huangjiagang station there are only 2 or 3 months at the xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao reaching a high degree of thermal alteration for the huangjiagang station moderate degree of thermal alteration was observed in most months table 4 the deviations in january february march may july november and december exceeded 34 the moderate degree the alteration degree of october median monthly temperature reached 75 the highest degree of deviation for the huangzhuang and xiantao stations the degree of alteration exceeded 34 in 8 months of the year table 5 table 6 the medians of annual minimum and maximum water temperature at the huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations changed significantly after the dam was built fig 5 remarkable differences were observed between the two periods along the hanjiang river although the median julian date of the minimum water temperatures at the four stations slightly shifted by 1 day 22 days 3 days and 15 days respectively these dates still occur during the winter tables 3 5 the timing of the maximum water temperatures at the four stations has not been strongly affected by the dam with only 9 days 4 days 0 and 16 days of shift respectively it indicates that reservoir impoundment affects the magnitude of the extreme water temperature but has no significant effect on the occurrence time of the extreme water temperature starting date when water reaches 18 is critical for the ffmc in the hanjiang river li et al 2006 the starting time at the huangjiagang station near the dam has been delayed by 18 days table 3 with a moderate alteration degree in comparison there was no obvious difference at the other three stations after danjiangkou dam started to impound water duration of high pulses duration of low pulses number of high pulses and number of low pulses at huangjiagang station have been greatly changed with alterations of 39 42 39 and 39 respectively table 3 compared with the huangjiagang station only number of low pulses at the xiangyang and huangzhuang reached a moderate degree high pulses and low pulses of water temperature at xiantao have not been greatly affected by the dam in terms of either number of events or the median duration of these events the alteration degree of minimum monthly range at the huangjiagang station reached high class of 76 table 3 in comparison the alteration degrees at the other three stations were moderate level of 57 55 and 56 respectively tables 4 6 for all four stations there was no significant alteration in the maximum monthly range of water temperature along the hanjiang river the influence of reservoir storage on the minimum monthly temperature range is significantly larger than that on the maximum monthly temperature range 4 4 effect of raising the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regime the water temperature regime of the hanjiang river was further influenced after the expansion of the danjiangkou reservoir high and moderate degrees of thermal regime alteration were observed for most months at the huangjiagang station the highest degrees of thermal change occurred in may june august november and december the monthly water temperatures in may and june dropped by 1 79 and 4 98 after 2013 respectively table 3 and then the dam was raised from 162 m to 176 6 m for the xiangyang station thermal alterations of most months reached high and moderate degrees in most months except for april table 4 the same trend is shown in the changes in water temperature at the xiantao and huangzhuang stations with most of the moderate and high level changes occurring in april autumn oct and nov and winter dec jan and feb table 5 and table 6 the monthly water temperature changed significantly along the hanjiang river after the dam was raised the median annual minimum and maximum water temperature at the huangjiagang station in 2013 2017 changed by 0 6 and 3 09 respectively compared to pre increasing capacity in danjiangkou reaching high level both with alteration values of 1 0 table 3 the daily minimum water temperature at the xiangyang station decreased from 6 85 to 2 9 with the alteration degree of high level while the daily maximum temperature did not change significantly table 4 similar to xiangyang the alteration degrees of the daily minimum water temperature at huangzhuang and xiantao were significant and the change of the maximum water temperature was not noticeable table 5 and table 6 although the timing of the minimum and maximum water temperature shifted about a week or two it was still in winter feb and summer aug however the timing of 18 at the huangjiagang station has been dramatically affected the start date of 18 shifted by nearly 2 months from 137th in pre dam raising period to the 182nd in the post dam raising period with a high alteration of 148 fig 6 the timing of 18 at xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations was not strongly affected by the dam shifting only 15 days 1 day and 2 days respectively these changes indicate that raising the dam has a greater impact on areas near the dam than areas far away from the dam duration of low pulses and number of high pulses at huangjiagang have been dramatically modified with the alteration degree of high level alteration of duration of high pulses and number of low pulses reached moderate with values of 54 and 52 respectively fig 3 high and moderate degrees of thermal regime alteration were observed for high pulses and low pulses at xiangyang and huangzhuang station table 4 and table 5 in contrast at the xiantao station there were only slight changes in duration and frequency of thermal events parameters it indicates the duration of low pulses and number of high pulses have changed significantly in the hanjiang river after the dam was heightened degrees of alteration in the minimum monthly range at the four stations were not significantly affected in comparison the median of the monthly maximum range at the four stations decreased by 8 95 7 79 4 33 and 4 49 tables 3 6 respectively at a moderate level it is related to the decrease of low water temperature caused by the increased reservoir capacity and water storage after the dam was raised 5 discussion 5 1 water temperature regime variability of the hanjiang river our results show that the completion of the danjiangkou dam especially after its being raised caused significant changes in the thermal regime of the hanjiang river compared to the conditions before the construction of the dam the main effect is changing thermal conditions by increasing the winter water temperature and decreasing the spring and summer water temperature at downstream of the dam major aspects of alteration associated with the danjiangkou dam such as the monthly water temperature and the start date of critical temperature 18 were enhanced by raising the dam the increase of water storage level intensified the thermal change of discharge water temperature downstream the variability of thermal impacts was due to the thermal stratification in large deep release dams niemeyer et al 2018 as a deep reservoir the water released from the danjiangkou reservoir would change the seasonal thermal regimes in the downstream of the river chen et al 2016b found that raising the danjiangkou dam altered water temperature seasonally i e increasing it in winter and decreasing it in summer with the use of a 3 d efdc model zhao et al 2020 used the landsat thermal infrared imagery to study the influence of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regimes in the downstream of the hanjiang river 2002 2017 and detected a seasonal cycle of thermal influence i e temperature drops in spring summer and autumn while there is no significant change in winter the results of our study are consistent with previous findings on seasonal cooling effects chen et al 2016b zhao et al 2020 however we find that the warming effects in winter at the four stations along the river were different from the findings of zhao et al 2020 the reason for the disagreement is that the water temperature data sources used are different we used measured daily water temperature while data from zhao et al 2020 were retrieved from the landsat tir imageries therefore according to the field data the impoundment of the danjiangkou dam has led to the warming effects in winter in the hanjiang river one limitation of this study is the short length of record for the post dam raised period previous studies suggest that when calculating 33 iha parameters to assess changes in hydrological regimes approximately 15 years of data timpe and kaplan 2017 or 12 years of daily records jones and schmidt 2018 should be used for the post impact period the analysis in this study is based on 46 years of data before the dam was raised and only 5 years of data after the dam was raised although the post impact period after raising the danjiangkou dam is short the impact is also pronounced as the dam was raised its impact changes temporally and spatially hence the effects of raising the dam on the thermal regime of the hanjiang river will only become apparent in the future more analysis is required as new data become available to fully assess the extent to which the danjiangkou dam has altered the water temperature conditions 5 2 influence of dam on water temperature along the river in the present study we investigated the extent of thermal impacts of danjiangkou dam along the river the total thermal alteration degree of huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao are 60 44 42 and 30 respectively it indicates that the effect was most obvious near the dam and gradually decreased with increasing distance from the dam overall raising the dam increased the reservoir s water storage from 174 5 m3 to 290 5 m3 leading to more severe river thermal regime change the total alteration degree at huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao are 76 65 47 and 43 respectively zhao et al 2020 revealed no clear signs of temperature recovery within the 20 km by use of the limited coverage of satellite image and indicated that thermal impacts of danjiangkou dam persists for a long distance moreover harris 1997 indicated that temperature depression of several degrees persisted for at least 250 km downstream from the burrendong dam on the macquarie river the effect was greatest immediately downstream from the keepit dam where the annual maximum daily temperature was approximately 5 0 lower and only recovered within 1 c 100 km below the dam preece and jones 2002 the modified water temperature recovers gradually along the river with the distance increase from dam recovery of longitudinal thermal regime depends on dam characteristics and downstream inputs of lakes groundwater and tributaries olden and naiman 2010 to fully know the exact affected reach of danjiangkou dam on water temperature along the river the hydrodynamic model can be used to simulate the water temperature of the hanjiang in the future work 5 3 ecological implications induced by thermal regime alteration dam construction throughout the world has raised long concerns regarding the potential impacts of altered thermal regimes on biodiversity and ecological processes danjiangkou dam has dramatically influenced the thermal regime of the hanjiang river by decreasing water temperature in spring and summer resulting in a cooling effect on the downstream although there was little detailed information on thermal requirements of most aquatic organisms in the hanjiang river some information for spawning of ffmc was available zhao et al 2020 the start date of the critical 18 required by the spawning activities of the ffmc was delayed by near two months such change was sufficient to disrupt thermal spawning cues for these fish species in the hanjiang river late hatching and lower water temperatures reduced the first year growth compared to an unregulated river zhou et al 1980 similarly the three gorges reservoirs alternated the downstream water temperature by delaying 2 3 weeks of the important water temperature required by the chinese sturgeon spawning activities in the yangtze river wang et al 2020 olden 2004 found that depressed summer temperatures below gathright dam on the jackson river virginia u s a resulted in complete species turnover from a warm water fish assemblage to a river dominated by cool and cold water fish species a similar temperature lag was found downstream of the keepit dam three weeks later than the pre dam condition preece and jones 2002 a recent assessment of spawning opportunities indicated that the danjiangkou dam may also result in a reduction of spawning sites and the optimal spawning locations moving downstream from huangjiagang 6 km to xiangyang 111 km due to the river regime alteration by the impoundment of dam chen et al 2016b raising the dam elevated the impoundment water level and increased the volume of cold water at the bottom of the reservoir and slowed down vertical heat transfer imposing a stronger cooling effect on the downstream reach the spawning activates and sites of the ffmc will be further threatened hence optimizing the current operation rules of the dam is necessary to alleviate the negative effects of water temperature on fish habitat in the hanjiang river 5 4 water temperature regime assessment with the framework this study has shown that the framework we proposed is a useful tool for evaluating the alteration of river water temperature regimes affected by human activities especially for rivers regulated by dam construction it provides powerful insights into the comprehensive understanding of thermal effects within river networks from the magnitude timing and variability of river water temperature for example the metric start date of a critical temperature is developed in this framework which can reflect the ecological implications of river thermal alteration in dammed rivers and provide important insights into river ecosystem protection this metric has not been considered in previous studies casado et al 2013 jones and schmidt 2018 in addition the breadth of parameters included in this framework makes it a particularly powerful tool for river ecosystem management this framework can be used in other regulated rivers around the world and be further improved through applications as olden and naiman 2010 indicated that understanding the dam induced impacts on long term river thermal regimes is challenging largely due to the paucity and appropriateness of water temperature data zhao et al 2020 the use of the grnn model allows us to reconstruct the historical water temperature which makes it possible to assess the thermal effects associated with dams the two main factors affecting river water temperature discharge and air temperature are considered as the input variables in the model in future work the optimization algorithm can be combined with grnn and more influencing factors can be considered to improve the accuracy of water temperature reconstruction 6 conclusions we proposed a framework for assessing the thermal regime alteration in regulated rivers based on the reconstructed water temperature we evaluated the alterations in the thermal regime of the hanjiang river after the construction of the danjiangkou dam using the newly developed framework our results show that the danjiangkou dam has significantly changed the thermal regime of the hanjiang river by increasing downstream water temperature in the winter and decreasing in spring and summer the effect is greatest immediately downstream to the dam and decreases as the distance from the dam increases a critical temperature of 18 required by ffmc spawning was delayed dramatically by nearly two months especially after the dam was raised the storage capacity of the reservoir increased from174 5 m3 to 290 5 m3 the duration of low pulses and number of high pulses have changed significantly the framework proposed in this work provides a new method for investigating the river thermal regime under changing environment these findings provide

3259,to better understand the river thermal regime alteration caused by anthropogenic disturbances we propose a framework to assess the alteration degree of thermal regime in a regulated river in this framework 23 temperature metrics including existing and newly developed temperature parameters are used to characterize river thermal alteration and are organized into four groups i e magnitude timing variability duration and frequency the proposed framework is then applied to assess the impacts of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regime of the hanjiang river our results show that the danjiangkou dam had a substantial impact on the thermal regime of the hanjiang river by increasing water temperature in winter and decreasing water temperature in spring and summer especially after the dam was raised the effect was greatest immediately downstream to the dam and decreased with as the distance from the dam increases start date of the critical 18 was delayed by approximately two months such effects may lead to negative ecological implications to the downstream of the danjiangkou dam the results of this study illustrate the pronounced effect of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regime of the hanjiang river the framework proposed could be a robust method to assess the impacts of reservoir operation on the thermal regime for regulated rivers keywords water temperature thermal regime

van vliet et al 2011 wang et al 2020 ferencz et al 2021 large dams and reservoirs impose direct impact on the thermal regime of the river downstream by inducing changes in the thermal capacity and heat load poole and berman 2001 olden and naiman 2010 the extent to which a dam affects downstream thermal regimes depends on their mode of operation and specific mechanism of water release the magnitude of thermal regime change depends largely on stratification behaviour of the reservoir i e depth profile of the thermocline and the depth at which water is released from the dam olden and naiman 2010 li et al 2021b therefore it is vitally important to understand the degree of alteration in the water temperature of dammed rivers in recent decades considerable studies have been done to investigate thermal impacts of large dams on downstream rivers worldwide wright et al 2009 hannah and garner 2015 niemeyer et al 2018 tao et al 2020 you et al 2020 shahryar et al 2021 keepit dam modified the thermal regime of the namoi river and as a result the annual maximum daily temperature was lowered by approximately 5 0 c preece and jones 2002 dickson et al 2012 illustrated some major effects that flow from hydropower storage reservoirs can have on the thermal dynamics of rivers in high altitude alpine basing alterations of hydropower to natural thermal regimes influence the key organisms in terms of survival development and behavioral thresholds of atlantic salmon and brown trout in high northern latitude stream systems heggenes et al 2021 spatial variability in water temperature of the sauce grande river regulated by the paso de las piedras dam revealed the effects of the dam on the thermal behavior of the downstream river casado et al 2013 cascading large reservoirs exert a more complex influence on the downstream water temperature disrupting the thermal spawning cues for fish species wang et al 2020 in addition some researchers are committed to studying the impact of small dams with shallow reservoirs on river water temperature maheu et al 2016 chandesris et al 2019 evaluating the impacts of dams and reservoirs in influencing the downstream thermal regimes in river systems has become a research hotspot in regulated rivers hydrological regimes of streams and rivers have been characterized e g poff et al 1997 gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 mezger et al 2021 based on previous studies similar approaches have been used in studying the thermal regimes of streams chu et al 2010 assessed the thermal characteristics of 90 stream sites throughout the great lakes basin with 13 temperature metrics indicating the existence of a regional pattern in the thermal regimes casado et al 2013 assembled a 30 day dataset at 8 water temperature gauging sites deployed along the main channel upstream and downstream from the impoundment and assessed the diurnal regimes by relative differences in the shape and magnitude of the thermographs with metrics characterizing daily water temperature regime jones and schmidt 2017 examined the influence of record length on the estimation uncertainty of commonly used thermal metrics at 19 sites from u s geological survey hydrometric stations and found that most thermal metrics can be evaluated with reasonable accuracy using approximately 12 years of daily data although these studies capture the river thermal conditions that may limit ecosystem productivity using these metrics alone ignores other ecologically relevant thermal characteristics for example the start date of critical water temperature affects the onset of spawning and hatching behavior of many organisms in streams and rivers the first date of critical temperature means the first day when water temperature reaches a critical temperature in a specific life stages e g spawning and hatching the critical temperature threshold is associated with spawning season and fish species motos et al 1996 king et al 1998 martin et al 2018 metrics that can describe these conditions the magnitude timing variability duration and frequency of thermal regimes are needed olden and naiman 2010 casado et al 2013 jones and schmidt 2018 to date limited studies exist on how to quantify the alteration degree in thermal regimes of streams and rivers the hanjiang river located between 106 and 114 e and 30 34 n is the largest tributary of the yangtze river yang et al 2012 the danjiangkou reservoir located in the middle section of the hanjiang river is the water source for the middle route of the south to north water diversion project in china the danjiangkou reservoir has influenced the hydrological processes wang et al 2015 and sediment regimes lu et al 2012 the hydrological regime of the middle and downstream sections of the hanjiang river was further significantly changed after the normal operational level was increased from 157 to 170 m in 2012 yu et al 2020 chen et al 2016b investigated the spatio temporal variability in the thermal regimes of the danjiangkou reservoir using a water temperature model zhao et al 2020 quantified the impacts of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regimes of the hanjiang river by retrieving water surface temperatures from landsat thermal infrared imageries however due to the limit of long term data quantifying thermal regime alteration of the hanjiang river has not yet been investigated especially after the dam being raised the objectives of the paper are a to present a framework to assess the impacts of dam on the thermal regime in the regulated river b to reconstruct the long term water temperature data of the hanjiang river and c to quantify the thermal regime alteration in the hanjiang river by comparing water temperature post dam construction and to analyze the possible causes the results of this study will provide a new tool for evaluating the thermal regime variations in regulated streams and rivers affected by human activities 2 study area and data the hanjiang river with a total length of 1 577 km and a catchment area of 159 000 km2 is the longest tributary of the yangtze river it passes through shanxi and hubei provinces in china and merges into the yangtze river in wuhan fig 1 the climate in this region is characterized as a subtropical monsoon with hot and humid summers and mild winters the average annual rainfall in the hanjiang river basin is 873 mm with an average annual runoff of 51 7 billion m3 a reduction of 75 between may october as a result of anthropogenic activities the flow regime has been changed especially after the completion of the danjiangkou dam yu et al 2020 li et al 2021a the danjiangkou dam is a deep release dam with an elevation of 162 m above the sea level creating one of the largest reservoirs in asia zhao et al 2020 it started to impound water in 1967 with a total storage capacity of 17 4 billion m3 as the reservoir serves as the water source for the south to north water diversion project it was raised from 162 to 176 6 m in 2012 liu et al 2018 leading to an increase in the storage capacity from 17 45 to 29 05 billion m3 the hydropower intake is at 122 5 m the limited level of reservoir during the flood season normal operational level and the highest flood regulation level of danjiangkou reservoir are 160 m 170 m and 174 34 m respectively a distinct thermocline formed in the reservoir between may and october chen et al 2016b the hydrological process has been influenced by the dam construction along the hanjiang river wang et al 2015 yu et al 2020 the hanjiang river is one of the most important freshwater fishery areas in china four famous major carp species ffmc black carp mylopharyngodon piceus grass carp ctenopharyngodon idellus silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and bighead carp aristichthys nobilis are important food resources in the yangtze river basin hydrological and thermal regime alterations caused by impoundment of danjiangkou dam threaten the biodiversity and ecosystem functions of hanjang river the population of ffmc reduced sharply from 1970 s xie et al 2009 to assess the river thermal alterations associated with the operation of the danjiangkou dam four hydrological stations on the main channel of the hanjiang river were investigated 1 huangjiagang 2 xiangyang 3 huangzhuang and 4 xiantao fig 1 the huangjiagang station is located 6 km downstream of the danjiangkou dam with a catchment area of 95 217 km2 the xiangyang station is a control station in the mainstream of the middle section of the hanjiang river located 111 km below the danjiangkou dam with a catchment area of 103 261 km2 the huangzhuang station is located approximately 241 km below the dam with a catchment area of 142 056 km2 the xiantao station is in the lower section of the hanjiang river about 530 km below the dam the daily flow discharges at the four stations from 1953 to 2017 were collected from the changjiang water resources commission of china flow data at xiantao station from jan 1968 to mar 1971 are not available daily air temperature data at the four meteorological stations from 1953 to 2017 were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn daily water temperature data at the four stations from 2006 to 2017 are also from the changjiang water resources commission the analysis focuses on three time periods from 1953 to 1966 the period prior to the construction of danjiangkou dam pre dam from 1967 to 2012 the period after the dam started to impound but prior to the dam being raised post dam and from 2013 to 2017 the period after the dam being raised post dam raised 3 methodology 3 1 a framework for water temperature regime alteration assessment in this study we present a framework for assessing the river thermal regime alterations associated with dam construction the implementation consists of a series of operational steps step 1 obtain the river temperature data collect the water temperature data at the study sites or obtain data from the watershed management department if the historical observation data is too short or unavailable it can be reconstructed based on the relationship between water temperature and major influencing factors such as flow and air temperature traditional water temperature models e g physical based and data driven models for the reservoir and river can be used to simulate the water temperature the deep learning methods with higher accuracy can also be used for water temperature prediction see section 3 2 step 2 determine the impact year for the regulated rivers with dams and sluices the first impoundment time of the dam can be taken as the impact year for other human activities if the exact impact year cannot be determined like dams statistical techniques can be applied to detect the impact year such as the non parametric test pettitt test this method can detect a significant change in the mean of a time series when the exact time of the change is unknown through test for a shift in the central tendency gao et al 2011 step 3 assess the thermal alteration calculate the water temperature metrics selected in the indicators of thermal alteration see section 3 3 assess the change in the thermal regime before and after the dam construction via alteration degree see section 3 4 3 2 water temperature series reconstruction a generalized regression neural network grnn model is applied to reconstruct the river water temperature the grnn is a one pass neural network learning algorithm with a highly parallel structure specht 1991 the network has the feature of fast learning and does not require an iterative procedure which is a powerful tool for regression approximation fitting and prediction problems yuan et al 2020 we assume a vector random variable and a scalar random variable y are the input and output variables respectively which can be expressed as follows 1 x x 1 x 2 x p 2 y y 1 y 2 y n where p is the dimension of and n is the number of observations assuming that x i and y i i 1 2 n are sample values of and y respectively the regression of y on the input value x can then be estimated by grnn as 3 y x i 1 n y i k x x i i 1 n k x x i 4 k x x i e d i 2 2 σ 2 5 d i 2 x x i t x x i where k is the gaussian kernel and di is the euclidean distance between x and x i and σ is a spread constant optimization involves determining the value of σ that minimizes the mean square error when predicting the outputs based on the model developed for the training data more details about grnn can be referred to cigizoglu and alp 2006 seckin et al 2013 and yuan et al 2020 in this study data at huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuan and xiantao stations in the hanjiang ricer are divided into the calibration period 2006 2010 and the validation period 2011 2012 air temperature and discharge are used as input variables in the grnn model the daily water temperatures at the four stations prior to 2005 are reconstructed by using the model the performance of the grnn model is evaluated by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 6 nse 1 t 1 n y t y t 2 t 1 n y t y 2 where y t is the simulated value yt is the observed value and y is the mean value of observed data the minimum values of nse closest to 1 represent the highest prediction accuracy 3 3 indicators of thermal alteration adapted from casado et al 2013 jones and schmidt 2018 and poff et al 1997 we propose a set of thermal metrics to characterize natural river water temperature conditions and facilitate evaluations of human induced changes to thermal regimes referred to as the indicators of thermal alteration indicators of thermal alteration is developed to assess the river water temperature regime it is based on an analysis of water temperature data available either from field measurement within an ecosystem or model data we use 23 parameters divided into three groups namely magnitude timing variability duration and frequency to statistically characterize river thermal variation within each year these 23 parameters provide information on the ecologically significant features of river ecosystems table 1 we then assess the perturbations of river water temperature conditions associated with human activities such as dam constructions flow diversions and intensive land use conversion by comparing the central tendency and dispersion of each parameter between pre impact and post impact periods 3 4 alteration degree assessment the range of variability approach by richter et al 1996 is used to assess the alteration degree of river thermal regime the target range for each river thermal parameter is usually based on selected percentile levels or a simple multiple of the parameter standard deviations for the pre disturbance thermal regime the degree to which annual values of thermal indices do not fall within the target range is a measure of thermal alteration measurement of thermal alteration can be calculated as follows observed expected expected where observed is the number of years in which the observed value of the thermal parameter falls within the target range and expected is the number of years in which the value of the parameter is expected to be in the target range based on the frequency of occurrence in the pre disturbance thermal regime the integrated degree of thermal alteration of all parameters can be determined as follows 7 d 0 1 n i 1 n d i 2 where n is the total number of the indicators d i denotes the alteration values for the ith thermal parameter to map river thermal alteration we divide the range of thermal alteration into three equal classes and assign a distinct pattern to each class 1 0 33 l representing little or no alteration 2 34 67 m representing a moderate alteration 3 68 100 h representing a high degree of alteration 4 results 4 1 performance of the model water temperature data reconstruction at the huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations was successfully obtained by using the grnn model discharge and air temperature are used as input variables in the proposed model reconstructed river water temperatures during the validation periods at the four stations were compared to the observed river water temperature data fig 2 the rmse and nse results of the calibration and validation periods are listed in table 2 value of nse for the grnn model for each station ranges from 0 92 to 0 97 as can be seen the grnn model shows satisfactory performance for all stations for the grnn model automatically adjust the network structure and approximate nonlinear functions with high precision it has the capacity to well represent the nonlinear relationships among water temperature and its critical factors i e air temperature and discharge which produces the high prediction accuracy in the calibration set and validation set daily water temperatures at the four stations from 1953 to 2005 are reconstructed using the proposed model 4 2 changes in discharge water temperature and air temperature the annual mean flow discharges at the huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations were 1082 m3 s 1234 m3 s 1424 m3 s and 1232 m3 s respectively fig 3 from 1953 to 2017 the annual mean water temperature at the four stations was 15 8 16 5 17 3 and 17 32 respectively the water temperature at the huangjiagang station decreased significantly after 2013 fig 3a which might be primarily due to the danjiangkou reservoir enhancement the coefficient of variation cv of the annual mean water temperature during the study period followed the following order xiantao cv 0 036 huangjiagang 0 035 huangzhuang 0 027 xiangyang 0 021 compared to the cv values of 0 034 to 0 040 for air temperature 4 3 effect of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regime after the completion of the danjiangkou dam dramatical changes have taken place in the hydrological regime of the hanjiang river monthly flow at the four stations from december to march normal low flow period increased after the reservoir behind the dam began to impound water in 1967 fig 3 when the dam was raised from 162 m to 176 6 m the flow regime of the hanjiang river was further affected after 1967 high discharges during summer decreased sharply at the four stations reflecting the flood control function of the dam thermal regime changes in the hanjiang river were assessed by using the framework proposed in this study the alteration degrees in the post dam parameters against that in the pre dam parameters in the hanjiang river were calculated tables 3 6 before and after the construction of the danjiangkou dam the median monthly water temperature at the four stations throughout the year changed slightly fig 4 after the dam was raised the monthly water temperature changed significantly especially at the huangjiagang station the high degree of change in water temperature at the huangjiagang station below the dam in ten months table 3 indicates that the danjiangkou impoundment has dramatically influenced the monthly water temperature near the location compared with the huangjiagang station there are only 2 or 3 months at the xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao reaching a high degree of thermal alteration for the huangjiagang station moderate degree of thermal alteration was observed in most months table 4 the deviations in january february march may july november and december exceeded 34 the moderate degree the alteration degree of october median monthly temperature reached 75 the highest degree of deviation for the huangzhuang and xiantao stations the degree of alteration exceeded 34 in 8 months of the year table 5 table 6 the medians of annual minimum and maximum water temperature at the huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations changed significantly after the dam was built fig 5 remarkable differences were observed between the two periods along the hanjiang river although the median julian date of the minimum water temperatures at the four stations slightly shifted by 1 day 22 days 3 days and 15 days respectively these dates still occur during the winter tables 3 5 the timing of the maximum water temperatures at the four stations has not been strongly affected by the dam with only 9 days 4 days 0 and 16 days of shift respectively it indicates that reservoir impoundment affects the magnitude of the extreme water temperature but has no significant effect on the occurrence time of the extreme water temperature starting date when water reaches 18 is critical for the ffmc in the hanjiang river li et al 2006 the starting time at the huangjiagang station near the dam has been delayed by 18 days table 3 with a moderate alteration degree in comparison there was no obvious difference at the other three stations after danjiangkou dam started to impound water duration of high pulses duration of low pulses number of high pulses and number of low pulses at huangjiagang station have been greatly changed with alterations of 39 42 39 and 39 respectively table 3 compared with the huangjiagang station only number of low pulses at the xiangyang and huangzhuang reached a moderate degree high pulses and low pulses of water temperature at xiantao have not been greatly affected by the dam in terms of either number of events or the median duration of these events the alteration degree of minimum monthly range at the huangjiagang station reached high class of 76 table 3 in comparison the alteration degrees at the other three stations were moderate level of 57 55 and 56 respectively tables 4 6 for all four stations there was no significant alteration in the maximum monthly range of water temperature along the hanjiang river the influence of reservoir storage on the minimum monthly temperature range is significantly larger than that on the maximum monthly temperature range 4 4 effect of raising the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regime the water temperature regime of the hanjiang river was further influenced after the expansion of the danjiangkou reservoir high and moderate degrees of thermal regime alteration were observed for most months at the huangjiagang station the highest degrees of thermal change occurred in may june august november and december the monthly water temperatures in may and june dropped by 1 79 and 4 98 after 2013 respectively table 3 and then the dam was raised from 162 m to 176 6 m for the xiangyang station thermal alterations of most months reached high and moderate degrees in most months except for april table 4 the same trend is shown in the changes in water temperature at the xiantao and huangzhuang stations with most of the moderate and high level changes occurring in april autumn oct and nov and winter dec jan and feb table 5 and table 6 the monthly water temperature changed significantly along the hanjiang river after the dam was raised the median annual minimum and maximum water temperature at the huangjiagang station in 2013 2017 changed by 0 6 and 3 09 respectively compared to pre increasing capacity in danjiangkou reaching high level both with alteration values of 1 0 table 3 the daily minimum water temperature at the xiangyang station decreased from 6 85 to 2 9 with the alteration degree of high level while the daily maximum temperature did not change significantly table 4 similar to xiangyang the alteration degrees of the daily minimum water temperature at huangzhuang and xiantao were significant and the change of the maximum water temperature was not noticeable table 5 and table 6 although the timing of the minimum and maximum water temperature shifted about a week or two it was still in winter feb and summer aug however the timing of 18 at the huangjiagang station has been dramatically affected the start date of 18 shifted by nearly 2 months from 137th in pre dam raising period to the 182nd in the post dam raising period with a high alteration of 148 fig 6 the timing of 18 at xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations was not strongly affected by the dam shifting only 15 days 1 day and 2 days respectively these changes indicate that raising the dam has a greater impact on areas near the dam than areas far away from the dam duration of low pulses and number of high pulses at huangjiagang have been dramatically modified with the alteration degree of high level alteration of duration of high pulses and number of low pulses reached moderate with values of 54 and 52 respectively fig 3 high and moderate degrees of thermal regime alteration were observed for high pulses and low pulses at xiangyang and huangzhuang station table 4 and table 5 in contrast at the xiantao station there were only slight changes in duration and frequency of thermal events parameters it indicates the duration of low pulses and number of high pulses have changed significantly in the hanjiang river after the dam was heightened degrees of alteration in the minimum monthly range at the four stations were not significantly affected in comparison the median of the monthly maximum range at the four stations decreased by 8 95 7 79 4 33 and 4 49 tables 3 6 respectively at a moderate level it is related to the decrease of low water temperature caused by the increased reservoir capacity and water storage after the dam was raised 5 discussion 5 1 water temperature regime variability of the hanjiang river our results show that the completion of the danjiangkou dam especially after its being raised caused significant changes in the thermal regime of the hanjiang river compared to the conditions before the construction of the dam the main effect is changing thermal conditions by increasing the winter water temperature and decreasing the spring and summer water temperature at downstream of the dam major aspects of alteration associated with the danjiangkou dam such as the monthly water temperature and the start date of critical temperature 18 were enhanced by raising the dam the increase of water storage level intensified the thermal change of discharge water temperature downstream the variability of thermal impacts was due to the thermal stratification in large deep release dams niemeyer et al 2018 as a deep reservoir the water released from the danjiangkou reservoir would change the seasonal thermal regimes in the downstream of the river chen et al 2016b found that raising the danjiangkou dam altered water temperature seasonally i e increasing it in winter and decreasing it in summer with the use of a 3 d efdc model zhao et al 2020 used the landsat thermal infrared imagery to study the influence of the danjiangkou dam on the thermal regimes in the downstream of the hanjiang river 2002 2017 and detected a seasonal cycle of thermal influence i e temperature drops in spring summer and autumn while there is no significant change in winter the results of our study are consistent with previous findings on seasonal cooling effects chen et al 2016b zhao et al 2020 however we find that the warming effects in winter at the four stations along the river were different from the findings of zhao et al 2020 the reason for the disagreement is that the water temperature data sources used are different we used measured daily water temperature while data from zhao et al 2020 were retrieved from the landsat tir imageries therefore according to the field data the impoundment of the danjiangkou dam has led to the warming effects in winter in the hanjiang river one limitation of this study is the short length of record for the post dam raised period previous studies suggest that when calculating 33 iha parameters to assess changes in hydrological regimes approximately 15 years of data timpe and kaplan 2017 or 12 years of daily records jones and schmidt 2018 should be used for the post impact period the analysis in this study is based on 46 years of data before the dam was raised and only 5 years of data after the dam was raised although the post impact period after raising the danjiangkou dam is short the impact is also pronounced as the dam was raised its impact changes temporally and spatially hence the effects of raising the dam on the thermal regime of the hanjiang river will only become apparent in the future more analysis is required as new data become available to fully assess the extent to which the danjiangkou dam has altered the water temperature conditions 5 2 influence of dam on water temperature along the river in the present study we investigated the extent of thermal impacts of danjiangkou dam along the river the total thermal alteration degree of huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao are 60 44 42 and 30 respectively it indicates that the effect was most obvious near the dam and gradually decreased with increasing distance from the dam overall raising the dam increased the reservoir s water storage from 174 5 m3 to 290 5 m3 leading to more severe river thermal regime change the total alteration degree at huangjiagang xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao are 76 65 47 and 43 respectively zhao et al 2020 revealed no clear signs of temperature recovery within the 20 km by use of the limited coverage of satellite image and indicated that thermal impacts of danjiangkou dam persists for a long distance moreover harris 1997 indicated that temperature depression of several degrees persisted for at least 250 km downstream from the burrendong dam on the macquarie river the effect was greatest immediately downstream from the keepit dam where the annual maximum daily temperature was approximately 5 0 lower and only recovered within 1 c 100 km below the dam preece and jones 2002 the modified water temperature recovers gradually along the river with the distance increase from dam recovery of longitudinal thermal regime depends on dam characteristics and downstream inputs of lakes groundwater and tributaries olden and naiman 2010 to fully know the exact affected reach of danjiangkou dam on water temperature along the river the hydrodynamic model can be used to simulate the water temperature of the hanjiang in the future work 5 3 ecological implications induced by thermal regime alteration dam construction throughout the world has raised long concerns regarding the potential impacts of altered thermal regimes on biodiversity and ecological processes danjiangkou dam has dramatically influenced the thermal regime of the hanjiang river by decreasing water temperature in spring and summer resulting in a cooling effect on the downstream although there was little detailed information on thermal requirements of most aquatic organisms in the hanjiang river some information for spawning of ffmc was available zhao et al 2020 the start date of the critical 18 required by the spawning activities of the ffmc was delayed by near two months such change was sufficient to disrupt thermal spawning cues for these fish species in the hanjiang river late hatching and lower water temperatures reduced the first year growth compared to an unregulated river zhou et al 1980 similarly the three gorges reservoirs alternated the downstream water temperature by delaying 2 3 weeks of the important water temperature required by the chinese sturgeon spawning activities in the yangtze river wang et al 2020 olden 2004 found that depressed summer temperatures below gathright dam on the jackson river virginia u s a resulted in complete species turnover from a warm water fish assemblage to a river dominated by cool and cold water fish species a similar temperature lag was found downstream of the keepit dam three weeks later than the pre dam condition preece and jones 2002 a recent assessment of spawning opportunities indicated that the danjiangkou dam may also result in a reduction of spawning sites and the optimal spawning locations moving downstream from huangjiagang 6 km to xiangyang 111 km due to the river regime alteration by the impoundment of dam chen et al 2016b raising the dam elevated the impoundment water level and increased the volume of cold water at the bottom of the reservoir and slowed down vertical heat transfer imposing a stronger cooling effect on the downstream reach the spawning activates and sites of the ffmc will be further threatened hence optimizing the current operation rules of the dam is necessary to alleviate the negative effects of water temperature on fish habitat in the hanjiang river 5 4 water temperature regime assessment with the framework this study has shown that the framework we proposed is a useful tool for evaluating the alteration of river water temperature regimes affected by human activities especially for rivers regulated by dam construction it provides powerful insights into the comprehensive understanding of thermal effects within river networks from the magnitude timing and variability of river water temperature for example the metric start date of a critical temperature is developed in this framework which can reflect the ecological implications of river thermal alteration in dammed rivers and provide important insights into river ecosystem protection this metric has not been considered in previous studies casado et al 2013 jones and schmidt 2018 in addition the breadth of parameters included in this framework makes it a particularly powerful tool for river ecosystem management this framework can be used in other regulated rivers around the world and be further improved through applications as olden and naiman 2010 indicated that understanding the dam induced impacts on long term river thermal regimes is challenging largely due to the paucity and appropriateness of water temperature data zhao et al 2020 the use of the grnn model allows us to reconstruct the historical water temperature which makes it possible to assess the thermal effects associated with dams the two main factors affecting river water temperature discharge and air temperature are considered as the input variables in the model in future work the optimization algorithm can be combined with grnn and more influencing factors can be considered to improve the accuracy of water temperature reconstruction 6 conclusions we proposed a framework for assessing the thermal regime alteration in regulated rivers based on the reconstructed water temperature we evaluated the alterations in the thermal regime of the hanjiang river after the construction of the danjiangkou dam using the newly developed framework our results show that the danjiangkou dam has significantly changed the thermal regime of the hanjiang river by increasing downstream water temperature in the winter and decreasing in spring and summer the effect is greatest immediately downstream to the dam and decreases as the distance from the dam increases a critical temperature of 18 required by ffmc spawning was delayed dramatically by nearly two months especially after the dam was raised the storage capacity of the reservoir increased from174 5 m3 to 290 5 m3 the duration of low pulses and number of high pulses have changed significantly the framework proposed in this work provides a new method for investigating the river thermal regime under changing environment these findings provide new understandings on the long term thermal regimes of regulated rivers which could be applicable to thermal effect investigations for large dams in regulated rivers credit authorship contribution
