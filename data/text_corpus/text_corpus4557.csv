22785,a review of existing technical challenges and their potential solutions in the development of vertical axis wind turbines vawts is presented in the context over the last decade vawts have received increasing attention from researchers and scientists due to their inherent features such as omni directional property simplification of the blade geometry lower noise generated and easy accessibility attributed to the ground based generators however their major drawbacks such as lower power coefficient poor self starting capability and fatigue issues due to cyclic aerodynamics loads make them less competitive than horizontal axis wind turbines hawts this paper will share a new perspective on the state of the art vawts to explore the new opportunity and possibility for their commercial viability a comprehensive comparison was performed between vawts and hawts focused in different sections on their aerodynamic performance efficiency power density in a wind farm and self starting ability the objective of the review paper is to identify technical barriers design challenges and the future of commercial vawts in the wind turbine market currently dominated by conventional hawts the paper will address what the major technical barriers for vawts to compete against hawts in future moreover the review will discuss if the innovative technologies proposed in the last decade are commercially feasible to overcome drawbacks of vawts the paper will also explore if vawts are more competitive in offshore application through the lessons learned from onshore turbines installed

market has been consolidated in the technologies of turbine design and operation wind energy has received growing interest and has been in the upward trend of wind power getting more penetration to the grids global wind energy council gwec has released in the report that global installed total wind power capacity is 539 123 mw by 2017 and including 3 5 offshore wind power gwec 2017 china u s and germany are the top 3 countries contributed 62 of the global installed wind power the tariff price of wind energy has reached below us 0 02 kwh in some countries about 6 of the country s electricity is delivered from the wind turbine fleet in u s and canada uruguay s electricity is all 100 from renewable energy while 35 40 is from wind energy wind turbines are the commonly used devices to harness wind energy they convert kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy which rotates generators to deliver electricity there are primarily two types of turbine according to the orientation of the rotating axis horizontal axis wind turbines hawts and vertical axis wind turbines vawts the rotary axis of hawts is parallel to the wind direction while that of vawts is perpendicular to the wind direction although both commercialized hawts and vawts are available in the market hawts are more prevailing in the market of both onshore and offshore applications over the past 30 years due to their mature technology and promising performance and they have a long record of operational success in the history small sized kilowatts vawt manufacturers take only one quarter market portion of hawt ones pitteloud and gsänger 2017 they seem to stagnate in the development and market share in generating business revenue megawatt scale vawts are rarely noticeable in the current market on the contrary the size of hawts has grown larger recently for example vestas turbines 2 mw 4 2 mw siemens 2 3 mw 4 3 mw and ge turbine 4 8 mw lengths of turbine blades have been manufactured longer and larger as shown in fig 1 the converged design and technologies of the hawt rotors have been established to be three bladed upwind type with yaw mechanism and pitch control system thanks to decades of their development and extensive research the growing turbine size plays a critical role in the reduction of levelized cost of electricity lcoe but meanwhile brings more challenges in construction and operation and maintenance o m as the blades are designed longer and larger more challenges arise due to significant weight of the top rotor and heavy mechanical and electrical system housed inside the nacelle of hawt their aerodynamic performance is scalable as derived from aerodynamic theory however dramatically increased mass of the topside rotor deteriorates scaling up behavior of the turbine system because the increased weight owing to bigger rotor size is greater than aerodynamic load increased malcolm 2003 self weight induced cyclic gravitational loading causes fatigue issues on the blades and their associated structures of hawt shires 2013 although the bigger size of turbine can benefit cost reduction the cost of o m is also significantly increased especially in harsher offshore environment and operational need of the specific vessels and installation equipment on the contrary increasing the scale of vawt doesn t bring such negative impact relatively because of the base mounted generator and gearbox systems therefore the scaling up limit of the top rotor can reach up to 30 mw apelfröjd et al 2016 in addition the blade profile of hawt is relatively more complicated with cylindrical shape at the rotor base connected to complex aerodynamic profile until the blade tip a large mould for producing such blade is necessary as shown in fig 2 of an offshore turbine blade manufactured by siemens mhi vestas has even launched a 9 5 mw offshore hawt in 2017 which is 164 m in diameter the world s most powerful available wind turbine gets major power boost 2017 its huge components are very costly for maritime transportation and o m which are much exposed to offshore environment in this point of view vawt has an advantage of having extruded blade profile and thus large mould is not necessary compared with offshore wind turbines aerodynamic performance of onshore ones is normally susceptible to the turbulence flow caused by complex topography of land terrain their gigantic structures also bring issues of obstruction view of the scene noise pollution and damage to the flying birds and shadow flicker during sunny days thus available wind farms have to be confined to non forested hills and non urban and ice free areas moreover onshore wind turbines have a relatively longer downtime window due to non predictable and unstable wind resources offshore devices are more able to tap the richer and better quality wind resources and the negative impact such as shadow flicker noise pollution on human population is also minimized annual installed offshore wind capacity has been expanding fast recently many large operating offshore wind farms have been installed in high geographic latitudes european countries and those areas with higher and consistent wind speed owing to the heating of the earth s surface by the sun radiation captured offshore wind capacity is approximately 1 5 2 times of onshore wind capacity in denmark germany and netherlands offshore energy outlook 2018 another trend of offshore wind energy is tapping into further deeper waters of more than 40 m depth to accommodate such water depth evolution of developed offshore platforms of hawts is shown in fig 3 from bottom fixed monopile or jacket to floating tension leg platform tlp semi submersible or spar however the installation of offshore wind farms need to avoid vessel traffic routes and fishing areas the impact of offshore wind turbines on marine spices and seabirds is assessed in the reference bailey et al 2014 to reduce cost engineers are nowadays diverting their attention to alternative technologies instead of immoderately enlarging hawts offshore vawts pose an alternative solution because their mechanical and electrical system can be mounted on the platform deck so that workers can easily access the system and complete o m in a much safer and less costly way on the other hand center of gravity cog is in consequence much lower than that of hawt with an equivalent power capacity this can reduce the size of the designed platform and anchored foundation additionally vawt can rotate in any wind direction without yaw system and hence less restraints to the hydrodynamic motion and the design of the platform this will increase uptime of operating window compared to that of using hawt platform in the harsh sea environment at present megawatt scale vawts are still in their infancy and concept design stage thus it is a big question to be answered if they could move forward and become an alternative in the offshore wind energy market innovative and advanced technologies are urgently needed to alleviate some inherent drawbacks of vawts for example lower power coefficient cyclic aerodynamics loads and poor self starting capability in this article a comprehensive literature review will be provided to fully understand the existing bottlenecks in the vawt technologies and to explore technical perspectives the paper will elaborate complicated aerodynamic load and performance of vawts involved and their associated mechanical and electrical technology on their commercial viability in future therefore the content of the review paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a comprehensive description on the advantages and disadvantages of hawts and vawts in order to fully understand drawbacks of vawts section 3 summarises the development history of onshore vawts the lessons learned in the past vawt projects will be emphasized to highlight their technical bottlenecks section 4 introduces the aerodynamic design tools of vawts and their corresponding technologies to theoretically explore working features and shortcomings of different rotors design tools for turbine rotors are also discussed in this section on their reliability accuracy and computational efficiency they play crucial role in optimizing rotor performance section 5 to 7 discuss the advanced technologies to overcome the drawbacks of vawts such as cyclic aerodynamics loads lower power coefficient and poor self starting capability a holistic review on vawts is provided for both new researchers and experts to continue to grow harnessing wind energy 2 advantages and disadvantages of vawts and hawts vawts are generally categorised as drag and lift based devices the former one utilises wind drag on the blades driving to rotate for example s type savonius the latter one utilises the lift on the blades for example straight type troposkien type and helical type darrieus fig 4 wiel 2015 lift based devices are the most popular for turbines sized up to hundreds of kilowatts drag based turbines are not preferred due to high solidity heavier weight and fairly low efficiency etc for example the power coefficient of savonius turbine is not more than 25 zamani et al 2016 however the drag based ones have the advantage of self starting ability therefore they are commonly found as small sized turbines in the urban and remote areas with relatively low wind speed for the lift based straight type vawts the advantage is their simple and extruded blades hence lower manufacture cost a patent of troposkien type turbine was filed in 1926 by g j m darrieus a french engineer darrieus 1931 this type of turbine has the lowest minimized bending stress which was offset by the increased centrifugal stresses at higher rpm ashwill 1992 sutherland et al 2012 the concepts of helical type rotor are developed to minimise their cyclic aerodynamics loads scheurich et al 2011 they have relatively lower vibration load due to the helix structure of each blade and vibration is thus balanced off besides the abovementioned savorius rotor and straight type troposkien type darrieus rotors bhutta et al 2012 also reviewed various innovative configurations in the past decades on their advantages and disadvantages troposkien type rotor has potential of scaling up to megawatt sized turbines in future innovative rotors such as two tier darrieus masgrowe rotor combined savonius and darrieus rotor and two leaf semi rotary rotor have both high starting torque and power efficiency cross flex type rotor can be integrated into the building and produce the acceptable power output currently they are only popular in urban application and are still not competitive over hawts in the market it is well known that megawatt scale hawts have their long successful commercial history in both onshore and offshore applications as mentioned above their technologies are more mature and converged in aerodynamic shapes design procedure operation installation etc turbine blades have been established to be non uniform and twisted in the spanwise distribution pitch control is used to regulate angle of attacks aoas in high wind speed in order to alleviate the occurrence of stall however vawts have fallen far behind in their development and commercialization because of their several unsatisfactory performances firstly their power efficiency is lower than that of hawts for hawts the blades are designed purposely to be non uniform and twisted to maximize aerodynamic performance accounted for different tangential speeds and aoas from the blade root to the tip thus dynamic stall can be reduced however the complicated profile of the blades results in the high cost of manufacturing because the whole piece of blade mould must be prepared to maximize structural strength siemens 6 0 mw offshore wind turbine brochure 2012 one example of the mould is illustrated in fig 2 the blade roots are typically thick in the cylindrical shape for mechanical strength purpose but some are in naca profiled shape at the blade tip its tangential speed is highest where the tip is mostly developed to be thinner to reduce both the aerodynamic loss and induced noise for vawts the shape of the blades is normally uniform without twist hence turbine blades are less costly in the manufacture as a turbine rotates aoa of each blade keeps changing together with varying rotational azimuth angles this phenomenon causes cyclic aerodynamic performance and hence fatigue issues of structures at the risk of failure only the blades in the upstream can produce rotational torque whereas others may be in the downstream turbulent region creating resistance to the rotation as a result the possibility of self starting mostly depends on the rotor s initial azimuth angles of the blades where the overall torque is relatively high consequently power efficiency c p is greatly reduced because of the occurrence of the stall over a wide range of rotational azimuth angles arab 2017 this inherent property is determined by the orientation of the rotational axis furthermore the rated tip speed ratio tsr λ of vawt is designed to be lower than that of hawt and is generally less than 4 but modern three bladed hawts are typically designed with a rated tsr from 6 to 9 schubel and crossley 2012 therefore vawts create lower aerodynamic noise emission and less disturbance to human population apelfröjd 2016 however higher gear ratio is required to increase rotational speed from a low spinning rotor to a high spinning drivetrain it should be noted that gearbox becomes much heavier and more expensive in such cases secondly only vawts upstream blades can produce rotational torque and thus the self starting capability is poor the fluctuation of the aerodynamic performance of vawts due to the changes of azimuth angle also deteriorates such situation the blades fail to provide positive torque when the stall happens on the contrary all hawts blades contribute rotating torque simultaneously regardless of rotational azimuth angles thus a breeze can easily blow the rotors to rotate if inertia and friction of the system can be overcome however hawts require yaw mechanism to deal with varying wind direction to secure the rotors always facing the incoming wind to maximize power output in contrast to hawts vawts are omni directional and yaw mechanism is not thus required therefore they have fewer components than hawts and hence less maintenance frequency in offshore application the omni directional characteristic leads to less restraints to the hydrodynamic motion and the design of the floating platform resulting in better floating stability fowler et al 2014 cheng 2016 lei et al 2017 lastly the vertical orientation of the long shaft brings both pros and cons of vawts the major advantage is that the drivetrain system of vawt can be installed at the ground level thus it is relatively safe and easy to be accessed for maintenance however this may sacrifice self starting ability and inherent efficiency the long steel causes an increase in the overall weight of the rotor which will be borne by bearing mechanism below moreover increased inertia requires more forces to move the top rotor especially for large scale devices higher torsional stress and inertia from the top rotor are unfavorable for self starting and turbine efficiency on the contrary hawt s weight is borne by their supporting tower consequently it is much easier to drive the generator to rotate additionally vawt s supporting tower is shorter than hawt s one the rotor of vawt has lower rotational speed owing to lower tsr thus tangential speed of its blades is much lower than that of the tips of hawts for hawts the clearance between the lowest blade tip and the ground must be relatively large for safety purpose from aerodynamic perspectives vawts can benefit from skewed wind direction and can produce power well bianchini 2012 for example mostly installed troposkien type darrieus wind turbine rotors are relatively close to the ground while the towers of hawts are usually as high as possible where the wind is much uniform and strong this will be a tradeoff between the increase in cost and the increase in wind energy extracted moreover vawts are less susceptible to shadow flicker compared to hawts which often disturbs residents in the installed area such shadow emission periodically casts shadow of each blade of hawt onto their surrounding buildings and land area during sunny days shadow flicker protection system for wind turbines 2018 helical type vawts produce minimal shadow flicker due to one end of each blade being curved in a helix structure in offshore application shadow flicker factor for rotor design can be ignored since the turbines are sighted far from residential areas in summary a comprehensive comparison was provided in this section between vawts and hawts and is tabulated in table 1 the primary unsatisfactory factors of vawts mainly lie in lower power efficiency poor self starting capability and cyclic aerodynamics loads and associated fatigue issues turbine blades alternatively contribute rotational torques by varying rotational azimuth angles only the upstream blades can provide rotational torque while stall occurs for the downstream blades this characteristic prohibits for further commercialization thus vawts fall far behind hawts in generating business revenues however small sized vawts still have broad applications in the urban or rural area due to their omni directionality insensitivity to turbulence less costly in materials and maintenance low tsr and less noise for example architecture roof turbines and off grid hybrid wind and solar street light system with maglev vawt aluminum alloy vertical axis wind turbine generator 300 w typmar cxf 30012v 24v ragheb 2014 pendharkar 2012 advanced solutions are still required to be further research and developed for their competitive potential in future wind turbine market 3 research and development history of onshore vawts the most successful commercialized onshore vawts are developed by sandia national laboratory snl early 1970 s to 1990 s they are two bladed troposkien type vawts sized 17 m in diameter and rated power at 95 kw fig 5 a more than 500 units were in commercial operation on land however nearly all the turbines were removed by the end of 2004 because the wind farm can only generate one tenth electricity of its original designed in 1990 s gipe 2009 this failure is due to the fatigue occurred in the joints alone the blades see fig 6 sutherland et al 2012 there are totally two joints along each blade to connect different airfoils naca 0021 at both ends and sand 0018 50 in the middle this weak design turns vawts into a negative influence on their commercial perspective u s department of energy doe terminated almost all vawt based research funding after the closure of flowind this commercialization has proved that vawts can produce competitive electricity compared with the hawts beside 17 m commercialized vawt snl also developed a 34 m vawt 500 kw test bed to optimize turbine performance ashwill 1992 c p reached as high as 40 presented in the field test report sutherland et al 2012 a 500 kw vawt 850 straight type rotor was also constructed in 1990 s by vawt ltd as shown in fig 5 b it was europe s biggest vawt at that time price 2006 it also suffered blade failure just within a few months of operation due to a manufacturing fault and one fiberglass blade broke shires 2013 d ambrosio and medaglia 2010 a unique direct drive t1 turbine was designed and built by the vertical wind ab and uppsala university sweden in 2010 fig 5 c möllerström et al 2015 the generator was mounted on the ground and connected to the rotor by a long steel shaft t1 turbine is currently in operation and owned by uppsala university for tower dynamics and noise study möllerström 2015 éole the world s largest 110 m high vawt installed at québec canada in the 1980 s fig 5 d its rated output power is 3 8 mw it was operating between 1987 and 1993 and produced 12 gwh of electric energy shires 2013 however it went out of service in 1993 due to the damage of its bottom large and expensive bearing benmeddour et al 2010 in a nutshell failure of the onshore vawts is primarily because of fatigue issues regardless of lcoe and poor self starting capability although turbine performance is not disappointing in terms of power efficiency research and development activities seem stagnated because of less funding support from government and the success of their competitor hawts it is less frequent to hear the released news on newly operational onshore vawts sized in hundreds of kilowatts after their prosperous period from 1970 s to 1990 s nowadays smallscaled wind energy converting devices have been prevailing in the city street or on the building rooftop in the urban area full of strong turbulence due to the disturbance of buildings small vawts are increasingly popular for installations in urban settings due to their aesthetically pleasing shape lower noise produced and easy building integration kumar et al 2018 for instance it was reported that over 200 quiet revolution vawts were installed between 2005 and 2016 quiet revolution vawt at rwe stadium essen 2015 quiet revolution wind turbines 2016 one case is shown in fig 7 a a 14 kw helical type vawt was installed for electric vehicle charging in spain see fig 7 b uge installs its first wind powered ev charging station 2012 sometimes small vawts are attractively designed into kinetic sculptures and become a dual purpose public art display as shown in fig 7 c and d and they are all drag based vawts some vawts installed in urban area were also reviewed by kumar et al 2018 including aforementioned combined savonius and darrieus rotor and modified darrieus rotors as pointed by authors their viability depends on their self starting ability reliability and cost to date researches and laboratory based tests on vawts are still going on in many universities and companies such as stanford university brownstein et al 2016 technical university of denmark dtu vita 2011 paulsen et al 2012 2014 cranfield university collu et al 2014 blusseau and patel 2012 delft university of technology tu delft he 2013 claessens 2006 kemp 2015 etc a number of researchers are also keeping eyes on the conceptual design of future offshore vawts due to higher wind energy available and lower turbulence near the sea surface without disturbance of complicated land terrain however they are still in the theoretical stage and lack of practical operation data for examples 5 mw deepwind by a consortium led by dtu 5 mw twinfloat by nénuphar 10 mw aeogenera x by a consortium led by cranfield university and 6 mw spinfloat by a consortium led by french wind power specialist asah lm these concepts are funded by government or private companies their aim is to explore a more favorable offshore device to reduce lcoe but there is a long way to go to prove their feasibility due to technical bottlenecks of existing vawts 4 aerodynamic design of vawts airfoils are widely chosen as blade profile of the wind turbine they were developed with wind tunnel tests by the united states national advisory committee for aeronautics naca during world war ii the aerodynamics of the wind turbine 2012 in contrast to blades of hawts which rotate at relatively steady aoas in a certain wind speed aoas of vawts blades are varying due to rapid changes of the rotational azimuth angles the pressure and suction surfaces of the blade always alternate in every rotation circle as summarized by kemp 2015 the symmetrical naca series without camber is normally employed for vawts design in order to produce equivalently torque between upstream half and downstream half of the rotation circle cambered airfoil is an asymmetry between two sides of the chord line the symmetrical 4 digit naca series are indicated as naca 00xx xx represents the thickness of the airfoil naca 0012 and naca 0015 are popular profiles and applied in vawts design horst 2015 the research on airfoil selection criteria effect of airfoil thickness camber on turbine performance and blade stall is discussed in the reference kemp 2015 and will not be repeated in this paper besides naca profiles there are fx series du series s series etc hashem and mohamed 2018 which can also be used for wind turbine design however it has been numerically proved that symmetrical airfoil s 1046 has maximum cp of 40 mohamed 2012 tjiu et al 2015 for this type of airfoil the maximum thickness 17 occurs at 30 8 of chord in conventional naca series the maximum thickness is at 30 of chord the blades of vawts experience a much wider range of aoas than that of the blades of hawts they are susceptible to dynamic stall due to the rapid changes of rational azimuth angles the dynamic stall is characterized by the flow separation on the blade surface claessens 2006 at a lower aoa the boundary fluid moves regularly attached to the surface of the airfoil but at the higher aoa separation happens at the trailing edge of the airfoil the stall occurs when aoa is larger than stall angle of airfoil at stall angle there is a sharp increase in drag liu et al 2017 vortices which generated from both leading and trailing edges of the blades due to flow separation will shed into the wake horst 2015 large wake field full of fierce turbulence can cause the embedded blades to produce decreased non uniform force the separation moves to the leading edge as further increase in aoa and this phenomenon is called deep stall claessens 2006 as shown in fig 8 a deep stall happens at aoa 15 50 where the value of c l suddenly decreases from approximately 1 2 to 0 6 the ratio of c l and c d also starts to drop which significantly affect the efficiency of the airfoil fig 8 b after stall occurrence of airfoil the blades continue to rotate into the upstream laminar flow and then lift is recovered when aoa 160 for the case in fig 8 aoa has to be lower than 15 50 to get the comparable lift value 1 1 due to hysteresis effect claessens 2006 it takes a long time for blades to recover from the effect of the vortices in the wake additionally the downstream blades have to pass through the turbulent flow produced by the upstream blades the oscillatory aerodynamic loads on vawt occur in all 6 degree of freedom dof when deep and dynamic stall happens thus the aerodynamic forces on blades are oscillating over the whole rotational circle blades are prone to fatigue aero elastic vibration and produce noise cyclic aerodynamic over a rotational revolution is the inherent characteristic of vawts and different from that of hawts it may shorten structural life span as discussed in section 3 turbines in fig 5 proves such findings nowadays hawts are the wind industry s preferred products due to aforementioned success stories rotor design tools have been developed and verified to be more reliable and accurate such as qblade bladed aerodyn harp opt etc all these methods employ blade element momentum theory bem namely an aerodynamic theory bem method has been widely integrated into the design tool of hawts because of its simplicity and high computational efficiency coupled with genetic algorithm it is able to generate optimized turbine blade profile with inputs from look up table of lift and drag polar data liu et al 2017 aerodynamic design tools for predicting vawt performance include local circulation models momentum models and vortex models castillo tudela 2011 circulation models are based on potential theory eulerian equation momentum models are derived from newton s second law of the motion and are an extension of bem method by employing actuator disc theory vawt rotor is represented as a disc top view and there is pressure jump as the fluid flows through the actuator disc a deceleration of the wind speed after the disc is responsible for the pressure jump and therefore an induced velocity is determined momentum models consist of multiple streamtube model ms and double multiple streamtube model dms marten et al 2013 the rotation disc is discretized into multiple streamtubes in the cross flow direction the difference between them is that dms employs twice actuator disc theory in both upstream and downstream half circle of the rotation in each streamtube while ms is only used in the upstream half circle fig 9 as a result dms is more advanced than ms model but this momentum model is limited to solidity less than 0 2 and is not valid for the larger range of solidity castillo tudela 2011 moreover their accuracy is doubtful in quantitatively predicting aerodynamic loads when the dynamic stall occurs arab et al 2017 some physical phenomenon will be lost since the rotor is run as a steady state situation therefore momentum analytical models are suitable for optimizing rotor design due to their high computational efficiency hamedi et al 2015 vortex models are for modelling wake field of a rotating turbine they are less computationally costly and suitable for the qualitative optimization of rotor design in industrial activity marten et al 2017 lifting line free vortex wake llfvw is one of the vortex models and it employs non linear lifting line theory to capture dynamic loading on the blades and free vortex wake algorithm to simulate vortices shed from the trailing edges into the downstream wake transient rotating behavior is accounted for in this model calculation of load on the blades is identical with bem method and requires lift and drag polar data of airfoil torque curve from llfvw is consistent with bem results which was proved by running the nrel phase vi hawt rotor marten et al 2016a a nonlinear llfvw has been implemented in the open source qblade v0 9 a wind turbine aerodynamics tool this method is applicable to simulate both hawts and vawts marten et al 2018 its accuracy and broad application even outperform unsteady bem method with fewer assumptions vortex model is applied in another turbine design tool cactus which was originally developed based on vdart3 code by strickland at texas tech later snl participated in the code development specified for the troposkien type vawts murray and barone 2011 in contrast to the traditional bem method cactus employs dynamic stall models in the load calculation all the wind turbine design tools stated above are summarized in table 2 together with the programming language of source code in contrast to the bem method llfvw is more representative on the physics of wake modelling the transient vortices shed from the blade trailing edges are simulated by calculating circulation at the quarter chord position of the blade in the lifting line formulation marten et al 2016b blade tip loss is also considered in this model thus the transient flow behavior around the rotor and trails of vortices shedding into the wake are all account for however in the momentum method the turbine rotor is assumed to be a virtual actuator disc liu et al 2016 the wake is modeled with a momentum balance across the actuator disc the coefficient of the thrust is implemented to calculate the wake induced flow it is assumed that inflow is uniform and steady in the disc region this one dimensional solution is not able to consider the vortices shed from the blade tips therefore the tip loss correction has to be taken into account to minimise aerodynamic prediction errors shen et al 2005 in addition this method can only obtain a steady state flow result the transient flow behavior in the rotor region is therefore simplified and cannot be captured liu et al 2016 but it is still acceptable to predict the turbine performance and the wake flow in the initial design stage another advantage of llfvw method is its employed yaw correction model which is used to deal with floating wind turbine bem method also includes yaw correction but it gives larger error than llfvw method in modelling hawts marten et al 2016a llfvw has a large improvement on the accuracy and convergence problems to simulate vawts over the dms model which has been implemented in qblade started from v0 6 bem method also has been implemented in fast in v0 8 and coupled to a structural model but llfvw has not been coupled to any structural model and only applied for aerodynamic simulation of the rigid rotors marten 2016 computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis is the most accurate method in predicting turbine performance and their numerical results are comparable with the wind tunnel testing results the cfd application in both scientific research and commercial industries is growing rapidly in recent decades it includes but not limited to investigate the underlying physics optimize turbine performance and reduce design cost however its powerful simulation solvers sacrifice computational time and efficiency compared to aerodynamic design tools and a few weeks may be needed to obtain the approximated solution depending on computational resources used nowadays computational efficiency has been greatly increased with the development of super parallel computing technology ansys fluent star ccm and openfoam are popular cfd software all of them use the same discretization technique finite volume method fvm to approximate the solution of the unsteady reynolds averaged navior stoke s rans equations versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the flow characteristics such as vortex shedding from the blades flow separation and pressure distribution on the blade surfaces and the wake induced flow can be fully resolved cfd analysis can be used to verify the results from aerodynamic design tools this is helpful for improving the accuracy and reliability of the rotor design and eliminating the uncertainty of aerodynamic performance such as oscillation frequency of the rotor flow interference output power self starting performance etc there are a number of scientific investigation on the effect of turbine particulars and the environmental condition on the power efficiency of vawts a research observed that the maximum power coefficient is shifted to lower tsr region with an increase in solidity with cfd analysis mohamed 2012 a broad range of high power coefficient can be obtained with lower solidity ratios of 0 1 and 0 16 the narrow blade chord causes less blockage to the incoming flow and this forms a wide gap between blades for the flow to pass through the wake effect is minimized and the chance of earlier stall is reduced solidity effect on the power coefficient was studied in the reference by hezaveh et al 2017 and the same conclusion was obtained besides cfd analysis could be performed to study the effect of aspect ratio on the power coefficient which is negligible in the condition of fixed solidity and the rotor swept area a different shapes of the diffuser outside of the rotor was investigated by hashem and mohamed 2018 and a factor of power augmentation is about 4 as compared to the bare vawt hashem and mohamed 2018 in the raining environment the turbine will suffer a power loss wu and cao 2018 cfd has been applied to experiment with the innovative designs of vawts as shown in fig 10 a the nature inspired shape of the turbine was studied numerically in tu delft wiel 2015 the tulip project is mainly intended for suburban and industrial areas numerical simulation was performed to study cycloidal wind turbine by active pitch control of blade motion hwang et al 2005 erickson et al 2011 fig 10 b the control mechanism is employed to change the pitch angle of the blade relative to the wind direction fig 10 c is the j shaped vawt the specific shape is used to improve self starting capability of the turbine in cfd simulation result there is a long wake in the downstream of the turbine because a portion of the kinetic energy in the coming flow is converted into the mechanic energy liu et al 2016 however it is unrealistic to measure the velocity of the wake in the laboratory when the wake is more than 30d long stallard et al 2013 thus cfd analysis plays an essential role in studying the downstream flow fig 11 shows the numerical prediction results of the wake at the different tsr the higher the tsr is the more kinetic energy is extracted by the turbine vortices shedding frequency is also much higher it was learnt that high turbulence in the flow can re energize the wake to recover efficiently on the contrary if the rotor is working at a lower tsr the wake is extended relatively long as a result less kinetic energy is harvested by the rotor the wake requires long downstream distance to dissipate viscous vortices until is recovered to the incoming flow as a summary in this section aerodynamic design techniques used in various design tools for wind turbine blades are discussed different bem techniques and models have been developed by researchers to be utilised in the optimization of hawt performance and obtaining outline of the blade s profile with low computational costs it has also been integrated into the structural analysis model vortex model is found to be more powerful and accurate for performance prediction of vawts and has been used in open source software qblade it has been also briefed by bhutta et al 2012 in which broad design techniques are introduced such as to estimate blade vibratory stresses structural and aero elastic system damping etc the literature review found that cfd can most accurately predict turbine performance and flow visualization 5 power coefficient of vawts compared to that of hawts the efficiency of either vawt or hawt is a function of solidity σ aspect ratio a r number of blades n tsr and reynolds number re saber et al 2015 1 c p f σ a r n t s r 1 r e where σ nc 2πr c is blade chord length and r is rotor radius a r l d l is blade length λ ωr u ω is the rotational speed u is the incoming wind speed to the rotor reynolds number re is a dimensionless number related to the resultant speed of the rotating blades 2 r e ρ c w r r μ where w r is the local resultant flow velocity and is defined as 3 w r u ω r the vector arithmetic is illustrated in fig 9 the energy available in the incoming wind is the cube of the wind speed 4 p 1 2 ρ a u 3 where ρ is the wind density and a is the swept area of the rotor a π r 2 for hawts and a 2lr for vawts the power produced by the turbine is determined by the power coefficient c p and available wind energy contained in the incoming wind over a swept area a 5 p t c p 1 2 ρ a u 3 turbines are typically designed to deliver retained high rated output power maximum power after u is higher than the rated wind speed u r c p reduces when u u r through stall regulation or passive stall for vawts liu et al 2017 apelfröjd et al 2016 such turbine ideally works at a constant maximum c p when u u r to produce a determined output power the size of the turbine rotor is generally determined by the rated c p and the rated wind speed u r for a commercialized megawatt scale wind turbine u r is typically at a range of 11 m s to 15 m s which is usually 1 5 times annual averaged wind speed measured at hub height malcolm and hansen 2006 this value is critical in the rotor design and in determining the optimal cost of the system the lower u r requires the higher swept area to reach prescribed output power this leads to the longer blades and larger swept area for the same power output the highest thrust on the rotor which is the main fundamental load usually happens in the stall regime instead of at the rated wind speed for vawt where this happens at the rated wind speed for hawt consequently high cost material is required to meet the required structural strength therefore the higher u r is recommended to reduce rotor size and minimise the dominant fundamental load to an acceptable level for both vawt and hawt generally wind speed is rated at 14 15 m s for vawt and 11 13 m s for hawt blonk 2010 within this higher range the highest thrust occurs at u r for vawt especially in the offshore application higher wind speed results in smaller rotor size and lower foundation load leading to less material used and hence a light topside structure the dimension of the designed platform is thus reduced and higher stability requirement is easily met fowler et al 2014 for example according to eq 5 the required swept area of the rotor at u r 11 m s is less than half of that at u r 15 m s this reduction is remarkable and significantly affect the support tower size material used system cost and even the size of the offshore platform in fig 12 the solid lines present the relationship between a and p t at different u r which is from 11 m s to 15 m s this calculation is based on eq 5 and c p is assumed to be 30 the output power is linearly proportional to the swept area a of the rotor solid lines various wind turbines either from published papers or commercialized products are indicated in fig 12 the square symbols represent vawts and the circle ones represent hawts different colors of the symbols represent the different u r of the turbine which is consistent with the colors of the lines the rated c p of the turbine rotor is less than 30 if the symbol is above the same colored solid line and vice versa the rated c p is the value when the turbine works at rated power that means the lower rated c p requires large swept area a and the higher rated c p requires small a in order to reach the prescribed power capacity for example darwind xe128 5 mw its rated c p is 37 and a is below the red solid line and smaller a is qualified to reach rated 5 mw it utilises the direct drivetrain to minimise the friction and inertia loss of the gear in practice but for gamesa g132 the same 5 mw turbine its rated c p is 27 at the rated wind speed 13 m s gamesa g132 5 0 mw its c p can be up to 48 at the wind speed of 8 m s a is above the blue solid line and it has to be large enough to fit its prescribed power capacity for vawts it has to be pointed out that all megawatts ones marked in fig 12 a are concept designs and their efficiency is apparently less than 30 at the rated power akimoto et al 2011 paulsen et al 2012 there are very limited products with published performance data in practice for vawts less than 1 mw thus only 2 rotors in 5 mw are given in fig 12 b power coefficient c p of all the rotors shown in fig 12 is summarized in fig 13 the rated wind speed u r of each rotor is differentiated with the color which is consistent with fig 12 all rated c p values are lower than betz limit 59 3 hau 2013 abdulrazek 2012 ragheb and ragheb 2011 fraenkel 1986 betz limit is the theoretical maximum percentage of kinetic energy which can be extracted by an ideal turbine without losses such as viscous loss pressure drag on blades and tip vortex its value is derived based on the continuation of flow regime when the downstream velocity is 1 3 of the upstream velocity ragheb and ragheb 2011 however in practice the typical power coefficients of turbines are lower than betz limit because of rotating wakes finite number of blades and no zero c d value on the blades lysen 1982 as shown in fig 13 c p of vawts in megawatts is much lower than hawts especially the ones are designed at higher u r from 13 to 15 m s the size of installed vawts in practice is only limited to kilowatt scale their efficiency is not much inferior to that of hawts especially for 0 5 mw vawt rotor designed by snl which can reach approximately 41 sutherland et al 2012 in this design both thicker end sections with naca 0021 profile provides structural strength support while the thinner sand 0018 50 is used in the middle to minimise stresses and maximize captured energy ashwill 1992 sand 0018 50 is developed by snl and the last two digits 5 and 0 indicate the maximum thickness is at 50 of the blade chord from the leading edge which is positioned backward compared to the conventional naca 0018 for normal naca series the drag is higher at the lower aoas it is thus difficult to self start at the lower wind speed the benefit of sand 0018 50 is the lower drag values at lower aoas and thereby improving their self starting property however the troposkien type vawt with sand 0018 50 profile is experimentally proved to be less efficient claessens 2006 6 advanced technologies to improve power efficiency and cyclic aerodynamics the c p values of vawts are lower than that of hawts for several reasons hawts employ yaw system which controls the projected area of the rotor to be in line with the wind direction ideally all the blades harness identical kinetic energy from wind continuously and uniformly which results in a constant aerodynamic force borg and collu 2015 but for vawts only the blade in the upstream half circle can produce the positive tangential force while the other blades produce zero or negative tangential force as indicated in fig 14 a thus the output torque on the straight type vawt rotor displays cyclic behavior in accordance with the varying rotational azimuth angles the averaged efficiency of vawts is normally lower than that of hawts where every blade produces constant torque continuously abdulrazek 2012 the aerodynamic forces on working vawts highly oscillate whereas they are fairly constant on hawts in operation borg and collu 2015 as mentioned before vawt has the inherent property of cyclic output power and thrust on the vawt rotor is due to the effect of the dynamic stall as the turbine rotates fig 14 b carrigan 2012 these will excite vibration on the turbine which is prone to fatigue of blades bearing shaft etc it leads to risk of failure of vawts to produce electric power for example the turbines shown in fig 5 the cyclic property of aerodynamic loading on blades can be smoothened by using the helical type design scheurich et al 2011 this kind of turbines requires lower start up wind speeds however they exhibit a lower power output than straight type ones marsh et al 2015 alaimo et al 2015 it has been found that an evenly distributed vortices were generated along the trailing edges of the helical blades whereas the vortices were mainly accumulated at the tips of the straight blades thus helical blades could create more drag in comparison to straight blades in some rotor designs the blades of cycloturbine are proposed to be mechanically pitched to the optimized aoa relative to the wind direction and hence to produce fairly constant aerodynamic loads d ambrosio and medaglia 2010 the concept of cycloturbine is shown in fig 10 b cycloturbine with free pitching blades has been proved to be worse with a dynamic mechanism in terms of self starting and efficiency compared to the conventional pitch fixed turbine rathi 2012 but if the blade can be actively pitched to an aoa at maximum tangential force cycloturbine could have the better self starting ability and display a great improvement in lower tsr based on the dms model results cfd method also proved the possibility of performance enhancement of vawt using variable pitch angle rezaeiha et al 2017 one approach of active pitch control mechanism was introduced in the research by hwang et al 2005 four blades of the straight type vawt were connected with four pitch link bars the optimal pitch angles synchronize with the changes in wind speed and direction to diminish stall occurrence 2d numerical results show not only 30 higher power of cycloturbine than that of classical vawt but also improved cyclic tangential force on the rotor hwang et al 2007 besides the application of moulded composite blades can reduce the risk of fatigue due to the cyclic aerodynamic performance of rotor and smoothen the joints on the rotor to reduce aerodynamic loss sutherland et al 2012 fiberglass composites had been used for vawt 850 see fig 5 b price 2006 but one of blades broke within one year s operation due to a manufacturing fault the expensive tower had to be built with concrete to bear large cycling fatigue loads the composite blades of hawt have been tested and can have a lifespan of between 18 66 years and 24 years shokrieh and rafiee 2006 the study results may not be applicable to composite blades of vawt because of the different sources of cyclic loads a potential way to improve the efficiency of vawts and reduce aerodynamic fatigue load is to apply a shield to diminish the negative tangential force on the downstream blades the shield idea was first presented by shepherd 1990 schematic view of the shield concept is illustrated in fig 15 a and b this idea was numerically investigated recently and applied to the counter inner rotating cir vawts jin et al 2017 a deflector was applied in the upstream of two turbines to act as a shield the numerical results show that the deflector can improve the performance of vawts however the shield concept is applicable to the fixed wind direction this will sacrifice the advantage of omni directional characteristic of vawts in addition the cyclic behavior in power was also improved instead according to the numerical results of the rotor torque coefficient in the reference jin et al 2017 recently the shield idea is employed in a venturi or a cycloidal diffuser design hashem and mohamed 2018 as shown in fig 15 c cfd study has proved its power improvement by a factor of approximately 4 wong et al 2018 proposed the concept of a flat plate to accelerate the flow by properly positioning it in the upstream see fig 15 d the higher wind velocity from the top edge of the flat plate can benefit the power extraction and self starting capability importantly this concept doesn t influence the omni directional characteristic of vawts some different configurations were also presented and discussed by bhutta et al 2012 however all above rotors are only found to be applicable in small scale size various researchers have also paid attention to improve the efficiency of vawts by optimizing the geometry of the rotor more recently windspire vawt was designed purposely with high aspect ratio a s 5 a s l d fig 16 it was found that the turbine with low solidity σ 0 04 produces a broad flat power curve and exhibits higher maximum c p giorgetti et al 2015 this is consistent with the study by hezaveh et al 2017 it is the solidity which has the significant effect on c p instead of aspect ratio a s of vawts can be higher than 1 whereas a s 1 for hawts as discussed in paraschivoiu 2002 higher a s more power can be captured by the turbine in the condition of the same solidity and turbine diameter as shown in fig 17 paraschivoiu 2002 an increase in swept area a results in the increase in output power the lower power coefficient for vawt can also be compensated by working in a pair dabiri 2011 recently the published field test data of wind farm with the large foot print area is published on the counter rotating 1 2 kw vawts manufactured by windspire energy inc this study was done by prof dabiri from california institute of technology dabiri 2011 the test site is called the antelope valley the field laboratory for optimized wind energy flowe each turbine is 1 2 m in diameter and 4 1 m in length as shown in fig 18 a his wind farm has 9 pairs of counter rotating vawts and is configured as in fig 18 b the wind farm with these small vawts can outperform 6 9 times conventional wind farms of hawts on power density with 4d d is the turbine rotor diameter turbine spacing dabiri 2011 the counter rotating concept and wind farm arrangement take advantage of schooling fish concept as shown in fig 19 a the vortex see fig 19 b created by front fish can provide propulsion to the neighboring fish whittlesey et al 2010 likewise the turbine array arranged the way the schooling fish can improve the performance of individual ones according to another study by giorgetti et al 2015 two close arranged counter rotating vawts suppress the downstream vortex of the flow and prevent energy dissipation thus output power is enhanced by more than 10 higher than the isolated turbine the vortex suppression can also cause an increase in power for the downstream turbines because of the lack of wake interaction zanforlin and nishino 2016 prof dabiri tested counter rotating vawts of a wind farm in his testing site and concluded that each turbine can deliver 10 more power as shown in fig 20 the possible arrangements of vawts can be co rotating cr counter outer rotating cor and counter inner rotating cir where s is rotational axis distance between two rotors the numerical study presents that all three arrangements can benefit efficiency increase with s at a range of 1 5d to 3d compared with the isolated one shaheen and abdallah 2017 the averaged power coefficient increases as s reduces this is consistent with the numerical results presented by giorgetti et al 2015 the configuration of cir shows the best results in the power enhancement however these conclusions above are limited to a fixed incoming wind direction of 900 it has been proved that the aerodynamic performance of each turbine is dependent on the incoming wind speed which has investigated in a wind tunnel ahmadi baloutaki et al 2016 for fixed s 2d configurations cr and cir exhibit a power decreasing trend with the increase of wind speed among the three configurations cor exhibits strongest flow interaction in the wake which can achieve fast wake recovery about 87 of the incoming flow at downstream10d away cir vawts can reduce energy dissipation in the regime between two turbines due to the oriented same flow direction thus more kinetic energy is available to be extracted by each turbine giorgetti et al 2015 the concept of cir vawts was studied in a wind tunnel by ahmadi baloutaki et al 2016 the output power of both turbines is improved when s 2d except at the higher wind speed of 14 m s as stated in the reference the smaller spacing s in the range of 1 5d 3d the more improvement in power shaheen and abdallah 2017 numerically proved that there is 16 increase in power compared to the isolated turbine when s 1 5d giorgetti et al 2015 also numerically showed around 10 increase when s is lower than 2d 11 increase in power efficiency was obtained in another wind tunnel testing when s is between 1 5d and 2d shyu 2014 moreover the vortex shedding and turbulence induced by the rotational blades are suppressed in the arrangement of cir rotors this will enhance power output and reduce the aerodynamic load on the turbine structure for the downstream turbines bremseth and duraisamy 2016 ahmadi baloutaki et al 2016 tested the performance of turbine working in the shadow of cir vawts in the wind tunnel the output power was enhanced and the increase was mainly dependent on s and d where d is the distance of the downstream turbine to the upstream turbines as illustrated in fig 21 the highest power efficiency happens when s 1 5d and d 3d as s 2d little flow interaction was observed between two cir turbines in the experimental results by lam and peng 2017 the flow along the centerline between two turbines appears to be undisturbed and hence the downstream turbine can likely operate as in the free stream flow when 1d d 2d this is however not applicable to the turbine operating in the downstream of cor it is hard to solve it fundamentally since this inherent property is determined by the orientation of the rotational axis in summary although c p of vawts in megawatts is much lower than hawts the kilowatts ones are not much inferior for example troposkien type vawts developed by snl megawatt scale vawts are still in the conceptual stage and have a lack of practical operation data it is well known that although development of vawts started decades ago rarely there are successfully commercialized products thus it is hard to convince people about their feasibility and reliability due to their negative publicity nevertheless scientists and engineers are continuing to put their efforts on overcoming the technical challenges many innovative ideas were proposed to enhance the output power including but not limited to shielding and deflector application cycloturbine and turbines working in a pair cir vawts working in a group could potentially be a promising solution although power coefficient of isolated hawt is higher than that of isolated vawt turbines must be spaced 3d to 5d in the lateral direction and 6d to10d in the longitudinal direction in modern wind farms to achieve 90 kinetic energy recovery giorgetti et al 2015 kanner 2015 according to the study conducted by ahmadi baloutaki et al 2016 the disadvantage of lower c p of vawts can be compensated by employing cir turbine group and putting them closer to increase power density cyclic behavior in power and thrust is really a critical factor in vawt design and it directly determines turbine lifespan nearly all past failure of onshore vawt cases are related to this characteristic for example the turbines shown in fig 5 to smoothen cyclic aerodynamics the advanced state of the art technologies include employing helical blades cycloturbine applying deflector and so on however no technology demonstration has ever shown their reliability in megawatts power output composite material utilization in blades manufacturing is also recommended for future turbines 7 self starting property self starting capability of vawts is another one of the most concerned factors in the design for areas where wind speed is lower it is well known that the rotating blades can only produce positive tangential force within a certain range of the azimuth angles due to the occurrence of the stall as rapid changes of aoas arab et al 2017 this inherent characteristic is determined by the specific orientation of the rotating axis relative to the wind direction the rotors produce cyclic torque as shown in fig 14 b as a result the possibility of self starting somehow depends on the rotor s initial azimuth angles of the blade the chance of self starting is high at the blade position where the overall produced torque can overcome inertia and friction of the system external assistance to self start could be a practical solution for example a bi directional gearbox is normally used to run the generator as a motor for a brief period of time to spin the rotor sutherland et al 2012 apelfröjd et al 2016 another obstacle of self starting could be the longer rotational shaft of vawt the natural frequency caused by the torsional vibration represents the fundamental frequency due to its lowest value for both hawt and vawt design it is even more concerned for vawts if the generator is at the ground level resulting in a long drivetrain as shown in fig 22 of a 200 kw vawt apelfröjd et al 2016 three blades are attached to the hub with struts the hub is connected to the direct driven generator bridged by a long rotating steel shaft this long drivetrain suffers generator damped torsional vibrations in the rotating shaft of vawt eriksson and bernhoff 2005 its smallest eigen frequency has to be designed to be larger than the greatest rotor frequency in order to avoid vibrational resonance the eigen frequency of the torsional vibration is dependent on the generator damping it has been theoretically proved that the direct driven synchronous generator has higher eigen frequency than the induction generator with a gearbox in the condition of same shaft dimension and material the eigen frequency can be improved by the increase of the mass of the shaft if the induction generator has to be used although the ground based generator makes it easy for maintenance personnel to access and hence to reduce maintenance cost this advantage seems insufficient to justify the increased friction and inertia of the system due to the heavy load from the long shaft especially for the megawatt scale turbines as a result the torque from the rotor has to bear the long shaft to start the connected generator to rotate that means strong wind is necessary in order to generate high rotational torque even worse the long shaft will also increase the risk of fatigue on the gears and eventually increase the frequency of turbine maintenance troposkien type vawt has a short shaft connection between the rotor and the generator as shown in fig 23 because the rotor is closer to the ground however the blades have to be much longer and larger to capture prescribed power output because of the lower wind speed at the lower altitude of the wind profile this will increase the cost of manufacturing and material used however for this kind of vawts extra upper bearing is needed at the top of the rotor in order to allow the rotor to rotate freely to stabilize the top side of the rotor guy wires are used with one end anchored on the ground thus such turbine requires a large footprint area the tension in wires also causes additional downward force burdened on the base structure cheng 2016 sutherland et al 2012 the downward force will be transferred to the lower bearing mechanism which is further detrimental for self starting on the other hand one extra upper bearing will also increase the total cost of the turbine to reduce the load from the long shaft and large rotors on the bearing mechanism floating offshore vawt could be a solution the spar float can be designed to rotate together with the rotor as one body as shown in fig 24 a deepwind concept the buoyancy of the float can balance the system weight and hence the downward force on the bearing mechanism is reduced vita 2011 additionally the rotating spar allows relatively large motion for the operating turbine however in this concept it is technically challenging to put the submerged generator at the end of the spar paulsen et al 2011 the technology of rotating spar float is also applied in the floating axis wind turbine fawt concept fig 24 b the rollers and generators are arranged around the cylindrical spar surface above the sea surface and are driven by contacting the cylindrical surface of the rotating floater akimoto et al 2011 the torque from the rotating spar float will drive the rollers and generators to produce power the drivetrain system is designed to be synchronized with the pitch and heave motion of the spar float the rotor support directly comes from buoyancy forces power take off mechanism system can be designed light only the thrust forces are loaded on the bearing mechanism which is much lower than the weight of the turbine rotor the tilt of the spar is caused by the magnus effect of the current it is hereby highlighted that the strong current can also cause vortex induced motion vim especially for deeper drafter float and hence the regular lateral oscillation this is a significant challenge in terms of turbine design fatigue of structure lifespan etc researchers have carried out a number of investigation using laboratory testing or numerical computing on the aerodynamic characteristics of self starting and have tried to find feasible solutions it has been found that the turbines with thicker blade profiles perform better in self starting than the ones with thinner blades batista et al 2011 the thicker blades are able to contribute relatively high torsion to spin the rotor however the thinner blade is normally utilised in the larger scale over tens or hundreds of kilowatt scale turbines in order to reduce the mass of the turbine bansil 2014 additionally a lighter rotor reduces the inertia of the rotor and less starting torque is required naca 0012 to naca 0018 are the classical and appropriate blade profiles applied in vawts the lower mass of the turbine is less costly not only in material but also in installation and importantly results in lower moment of inertia the self starting capability is also dependent on the number of vawt blades it has been concluded that three bladed rotors are normally better than two bladed rotors in lightly loaded condition irrespective of the initial azimuth position of the blades dominy et al 2007 in the reference zamani et al 2016 the j shaped blade profile was proved numerically to perform better in self starting it produces higher torque at lower tsr than the conventional blade profile decades ago hybrid vawts had been developed which used savonius rotor to assist self starting at low wind speed while the darrieus rotor was to augment efficiency at higher wind speed shankar 1979 this arrangement combines their respective advantage of the self starting ability in savonius rotor and high efficiency in darrieus rotor there are two possible ways to arrange these hybrid rotors savonius rotor is either stacked below the darrieus rotor configuration 1 or tucked inside the darrieus rotor configuration 2 configuration 1 is more sensitive to the variation of wind speed than configuration 2 because it has shorter rotational axis wakui et al 2005 however it harnesses less wind energy due to the flow interference between the inner blades and outer blades the radius ratio of these configurations is a critical parameter to maximize the power output wakui et al 2005 jacob and chatterjee 2019 investigated configuration 2 using experiment and numerical modelling it was found that the overall produced power is the sum of power from the individual rotor the rotational speed of the whole system is dependent on the radius ratio of the two rotors however its longer rotational shaft determines its favorability in small scale power application the hybrid vawts in a few thousand watts have been commercialized and are widely popular in the urban area in this section possible solutions are explored on the self starting capability of the vawts several researchers and engineers have attempted to improve the blade profile to increase the produced torque from the blade however this improvement is found to be minimal because of the stall of the blade with varying rotational azimuth angles the self starting capability is attributed to the cyclic torque output of the turbine the heavy rotors due to the long shaft on the top of the drivetrain system are detrimental to the situation the high percentage of the power is consumed to drive the generator due to the high friction and inertia of the rotor offshore vawts could be the solution by balancing rotor weight with the buoyancy of the spar float however magnus effect and vim are another significant concerns for the spar type vawts designs and could be eliminated by deliberated design of the float 8 conclusions this paper gives a new perspective on the state of the art of vawts a comprehensive comparison was performed between vawts and hawts on the aerodynamic working principle and design tools power efficiency self starting capability yaw mechanism fatigue issues noise etc the aim of the paper is to identify the technical barriers and design challenges and to explore the feasibility of deviation from traditional hawts to vawts for the future wind turbine market like a coin has two sides although the orientation of vertical axis determinates their omnidirectional characteristic and easy accessible ground based drivetrain system it also brings a series of technical barriers such as lower c p self starting issue and cyclic aerodynamics and associated structure fatigue it is well known that lower level installed drivetrain system can reduce the height of cog of vawts and the size of the support structure which significantly benefit cost reduction for floating platforms in the offshore application it certainly alleviates the challenges of the structural design however this advantage seems insufficient to justify the increased friction and inertia of the system due to the heavy load from the long shaft or struts and hub especially for megawatt scale turbines in this review article holistic information of vawt designs is provided for both new researchers and experts to understand their technical perspectives and commercial viability an overview of lessons learned from the installed vawts in the field is presented to support the development of optimal vawts advanced technologies proposed in the latest publications are respectively reviewed in this paper in order to mitigate technical barriers in terms of power efficiency the troposkien type rotor has proved its inspiring power output techniques such as shielding and deflector ideas cycloturbine and paired cir vawts are also proposed to enhance the output power although the power coefficient of isolated hawt is higher than that of isolated vawt this disadvantage can be compensated by employing turbines in arrays and putting vawts closer to each other to increase power density the major hindrance for vawts is from cyclic aerodynamics of the rotors nearly all past failure onshore cases as shown in fig 5 are inherent results of this characteristic proposed helical type design and cycloturbine can reduce fluctuation of such periodic performance but the recently developed technologies have not been proved to feasible for megawatt scale turbines yet moreover the reinforced composite material has to be used to maximize structural strength to resist the fatigue loads to improve self starting ability combined savornius and darreus rotor could be a feasible solution but only applicable in kilowatts sized device another way is to employ an offshore spar buoy with a generator connected at the bottom of the structure the buoyancy of the spar float can balance off the heavy mass of the top rotor and support tower and downward forces to reduce system inertia for self starting in addition richer offshore wind resources can drive the vawts to self start at higher wind speeds in the present vawts have fallen far behind hawts in publicity and generating business revenues in both onshore and offshore applications in the 4th quarter of 2017 30 mw hywind scotland offshore floating hawt farm started to deliver electricity 25 km off the coast shore in scotland each turbine is rated 6 mw advanced innovative solutions are required to develop the competitive vawts in the global trend of larger turbine rotor size to reduce lcoe due to the discussed constraints of upsizing hawt vawt could be an alternative to be developed for over 10 mw in power capacity thanks to its lesser technical barriers of scaling up the offshore application poses a great potential for vawts but is still in its infancy and concept design stage nowadays in the rural or urban area the commercialized kilowatts vawts are increasingly popular partly because of their aesthetic shapes in future it is expected that kinetic sculpture combined vawts could be increasingly popular as a dual purpose public art display 
22785,a review of existing technical challenges and their potential solutions in the development of vertical axis wind turbines vawts is presented in the context over the last decade vawts have received increasing attention from researchers and scientists due to their inherent features such as omni directional property simplification of the blade geometry lower noise generated and easy accessibility attributed to the ground based generators however their major drawbacks such as lower power coefficient poor self starting capability and fatigue issues due to cyclic aerodynamics loads make them less competitive than horizontal axis wind turbines hawts this paper will share a new perspective on the state of the art vawts to explore the new opportunity and possibility for their commercial viability a comprehensive comparison was performed between vawts and hawts focused in different sections on their aerodynamic performance efficiency power density in a wind farm and self starting ability the objective of the review paper is to identify technical barriers design challenges and the future of commercial vawts in the wind turbine market currently dominated by conventional hawts the paper will address what the major technical barriers for vawts to compete against hawts in future moreover the review will discuss if the innovative technologies proposed in the last decade are commercially feasible to overcome drawbacks of vawts the paper will also explore if vawts are more competitive in offshore application through the lessons learned from onshore turbines installed

market has been consolidated in the technologies of turbine design and operation wind energy has received growing interest and has been in the upward trend of wind power getting more penetration to the grids global wind energy council gwec has released in the report that global installed total wind power capacity is 539 123 mw by 2017 and including 3 5 offshore wind power gwec 2017 china u s and germany are the top 3 countries contributed 62 of the global installed wind power the tariff price of wind energy has reached below us 0 02 kwh in some countries about 6 of the country s electricity is delivered from the wind turbine fleet in u s and canada uruguay s electricity is all 100 from renewable energy while 35 40 is from wind energy wind turbines are the commonly used devices to harness wind energy they convert kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy which rotates generators to deliver electricity there are primarily two types of turbine according to the orientation of the rotating axis horizontal axis wind turbines hawts and vertical axis wind turbines vawts the rotary axis of hawts is parallel to the wind direction while that of vawts is perpendicular to the wind direction although both commercialized hawts and vawts are available in the market hawts are more prevailing in the market of both onshore and offshore applications over the past 30 years due to their mature technology and promising performance and they have a long record of operational success in the history small sized kilowatts vawt manufacturers take only one quarter market portion of hawt ones pitteloud and gsänger 2017 they seem to stagnate in the development and market share in generating business revenue megawatt scale vawts are rarely noticeable in the current market on the contrary the size of hawts has grown larger recently for example vestas turbines 2 mw 4 2 mw siemens 2 3 mw 4 3 mw and ge turbine 4 8 mw lengths of turbine blades have been manufactured longer and larger as shown in fig 1 the converged design and technologies of the hawt rotors have been established to be three bladed upwind type with yaw mechanism and pitch control system thanks to decades of their development and extensive research the growing turbine size plays a critical role in the reduction of levelized cost of electricity lcoe but meanwhile brings more challenges in construction and operation and maintenance o m as the blades are designed longer and larger more challenges arise due to significant weight of the top rotor and heavy mechanical and electrical system housed inside the nacelle of hawt their aerodynamic performance is scalable as derived from aerodynamic theory however dramatically increased mass of the topside rotor deteriorates scaling up behavior of the turbine system because the increased weight owing to bigger rotor size is greater than aerodynamic load increased malcolm 2003 self weight induced cyclic gravitational loading causes fatigue issues on the blades and their associated structures of hawt shires 2013 although the bigger size of turbine can benefit cost reduction the cost of o m is also significantly increased especially in harsher offshore environment and operational need of the specific vessels and installation equipment on the contrary increasing the scale of vawt doesn t bring such negative impact relatively because of the base mounted generator and gearbox systems therefore the scaling up limit of the top rotor can reach up to 30 mw apelfröjd et al 2016 in addition the blade profile of hawt is relatively more complicated with cylindrical shape at the rotor base connected to complex aerodynamic profile until the blade tip a large mould for producing such blade is necessary as shown in fig 2 of an offshore turbine blade manufactured by siemens mhi vestas has even launched a 9 5 mw offshore hawt in 2017 which is 164 m in diameter the world s most powerful available wind turbine gets major power boost 2017 its huge components are very costly for maritime transportation and o m which are much exposed to offshore environment in this point of view vawt has an advantage of having extruded blade profile and thus large mould is not necessary compared with offshore wind turbines aerodynamic performance of onshore ones is normally susceptible to the turbulence flow caused by complex topography of land terrain their gigantic structures also bring issues of obstruction view of the scene noise pollution and damage to the flying birds and shadow flicker during sunny days thus available wind farms have to be confined to non forested hills and non urban and ice free areas moreover onshore wind turbines have a relatively longer downtime window due to non predictable and unstable wind resources offshore devices are more able to tap the richer and better quality wind resources and the negative impact such as shadow flicker noise pollution on human population is also minimized annual installed offshore wind capacity has been expanding fast recently many large operating offshore wind farms have been installed in high geographic latitudes european countries and those areas with higher and consistent wind speed owing to the heating of the earth s surface by the sun radiation captured offshore wind capacity is approximately 1 5 2 times of onshore wind capacity in denmark germany and netherlands offshore energy outlook 2018 another trend of offshore wind energy is tapping into further deeper waters of more than 40 m depth to accommodate such water depth evolution of developed offshore platforms of hawts is shown in fig 3 from bottom fixed monopile or jacket to floating tension leg platform tlp semi submersible or spar however the installation of offshore wind farms need to avoid vessel traffic routes and fishing areas the impact of offshore wind turbines on marine spices and seabirds is assessed in the reference bailey et al 2014 to reduce cost engineers are nowadays diverting their attention to alternative technologies instead of immoderately enlarging hawts offshore vawts pose an alternative solution because their mechanical and electrical system can be mounted on the platform deck so that workers can easily access the system and complete o m in a much safer and less costly way on the other hand center of gravity cog is in consequence much lower than that of hawt with an equivalent power capacity this can reduce the size of the designed platform and anchored foundation additionally vawt can rotate in any wind direction without yaw system and hence less restraints to the hydrodynamic motion and the design of the platform this will increase uptime of operating window compared to that of using hawt platform in the harsh sea environment at present megawatt scale vawts are still in their infancy and concept design stage thus it is a big question to be answered if they could move forward and become an alternative in the offshore wind energy market innovative and advanced technologies are urgently needed to alleviate some inherent drawbacks of vawts for example lower power coefficient cyclic aerodynamics loads and poor self starting capability in this article a comprehensive literature review will be provided to fully understand the existing bottlenecks in the vawt technologies and to explore technical perspectives the paper will elaborate complicated aerodynamic load and performance of vawts involved and their associated mechanical and electrical technology on their commercial viability in future therefore the content of the review paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a comprehensive description on the advantages and disadvantages of hawts and vawts in order to fully understand drawbacks of vawts section 3 summarises the development history of onshore vawts the lessons learned in the past vawt projects will be emphasized to highlight their technical bottlenecks section 4 introduces the aerodynamic design tools of vawts and their corresponding technologies to theoretically explore working features and shortcomings of different rotors design tools for turbine rotors are also discussed in this section on their reliability accuracy and computational efficiency they play crucial role in optimizing rotor performance section 5 to 7 discuss the advanced technologies to overcome the drawbacks of vawts such as cyclic aerodynamics loads lower power coefficient and poor self starting capability a holistic review on vawts is provided for both new researchers and experts to continue to grow harnessing wind energy 2 advantages and disadvantages of vawts and hawts vawts are generally categorised as drag and lift based devices the former one utilises wind drag on the blades driving to rotate for example s type savonius the latter one utilises the lift on the blades for example straight type troposkien type and helical type darrieus fig 4 wiel 2015 lift based devices are the most popular for turbines sized up to hundreds of kilowatts drag based turbines are not preferred due to high solidity heavier weight and fairly low efficiency etc for example the power coefficient of savonius turbine is not more than 25 zamani et al 2016 however the drag based ones have the advantage of self starting ability therefore they are commonly found as small sized turbines in the urban and remote areas with relatively low wind speed for the lift based straight type vawts the advantage is their simple and extruded blades hence lower manufacture cost a patent of troposkien type turbine was filed in 1926 by g j m darrieus a french engineer darrieus 1931 this type of turbine has the lowest minimized bending stress which was offset by the increased centrifugal stresses at higher rpm ashwill 1992 sutherland et al 2012 the concepts of helical type rotor are developed to minimise their cyclic aerodynamics loads scheurich et al 2011 they have relatively lower vibration load due to the helix structure of each blade and vibration is thus balanced off besides the abovementioned savorius rotor and straight type troposkien type darrieus rotors bhutta et al 2012 also reviewed various innovative configurations in the past decades on their advantages and disadvantages troposkien type rotor has potential of scaling up to megawatt sized turbines in future innovative rotors such as two tier darrieus masgrowe rotor combined savonius and darrieus rotor and two leaf semi rotary rotor have both high starting torque and power efficiency cross flex type rotor can be integrated into the building and produce the acceptable power output currently they are only popular in urban application and are still not competitive over hawts in the market it is well known that megawatt scale hawts have their long successful commercial history in both onshore and offshore applications as mentioned above their technologies are more mature and converged in aerodynamic shapes design procedure operation installation etc turbine blades have been established to be non uniform and twisted in the spanwise distribution pitch control is used to regulate angle of attacks aoas in high wind speed in order to alleviate the occurrence of stall however vawts have fallen far behind in their development and commercialization because of their several unsatisfactory performances firstly their power efficiency is lower than that of hawts for hawts the blades are designed purposely to be non uniform and twisted to maximize aerodynamic performance accounted for different tangential speeds and aoas from the blade root to the tip thus dynamic stall can be reduced however the complicated profile of the blades results in the high cost of manufacturing because the whole piece of blade mould must be prepared to maximize structural strength siemens 6 0 mw offshore wind turbine brochure 2012 one example of the mould is illustrated in fig 2 the blade roots are typically thick in the cylindrical shape for mechanical strength purpose but some are in naca profiled shape at the blade tip its tangential speed is highest where the tip is mostly developed to be thinner to reduce both the aerodynamic loss and induced noise for vawts the shape of the blades is normally uniform without twist hence turbine blades are less costly in the manufacture as a turbine rotates aoa of each blade keeps changing together with varying rotational azimuth angles this phenomenon causes cyclic aerodynamic performance and hence fatigue issues of structures at the risk of failure only the blades in the upstream can produce rotational torque whereas others may be in the downstream turbulent region creating resistance to the rotation as a result the possibility of self starting mostly depends on the rotor s initial azimuth angles of the blades where the overall torque is relatively high consequently power efficiency c p is greatly reduced because of the occurrence of the stall over a wide range of rotational azimuth angles arab 2017 this inherent property is determined by the orientation of the rotational axis furthermore the rated tip speed ratio tsr λ of vawt is designed to be lower than that of hawt and is generally less than 4 but modern three bladed hawts are typically designed with a rated tsr from 6 to 9 schubel and crossley 2012 therefore vawts create lower aerodynamic noise emission and less disturbance to human population apelfröjd 2016 however higher gear ratio is required to increase rotational speed from a low spinning rotor to a high spinning drivetrain it should be noted that gearbox becomes much heavier and more expensive in such cases secondly only vawts upstream blades can produce rotational torque and thus the self starting capability is poor the fluctuation of the aerodynamic performance of vawts due to the changes of azimuth angle also deteriorates such situation the blades fail to provide positive torque when the stall happens on the contrary all hawts blades contribute rotating torque simultaneously regardless of rotational azimuth angles thus a breeze can easily blow the rotors to rotate if inertia and friction of the system can be overcome however hawts require yaw mechanism to deal with varying wind direction to secure the rotors always facing the incoming wind to maximize power output in contrast to hawts vawts are omni directional and yaw mechanism is not thus required therefore they have fewer components than hawts and hence less maintenance frequency in offshore application the omni directional characteristic leads to less restraints to the hydrodynamic motion and the design of the floating platform resulting in better floating stability fowler et al 2014 cheng 2016 lei et al 2017 lastly the vertical orientation of the long shaft brings both pros and cons of vawts the major advantage is that the drivetrain system of vawt can be installed at the ground level thus it is relatively safe and easy to be accessed for maintenance however this may sacrifice self starting ability and inherent efficiency the long steel causes an increase in the overall weight of the rotor which will be borne by bearing mechanism below moreover increased inertia requires more forces to move the top rotor especially for large scale devices higher torsional stress and inertia from the top rotor are unfavorable for self starting and turbine efficiency on the contrary hawt s weight is borne by their supporting tower consequently it is much easier to drive the generator to rotate additionally vawt s supporting tower is shorter than hawt s one the rotor of vawt has lower rotational speed owing to lower tsr thus tangential speed of its blades is much lower than that of the tips of hawts for hawts the clearance between the lowest blade tip and the ground must be relatively large for safety purpose from aerodynamic perspectives vawts can benefit from skewed wind direction and can produce power well bianchini 2012 for example mostly installed troposkien type darrieus wind turbine rotors are relatively close to the ground while the towers of hawts are usually as high as possible where the wind is much uniform and strong this will be a tradeoff between the increase in cost and the increase in wind energy extracted moreover vawts are less susceptible to shadow flicker compared to hawts which often disturbs residents in the installed area such shadow emission periodically casts shadow of each blade of hawt onto their surrounding buildings and land area during sunny days shadow flicker protection system for wind turbines 2018 helical type vawts produce minimal shadow flicker due to one end of each blade being curved in a helix structure in offshore application shadow flicker factor for rotor design can be ignored since the turbines are sighted far from residential areas in summary a comprehensive comparison was provided in this section between vawts and hawts and is tabulated in table 1 the primary unsatisfactory factors of vawts mainly lie in lower power efficiency poor self starting capability and cyclic aerodynamics loads and associated fatigue issues turbine blades alternatively contribute rotational torques by varying rotational azimuth angles only the upstream blades can provide rotational torque while stall occurs for the downstream blades this characteristic prohibits for further commercialization thus vawts fall far behind hawts in generating business revenues however small sized vawts still have broad applications in the urban or rural area due to their omni directionality insensitivity to turbulence less costly in materials and maintenance low tsr and less noise for example architecture roof turbines and off grid hybrid wind and solar street light system with maglev vawt aluminum alloy vertical axis wind turbine generator 300 w typmar cxf 30012v 24v ragheb 2014 pendharkar 2012 advanced solutions are still required to be further research and developed for their competitive potential in future wind turbine market 3 research and development history of onshore vawts the most successful commercialized onshore vawts are developed by sandia national laboratory snl early 1970 s to 1990 s they are two bladed troposkien type vawts sized 17 m in diameter and rated power at 95 kw fig 5 a more than 500 units were in commercial operation on land however nearly all the turbines were removed by the end of 2004 because the wind farm can only generate one tenth electricity of its original designed in 1990 s gipe 2009 this failure is due to the fatigue occurred in the joints alone the blades see fig 6 sutherland et al 2012 there are totally two joints along each blade to connect different airfoils naca 0021 at both ends and sand 0018 50 in the middle this weak design turns vawts into a negative influence on their commercial perspective u s department of energy doe terminated almost all vawt based research funding after the closure of flowind this commercialization has proved that vawts can produce competitive electricity compared with the hawts beside 17 m commercialized vawt snl also developed a 34 m vawt 500 kw test bed to optimize turbine performance ashwill 1992 c p reached as high as 40 presented in the field test report sutherland et al 2012 a 500 kw vawt 850 straight type rotor was also constructed in 1990 s by vawt ltd as shown in fig 5 b it was europe s biggest vawt at that time price 2006 it also suffered blade failure just within a few months of operation due to a manufacturing fault and one fiberglass blade broke shires 2013 d ambrosio and medaglia 2010 a unique direct drive t1 turbine was designed and built by the vertical wind ab and uppsala university sweden in 2010 fig 5 c möllerström et al 2015 the generator was mounted on the ground and connected to the rotor by a long steel shaft t1 turbine is currently in operation and owned by uppsala university for tower dynamics and noise study möllerström 2015 éole the world s largest 110 m high vawt installed at québec canada in the 1980 s fig 5 d its rated output power is 3 8 mw it was operating between 1987 and 1993 and produced 12 gwh of electric energy shires 2013 however it went out of service in 1993 due to the damage of its bottom large and expensive bearing benmeddour et al 2010 in a nutshell failure of the onshore vawts is primarily because of fatigue issues regardless of lcoe and poor self starting capability although turbine performance is not disappointing in terms of power efficiency research and development activities seem stagnated because of less funding support from government and the success of their competitor hawts it is less frequent to hear the released news on newly operational onshore vawts sized in hundreds of kilowatts after their prosperous period from 1970 s to 1990 s nowadays smallscaled wind energy converting devices have been prevailing in the city street or on the building rooftop in the urban area full of strong turbulence due to the disturbance of buildings small vawts are increasingly popular for installations in urban settings due to their aesthetically pleasing shape lower noise produced and easy building integration kumar et al 2018 for instance it was reported that over 200 quiet revolution vawts were installed between 2005 and 2016 quiet revolution vawt at rwe stadium essen 2015 quiet revolution wind turbines 2016 one case is shown in fig 7 a a 14 kw helical type vawt was installed for electric vehicle charging in spain see fig 7 b uge installs its first wind powered ev charging station 2012 sometimes small vawts are attractively designed into kinetic sculptures and become a dual purpose public art display as shown in fig 7 c and d and they are all drag based vawts some vawts installed in urban area were also reviewed by kumar et al 2018 including aforementioned combined savonius and darrieus rotor and modified darrieus rotors as pointed by authors their viability depends on their self starting ability reliability and cost to date researches and laboratory based tests on vawts are still going on in many universities and companies such as stanford university brownstein et al 2016 technical university of denmark dtu vita 2011 paulsen et al 2012 2014 cranfield university collu et al 2014 blusseau and patel 2012 delft university of technology tu delft he 2013 claessens 2006 kemp 2015 etc a number of researchers are also keeping eyes on the conceptual design of future offshore vawts due to higher wind energy available and lower turbulence near the sea surface without disturbance of complicated land terrain however they are still in the theoretical stage and lack of practical operation data for examples 5 mw deepwind by a consortium led by dtu 5 mw twinfloat by nénuphar 10 mw aeogenera x by a consortium led by cranfield university and 6 mw spinfloat by a consortium led by french wind power specialist asah lm these concepts are funded by government or private companies their aim is to explore a more favorable offshore device to reduce lcoe but there is a long way to go to prove their feasibility due to technical bottlenecks of existing vawts 4 aerodynamic design of vawts airfoils are widely chosen as blade profile of the wind turbine they were developed with wind tunnel tests by the united states national advisory committee for aeronautics naca during world war ii the aerodynamics of the wind turbine 2012 in contrast to blades of hawts which rotate at relatively steady aoas in a certain wind speed aoas of vawts blades are varying due to rapid changes of the rotational azimuth angles the pressure and suction surfaces of the blade always alternate in every rotation circle as summarized by kemp 2015 the symmetrical naca series without camber is normally employed for vawts design in order to produce equivalently torque between upstream half and downstream half of the rotation circle cambered airfoil is an asymmetry between two sides of the chord line the symmetrical 4 digit naca series are indicated as naca 00xx xx represents the thickness of the airfoil naca 0012 and naca 0015 are popular profiles and applied in vawts design horst 2015 the research on airfoil selection criteria effect of airfoil thickness camber on turbine performance and blade stall is discussed in the reference kemp 2015 and will not be repeated in this paper besides naca profiles there are fx series du series s series etc hashem and mohamed 2018 which can also be used for wind turbine design however it has been numerically proved that symmetrical airfoil s 1046 has maximum cp of 40 mohamed 2012 tjiu et al 2015 for this type of airfoil the maximum thickness 17 occurs at 30 8 of chord in conventional naca series the maximum thickness is at 30 of chord the blades of vawts experience a much wider range of aoas than that of the blades of hawts they are susceptible to dynamic stall due to the rapid changes of rational azimuth angles the dynamic stall is characterized by the flow separation on the blade surface claessens 2006 at a lower aoa the boundary fluid moves regularly attached to the surface of the airfoil but at the higher aoa separation happens at the trailing edge of the airfoil the stall occurs when aoa is larger than stall angle of airfoil at stall angle there is a sharp increase in drag liu et al 2017 vortices which generated from both leading and trailing edges of the blades due to flow separation will shed into the wake horst 2015 large wake field full of fierce turbulence can cause the embedded blades to produce decreased non uniform force the separation moves to the leading edge as further increase in aoa and this phenomenon is called deep stall claessens 2006 as shown in fig 8 a deep stall happens at aoa 15 50 where the value of c l suddenly decreases from approximately 1 2 to 0 6 the ratio of c l and c d also starts to drop which significantly affect the efficiency of the airfoil fig 8 b after stall occurrence of airfoil the blades continue to rotate into the upstream laminar flow and then lift is recovered when aoa 160 for the case in fig 8 aoa has to be lower than 15 50 to get the comparable lift value 1 1 due to hysteresis effect claessens 2006 it takes a long time for blades to recover from the effect of the vortices in the wake additionally the downstream blades have to pass through the turbulent flow produced by the upstream blades the oscillatory aerodynamic loads on vawt occur in all 6 degree of freedom dof when deep and dynamic stall happens thus the aerodynamic forces on blades are oscillating over the whole rotational circle blades are prone to fatigue aero elastic vibration and produce noise cyclic aerodynamic over a rotational revolution is the inherent characteristic of vawts and different from that of hawts it may shorten structural life span as discussed in section 3 turbines in fig 5 proves such findings nowadays hawts are the wind industry s preferred products due to aforementioned success stories rotor design tools have been developed and verified to be more reliable and accurate such as qblade bladed aerodyn harp opt etc all these methods employ blade element momentum theory bem namely an aerodynamic theory bem method has been widely integrated into the design tool of hawts because of its simplicity and high computational efficiency coupled with genetic algorithm it is able to generate optimized turbine blade profile with inputs from look up table of lift and drag polar data liu et al 2017 aerodynamic design tools for predicting vawt performance include local circulation models momentum models and vortex models castillo tudela 2011 circulation models are based on potential theory eulerian equation momentum models are derived from newton s second law of the motion and are an extension of bem method by employing actuator disc theory vawt rotor is represented as a disc top view and there is pressure jump as the fluid flows through the actuator disc a deceleration of the wind speed after the disc is responsible for the pressure jump and therefore an induced velocity is determined momentum models consist of multiple streamtube model ms and double multiple streamtube model dms marten et al 2013 the rotation disc is discretized into multiple streamtubes in the cross flow direction the difference between them is that dms employs twice actuator disc theory in both upstream and downstream half circle of the rotation in each streamtube while ms is only used in the upstream half circle fig 9 as a result dms is more advanced than ms model but this momentum model is limited to solidity less than 0 2 and is not valid for the larger range of solidity castillo tudela 2011 moreover their accuracy is doubtful in quantitatively predicting aerodynamic loads when the dynamic stall occurs arab et al 2017 some physical phenomenon will be lost since the rotor is run as a steady state situation therefore momentum analytical models are suitable for optimizing rotor design due to their high computational efficiency hamedi et al 2015 vortex models are for modelling wake field of a rotating turbine they are less computationally costly and suitable for the qualitative optimization of rotor design in industrial activity marten et al 2017 lifting line free vortex wake llfvw is one of the vortex models and it employs non linear lifting line theory to capture dynamic loading on the blades and free vortex wake algorithm to simulate vortices shed from the trailing edges into the downstream wake transient rotating behavior is accounted for in this model calculation of load on the blades is identical with bem method and requires lift and drag polar data of airfoil torque curve from llfvw is consistent with bem results which was proved by running the nrel phase vi hawt rotor marten et al 2016a a nonlinear llfvw has been implemented in the open source qblade v0 9 a wind turbine aerodynamics tool this method is applicable to simulate both hawts and vawts marten et al 2018 its accuracy and broad application even outperform unsteady bem method with fewer assumptions vortex model is applied in another turbine design tool cactus which was originally developed based on vdart3 code by strickland at texas tech later snl participated in the code development specified for the troposkien type vawts murray and barone 2011 in contrast to the traditional bem method cactus employs dynamic stall models in the load calculation all the wind turbine design tools stated above are summarized in table 2 together with the programming language of source code in contrast to the bem method llfvw is more representative on the physics of wake modelling the transient vortices shed from the blade trailing edges are simulated by calculating circulation at the quarter chord position of the blade in the lifting line formulation marten et al 2016b blade tip loss is also considered in this model thus the transient flow behavior around the rotor and trails of vortices shedding into the wake are all account for however in the momentum method the turbine rotor is assumed to be a virtual actuator disc liu et al 2016 the wake is modeled with a momentum balance across the actuator disc the coefficient of the thrust is implemented to calculate the wake induced flow it is assumed that inflow is uniform and steady in the disc region this one dimensional solution is not able to consider the vortices shed from the blade tips therefore the tip loss correction has to be taken into account to minimise aerodynamic prediction errors shen et al 2005 in addition this method can only obtain a steady state flow result the transient flow behavior in the rotor region is therefore simplified and cannot be captured liu et al 2016 but it is still acceptable to predict the turbine performance and the wake flow in the initial design stage another advantage of llfvw method is its employed yaw correction model which is used to deal with floating wind turbine bem method also includes yaw correction but it gives larger error than llfvw method in modelling hawts marten et al 2016a llfvw has a large improvement on the accuracy and convergence problems to simulate vawts over the dms model which has been implemented in qblade started from v0 6 bem method also has been implemented in fast in v0 8 and coupled to a structural model but llfvw has not been coupled to any structural model and only applied for aerodynamic simulation of the rigid rotors marten 2016 computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis is the most accurate method in predicting turbine performance and their numerical results are comparable with the wind tunnel testing results the cfd application in both scientific research and commercial industries is growing rapidly in recent decades it includes but not limited to investigate the underlying physics optimize turbine performance and reduce design cost however its powerful simulation solvers sacrifice computational time and efficiency compared to aerodynamic design tools and a few weeks may be needed to obtain the approximated solution depending on computational resources used nowadays computational efficiency has been greatly increased with the development of super parallel computing technology ansys fluent star ccm and openfoam are popular cfd software all of them use the same discretization technique finite volume method fvm to approximate the solution of the unsteady reynolds averaged navior stoke s rans equations versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the flow characteristics such as vortex shedding from the blades flow separation and pressure distribution on the blade surfaces and the wake induced flow can be fully resolved cfd analysis can be used to verify the results from aerodynamic design tools this is helpful for improving the accuracy and reliability of the rotor design and eliminating the uncertainty of aerodynamic performance such as oscillation frequency of the rotor flow interference output power self starting performance etc there are a number of scientific investigation on the effect of turbine particulars and the environmental condition on the power efficiency of vawts a research observed that the maximum power coefficient is shifted to lower tsr region with an increase in solidity with cfd analysis mohamed 2012 a broad range of high power coefficient can be obtained with lower solidity ratios of 0 1 and 0 16 the narrow blade chord causes less blockage to the incoming flow and this forms a wide gap between blades for the flow to pass through the wake effect is minimized and the chance of earlier stall is reduced solidity effect on the power coefficient was studied in the reference by hezaveh et al 2017 and the same conclusion was obtained besides cfd analysis could be performed to study the effect of aspect ratio on the power coefficient which is negligible in the condition of fixed solidity and the rotor swept area a different shapes of the diffuser outside of the rotor was investigated by hashem and mohamed 2018 and a factor of power augmentation is about 4 as compared to the bare vawt hashem and mohamed 2018 in the raining environment the turbine will suffer a power loss wu and cao 2018 cfd has been applied to experiment with the innovative designs of vawts as shown in fig 10 a the nature inspired shape of the turbine was studied numerically in tu delft wiel 2015 the tulip project is mainly intended for suburban and industrial areas numerical simulation was performed to study cycloidal wind turbine by active pitch control of blade motion hwang et al 2005 erickson et al 2011 fig 10 b the control mechanism is employed to change the pitch angle of the blade relative to the wind direction fig 10 c is the j shaped vawt the specific shape is used to improve self starting capability of the turbine in cfd simulation result there is a long wake in the downstream of the turbine because a portion of the kinetic energy in the coming flow is converted into the mechanic energy liu et al 2016 however it is unrealistic to measure the velocity of the wake in the laboratory when the wake is more than 30d long stallard et al 2013 thus cfd analysis plays an essential role in studying the downstream flow fig 11 shows the numerical prediction results of the wake at the different tsr the higher the tsr is the more kinetic energy is extracted by the turbine vortices shedding frequency is also much higher it was learnt that high turbulence in the flow can re energize the wake to recover efficiently on the contrary if the rotor is working at a lower tsr the wake is extended relatively long as a result less kinetic energy is harvested by the rotor the wake requires long downstream distance to dissipate viscous vortices until is recovered to the incoming flow as a summary in this section aerodynamic design techniques used in various design tools for wind turbine blades are discussed different bem techniques and models have been developed by researchers to be utilised in the optimization of hawt performance and obtaining outline of the blade s profile with low computational costs it has also been integrated into the structural analysis model vortex model is found to be more powerful and accurate for performance prediction of vawts and has been used in open source software qblade it has been also briefed by bhutta et al 2012 in which broad design techniques are introduced such as to estimate blade vibratory stresses structural and aero elastic system damping etc the literature review found that cfd can most accurately predict turbine performance and flow visualization 5 power coefficient of vawts compared to that of hawts the efficiency of either vawt or hawt is a function of solidity σ aspect ratio a r number of blades n tsr and reynolds number re saber et al 2015 1 c p f σ a r n t s r 1 r e where σ nc 2πr c is blade chord length and r is rotor radius a r l d l is blade length λ ωr u ω is the rotational speed u is the incoming wind speed to the rotor reynolds number re is a dimensionless number related to the resultant speed of the rotating blades 2 r e ρ c w r r μ where w r is the local resultant flow velocity and is defined as 3 w r u ω r the vector arithmetic is illustrated in fig 9 the energy available in the incoming wind is the cube of the wind speed 4 p 1 2 ρ a u 3 where ρ is the wind density and a is the swept area of the rotor a π r 2 for hawts and a 2lr for vawts the power produced by the turbine is determined by the power coefficient c p and available wind energy contained in the incoming wind over a swept area a 5 p t c p 1 2 ρ a u 3 turbines are typically designed to deliver retained high rated output power maximum power after u is higher than the rated wind speed u r c p reduces when u u r through stall regulation or passive stall for vawts liu et al 2017 apelfröjd et al 2016 such turbine ideally works at a constant maximum c p when u u r to produce a determined output power the size of the turbine rotor is generally determined by the rated c p and the rated wind speed u r for a commercialized megawatt scale wind turbine u r is typically at a range of 11 m s to 15 m s which is usually 1 5 times annual averaged wind speed measured at hub height malcolm and hansen 2006 this value is critical in the rotor design and in determining the optimal cost of the system the lower u r requires the higher swept area to reach prescribed output power this leads to the longer blades and larger swept area for the same power output the highest thrust on the rotor which is the main fundamental load usually happens in the stall regime instead of at the rated wind speed for vawt where this happens at the rated wind speed for hawt consequently high cost material is required to meet the required structural strength therefore the higher u r is recommended to reduce rotor size and minimise the dominant fundamental load to an acceptable level for both vawt and hawt generally wind speed is rated at 14 15 m s for vawt and 11 13 m s for hawt blonk 2010 within this higher range the highest thrust occurs at u r for vawt especially in the offshore application higher wind speed results in smaller rotor size and lower foundation load leading to less material used and hence a light topside structure the dimension of the designed platform is thus reduced and higher stability requirement is easily met fowler et al 2014 for example according to eq 5 the required swept area of the rotor at u r 11 m s is less than half of that at u r 15 m s this reduction is remarkable and significantly affect the support tower size material used system cost and even the size of the offshore platform in fig 12 the solid lines present the relationship between a and p t at different u r which is from 11 m s to 15 m s this calculation is based on eq 5 and c p is assumed to be 30 the output power is linearly proportional to the swept area a of the rotor solid lines various wind turbines either from published papers or commercialized products are indicated in fig 12 the square symbols represent vawts and the circle ones represent hawts different colors of the symbols represent the different u r of the turbine which is consistent with the colors of the lines the rated c p of the turbine rotor is less than 30 if the symbol is above the same colored solid line and vice versa the rated c p is the value when the turbine works at rated power that means the lower rated c p requires large swept area a and the higher rated c p requires small a in order to reach the prescribed power capacity for example darwind xe128 5 mw its rated c p is 37 and a is below the red solid line and smaller a is qualified to reach rated 5 mw it utilises the direct drivetrain to minimise the friction and inertia loss of the gear in practice but for gamesa g132 the same 5 mw turbine its rated c p is 27 at the rated wind speed 13 m s gamesa g132 5 0 mw its c p can be up to 48 at the wind speed of 8 m s a is above the blue solid line and it has to be large enough to fit its prescribed power capacity for vawts it has to be pointed out that all megawatts ones marked in fig 12 a are concept designs and their efficiency is apparently less than 30 at the rated power akimoto et al 2011 paulsen et al 2012 there are very limited products with published performance data in practice for vawts less than 1 mw thus only 2 rotors in 5 mw are given in fig 12 b power coefficient c p of all the rotors shown in fig 12 is summarized in fig 13 the rated wind speed u r of each rotor is differentiated with the color which is consistent with fig 12 all rated c p values are lower than betz limit 59 3 hau 2013 abdulrazek 2012 ragheb and ragheb 2011 fraenkel 1986 betz limit is the theoretical maximum percentage of kinetic energy which can be extracted by an ideal turbine without losses such as viscous loss pressure drag on blades and tip vortex its value is derived based on the continuation of flow regime when the downstream velocity is 1 3 of the upstream velocity ragheb and ragheb 2011 however in practice the typical power coefficients of turbines are lower than betz limit because of rotating wakes finite number of blades and no zero c d value on the blades lysen 1982 as shown in fig 13 c p of vawts in megawatts is much lower than hawts especially the ones are designed at higher u r from 13 to 15 m s the size of installed vawts in practice is only limited to kilowatt scale their efficiency is not much inferior to that of hawts especially for 0 5 mw vawt rotor designed by snl which can reach approximately 41 sutherland et al 2012 in this design both thicker end sections with naca 0021 profile provides structural strength support while the thinner sand 0018 50 is used in the middle to minimise stresses and maximize captured energy ashwill 1992 sand 0018 50 is developed by snl and the last two digits 5 and 0 indicate the maximum thickness is at 50 of the blade chord from the leading edge which is positioned backward compared to the conventional naca 0018 for normal naca series the drag is higher at the lower aoas it is thus difficult to self start at the lower wind speed the benefit of sand 0018 50 is the lower drag values at lower aoas and thereby improving their self starting property however the troposkien type vawt with sand 0018 50 profile is experimentally proved to be less efficient claessens 2006 6 advanced technologies to improve power efficiency and cyclic aerodynamics the c p values of vawts are lower than that of hawts for several reasons hawts employ yaw system which controls the projected area of the rotor to be in line with the wind direction ideally all the blades harness identical kinetic energy from wind continuously and uniformly which results in a constant aerodynamic force borg and collu 2015 but for vawts only the blade in the upstream half circle can produce the positive tangential force while the other blades produce zero or negative tangential force as indicated in fig 14 a thus the output torque on the straight type vawt rotor displays cyclic behavior in accordance with the varying rotational azimuth angles the averaged efficiency of vawts is normally lower than that of hawts where every blade produces constant torque continuously abdulrazek 2012 the aerodynamic forces on working vawts highly oscillate whereas they are fairly constant on hawts in operation borg and collu 2015 as mentioned before vawt has the inherent property of cyclic output power and thrust on the vawt rotor is due to the effect of the dynamic stall as the turbine rotates fig 14 b carrigan 2012 these will excite vibration on the turbine which is prone to fatigue of blades bearing shaft etc it leads to risk of failure of vawts to produce electric power for example the turbines shown in fig 5 the cyclic property of aerodynamic loading on blades can be smoothened by using the helical type design scheurich et al 2011 this kind of turbines requires lower start up wind speeds however they exhibit a lower power output than straight type ones marsh et al 2015 alaimo et al 2015 it has been found that an evenly distributed vortices were generated along the trailing edges of the helical blades whereas the vortices were mainly accumulated at the tips of the straight blades thus helical blades could create more drag in comparison to straight blades in some rotor designs the blades of cycloturbine are proposed to be mechanically pitched to the optimized aoa relative to the wind direction and hence to produce fairly constant aerodynamic loads d ambrosio and medaglia 2010 the concept of cycloturbine is shown in fig 10 b cycloturbine with free pitching blades has been proved to be worse with a dynamic mechanism in terms of self starting and efficiency compared to the conventional pitch fixed turbine rathi 2012 but if the blade can be actively pitched to an aoa at maximum tangential force cycloturbine could have the better self starting ability and display a great improvement in lower tsr based on the dms model results cfd method also proved the possibility of performance enhancement of vawt using variable pitch angle rezaeiha et al 2017 one approach of active pitch control mechanism was introduced in the research by hwang et al 2005 four blades of the straight type vawt were connected with four pitch link bars the optimal pitch angles synchronize with the changes in wind speed and direction to diminish stall occurrence 2d numerical results show not only 30 higher power of cycloturbine than that of classical vawt but also improved cyclic tangential force on the rotor hwang et al 2007 besides the application of moulded composite blades can reduce the risk of fatigue due to the cyclic aerodynamic performance of rotor and smoothen the joints on the rotor to reduce aerodynamic loss sutherland et al 2012 fiberglass composites had been used for vawt 850 see fig 5 b price 2006 but one of blades broke within one year s operation due to a manufacturing fault the expensive tower had to be built with concrete to bear large cycling fatigue loads the composite blades of hawt have been tested and can have a lifespan of between 18 66 years and 24 years shokrieh and rafiee 2006 the study results may not be applicable to composite blades of vawt because of the different sources of cyclic loads a potential way to improve the efficiency of vawts and reduce aerodynamic fatigue load is to apply a shield to diminish the negative tangential force on the downstream blades the shield idea was first presented by shepherd 1990 schematic view of the shield concept is illustrated in fig 15 a and b this idea was numerically investigated recently and applied to the counter inner rotating cir vawts jin et al 2017 a deflector was applied in the upstream of two turbines to act as a shield the numerical results show that the deflector can improve the performance of vawts however the shield concept is applicable to the fixed wind direction this will sacrifice the advantage of omni directional characteristic of vawts in addition the cyclic behavior in power was also improved instead according to the numerical results of the rotor torque coefficient in the reference jin et al 2017 recently the shield idea is employed in a venturi or a cycloidal diffuser design hashem and mohamed 2018 as shown in fig 15 c cfd study has proved its power improvement by a factor of approximately 4 wong et al 2018 proposed the concept of a flat plate to accelerate the flow by properly positioning it in the upstream see fig 15 d the higher wind velocity from the top edge of the flat plate can benefit the power extraction and self starting capability importantly this concept doesn t influence the omni directional characteristic of vawts some different configurations were also presented and discussed by bhutta et al 2012 however all above rotors are only found to be applicable in small scale size various researchers have also paid attention to improve the efficiency of vawts by optimizing the geometry of the rotor more recently windspire vawt was designed purposely with high aspect ratio a s 5 a s l d fig 16 it was found that the turbine with low solidity σ 0 04 produces a broad flat power curve and exhibits higher maximum c p giorgetti et al 2015 this is consistent with the study by hezaveh et al 2017 it is the solidity which has the significant effect on c p instead of aspect ratio a s of vawts can be higher than 1 whereas a s 1 for hawts as discussed in paraschivoiu 2002 higher a s more power can be captured by the turbine in the condition of the same solidity and turbine diameter as shown in fig 17 paraschivoiu 2002 an increase in swept area a results in the increase in output power the lower power coefficient for vawt can also be compensated by working in a pair dabiri 2011 recently the published field test data of wind farm with the large foot print area is published on the counter rotating 1 2 kw vawts manufactured by windspire energy inc this study was done by prof dabiri from california institute of technology dabiri 2011 the test site is called the antelope valley the field laboratory for optimized wind energy flowe each turbine is 1 2 m in diameter and 4 1 m in length as shown in fig 18 a his wind farm has 9 pairs of counter rotating vawts and is configured as in fig 18 b the wind farm with these small vawts can outperform 6 9 times conventional wind farms of hawts on power density with 4d d is the turbine rotor diameter turbine spacing dabiri 2011 the counter rotating concept and wind farm arrangement take advantage of schooling fish concept as shown in fig 19 a the vortex see fig 19 b created by front fish can provide propulsion to the neighboring fish whittlesey et al 2010 likewise the turbine array arranged the way the schooling fish can improve the performance of individual ones according to another study by giorgetti et al 2015 two close arranged counter rotating vawts suppress the downstream vortex of the flow and prevent energy dissipation thus output power is enhanced by more than 10 higher than the isolated turbine the vortex suppression can also cause an increase in power for the downstream turbines because of the lack of wake interaction zanforlin and nishino 2016 prof dabiri tested counter rotating vawts of a wind farm in his testing site and concluded that each turbine can deliver 10 more power as shown in fig 20 the possible arrangements of vawts can be co rotating cr counter outer rotating cor and counter inner rotating cir where s is rotational axis distance between two rotors the numerical study presents that all three arrangements can benefit efficiency increase with s at a range of 1 5d to 3d compared with the isolated one shaheen and abdallah 2017 the averaged power coefficient increases as s reduces this is consistent with the numerical results presented by giorgetti et al 2015 the configuration of cir shows the best results in the power enhancement however these conclusions above are limited to a fixed incoming wind direction of 900 it has been proved that the aerodynamic performance of each turbine is dependent on the incoming wind speed which has investigated in a wind tunnel ahmadi baloutaki et al 2016 for fixed s 2d configurations cr and cir exhibit a power decreasing trend with the increase of wind speed among the three configurations cor exhibits strongest flow interaction in the wake which can achieve fast wake recovery about 87 of the incoming flow at downstream10d away cir vawts can reduce energy dissipation in the regime between two turbines due to the oriented same flow direction thus more kinetic energy is available to be extracted by each turbine giorgetti et al 2015 the concept of cir vawts was studied in a wind tunnel by ahmadi baloutaki et al 2016 the output power of both turbines is improved when s 2d except at the higher wind speed of 14 m s as stated in the reference the smaller spacing s in the range of 1 5d 3d the more improvement in power shaheen and abdallah 2017 numerically proved that there is 16 increase in power compared to the isolated turbine when s 1 5d giorgetti et al 2015 also numerically showed around 10 increase when s is lower than 2d 11 increase in power efficiency was obtained in another wind tunnel testing when s is between 1 5d and 2d shyu 2014 moreover the vortex shedding and turbulence induced by the rotational blades are suppressed in the arrangement of cir rotors this will enhance power output and reduce the aerodynamic load on the turbine structure for the downstream turbines bremseth and duraisamy 2016 ahmadi baloutaki et al 2016 tested the performance of turbine working in the shadow of cir vawts in the wind tunnel the output power was enhanced and the increase was mainly dependent on s and d where d is the distance of the downstream turbine to the upstream turbines as illustrated in fig 21 the highest power efficiency happens when s 1 5d and d 3d as s 2d little flow interaction was observed between two cir turbines in the experimental results by lam and peng 2017 the flow along the centerline between two turbines appears to be undisturbed and hence the downstream turbine can likely operate as in the free stream flow when 1d d 2d this is however not applicable to the turbine operating in the downstream of cor it is hard to solve it fundamentally since this inherent property is determined by the orientation of the rotational axis in summary although c p of vawts in megawatts is much lower than hawts the kilowatts ones are not much inferior for example troposkien type vawts developed by snl megawatt scale vawts are still in the conceptual stage and have a lack of practical operation data it is well known that although development of vawts started decades ago rarely there are successfully commercialized products thus it is hard to convince people about their feasibility and reliability due to their negative publicity nevertheless scientists and engineers are continuing to put their efforts on overcoming the technical challenges many innovative ideas were proposed to enhance the output power including but not limited to shielding and deflector application cycloturbine and turbines working in a pair cir vawts working in a group could potentially be a promising solution although power coefficient of isolated hawt is higher than that of isolated vawt turbines must be spaced 3d to 5d in the lateral direction and 6d to10d in the longitudinal direction in modern wind farms to achieve 90 kinetic energy recovery giorgetti et al 2015 kanner 2015 according to the study conducted by ahmadi baloutaki et al 2016 the disadvantage of lower c p of vawts can be compensated by employing cir turbine group and putting them closer to increase power density cyclic behavior in power and thrust is really a critical factor in vawt design and it directly determines turbine lifespan nearly all past failure of onshore vawt cases are related to this characteristic for example the turbines shown in fig 5 to smoothen cyclic aerodynamics the advanced state of the art technologies include employing helical blades cycloturbine applying deflector and so on however no technology demonstration has ever shown their reliability in megawatts power output composite material utilization in blades manufacturing is also recommended for future turbines 7 self starting property self starting capability of vawts is another one of the most concerned factors in the design for areas where wind speed is lower it is well known that the rotating blades can only produce positive tangential force within a certain range of the azimuth angles due to the occurrence of the stall as rapid changes of aoas arab et al 2017 this inherent characteristic is determined by the specific orientation of the rotating axis relative to the wind direction the rotors produce cyclic torque as shown in fig 14 b as a result the possibility of self starting somehow depends on the rotor s initial azimuth angles of the blade the chance of self starting is high at the blade position where the overall produced torque can overcome inertia and friction of the system external assistance to self start could be a practical solution for example a bi directional gearbox is normally used to run the generator as a motor for a brief period of time to spin the rotor sutherland et al 2012 apelfröjd et al 2016 another obstacle of self starting could be the longer rotational shaft of vawt the natural frequency caused by the torsional vibration represents the fundamental frequency due to its lowest value for both hawt and vawt design it is even more concerned for vawts if the generator is at the ground level resulting in a long drivetrain as shown in fig 22 of a 200 kw vawt apelfröjd et al 2016 three blades are attached to the hub with struts the hub is connected to the direct driven generator bridged by a long rotating steel shaft this long drivetrain suffers generator damped torsional vibrations in the rotating shaft of vawt eriksson and bernhoff 2005 its smallest eigen frequency has to be designed to be larger than the greatest rotor frequency in order to avoid vibrational resonance the eigen frequency of the torsional vibration is dependent on the generator damping it has been theoretically proved that the direct driven synchronous generator has higher eigen frequency than the induction generator with a gearbox in the condition of same shaft dimension and material the eigen frequency can be improved by the increase of the mass of the shaft if the induction generator has to be used although the ground based generator makes it easy for maintenance personnel to access and hence to reduce maintenance cost this advantage seems insufficient to justify the increased friction and inertia of the system due to the heavy load from the long shaft especially for the megawatt scale turbines as a result the torque from the rotor has to bear the long shaft to start the connected generator to rotate that means strong wind is necessary in order to generate high rotational torque even worse the long shaft will also increase the risk of fatigue on the gears and eventually increase the frequency of turbine maintenance troposkien type vawt has a short shaft connection between the rotor and the generator as shown in fig 23 because the rotor is closer to the ground however the blades have to be much longer and larger to capture prescribed power output because of the lower wind speed at the lower altitude of the wind profile this will increase the cost of manufacturing and material used however for this kind of vawts extra upper bearing is needed at the top of the rotor in order to allow the rotor to rotate freely to stabilize the top side of the rotor guy wires are used with one end anchored on the ground thus such turbine requires a large footprint area the tension in wires also causes additional downward force burdened on the base structure cheng 2016 sutherland et al 2012 the downward force will be transferred to the lower bearing mechanism which is further detrimental for self starting on the other hand one extra upper bearing will also increase the total cost of the turbine to reduce the load from the long shaft and large rotors on the bearing mechanism floating offshore vawt could be a solution the spar float can be designed to rotate together with the rotor as one body as shown in fig 24 a deepwind concept the buoyancy of the float can balance the system weight and hence the downward force on the bearing mechanism is reduced vita 2011 additionally the rotating spar allows relatively large motion for the operating turbine however in this concept it is technically challenging to put the submerged generator at the end of the spar paulsen et al 2011 the technology of rotating spar float is also applied in the floating axis wind turbine fawt concept fig 24 b the rollers and generators are arranged around the cylindrical spar surface above the sea surface and are driven by contacting the cylindrical surface of the rotating floater akimoto et al 2011 the torque from the rotating spar float will drive the rollers and generators to produce power the drivetrain system is designed to be synchronized with the pitch and heave motion of the spar float the rotor support directly comes from buoyancy forces power take off mechanism system can be designed light only the thrust forces are loaded on the bearing mechanism which is much lower than the weight of the turbine rotor the tilt of the spar is caused by the magnus effect of the current it is hereby highlighted that the strong current can also cause vortex induced motion vim especially for deeper drafter float and hence the regular lateral oscillation this is a significant challenge in terms of turbine design fatigue of structure lifespan etc researchers have carried out a number of investigation using laboratory testing or numerical computing on the aerodynamic characteristics of self starting and have tried to find feasible solutions it has been found that the turbines with thicker blade profiles perform better in self starting than the ones with thinner blades batista et al 2011 the thicker blades are able to contribute relatively high torsion to spin the rotor however the thinner blade is normally utilised in the larger scale over tens or hundreds of kilowatt scale turbines in order to reduce the mass of the turbine bansil 2014 additionally a lighter rotor reduces the inertia of the rotor and less starting torque is required naca 0012 to naca 0018 are the classical and appropriate blade profiles applied in vawts the lower mass of the turbine is less costly not only in material but also in installation and importantly results in lower moment of inertia the self starting capability is also dependent on the number of vawt blades it has been concluded that three bladed rotors are normally better than two bladed rotors in lightly loaded condition irrespective of the initial azimuth position of the blades dominy et al 2007 in the reference zamani et al 2016 the j shaped blade profile was proved numerically to perform better in self starting it produces higher torque at lower tsr than the conventional blade profile decades ago hybrid vawts had been developed which used savonius rotor to assist self starting at low wind speed while the darrieus rotor was to augment efficiency at higher wind speed shankar 1979 this arrangement combines their respective advantage of the self starting ability in savonius rotor and high efficiency in darrieus rotor there are two possible ways to arrange these hybrid rotors savonius rotor is either stacked below the darrieus rotor configuration 1 or tucked inside the darrieus rotor configuration 2 configuration 1 is more sensitive to the variation of wind speed than configuration 2 because it has shorter rotational axis wakui et al 2005 however it harnesses less wind energy due to the flow interference between the inner blades and outer blades the radius ratio of these configurations is a critical parameter to maximize the power output wakui et al 2005 jacob and chatterjee 2019 investigated configuration 2 using experiment and numerical modelling it was found that the overall produced power is the sum of power from the individual rotor the rotational speed of the whole system is dependent on the radius ratio of the two rotors however its longer rotational shaft determines its favorability in small scale power application the hybrid vawts in a few thousand watts have been commercialized and are widely popular in the urban area in this section possible solutions are explored on the self starting capability of the vawts several researchers and engineers have attempted to improve the blade profile to increase the produced torque from the blade however this improvement is found to be minimal because of the stall of the blade with varying rotational azimuth angles the self starting capability is attributed to the cyclic torque output of the turbine the heavy rotors due to the long shaft on the top of the drivetrain system are detrimental to the situation the high percentage of the power is consumed to drive the generator due to the high friction and inertia of the rotor offshore vawts could be the solution by balancing rotor weight with the buoyancy of the spar float however magnus effect and vim are another significant concerns for the spar type vawts designs and could be eliminated by deliberated design of the float 8 conclusions this paper gives a new perspective on the state of the art of vawts a comprehensive comparison was performed between vawts and hawts on the aerodynamic working principle and design tools power efficiency self starting capability yaw mechanism fatigue issues noise etc the aim of the paper is to identify the technical barriers and design challenges and to explore the feasibility of deviation from traditional hawts to vawts for the future wind turbine market like a coin has two sides although the orientation of vertical axis determinates their omnidirectional characteristic and easy accessible ground based drivetrain system it also brings a series of technical barriers such as lower c p self starting issue and cyclic aerodynamics and associated structure fatigue it is well known that lower level installed drivetrain system can reduce the height of cog of vawts and the size of the support structure which significantly benefit cost reduction for floating platforms in the offshore application it certainly alleviates the challenges of the structural design however this advantage seems insufficient to justify the increased friction and inertia of the system due to the heavy load from the long shaft or struts and hub especially for megawatt scale turbines in this review article holistic information of vawt designs is provided for both new researchers and experts to understand their technical perspectives and commercial viability an overview of lessons learned from the installed vawts in the field is presented to support the development of optimal vawts advanced technologies proposed in the latest publications are respectively reviewed in this paper in order to mitigate technical barriers in terms of power efficiency the troposkien type rotor has proved its inspiring power output techniques such as shielding and deflector ideas cycloturbine and paired cir vawts are also proposed to enhance the output power although the power coefficient of isolated hawt is higher than that of isolated vawt this disadvantage can be compensated by employing turbines in arrays and putting vawts closer to each other to increase power density the major hindrance for vawts is from cyclic aerodynamics of the rotors nearly all past failure onshore cases as shown in fig 5 are inherent results of this characteristic proposed helical type design and cycloturbine can reduce fluctuation of such periodic performance but the recently developed technologies have not been proved to feasible for megawatt scale turbines yet moreover the reinforced composite material has to be used to maximize structural strength to resist the fatigue loads to improve self starting ability combined savornius and darreus rotor could be a feasible solution but only applicable in kilowatts sized device another way is to employ an offshore spar buoy with a generator connected at the bottom of the structure the buoyancy of the spar float can balance off the heavy mass of the top rotor and support tower and downward forces to reduce system inertia for self starting in addition richer offshore wind resources can drive the vawts to self start at higher wind speeds in the present vawts have fallen far behind hawts in publicity and generating business revenues in both onshore and offshore applications in the 4th quarter of 2017 30 mw hywind scotland offshore floating hawt farm started to deliver electricity 25 km off the coast shore in scotland each turbine is rated 6 mw advanced innovative solutions are required to develop the competitive vawts in the global trend of larger turbine rotor size to reduce lcoe due to the discussed constraints of upsizing hawt vawt could be an alternative to be developed for over 10 mw in power capacity thanks to its lesser technical barriers of scaling up the offshore application poses a great potential for vawts but is still in its infancy and concept design stage nowadays in the rural or urban area the commercialized kilowatts vawts are increasingly popular partly because of their aesthetic shapes in future it is expected that kinetic sculpture combined vawts could be increasingly popular as a dual purpose public art display 
22786,in this study the impacting force on the face of porous structure is investigated by using the mesh free macroscopic model to achieve this the mesh free macroscopic approach of moving particle semi implicit method mps is redeveloped firstly a stabilization technique is used in the method to eliminate numerical noise secondly the spatial discretization operators employ a porosity based coefficient to account for the representative volume to model fluid flows in the porous media more importantly an improved numerical technique is proposed to overcome abrupt porosity change at the boundary between the porous and non porous regions the numerical model is validated by the dam breaking waves through porous blocks and flows over porous weirs in which the simulated free surface profiles are in good agreement with experimental measurements by applying the method how the porosity and mean diameter of porous materials play a role in impacting pressure and wave height for dam breaking flow through porous block is investigated it is found that the porous materials with a larger porosity or larger mean diameter are able to easily permit water penetration through the porous media while the impacting pressure at the interface and reflected wave height can be reduced keywords particle method porous weir numerical analysis dam breaking wave porosity 1 introduction engineered porous structures such as gabion weir maynord 1995 mohamed 2009 porous bed in open channel prinos et al 2003 pechlivanidis et al 2015 and coastal breakwater lin and liu 1998 huang et al 2003 lara et al 2006 khayyer et al 2008 akbari and namin 2013 are widely used in coastal or hydraulic engineering they are used to either break waves khayyer et al 2008 losada et al 2008 dissipate wave energies hsu et al 2002 or protect bridge piers yoon 2005 moreover they are structures with environmental and ecological benefits environmentally the fine chemical and organic substance can flow through the porous body to minimize sedimentation or contaminant impoundment michioku et al 2005 mohammadpour et al 2013 the violent free surface flow through the porous block could promote aeration that is capable of promoting decomposition of organic substance ecologically the porous interface is helpful in providing habitat for bacteria which could purify the water body in rivers or canals through biochemical reaction mohamed 2009 in the past decades there have been numerous experimental studies in free surface flows with the presence of porous media mohamed 2009 investigated flows over gabion weirs with different porous materials while leu et al 2008 conducted experimental measurements in velocity and turbulence for permeable weirs moreover numerical modeling is extensively applied into studying flow characteristics for porous structures in coastal engineering among numerical studies in flow through porous media macroscopic modeling is widely used to simulate the interaction between wave and porous structures liu et al 1999 wu and hsiao 2013 larese et al 2015 or steady flow over porous weirs mohammadpour et al 2013 in this method the resistance from the fixed solid skeleton of the porous media is described by linear darcy s and nonlinear forchheimer models van gent 1995 liu et al 1999 huang et al 2003 shao 2010 gui et al 2015 ren et al 2016 hence in the macroscopic approach the navier stokes equations in the porous domain are formulated by spatially averaged process liu et al 1999 ren et al 2016 both mesh based and mesh free methods are capable of solving the problems however since free surface occurs in most of the flows related to coastal or hydraulic engineering additional numerical technique such as volume of fluid vof has to be incorporated in the mesh based methods such as finite volume method fvm to accurately trace the free surface liu et al 1999 karunarathna and lin 2006 hu et al 2012 mohammadpour et al 2013 wu and hsiao 2013 higuera et al 2014 in mesh free methods the free surface can be calculated without the use of any additional numerical effort which makes them attractive and offers a promising numerical tool in simulating free surface problems monaghan 2005 koshizuka 2011 gotoh and khayyer 2016 shadloo et al 2016 the mesh free methods including smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and moving particle semi implicit method mps are widely used to simulate flows in hydraulic and coastal engineering and also with applications for flows through porous media shao 2010 akbari and namin 2013 ren et al 2016 the two mesh free methods share many similarities i they both discretize the fluid into a set of particles or points ii they can both use either pressure poisson equation ppe or equation of state to calculate the pressure field and iii the boundary conditions can be implemented in the same manner however comparing to sph the weighting function in the mps method is unnecessary to satisfy a set of strict conditions koshizuka et al 1998 lee et al 2011 another important difference in the two methods is to handle the spatial discretization in the governing equations the mps spatial operators are developed from a weighting process emphasizing the particle number density which is proportional to the fluid density while the operators in sph are derived by using the kernel function gomez gesteira et al 2010 liu and liu 2010 by using the mesh free method in simulating flows through porous media the use of the turbulence model is of a concern as pointed out by liu et al 1999 small permeability of the porous material could make the turbulence free in the porous media shao 2010 and akbari and namin 2013 neglected the turbulence in their simulations of wave interaction to porous structures ren et al 2014 2016 simulated wave motions through porous media by using the sps sub particle scale turbulence model which was re developed from the sub grid scale sgs model in les large eddy simulation shao and gotoh 2005 gotoh and sakai 2006 mohammadpour et al 2013 simulated flow over porous weirs by using different turbulence models in the fvm numerical package such as k ε turbulence model the turbulence plays a significant role for the flow evolution in some violent flows such as wave breaking also for flows over the porous weir in the open channel the turbulence model is necessary in both porous and non porous regions in the modeling in this study the sps turbulence model is also employed in both the porous and non porous regions for the simulations obviously at the boundary between non porous and porous domains porosity has an abrupt change this can result in numerical oscillation in the simulations obtaining noisy numerical results therefore another concern is to treat the porosity discontinuity at the boundary between the two regions by applying a coupling procedure at the interface huang et al 2003 the continuity of velocity and stress can be maintained which is implemented by shao 2010 to treat the interface in his sph simulation by solving the pressure poisson equation ppe to obtain the pressure field the normal stress can be balanced in the ppe that means the discontinuous porosity issue at the boundary between the two regions can be addressed in the ppe without interface treatment pahar and dhar 2016 2017 however another approach to calculate the pressure field is to use the equation of state which is also an important scheme in the mesh free numerical method as weakly compressible method for simulating incompressible fluid flows and this scheme is more convenient to be implemented in the parallel computing antuono et al 2012 if apply this weakly compressible numerical scheme into simulations the boundary between the porous and non porous regions has to be treated by using a numerical technique akbari and namin 2013 akbari 2014 ren et al 2014 2016 hence a zone with a limited length at the interface of the two regions is defined for treatment in the interface zone to make the porosity continuous a sph smoothing interpolation is used in a predefined background mesh framework akbari and namin 2013 akbari 2014 this provides a convenient way to handle the porosity discontinuity problem by using the method on the other hand due to the use of sph interpolation to calculate the porosity in the zone for smooth connection the zone could be set at least one smoothing length akbari and namin 2013 ren et al 2014 or four particle distances gui et al 2015 in their simulations in this study we use a linear interpolation to replace the sph interpolation to achieve continuous porosity connection this is able to reduce the required length of the transition zone for the interface treatment moreover in setting the length of the zone the porosity for the porous materials is taken into account since in the simulation of the porous and non porous regions the numerical resolution shows differently based on the porosity akbari and namin 2013 pahar and dhar 2016 2017 ren et al 2016 hence our interface treatment is able to make the treatment applicable to both small and larger porous materials to maintain continuous porosity transition in the numerical simulation by using the method the mps method is modified by considering porosity to model the flow in the porous media as suggested to use the apparent density to account for the volume represented by the particles inside the porous media akbari 2014 or increase representative volume by multiplying a coefficient pahar and dhar 2016 2017 the mps operators are modified to accommodate the effects from porosity compared with the work by pahar and dhar 2016 2017 the present numerical method adopts the equation of state to calculate the pressure field cheng et al 2017 xu and jin 2017 rather than the pressure poisson equation ppe meanwhile a stabilization technique xu and jin 2016 is applied in the simulations to reduce numerical noise due to the use of equation of state moreover an improved boundary treatment to deal with porosity discontinuity is proposed in this study this interface treatment is able to reduce the required length of the transition zone to achieve continuous porosity variation with the interface treatment the numerical method is applied into exploring how porosity and mean diameter of the grain of the porous materials contribute the wave height and impacting pressure after impacting the porous media physically porous structures are able to attenuate the wave height and eliminate impacting force to the structures by permitting flow penetration to the porous media thus different porous materials characterized with a variety of porosities and mean diameters could cause diverse responses to the dam breaking wave since porosity and mean diameter can both contribute to the permeability of the porous material larger permeability could be obtained by designing the porous structures with larger porosity or larger grain size of the porous material which can significantly reduce the wave height and impacting pressure to the structure the reduction in wave height and pressure will reduce the possibility of overtopping flow in the coastal areas and the use of porous structures can prevent damage by the high impacting forces the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the governing equations are described as well as the resistance force in the porous media and the mps operators the modified operators considering the porosity stabilization technique and porous and non porous interface treatment are described in section 3 the proposed interface treatment is examined and the numerical model is verified in section 4 section 5 presents the impacting pressure on the porous structure face induced by the dam breaking wave and finally with the conclusions 2 governing equations and mps discretization 2 1 governing equations the governing equations for the newtonian fluid flow inside and outside porous media have been developed by considering volume averaging liu et al 1999 hu et al 2012 pahar and dhar 2017 they are expressed in the lagrangian framework pahar and dhar 2017 as 1 d ρ d t 0 2 d u p d t φ ρ p φ g υ 2 u p 1 ρ τ f r ρ where ρ is the density t is the time p the pressure υ the kinematic viscosity g gravity force τ is the turbulence stress tensor ϕ the porosity which is equal to 1 outside porous media and less than 1 in porous media u p the velocity which is the intrinsic fluid velocity outside the porous domain and a spatially averaged velocity in the porous media as the intrinsic velocity multiplied by porosity ϕ and f r is the resistive force vector caused by fixed solid skeleton which is zero outside the porous domain the resistive force in porous media is composed of both the linear darcy and nonlinear forchheimer f c terms which are suggested as follows ghimire 2009 pahar and dhar 2017 3 f c 1 75 150 φ 3 4 k φ 2 d 50 2 α 1 φ 2 5 f r ρ υ φ 2 u k f c φ 3 u u k where k denotes the permeability of a porous medium u u p ϕ is the actual flow velocity d 50 is the mean diameter of the porous medium and α is a problem dependent coefficient in the range of 100 2000 pahar and dhar 2017 2 2 mps discretization in the moving particle semi implicit method mps the spatial differentials are represented by a set of mps models such as gradient model divergence model and laplacian model the pressure gradient model in mps is expressed as koshizuka et al 1998 shibata et al 2017 6 p i d m n 0 j i p j p ˆ i r i j 2 w i j where denotes mps operator d m is dimension of space i is the target particle and j is one of its neighboring particles and p ˆ i is the minimum value of pressure in the interaction circle for particle i in eq 6 w ij is the weighting function in mps the modeled material is represented by a set of points or particles in the calculation the method traces each particle s movement hence when calculating the flow properties of the particle i its neighboring particles have to be identified since they are able to switch information by interaction the weighting function w ij is used to determine the contributions from the neighboring particles in calculating flow properties the function commonly used in mps is written as xu and jin 2016 cheng et al 2017 7 w i j 1 r i j r e 3 r i j r e 0 r i j r e where r ij is the distance between the particle i and j r e is the search radius of the interaction circle r e 4 0d d is the particle distance in the non porous region in the circle the particles are recognized as the neighboring particle and they have interaction with particle i and the interaction for the particles outside the circle to the particle i is neglected the particle number density is introduced by using the weighting function 8 n i j i w i j in the initial condition particles are usually arranged to be symmetrical distribution in a local circle fully filled with particles in the distance of d with each other the particle number density in this condition is defined as n 0 a laplacian model is developed by xu and jin 2016 for the mps method as 10 2 ψ i d m n 0 j i ψ j ψ i r i j 2 g i j 11 g i j 3 d m 2 w i j r i j w i j r i j where ψ is a scalar for the time splitting the predictor and corrector numerical scheme is used namely the laplacian term and force term including the gravity force and resistive force are solved in the predictor to obtain the pressure field while the intermediate properties such as intermediate positions r intermediate particle number density n are calculated and the pressure gradient term is solved in the corrector to gain new velocity particles subsequently move to a new position field according to the new velocity in solving the momentum equation the mass conservation is satisfied by keeping density or particle number density constant in the predictor the pressure field is obtained from an equation of state as cheng et al 2017 12 p i ρ c 0 2 λ n i n 0 λ 1 where λ is a coefficient equal to 7 c 0 is the artificial sound speed c 0 is defined as 10 times of the maximum velocity in the problem this can ensure that the modeled incompressible fluid is weakly compressible with compressibility less than 1 monaghan 2005 in this study the sps turbulence model is used in the mps method to simulate the turbulence in the flows and this model has been successfully applied into calculating turbulence in fishway flow xu and jin 2014 flow over weirs xu and jin 2017 hydraulic jump cheng et al 2017 and other flows shao and gotoh 2005 gotoh and khayyer 2016 gotoh and sakai 2006 ren et al 2016 the boundary conditions for the free surface and solid wall are implemented according to previous studies by using the mps method koshizuka et al 1998 shao and gotoh 2005 gotoh and sakai 2006 khayyer et al 2008 a free surface particle is identified by its intermediate particle number density when it is less than a threshold while the solid boundary is implemented by using both solid and ghost particles koshizuka et al 1998 3 mps model modification incorporating porosity the mps models such as the pressure gradient model and laplacian model are modified by considering porosity of the porous media 3 1 porosity modification to mps in modeling flows through porous media by the macroscopic approach the volume that a particle represents respectively in the porous and non porous domains displays a difference if a constant particle distance d is used in the discretization taking a two dimensional flow as an example the representative volume for a particle is d d in the non porous domain as we assume the particle occupies the space of rectangular while it changes to d d ϕ in the porous media due to the macroscopic simulation thus when the particles with the particle distance d enter to the porous domain the particle distance varies to d ϕ 0 5 because of this an apparent density is used in the sph modeling to alter the volume a particle represents in the porous domain akbari 2014 pahar and dhar 2016 2017 similarly introduced a porosity based coefficient to the models in their mesh free method with consideration of volume change the particle number density in the mps method can be modified by taking the porosity of the porous materials into account as pahar and dhar 2017 13 n i j i w i j φ j where ϕ j is the porosity taking by the neighboring particle j ϕ j has no effect in the calculation of particle number density in the non porous phase as ϕ j 1 0 when the particle j is in the non porous domain eq 13 becomes eq 8 this interpolation is also applicable to the following modified equations by using the porosity the pressure gradient model then becomes 14 p i d m n 0 j i p j p ˆ i φ j r i j 2 w i j where w ij is calculated by using eq 13 n 0 remains constant in the entire simulation which is calculated from the initial condition when the particles are evenly distributed with a constant distance d the laplacian model eq 10 is expressed as follows by considering the porosity 15 2 ψ i d m n 0 j i ψ j ψ i φ j r i j 2 g i j since the equation of state is a function of the particle number density if the calculation of the particle number density is based on eq 13 the form of the equation of state does not need to be changed and is still expressed by eq 12 it should be noted that the particles in the calculation moves according to the actual velocity rather than the darcy velocity in the porous media hence in the predictor in the numerical scheme the intermediate and the new time step particle positions r i r i m 1 are updated respectively as 16 r i r i m δ t u p i m φ i 17 r i m 1 r i m δ t u p i m 1 φ i where m denotes the previous time step m 1 is the new time step and δt is the time step size in regards to the time step it satisfies the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criteria as in previous studies ren et al 2016 3 2 a stabilization technique due to the use of equation of state to obtain the pressure field the modeled incompressible fluid is treated as weakly compressible this could result in a noisy pressure field a stabilization technique in the mps method is proposed by xu and jin 2016 which is adopted in this study to eliminate the pressure noise in the simulations however when using the technique in the flows with porous media a porosity based coefficient is introduced in the technique as 18 δ u i δ r i n 0 j i u i j m 1 φ j w i j r i j 19 u i n e w m 1 u i m 1 δ u i a modified velocity is imposed to the velocity field u m 1 calculated from the corrector in the numerical scheme in obtaining a new velocity field u new m 1 δr i 0 01d is implemented in the simulations 3 3 porous and non porous interface treatment since the modeling is based on the macroscopic approach the fixed solid skeleton is not set up but instead the resistant forces are used to represent effects from the solid skeleton in this sense the fluid particles in the simulation entering and exiting the porous domain will not encounter any solid however when fluid particles cross the interface either to the porous media or to the non porous domain the porosity can emerge with variations this could lead to a non smooth transition when the flow passes through the interface as numerical oscillations in some studies de lemos and pedras 2001 shao 2010 a matching condition for the velocity and shear stress has to be defined at the interface to achieve smooth flow transition by using the mesh free method pahar and dhar 2016 2017 an averaging technique for the effective porosity around the interface is used to overcome the porosity discontinuity in this study a zone with limited length is set up at the interface to achieve a continuous porosity connection this technique is also used in previous studies akbari and namin 2013 akbari 2014 ren et al 2014 to obtain continuous porosity connection the porosity in the zone is usually calculated by using the averaging or smoothing procedure so that the length of the zone has to be at least one smoothing length in the simulations akbari and namin 2013 ren et al 2014 however in the present study a linear function based on the particle s distance to the boundary is used to achieve continuous porosity change at the interface this can reduce the required length of the zone being less than half of one smoothing length in the case of the porosity ϕ 0 5 for the porous material in the simulations the numerical resolution is characterized differently in the porous and non porous regions ren et al 2016 the particle distance is d in the non porous region while it changes to d ϕ 0 5 in the porous region thus our interface treatment takes the porosity in the porous region into account making it applicable both to the small and large porosity cases besides the search radius in the method significantly determines the accuracy of the spatial discretization models which should be considered in the treatment to set up the zone therefore in the proposed interface treatment the length of the zone l is related to both the search radius and porosity as r e ϕ 0 5 it has to be pointed out that the transition length of the zone is used according to the mean diameter of the grains in the porous region in some studies akbari 2014 ren et al 2016 this can satisfy the physical aspect for modeling the porous materials however if a type of the larger mean diameter material is equipped in the porous region which is common in engineering a very large transition zone has to be set for the interface treatment this can result in underestimation of the free surface at the interface the improved zone set up technique is shown in fig 1 we assume that the porosity in the zone is solely determined by its distance to the interface d z in the zone the porosity is calculated by a linear relationship as ϕ δϕ d z l making the porosity less than 1 0 and larger than ϕ in this manner the porosity is able to be linearly varied in the zone so that numerical oscillation can be eliminated we will examine sensitivity from the length of the transition zone by using a numerical example in section 4 4 model validation in this section effects from length of the transition zone and numerical convergence are examined 4 1 sensitivity from the zone length of the proposed interface treatment since there is a sudden change in porosity between the porous and non porous regions without proper treatment in the numerical method the flow through the porous media will undergo oscillations resulting in unstable simulation results to ensure a smooth transition for the flow in the simulations we proposed an interface treatment described in section 3 3 with the length related to the porosity ϕ and the numerical parameter of the search radius r e as the form of r e ϕ 0 5 to examine its sensitivity the simulations for a dam breaking flow through the porous media are conducting by implementing the lengths of l 0 25r e ϕ 0 5 0 5r e ϕ 0 5 0 75r e ϕ 0 5 and r e ϕ 0 5 in which α 1000 in calculating the resistive force by using eq 4 it should be noted that a small porosity value of 0 1 for the porous media is selected in the simulation to show that the proposed interface treatment is able to handle a big porosity difference this value is much smaller than the typical porosity value 0 25 for the porous material in most civil engineering problems fig 2 shows the flow characteristics through a porous block with different lengths of the transition zone in which the porosity of the porous material is set to be 0 1 in fig 2 the particles with red color are big pressure compare to neighboring particles that can be classified as particles with pressure noises the transition length of l 0 25r e ϕ 0 5 is able to calculate good results although some pressure noise is observed due to the use of equation of state the flow crosses to the porous region without jumps when l 0 5r e ϕ 0 5 is used in the simulation the pressure noise becomes less if l increases to 0 75r e ϕ 0 5 or even r e ϕ 0 5 the pressure noise disappears in the figure however if a much longer transition zone is used it can cause underestimation for the free surface elevation generally in the examination l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 can be used to obtain good results in order to further examine the effects from the transition length l another dam breaking flow through porous block is simulated by using the different lengths of l 0 25r e ϕ 0 5 0 75r e ϕ 0 5 r e ϕ 0 5 1 25r e ϕ 0 5 and 2 0r e ϕ 0 5 in which α 1000 by using eq 4 this dam breaking flow is different from the previous dam breaking flow as there is a thin layer of water downstream of the break moreover the free surface for the flow through the porous block is measured by lin 1998 and we are able to compare the numerical results of the different transition lengths with the experimental measurements initially a water column with height 0 25 m and width 0 28 m is equipped at the left side of the channel the depth for downstream water through the porous media is 0 02 m the porous block is placed in the middle of the channel with a distance of 0 02 m to the left water column the porosity is 0 49 and equivalent mean diameter of the porous material d 50 0 0159 m the diagram of the flow is shown in fig 3 fig 4 illustrates the free surface variation with time at the center section of the porous block with the position x 0 445 m simulated by using different transition lengths the measured free surface elevations lin 1998 liu et al 1999 are also included in the figure for comparison the figure also presents isph numerical result akbari and namin 2013 and the numerical result simulated by vof volume of fluid liu et al 1999 the transition length l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 is able to calculate similar free surface variations at the section which are close to experimental measurements especially for the period t 0 5 s 1 0 s for l 1 25 r e ϕ 0 5 the height of the simulated free surface at t 0 3 s 1 0 s is increased and the increase for l 2 0 r e ϕ 0 5 is more profound approaching the isph results this is because isph also uses a larger transient length as nearly 4 times of the smoothing length akbari and namin 2013 after t 1 0 s the water surface at this section almost overlaps for the lengths l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 but there is a clear deviation for the result simulated by using l 2 0 r e ϕ 0 5 even compared with the experimental measurements to calculate the free surface profiles the transition length l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 is able to capture good results when compared to the experimental measurements 4 2 comparison with experiment and numerical convergence to simulate the flow shown in fig 3 the particle distances of d 0 005 m 0 0025 m and 0 00125 m are used for numerical convergence analysis and α 1000 when using eq 4 to calculate the resistive force fig 5 illustrates the free surface profiles for the dam breaking flow through the porous media at different time steps from t 0 0 2 2 s for the particle distance d 0 005 m with the comparison to the experimental results lin 1998 liu et al 1999 the simulated flow pattern for the flow by using the proposed method is also illustrated in the figure the water column collapses and flows towards to the region of the porous media the flow slows down when it reaches the porous media due to the barrier from the porous media the water level rises as illustrated at t 0 04 s subsequently more water flows through the porous block and the flow approaches to the other side of the channel resulting in a decrease of water level elevation in the porous block as illustrated at t 0 06 s and 0 08 s the flow then impacts on the end wall of the simulated domain causing a reverse wave when the backward wave encounters the porous block it collides with the forward moving flow during the interaction at the interface water penetrates back into the porous block the free surface profiles in the simulation show a good agreement with the experimental measurements in fig 5 compared with the numerical result by manuel del jesus et al 2012 although there are some discrepancies from the wave front in the beginning of the flow such as t 0 2 s and 0 4 s in fig 5 a good agreement between them can be observed from t 0 6 s 2 2 s it suggests that the proposed numerical model is able to capture the free surface in the porous media and reflect the interaction of flow between the porous and non porous regions it should be noted that the free surface profiles in the simulation show some discrepancies with the experimental measurements which is particularly obvious at the early stages of the flow such as at t 0 2 s and 0 4 s there could be two reasons explained in the following in the present simulation the effect of the porous media is represented by linear darcy and nonlinear forchheimer f c terms incorporated in the governing equations this approximation to denote the porous media could lead to the discrepancy for the free surface in the comparison on the other hand in the experimental measurements the gate initially holding the left water column is opened manually within 0 1 s liu et al 1999 which could partially cause some discrepancies especially at the initial stages of the flow however this discrepancy is minimized with increasing time step the free surface variation is further examined at section i x 0 445 m by using different numerical resolutions fig 6 it also includes the experimental measurement lin 1998 isph numerical results akbari and namin 2013 and a numerical simulation by vof volume of fluid liu et al 1999 for comparison purposes the present method with different numerical resolutions is able to calculate similar free surface profiles at the section as the time increases by using different particle distances d the simulated free surface profiles show slight difference especially for t 0 5 s however a good numerical convergence is observed in the figure for t 0 5 s while with a finer particle distance such as d 0 0025 m and 0 00125 m the free surface is much more comparable to the experimental results as opposed to d 0 005 m 4 3 flow over the porous weir the mesh free macroscopic method is used to simulate the flow over the porous weir fig 7 illustrates the schematic diagram of the simulated flow conditions over the porous weirs the porous weir is 0 2 m wide l 0 2 m and 0 2 m high p 0 2 m with different porosity and mean diameter materials locating in an open channel in the simulations the water discharge is set to be constant which is similar to the experimental conditions by mohamed 2009 the downstream water depth is controlled by the tailgate we simulated three porous weirs with different material properties solid weir porous weir i ϕ 0 4 d 50 0 0028 m and porous weir ii ϕ 0 49 d 50 0 007 m in simulating the flows we investigated the free surface that is affected by different porous weirs for the open boundary condition the particles are injected to the simulation domain according the inflow velocity and they are removed when they arrive at the end of the domain more details on the boundary condition can be found in the studies by xu and jin 2014 and cheng et al 2017 fig 8 shows the free surface profiles with the flow over different porous weirs including the experimental measurements mohamed 2009 and numerical results simulated by finite volume method fvm mohammadpour et al 2013 the numerical results from the present method have a good agreement with the experimental and fvm results for the flows over the porous weirs 5 impacting force on the porous structural face the macroscopic simulation method with the proposed interface treatment is then applied to investigate the impacting force to the face of the porous media from a dam break flow in most civil engineering problems the porosity for the porous materials is larger than 0 25 hence the simulations are conducted by varying the porosity in the range ϕ 0 25 1 0 to examine the impacting pressure on porous material interface caused by the dam breaking wave 5 1 impact investigation by dam breaking flow in the presence of porous media the diagram of the dam breaking flow is shown in fig 9 in which a solid wall fig 9a and porous media wall fig 9b are respectively set up the solid wall at x 1 61 m in fig 9a indicates that the flow is completely reflected by the wall without any water penetration to the right side the porous media wall at x 1 61 m shown in fig 9b means that the domain for x 1 61 m is filled with porous material and the section of x 1 61 m is the interface between non porous and porous regions a water column with height h 0 30 m and length l 0 60 m is initially held at the left side of the channel by a gate after removal of the gate at t 0 00 s a dam breaking wave is generated propagating to the right side of the solid wall or porous media wall as the water collides with the right side wall the impacting force from the dam breaking flow exerts and the impacting pressure is monitored at several points on the wall respectively at the height of h 0 003 m 0 15 m and 0 03 m as shown in the figure the impacting pressure on the face of the porous media caused by the dam breaking wave are investigated and compared to the impacting pressure to the solid face which is measured by lobovský et al 2014 the impacting pressure is supposed to be affected by the properties of the porous media such as porosity and mean diameter of the material the simulations by the proposed method are conducted by varying the two properties for the porous media equipped at the domain x 1 61 m to investigate their effects to the impacting pressure on the face at x 1 61 m fig 10 shows the dam breaking flow pattern hitting the porous media block in which porosity for the porous material in the region x 1 61 m is ϕ 0 25 and mean diameter is d 50 0 0028 m at around t 0 45 s the dam breaking wave encounters the right porous media wall the flowing water is able to penetrate into the porous domain which is different from the solid wall for the solid wall all the water body is reflected at x 1 61 m producing a reverse wave in the case with the porous domain at x 1 61 m water penetration occurs at t 0 60 s at t 1 8 s we observe more water crossing the interface between the non porous and porous domains at x 1 61 m despite of the water penetration a reverse wave is also observed at t 0 6 s the reflected water body by the porous wall then moves backward to the left during the movement of the backward wave a void as a circle in the figure is observed at t 1 0 s and 1 1 s the reversed wave affected by the porous media wall is able to generate a train of ripples in the simulation such as t 1 5 s later the ripples are submerged by the running wave at t 1 8 s by observing the flow phenomenon the porous media with the domain of x 1 61 m play a significant role in the dam breaking wave propagation it should be noted that the low value for the porosity is 0 25 as the porous material of sand or gravel in most of the civil engineering problems in the range of porosityϕ 0 25 1 0 the forchheimer model is valid to calculate the turbulence in the porous media bear 2013 in this sense more simulations are conducted by varying the porosity bounded in the range of ϕ 0 25 1 0 for the porous media at x 1 61 m with keeping the mean diameter constant as d 50 0 0028 m the impacting pressure at the interface at x 1 61 m is plotted comparing to the impacting pressure on the solid wall at x 1 61 m the impacting pressure histories with different porosities on the wall are shown at the points with heights h 0 003 m fig 11 a 0 015 m figs 11b and 0 03 m fig 11c also including the measured pressure from experiments by lobovský et al 2014 when the wall is solid in the figure the pressure fluctuates when hitting the wall regardless of porous wall or solid wall the obvious fluctuations occur at t h g 0 5 2 46 as a peak pressure for all the walls with different porosities however for larger porosity wall such as ϕ 0 5 it is able to clearly reduce the fluctuating peak pressure caused by the impinging dam breaking wave which occurs at the points with the height h 0 003 m figs 11a and 0 015 m fig 11b with the evolution of the flow the fluctuation of the pressure gradually becomes weak at the three points to t h g 0 5 5 89 the second pressure peak is observed for the cases with different porous walls and this pressure peak is also measured by the experiments for a solid wall without any porous media from the figure the use of the porous media wall can effectively reduce the second pressure peak value at the three monitored points for instance at the point h 0 03 m p ρgh 1 36 for solid wall p ρgh 1 24 and 1 01 respectively for the wall with porosity ϕ 0 25 and 0 5 afterwards the pressure is decreasing as shown in the figure the dam breaking wave propagation can be affected by the porous media at the right side with different porosities which is particularly profound for the second pressure wave shown in fig 11 we also examined the free surface variations at the two sections x 0 865 m and 1 3625 m marked as sections h1 and h2 fig 12 a and b for the solid wall the free surface elevation at the two sections is measured by lobovský et al 2014 in fig 12 the numerical method is able to reproduce the free surface variations when the right wall at x 1 61 m is solid it has to be pointed out that the free surface evolution after t h g 0 5 5 26 has a discrepancy between the experimental measurements and numerical results for the solid wall in fig 12b this is caused by the three dimensional flow feature after the water hitting the wall causing a strong splash resulting in water drops occurring in the experiments lobovský et al 2014 in the numerical modeling we treated the flow as two dimensional without considering these complex flow phenomena including air entrainment at section h1 fig 12a the porosity of the porous media wall shows no effect to the free surface evolution for the period t h g 0 5 0 0 7 0 as all the surface profiles from different porosity walls are identical the free surface profiles are also very similar for the period t h g 0 5 2 0 5 39 at section h2 fig 12b since the flow does not arrive at the porous media wall in this period and still propagates in the non porous domain however at t h g 0 5 5 39 after the dam breaking wave impinges against the solid or porous media wall the porosity affects the free surface variations the free surface elevation is obviously lower for a larger porosity wall such as ϕ 0 5 fig 12b this is because the running water can easily penetrate into the porous media decreasing the free surface height of the reflected water wave to clearly address the effects from the porosity for the porous material at the right side at x 1 61 m the dam breaking flow patterns at t 1 1 s with different porosity walls are shown in fig 13 in the simulations the mean diameter of the porous material is used as a constant value d 50 0 0028 m while the porosity varies as ϕ 0 0 solid wall figs 13a 0 25 fig 13b and 0 5 fig 13c in terms of a specific mean diameter of the porous media the porosity is able to affect the penetrated water body as a larger porosity such as ϕ 0 5 fig 13c makes it easier to allow water penetration to the porous material hence a larger body of water can be observed for the porosity ϕ 0 5 in fig 13c on the other hand when ϕ 0 25 the penetrated water becomes less fig 13b the simulated results correspond to the understanding that the penetration of water into the porous media which is dependent on the porosity when the mean diameter is constant meanwhile the reflected wave is also affected as larger void is observed for the larger porosity wall ϕ 0 5 in fig 13c while this void area is very small for the reflected wave if the wall is solid in fig 13a however the flow pattern could be different if the mean diameter of the porous material changes because it can affect the permeability of the porous material thus we then investigated the effects from the mean diameter in the flow fig 14 shows the flow patterns for d 50 0 06 m when ϕ 0 5 in which the mean diameter is set to be greater than the simulations in figs 10 and 13 d 50 0 0028 m the simulated results show a big difference in the flow pattern for a larger d 50 the dam breaking flow can easily pass through the porous media wall when the porosity remains constant in the simulations even at t 0 6 s the running water already passes through the porous material forming a reflected wave in the porous domain due to more water penetration the reflected wave is able to move backwards and cross the interface again to the non porous domain after the repeated water penetration across the non porous and porous interface the reflected wave becomes much weaker compared to the flow pattern in figs 10 and 13 moreover more water accumulates at the right side of the wall in the porous domain and propagates forwards until t 1 9 s the water in the porous domain moves to an extended distance this flow phenomenon especially for the flow characteristics in the porous media is attributed to the larger mean diameter used in the simulation to further understand the function of d 50 in the flow through porous media when using the macroscopic modeling different mean diameters for the porous material are used in the simulations as d 50 0 0028 m 0 01 m 0 06 m and 0 12 m while the porosity of the porous media is kept constant as ϕ 0 5 the flow patterns by using different d 50 at t 1 0 s are shown in fig 15 it is clear that the flow is significantly affected by the mean diameter d 50 for a small d 50 the flow does not easily pass through interface to the porous domain with only a fraction of water body observed when d 50 0 0028 m as illustrated in fig 15a however when the mean diameter increases penetration of water to the porous domain becomes much more profound such as in the cases of d 50 0 06 m figs 15c and 0 12 m fig 15d in the meantime the reflected wave becomes weak behaving as a reduced wave height and wave propagating length due to water penetration to the porous domain particularly obvious in fig 15d in the simulations the mean diameter d 50 plays a significant role in the dam breaking flow through porous media the impacting pressure on the interface between non porous and porous regions could also be affected by using different mean diameter for the porous materials for x 1 61 m we then examined the pressure time history at the three points of different heights as h 0 003 m 0 015 m and 0 03 m as shown in fig 16 a c a larger value of the mean diameter can greatly reduce the fluctuations of the pressure and the peak value of the pressure at the three points for example when d 50 0 06 m the peak pressure p ρgh for the first wave when the dam breaking reaches the interface reduces from larger than 4 0 solid wall to 0 75 at the point h 0 003 m as in fig 16a more importantly the first peak pressure is delayed by using the larger d 50 0 06 m as compared with the solid wall at both points with heights h 0 015 m figs 16b and 0 03 m fig 16c it is delayed to almost t h g 0 5 3 0 for the first pressure peak value compared with t h g 0 5 2 4 for the solid wall for the point h 0 03 m fig 16c overall the parameters of porosity and mean diameter are able to have an effect on the flow pattern in the flow through porous media and impacting pressure on the interface a larger porosity or a larger mean diameter d 50 can easily permit more running water passing into the porous media the impacting pressure on the interface of the porous media can be reduced by larger value of porosity or mean diameter of the grains 6 conclusions in this study a macroscopic mesh free method is used to investigate the flow affected by porous materials in the numerical method the spatial discretization models in the moving particle semi implicit method mps is modified by considering the porosity of the porous material in which a porosity based coefficient is introduced in this way the representative volume by a fluid particle is increased to d d ϕ in the porous domain compared to the volume d d in the non porous domain to eliminate the noisy pressure field due to the use of the equation of state a stabilization technique is implemented in the numerical method moreover an improved interface treatment for the discontinuous porosity issue is proposed in the treatment a transition zone is set up to achieve continuous porosity change at the interface moreover the setting of the transition length is related to the porosity this is able to achieve a smooth flow transition in the case of not only small porosity difference but also large porosity difference at the interface more importantly the continuous change for the porosity in the zone is achieved by using a linear relationship in which the calculated porosity in the zone is only determined by the particles distance to the boundary compared with the sph interpolation in the zone to obtain the porosity continuity the transition length can be shorter as l 0 25r e ϕ 0 5 that is less than half the required length in the previous studies and able to obtain good results when compared to the experimental measurements in the present study the technique is then used to simulate a dam breaking wave through porous media and different lengths of the zone are examined it is found that the length l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 is able to calculate good results the method with the interface treatment is applied to simulate a dam breaking wave through a porous block in which the sps turbulence model is also employed in the simulation the simulated free surface profiles have a good agreement with experimental measurements in literature and the method has a good numerical convergence by investigating different numerical resolutions subsequently the impacting pressure on the interface between non porous and porous regions is investigated by the numerical method both the porosity and grain size of porous materials can affect the impacting pressure and flow penetration to the porous media since both of them can contribute to the permeability of porous media the impacting pressure is able to be reduced greatly by using larger porosity materials or larger grain size for the porous block which also permits penetration of a larger body of water in the porous media besides the height of the dam breaking wave can also be reduced by using porous blocks compared with solid walls in the simulation of flow over porous weirs with different porosities and grain size materials the free surface profiles have a good agreement with experimental measurements in the simulations we found that the use of larger porosity materials or larger grain size to construct the porous block is able to reduce impacting pressure and wave height the findings are helpful for designing the porous structures from damage due to high impacting force besides to attenuate the wave height to prevent overtopping for the waves in the coastal region the porous structures with a larger porosity or larger gravel could be effective based on the study the proposed method in this study is able to be used to study flow interactions between porous and non porous phases it can reproduce the flow characteristics such as free surface wave elevation and impacting pressure it could be a promising numerical tool to aid structural designs in coastal or hydraulic engineering the method can be easily extended to simulate 3d flows through porous media when modeling 3d problems the dimension of space in the spatial operators such as gradient model and laplacian model is equal to d m 3 in both 2d and 3d problems the method is good at capturing the free surface without introducing extra numerical techniques however the computational cost could be high when simulating 3d problems due to involving a large number of particles acknowledgement we acknowledge the

22786,in this study the impacting force on the face of porous structure is investigated by using the mesh free macroscopic model to achieve this the mesh free macroscopic approach of moving particle semi implicit method mps is redeveloped firstly a stabilization technique is used in the method to eliminate numerical noise secondly the spatial discretization operators employ a porosity based coefficient to account for the representative volume to model fluid flows in the porous media more importantly an improved numerical technique is proposed to overcome abrupt porosity change at the boundary between the porous and non porous regions the numerical model is validated by the dam breaking waves through porous blocks and flows over porous weirs in which the simulated free surface profiles are in good agreement with experimental measurements by applying the method how the porosity and mean diameter of porous materials play a role in impacting pressure and wave height for dam breaking flow through porous block is investigated it is found that the porous materials with a larger porosity or larger mean diameter are able to easily permit water penetration through the porous media while the impacting pressure at the interface and reflected wave height can be reduced keywords particle method porous weir numerical analysis dam breaking wave porosity 1 introduction engineered porous structures such as gabion weir maynord 1995 mohamed 2009 porous bed in open channel prinos et al 2003 pechlivanidis et al 2015 and coastal breakwater lin and liu 1998 huang et al 2003 lara et al 2006 khayyer et al 2008 akbari and namin 2013 are widely used in coastal or hydraulic engineering they are used to either break waves khayyer et al 2008 losada et al 2008 dissipate wave energies hsu et al 2002 or protect bridge piers yoon 2005 moreover they are structures with environmental and ecological benefits environmentally the fine chemical and organic substance can flow through the porous body to minimize sedimentation or contaminant impoundment michioku et al 2005 mohammadpour et al 2013 the violent free surface flow through the porous block could promote aeration that is capable of promoting decomposition of organic substance ecologically the porous interface is helpful in providing habitat for bacteria which could purify the water body in rivers or canals through biochemical reaction mohamed 2009 in the past decades there have been numerous experimental studies in free surface flows with the presence of porous media mohamed 2009 investigated flows over gabion weirs with different porous materials while leu et al 2008 conducted experimental measurements in velocity and turbulence for permeable weirs moreover numerical modeling is extensively applied into studying flow characteristics for porous structures in coastal engineering among numerical studies in flow through porous media macroscopic modeling is widely used to simulate the interaction between wave and porous structures liu et al 1999 wu and hsiao 2013 larese et al 2015 or steady flow over porous weirs mohammadpour et al 2013 in this method the resistance from the fixed solid skeleton of the porous media is described by linear darcy s and nonlinear forchheimer models van gent 1995 liu et al 1999 huang et al 2003 shao 2010 gui et al 2015 ren et al 2016 hence in the macroscopic approach the navier stokes equations in the porous domain are formulated by spatially averaged process liu et al 1999 ren et al 2016 both mesh based and mesh free methods are capable of solving the problems however since free surface occurs in most of the flows related to coastal or hydraulic engineering additional numerical technique such as volume of fluid vof has to be incorporated in the mesh based methods such as finite volume method fvm to accurately trace the free surface liu et al 1999 karunarathna and lin 2006 hu et al 2012 mohammadpour et al 2013 wu and hsiao 2013 higuera et al 2014 in mesh free methods the free surface can be calculated without the use of any additional numerical effort which makes them attractive and offers a promising numerical tool in simulating free surface problems monaghan 2005 koshizuka 2011 gotoh and khayyer 2016 shadloo et al 2016 the mesh free methods including smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and moving particle semi implicit method mps are widely used to simulate flows in hydraulic and coastal engineering and also with applications for flows through porous media shao 2010 akbari and namin 2013 ren et al 2016 the two mesh free methods share many similarities i they both discretize the fluid into a set of particles or points ii they can both use either pressure poisson equation ppe or equation of state to calculate the pressure field and iii the boundary conditions can be implemented in the same manner however comparing to sph the weighting function in the mps method is unnecessary to satisfy a set of strict conditions koshizuka et al 1998 lee et al 2011 another important difference in the two methods is to handle the spatial discretization in the governing equations the mps spatial operators are developed from a weighting process emphasizing the particle number density which is proportional to the fluid density while the operators in sph are derived by using the kernel function gomez gesteira et al 2010 liu and liu 2010 by using the mesh free method in simulating flows through porous media the use of the turbulence model is of a concern as pointed out by liu et al 1999 small permeability of the porous material could make the turbulence free in the porous media shao 2010 and akbari and namin 2013 neglected the turbulence in their simulations of wave interaction to porous structures ren et al 2014 2016 simulated wave motions through porous media by using the sps sub particle scale turbulence model which was re developed from the sub grid scale sgs model in les large eddy simulation shao and gotoh 2005 gotoh and sakai 2006 mohammadpour et al 2013 simulated flow over porous weirs by using different turbulence models in the fvm numerical package such as k ε turbulence model the turbulence plays a significant role for the flow evolution in some violent flows such as wave breaking also for flows over the porous weir in the open channel the turbulence model is necessary in both porous and non porous regions in the modeling in this study the sps turbulence model is also employed in both the porous and non porous regions for the simulations obviously at the boundary between non porous and porous domains porosity has an abrupt change this can result in numerical oscillation in the simulations obtaining noisy numerical results therefore another concern is to treat the porosity discontinuity at the boundary between the two regions by applying a coupling procedure at the interface huang et al 2003 the continuity of velocity and stress can be maintained which is implemented by shao 2010 to treat the interface in his sph simulation by solving the pressure poisson equation ppe to obtain the pressure field the normal stress can be balanced in the ppe that means the discontinuous porosity issue at the boundary between the two regions can be addressed in the ppe without interface treatment pahar and dhar 2016 2017 however another approach to calculate the pressure field is to use the equation of state which is also an important scheme in the mesh free numerical method as weakly compressible method for simulating incompressible fluid flows and this scheme is more convenient to be implemented in the parallel computing antuono et al 2012 if apply this weakly compressible numerical scheme into simulations the boundary between the porous and non porous regions has to be treated by using a numerical technique akbari and namin 2013 akbari 2014 ren et al 2014 2016 hence a zone with a limited length at the interface of the two regions is defined for treatment in the interface zone to make the porosity continuous a sph smoothing interpolation is used in a predefined background mesh framework akbari and namin 2013 akbari 2014 this provides a convenient way to handle the porosity discontinuity problem by using the method on the other hand due to the use of sph interpolation to calculate the porosity in the zone for smooth connection the zone could be set at least one smoothing length akbari and namin 2013 ren et al 2014 or four particle distances gui et al 2015 in their simulations in this study we use a linear interpolation to replace the sph interpolation to achieve continuous porosity connection this is able to reduce the required length of the transition zone for the interface treatment moreover in setting the length of the zone the porosity for the porous materials is taken into account since in the simulation of the porous and non porous regions the numerical resolution shows differently based on the porosity akbari and namin 2013 pahar and dhar 2016 2017 ren et al 2016 hence our interface treatment is able to make the treatment applicable to both small and larger porous materials to maintain continuous porosity transition in the numerical simulation by using the method the mps method is modified by considering porosity to model the flow in the porous media as suggested to use the apparent density to account for the volume represented by the particles inside the porous media akbari 2014 or increase representative volume by multiplying a coefficient pahar and dhar 2016 2017 the mps operators are modified to accommodate the effects from porosity compared with the work by pahar and dhar 2016 2017 the present numerical method adopts the equation of state to calculate the pressure field cheng et al 2017 xu and jin 2017 rather than the pressure poisson equation ppe meanwhile a stabilization technique xu and jin 2016 is applied in the simulations to reduce numerical noise due to the use of equation of state moreover an improved boundary treatment to deal with porosity discontinuity is proposed in this study this interface treatment is able to reduce the required length of the transition zone to achieve continuous porosity variation with the interface treatment the numerical method is applied into exploring how porosity and mean diameter of the grain of the porous materials contribute the wave height and impacting pressure after impacting the porous media physically porous structures are able to attenuate the wave height and eliminate impacting force to the structures by permitting flow penetration to the porous media thus different porous materials characterized with a variety of porosities and mean diameters could cause diverse responses to the dam breaking wave since porosity and mean diameter can both contribute to the permeability of the porous material larger permeability could be obtained by designing the porous structures with larger porosity or larger grain size of the porous material which can significantly reduce the wave height and impacting pressure to the structure the reduction in wave height and pressure will reduce the possibility of overtopping flow in the coastal areas and the use of porous structures can prevent damage by the high impacting forces the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the governing equations are described as well as the resistance force in the porous media and the mps operators the modified operators considering the porosity stabilization technique and porous and non porous interface treatment are described in section 3 the proposed interface treatment is examined and the numerical model is verified in section 4 section 5 presents the impacting pressure on the porous structure face induced by the dam breaking wave and finally with the conclusions 2 governing equations and mps discretization 2 1 governing equations the governing equations for the newtonian fluid flow inside and outside porous media have been developed by considering volume averaging liu et al 1999 hu et al 2012 pahar and dhar 2017 they are expressed in the lagrangian framework pahar and dhar 2017 as 1 d ρ d t 0 2 d u p d t φ ρ p φ g υ 2 u p 1 ρ τ f r ρ where ρ is the density t is the time p the pressure υ the kinematic viscosity g gravity force τ is the turbulence stress tensor ϕ the porosity which is equal to 1 outside porous media and less than 1 in porous media u p the velocity which is the intrinsic fluid velocity outside the porous domain and a spatially averaged velocity in the porous media as the intrinsic velocity multiplied by porosity ϕ and f r is the resistive force vector caused by fixed solid skeleton which is zero outside the porous domain the resistive force in porous media is composed of both the linear darcy and nonlinear forchheimer f c terms which are suggested as follows ghimire 2009 pahar and dhar 2017 3 f c 1 75 150 φ 3 4 k φ 2 d 50 2 α 1 φ 2 5 f r ρ υ φ 2 u k f c φ 3 u u k where k denotes the permeability of a porous medium u u p ϕ is the actual flow velocity d 50 is the mean diameter of the porous medium and α is a problem dependent coefficient in the range of 100 2000 pahar and dhar 2017 2 2 mps discretization in the moving particle semi implicit method mps the spatial differentials are represented by a set of mps models such as gradient model divergence model and laplacian model the pressure gradient model in mps is expressed as koshizuka et al 1998 shibata et al 2017 6 p i d m n 0 j i p j p ˆ i r i j 2 w i j where denotes mps operator d m is dimension of space i is the target particle and j is one of its neighboring particles and p ˆ i is the minimum value of pressure in the interaction circle for particle i in eq 6 w ij is the weighting function in mps the modeled material is represented by a set of points or particles in the calculation the method traces each particle s movement hence when calculating the flow properties of the particle i its neighboring particles have to be identified since they are able to switch information by interaction the weighting function w ij is used to determine the contributions from the neighboring particles in calculating flow properties the function commonly used in mps is written as xu and jin 2016 cheng et al 2017 7 w i j 1 r i j r e 3 r i j r e 0 r i j r e where r ij is the distance between the particle i and j r e is the search radius of the interaction circle r e 4 0d d is the particle distance in the non porous region in the circle the particles are recognized as the neighboring particle and they have interaction with particle i and the interaction for the particles outside the circle to the particle i is neglected the particle number density is introduced by using the weighting function 8 n i j i w i j in the initial condition particles are usually arranged to be symmetrical distribution in a local circle fully filled with particles in the distance of d with each other the particle number density in this condition is defined as n 0 a laplacian model is developed by xu and jin 2016 for the mps method as 10 2 ψ i d m n 0 j i ψ j ψ i r i j 2 g i j 11 g i j 3 d m 2 w i j r i j w i j r i j where ψ is a scalar for the time splitting the predictor and corrector numerical scheme is used namely the laplacian term and force term including the gravity force and resistive force are solved in the predictor to obtain the pressure field while the intermediate properties such as intermediate positions r intermediate particle number density n are calculated and the pressure gradient term is solved in the corrector to gain new velocity particles subsequently move to a new position field according to the new velocity in solving the momentum equation the mass conservation is satisfied by keeping density or particle number density constant in the predictor the pressure field is obtained from an equation of state as cheng et al 2017 12 p i ρ c 0 2 λ n i n 0 λ 1 where λ is a coefficient equal to 7 c 0 is the artificial sound speed c 0 is defined as 10 times of the maximum velocity in the problem this can ensure that the modeled incompressible fluid is weakly compressible with compressibility less than 1 monaghan 2005 in this study the sps turbulence model is used in the mps method to simulate the turbulence in the flows and this model has been successfully applied into calculating turbulence in fishway flow xu and jin 2014 flow over weirs xu and jin 2017 hydraulic jump cheng et al 2017 and other flows shao and gotoh 2005 gotoh and khayyer 2016 gotoh and sakai 2006 ren et al 2016 the boundary conditions for the free surface and solid wall are implemented according to previous studies by using the mps method koshizuka et al 1998 shao and gotoh 2005 gotoh and sakai 2006 khayyer et al 2008 a free surface particle is identified by its intermediate particle number density when it is less than a threshold while the solid boundary is implemented by using both solid and ghost particles koshizuka et al 1998 3 mps model modification incorporating porosity the mps models such as the pressure gradient model and laplacian model are modified by considering porosity of the porous media 3 1 porosity modification to mps in modeling flows through porous media by the macroscopic approach the volume that a particle represents respectively in the porous and non porous domains displays a difference if a constant particle distance d is used in the discretization taking a two dimensional flow as an example the representative volume for a particle is d d in the non porous domain as we assume the particle occupies the space of rectangular while it changes to d d ϕ in the porous media due to the macroscopic simulation thus when the particles with the particle distance d enter to the porous domain the particle distance varies to d ϕ 0 5 because of this an apparent density is used in the sph modeling to alter the volume a particle represents in the porous domain akbari 2014 pahar and dhar 2016 2017 similarly introduced a porosity based coefficient to the models in their mesh free method with consideration of volume change the particle number density in the mps method can be modified by taking the porosity of the porous materials into account as pahar and dhar 2017 13 n i j i w i j φ j where ϕ j is the porosity taking by the neighboring particle j ϕ j has no effect in the calculation of particle number density in the non porous phase as ϕ j 1 0 when the particle j is in the non porous domain eq 13 becomes eq 8 this interpolation is also applicable to the following modified equations by using the porosity the pressure gradient model then becomes 14 p i d m n 0 j i p j p ˆ i φ j r i j 2 w i j where w ij is calculated by using eq 13 n 0 remains constant in the entire simulation which is calculated from the initial condition when the particles are evenly distributed with a constant distance d the laplacian model eq 10 is expressed as follows by considering the porosity 15 2 ψ i d m n 0 j i ψ j ψ i φ j r i j 2 g i j since the equation of state is a function of the particle number density if the calculation of the particle number density is based on eq 13 the form of the equation of state does not need to be changed and is still expressed by eq 12 it should be noted that the particles in the calculation moves according to the actual velocity rather than the darcy velocity in the porous media hence in the predictor in the numerical scheme the intermediate and the new time step particle positions r i r i m 1 are updated respectively as 16 r i r i m δ t u p i m φ i 17 r i m 1 r i m δ t u p i m 1 φ i where m denotes the previous time step m 1 is the new time step and δt is the time step size in regards to the time step it satisfies the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criteria as in previous studies ren et al 2016 3 2 a stabilization technique due to the use of equation of state to obtain the pressure field the modeled incompressible fluid is treated as weakly compressible this could result in a noisy pressure field a stabilization technique in the mps method is proposed by xu and jin 2016 which is adopted in this study to eliminate the pressure noise in the simulations however when using the technique in the flows with porous media a porosity based coefficient is introduced in the technique as 18 δ u i δ r i n 0 j i u i j m 1 φ j w i j r i j 19 u i n e w m 1 u i m 1 δ u i a modified velocity is imposed to the velocity field u m 1 calculated from the corrector in the numerical scheme in obtaining a new velocity field u new m 1 δr i 0 01d is implemented in the simulations 3 3 porous and non porous interface treatment since the modeling is based on the macroscopic approach the fixed solid skeleton is not set up but instead the resistant forces are used to represent effects from the solid skeleton in this sense the fluid particles in the simulation entering and exiting the porous domain will not encounter any solid however when fluid particles cross the interface either to the porous media or to the non porous domain the porosity can emerge with variations this could lead to a non smooth transition when the flow passes through the interface as numerical oscillations in some studies de lemos and pedras 2001 shao 2010 a matching condition for the velocity and shear stress has to be defined at the interface to achieve smooth flow transition by using the mesh free method pahar and dhar 2016 2017 an averaging technique for the effective porosity around the interface is used to overcome the porosity discontinuity in this study a zone with limited length is set up at the interface to achieve a continuous porosity connection this technique is also used in previous studies akbari and namin 2013 akbari 2014 ren et al 2014 to obtain continuous porosity connection the porosity in the zone is usually calculated by using the averaging or smoothing procedure so that the length of the zone has to be at least one smoothing length in the simulations akbari and namin 2013 ren et al 2014 however in the present study a linear function based on the particle s distance to the boundary is used to achieve continuous porosity change at the interface this can reduce the required length of the zone being less than half of one smoothing length in the case of the porosity ϕ 0 5 for the porous material in the simulations the numerical resolution is characterized differently in the porous and non porous regions ren et al 2016 the particle distance is d in the non porous region while it changes to d ϕ 0 5 in the porous region thus our interface treatment takes the porosity in the porous region into account making it applicable both to the small and large porosity cases besides the search radius in the method significantly determines the accuracy of the spatial discretization models which should be considered in the treatment to set up the zone therefore in the proposed interface treatment the length of the zone l is related to both the search radius and porosity as r e ϕ 0 5 it has to be pointed out that the transition length of the zone is used according to the mean diameter of the grains in the porous region in some studies akbari 2014 ren et al 2016 this can satisfy the physical aspect for modeling the porous materials however if a type of the larger mean diameter material is equipped in the porous region which is common in engineering a very large transition zone has to be set for the interface treatment this can result in underestimation of the free surface at the interface the improved zone set up technique is shown in fig 1 we assume that the porosity in the zone is solely determined by its distance to the interface d z in the zone the porosity is calculated by a linear relationship as ϕ δϕ d z l making the porosity less than 1 0 and larger than ϕ in this manner the porosity is able to be linearly varied in the zone so that numerical oscillation can be eliminated we will examine sensitivity from the length of the transition zone by using a numerical example in section 4 4 model validation in this section effects from length of the transition zone and numerical convergence are examined 4 1 sensitivity from the zone length of the proposed interface treatment since there is a sudden change in porosity between the porous and non porous regions without proper treatment in the numerical method the flow through the porous media will undergo oscillations resulting in unstable simulation results to ensure a smooth transition for the flow in the simulations we proposed an interface treatment described in section 3 3 with the length related to the porosity ϕ and the numerical parameter of the search radius r e as the form of r e ϕ 0 5 to examine its sensitivity the simulations for a dam breaking flow through the porous media are conducting by implementing the lengths of l 0 25r e ϕ 0 5 0 5r e ϕ 0 5 0 75r e ϕ 0 5 and r e ϕ 0 5 in which α 1000 in calculating the resistive force by using eq 4 it should be noted that a small porosity value of 0 1 for the porous media is selected in the simulation to show that the proposed interface treatment is able to handle a big porosity difference this value is much smaller than the typical porosity value 0 25 for the porous material in most civil engineering problems fig 2 shows the flow characteristics through a porous block with different lengths of the transition zone in which the porosity of the porous material is set to be 0 1 in fig 2 the particles with red color are big pressure compare to neighboring particles that can be classified as particles with pressure noises the transition length of l 0 25r e ϕ 0 5 is able to calculate good results although some pressure noise is observed due to the use of equation of state the flow crosses to the porous region without jumps when l 0 5r e ϕ 0 5 is used in the simulation the pressure noise becomes less if l increases to 0 75r e ϕ 0 5 or even r e ϕ 0 5 the pressure noise disappears in the figure however if a much longer transition zone is used it can cause underestimation for the free surface elevation generally in the examination l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 can be used to obtain good results in order to further examine the effects from the transition length l another dam breaking flow through porous block is simulated by using the different lengths of l 0 25r e ϕ 0 5 0 75r e ϕ 0 5 r e ϕ 0 5 1 25r e ϕ 0 5 and 2 0r e ϕ 0 5 in which α 1000 by using eq 4 this dam breaking flow is different from the previous dam breaking flow as there is a thin layer of water downstream of the break moreover the free surface for the flow through the porous block is measured by lin 1998 and we are able to compare the numerical results of the different transition lengths with the experimental measurements initially a water column with height 0 25 m and width 0 28 m is equipped at the left side of the channel the depth for downstream water through the porous media is 0 02 m the porous block is placed in the middle of the channel with a distance of 0 02 m to the left water column the porosity is 0 49 and equivalent mean diameter of the porous material d 50 0 0159 m the diagram of the flow is shown in fig 3 fig 4 illustrates the free surface variation with time at the center section of the porous block with the position x 0 445 m simulated by using different transition lengths the measured free surface elevations lin 1998 liu et al 1999 are also included in the figure for comparison the figure also presents isph numerical result akbari and namin 2013 and the numerical result simulated by vof volume of fluid liu et al 1999 the transition length l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 is able to calculate similar free surface variations at the section which are close to experimental measurements especially for the period t 0 5 s 1 0 s for l 1 25 r e ϕ 0 5 the height of the simulated free surface at t 0 3 s 1 0 s is increased and the increase for l 2 0 r e ϕ 0 5 is more profound approaching the isph results this is because isph also uses a larger transient length as nearly 4 times of the smoothing length akbari and namin 2013 after t 1 0 s the water surface at this section almost overlaps for the lengths l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 but there is a clear deviation for the result simulated by using l 2 0 r e ϕ 0 5 even compared with the experimental measurements to calculate the free surface profiles the transition length l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 is able to capture good results when compared to the experimental measurements 4 2 comparison with experiment and numerical convergence to simulate the flow shown in fig 3 the particle distances of d 0 005 m 0 0025 m and 0 00125 m are used for numerical convergence analysis and α 1000 when using eq 4 to calculate the resistive force fig 5 illustrates the free surface profiles for the dam breaking flow through the porous media at different time steps from t 0 0 2 2 s for the particle distance d 0 005 m with the comparison to the experimental results lin 1998 liu et al 1999 the simulated flow pattern for the flow by using the proposed method is also illustrated in the figure the water column collapses and flows towards to the region of the porous media the flow slows down when it reaches the porous media due to the barrier from the porous media the water level rises as illustrated at t 0 04 s subsequently more water flows through the porous block and the flow approaches to the other side of the channel resulting in a decrease of water level elevation in the porous block as illustrated at t 0 06 s and 0 08 s the flow then impacts on the end wall of the simulated domain causing a reverse wave when the backward wave encounters the porous block it collides with the forward moving flow during the interaction at the interface water penetrates back into the porous block the free surface profiles in the simulation show a good agreement with the experimental measurements in fig 5 compared with the numerical result by manuel del jesus et al 2012 although there are some discrepancies from the wave front in the beginning of the flow such as t 0 2 s and 0 4 s in fig 5 a good agreement between them can be observed from t 0 6 s 2 2 s it suggests that the proposed numerical model is able to capture the free surface in the porous media and reflect the interaction of flow between the porous and non porous regions it should be noted that the free surface profiles in the simulation show some discrepancies with the experimental measurements which is particularly obvious at the early stages of the flow such as at t 0 2 s and 0 4 s there could be two reasons explained in the following in the present simulation the effect of the porous media is represented by linear darcy and nonlinear forchheimer f c terms incorporated in the governing equations this approximation to denote the porous media could lead to the discrepancy for the free surface in the comparison on the other hand in the experimental measurements the gate initially holding the left water column is opened manually within 0 1 s liu et al 1999 which could partially cause some discrepancies especially at the initial stages of the flow however this discrepancy is minimized with increasing time step the free surface variation is further examined at section i x 0 445 m by using different numerical resolutions fig 6 it also includes the experimental measurement lin 1998 isph numerical results akbari and namin 2013 and a numerical simulation by vof volume of fluid liu et al 1999 for comparison purposes the present method with different numerical resolutions is able to calculate similar free surface profiles at the section as the time increases by using different particle distances d the simulated free surface profiles show slight difference especially for t 0 5 s however a good numerical convergence is observed in the figure for t 0 5 s while with a finer particle distance such as d 0 0025 m and 0 00125 m the free surface is much more comparable to the experimental results as opposed to d 0 005 m 4 3 flow over the porous weir the mesh free macroscopic method is used to simulate the flow over the porous weir fig 7 illustrates the schematic diagram of the simulated flow conditions over the porous weirs the porous weir is 0 2 m wide l 0 2 m and 0 2 m high p 0 2 m with different porosity and mean diameter materials locating in an open channel in the simulations the water discharge is set to be constant which is similar to the experimental conditions by mohamed 2009 the downstream water depth is controlled by the tailgate we simulated three porous weirs with different material properties solid weir porous weir i ϕ 0 4 d 50 0 0028 m and porous weir ii ϕ 0 49 d 50 0 007 m in simulating the flows we investigated the free surface that is affected by different porous weirs for the open boundary condition the particles are injected to the simulation domain according the inflow velocity and they are removed when they arrive at the end of the domain more details on the boundary condition can be found in the studies by xu and jin 2014 and cheng et al 2017 fig 8 shows the free surface profiles with the flow over different porous weirs including the experimental measurements mohamed 2009 and numerical results simulated by finite volume method fvm mohammadpour et al 2013 the numerical results from the present method have a good agreement with the experimental and fvm results for the flows over the porous weirs 5 impacting force on the porous structural face the macroscopic simulation method with the proposed interface treatment is then applied to investigate the impacting force to the face of the porous media from a dam break flow in most civil engineering problems the porosity for the porous materials is larger than 0 25 hence the simulations are conducted by varying the porosity in the range ϕ 0 25 1 0 to examine the impacting pressure on porous material interface caused by the dam breaking wave 5 1 impact investigation by dam breaking flow in the presence of porous media the diagram of the dam breaking flow is shown in fig 9 in which a solid wall fig 9a and porous media wall fig 9b are respectively set up the solid wall at x 1 61 m in fig 9a indicates that the flow is completely reflected by the wall without any water penetration to the right side the porous media wall at x 1 61 m shown in fig 9b means that the domain for x 1 61 m is filled with porous material and the section of x 1 61 m is the interface between non porous and porous regions a water column with height h 0 30 m and length l 0 60 m is initially held at the left side of the channel by a gate after removal of the gate at t 0 00 s a dam breaking wave is generated propagating to the right side of the solid wall or porous media wall as the water collides with the right side wall the impacting force from the dam breaking flow exerts and the impacting pressure is monitored at several points on the wall respectively at the height of h 0 003 m 0 15 m and 0 03 m as shown in the figure the impacting pressure on the face of the porous media caused by the dam breaking wave are investigated and compared to the impacting pressure to the solid face which is measured by lobovský et al 2014 the impacting pressure is supposed to be affected by the properties of the porous media such as porosity and mean diameter of the material the simulations by the proposed method are conducted by varying the two properties for the porous media equipped at the domain x 1 61 m to investigate their effects to the impacting pressure on the face at x 1 61 m fig 10 shows the dam breaking flow pattern hitting the porous media block in which porosity for the porous material in the region x 1 61 m is ϕ 0 25 and mean diameter is d 50 0 0028 m at around t 0 45 s the dam breaking wave encounters the right porous media wall the flowing water is able to penetrate into the porous domain which is different from the solid wall for the solid wall all the water body is reflected at x 1 61 m producing a reverse wave in the case with the porous domain at x 1 61 m water penetration occurs at t 0 60 s at t 1 8 s we observe more water crossing the interface between the non porous and porous domains at x 1 61 m despite of the water penetration a reverse wave is also observed at t 0 6 s the reflected water body by the porous wall then moves backward to the left during the movement of the backward wave a void as a circle in the figure is observed at t 1 0 s and 1 1 s the reversed wave affected by the porous media wall is able to generate a train of ripples in the simulation such as t 1 5 s later the ripples are submerged by the running wave at t 1 8 s by observing the flow phenomenon the porous media with the domain of x 1 61 m play a significant role in the dam breaking wave propagation it should be noted that the low value for the porosity is 0 25 as the porous material of sand or gravel in most of the civil engineering problems in the range of porosityϕ 0 25 1 0 the forchheimer model is valid to calculate the turbulence in the porous media bear 2013 in this sense more simulations are conducted by varying the porosity bounded in the range of ϕ 0 25 1 0 for the porous media at x 1 61 m with keeping the mean diameter constant as d 50 0 0028 m the impacting pressure at the interface at x 1 61 m is plotted comparing to the impacting pressure on the solid wall at x 1 61 m the impacting pressure histories with different porosities on the wall are shown at the points with heights h 0 003 m fig 11 a 0 015 m figs 11b and 0 03 m fig 11c also including the measured pressure from experiments by lobovský et al 2014 when the wall is solid in the figure the pressure fluctuates when hitting the wall regardless of porous wall or solid wall the obvious fluctuations occur at t h g 0 5 2 46 as a peak pressure for all the walls with different porosities however for larger porosity wall such as ϕ 0 5 it is able to clearly reduce the fluctuating peak pressure caused by the impinging dam breaking wave which occurs at the points with the height h 0 003 m figs 11a and 0 015 m fig 11b with the evolution of the flow the fluctuation of the pressure gradually becomes weak at the three points to t h g 0 5 5 89 the second pressure peak is observed for the cases with different porous walls and this pressure peak is also measured by the experiments for a solid wall without any porous media from the figure the use of the porous media wall can effectively reduce the second pressure peak value at the three monitored points for instance at the point h 0 03 m p ρgh 1 36 for solid wall p ρgh 1 24 and 1 01 respectively for the wall with porosity ϕ 0 25 and 0 5 afterwards the pressure is decreasing as shown in the figure the dam breaking wave propagation can be affected by the porous media at the right side with different porosities which is particularly profound for the second pressure wave shown in fig 11 we also examined the free surface variations at the two sections x 0 865 m and 1 3625 m marked as sections h1 and h2 fig 12 a and b for the solid wall the free surface elevation at the two sections is measured by lobovský et al 2014 in fig 12 the numerical method is able to reproduce the free surface variations when the right wall at x 1 61 m is solid it has to be pointed out that the free surface evolution after t h g 0 5 5 26 has a discrepancy between the experimental measurements and numerical results for the solid wall in fig 12b this is caused by the three dimensional flow feature after the water hitting the wall causing a strong splash resulting in water drops occurring in the experiments lobovský et al 2014 in the numerical modeling we treated the flow as two dimensional without considering these complex flow phenomena including air entrainment at section h1 fig 12a the porosity of the porous media wall shows no effect to the free surface evolution for the period t h g 0 5 0 0 7 0 as all the surface profiles from different porosity walls are identical the free surface profiles are also very similar for the period t h g 0 5 2 0 5 39 at section h2 fig 12b since the flow does not arrive at the porous media wall in this period and still propagates in the non porous domain however at t h g 0 5 5 39 after the dam breaking wave impinges against the solid or porous media wall the porosity affects the free surface variations the free surface elevation is obviously lower for a larger porosity wall such as ϕ 0 5 fig 12b this is because the running water can easily penetrate into the porous media decreasing the free surface height of the reflected water wave to clearly address the effects from the porosity for the porous material at the right side at x 1 61 m the dam breaking flow patterns at t 1 1 s with different porosity walls are shown in fig 13 in the simulations the mean diameter of the porous material is used as a constant value d 50 0 0028 m while the porosity varies as ϕ 0 0 solid wall figs 13a 0 25 fig 13b and 0 5 fig 13c in terms of a specific mean diameter of the porous media the porosity is able to affect the penetrated water body as a larger porosity such as ϕ 0 5 fig 13c makes it easier to allow water penetration to the porous material hence a larger body of water can be observed for the porosity ϕ 0 5 in fig 13c on the other hand when ϕ 0 25 the penetrated water becomes less fig 13b the simulated results correspond to the understanding that the penetration of water into the porous media which is dependent on the porosity when the mean diameter is constant meanwhile the reflected wave is also affected as larger void is observed for the larger porosity wall ϕ 0 5 in fig 13c while this void area is very small for the reflected wave if the wall is solid in fig 13a however the flow pattern could be different if the mean diameter of the porous material changes because it can affect the permeability of the porous material thus we then investigated the effects from the mean diameter in the flow fig 14 shows the flow patterns for d 50 0 06 m when ϕ 0 5 in which the mean diameter is set to be greater than the simulations in figs 10 and 13 d 50 0 0028 m the simulated results show a big difference in the flow pattern for a larger d 50 the dam breaking flow can easily pass through the porous media wall when the porosity remains constant in the simulations even at t 0 6 s the running water already passes through the porous material forming a reflected wave in the porous domain due to more water penetration the reflected wave is able to move backwards and cross the interface again to the non porous domain after the repeated water penetration across the non porous and porous interface the reflected wave becomes much weaker compared to the flow pattern in figs 10 and 13 moreover more water accumulates at the right side of the wall in the porous domain and propagates forwards until t 1 9 s the water in the porous domain moves to an extended distance this flow phenomenon especially for the flow characteristics in the porous media is attributed to the larger mean diameter used in the simulation to further understand the function of d 50 in the flow through porous media when using the macroscopic modeling different mean diameters for the porous material are used in the simulations as d 50 0 0028 m 0 01 m 0 06 m and 0 12 m while the porosity of the porous media is kept constant as ϕ 0 5 the flow patterns by using different d 50 at t 1 0 s are shown in fig 15 it is clear that the flow is significantly affected by the mean diameter d 50 for a small d 50 the flow does not easily pass through interface to the porous domain with only a fraction of water body observed when d 50 0 0028 m as illustrated in fig 15a however when the mean diameter increases penetration of water to the porous domain becomes much more profound such as in the cases of d 50 0 06 m figs 15c and 0 12 m fig 15d in the meantime the reflected wave becomes weak behaving as a reduced wave height and wave propagating length due to water penetration to the porous domain particularly obvious in fig 15d in the simulations the mean diameter d 50 plays a significant role in the dam breaking flow through porous media the impacting pressure on the interface between non porous and porous regions could also be affected by using different mean diameter for the porous materials for x 1 61 m we then examined the pressure time history at the three points of different heights as h 0 003 m 0 015 m and 0 03 m as shown in fig 16 a c a larger value of the mean diameter can greatly reduce the fluctuations of the pressure and the peak value of the pressure at the three points for example when d 50 0 06 m the peak pressure p ρgh for the first wave when the dam breaking reaches the interface reduces from larger than 4 0 solid wall to 0 75 at the point h 0 003 m as in fig 16a more importantly the first peak pressure is delayed by using the larger d 50 0 06 m as compared with the solid wall at both points with heights h 0 015 m figs 16b and 0 03 m fig 16c it is delayed to almost t h g 0 5 3 0 for the first pressure peak value compared with t h g 0 5 2 4 for the solid wall for the point h 0 03 m fig 16c overall the parameters of porosity and mean diameter are able to have an effect on the flow pattern in the flow through porous media and impacting pressure on the interface a larger porosity or a larger mean diameter d 50 can easily permit more running water passing into the porous media the impacting pressure on the interface of the porous media can be reduced by larger value of porosity or mean diameter of the grains 6 conclusions in this study a macroscopic mesh free method is used to investigate the flow affected by porous materials in the numerical method the spatial discretization models in the moving particle semi implicit method mps is modified by considering the porosity of the porous material in which a porosity based coefficient is introduced in this way the representative volume by a fluid particle is increased to d d ϕ in the porous domain compared to the volume d d in the non porous domain to eliminate the noisy pressure field due to the use of the equation of state a stabilization technique is implemented in the numerical method moreover an improved interface treatment for the discontinuous porosity issue is proposed in the treatment a transition zone is set up to achieve continuous porosity change at the interface moreover the setting of the transition length is related to the porosity this is able to achieve a smooth flow transition in the case of not only small porosity difference but also large porosity difference at the interface more importantly the continuous change for the porosity in the zone is achieved by using a linear relationship in which the calculated porosity in the zone is only determined by the particles distance to the boundary compared with the sph interpolation in the zone to obtain the porosity continuity the transition length can be shorter as l 0 25r e ϕ 0 5 that is less than half the required length in the previous studies and able to obtain good results when compared to the experimental measurements in the present study the technique is then used to simulate a dam breaking wave through porous media and different lengths of the zone are examined it is found that the length l 0 25 1 0 r e ϕ 0 5 is able to calculate good results the method with the interface treatment is applied to simulate a dam breaking wave through a porous block in which the sps turbulence model is also employed in the simulation the simulated free surface profiles have a good agreement with experimental measurements in literature and the method has a good numerical convergence by investigating different numerical resolutions subsequently the impacting pressure on the interface between non porous and porous regions is investigated by the numerical method both the porosity and grain size of porous materials can affect the impacting pressure and flow penetration to the porous media since both of them can contribute to the permeability of porous media the impacting pressure is able to be reduced greatly by using larger porosity materials or larger grain size for the porous block which also permits penetration of a larger body of water in the porous media besides the height of the dam breaking wave can also be reduced by using porous blocks compared with solid walls in the simulation of flow over porous weirs with different porosities and grain size materials the free surface profiles have a good agreement with experimental measurements in the simulations we found that the use of larger porosity materials or larger grain size to construct the porous block is able to reduce impacting pressure and wave height the findings are helpful for designing the porous structures from damage due to high impacting force besides to attenuate the wave height to prevent overtopping for the waves in the coastal region the porous structures with a larger porosity or larger gravel could be effective based on the study the proposed method in this study is able to be used to study flow interactions between porous and non porous phases it can reproduce the flow characteristics such as free surface wave elevation and impacting pressure it could be a promising numerical tool to aid structural designs in coastal or hydraulic engineering the method can be easily extended to simulate 3d flows through porous media when modeling 3d problems the dimension of space in the spatial operators such as gradient model and laplacian model is equal to d m 3 in both 2d and 3d problems the method is good at capturing the free surface without introducing extra numerical techniques however the computational cost could be high when simulating 3d problems due to involving a large number of particles acknowledgement we acknowledge the

22787,rubber isolator is commonly used as vibration isolation device for piston pump and the vibration of piston pump can be effectively reduced by adjusting the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator in this paper in order to study the effect of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the dynamic of seawater hydraulic piston pump swhpp four kinds of rubber isolators with different dynamic stiffness were selected an experimental modal analysis ema experiment was conducted to study the influence of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the natural frequency of swhpp the experimental results indicated that the natural frequency of the pump structure decreased as the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator increased then the influence of the rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the vibration of swhpp was further studied and conclusions can be obtained that the vibration level of the pump decreases with the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator increases for the four kinds of rubber isolators when the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator is 5800n cm the vibration reduction effect of the isolator is the best which reaching 38 in addition the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator mainly affects the vibration of the pump in the frequency of 0 20 hz keywords dynamic stiffness rubber isolator natural frequency vibration seawater hydraulic piston pump 1 introduction swhpp is widely used in autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and submarines to adjust buoyancy due to its advantages of high pressure large flow and high volumetric efficiency however the swhpp is the main vibration and noise source of hydraulic system the vibration and noise generated by the pump will not only cause the fatigue damage of the equipment and affect the working life of equipment but also significantly reduce the quietness and concealment of the auvs and submarines with the development of auvs and submarines the research of vibration and noise reduction of the pump has got more and more attention johansson 2009 the vibration and noise reduction technology of piston pump can be divided into two categories one approach is to reduce vibration by optimizing the structure of piston pump which mainly changes the dynamic behavior of the pump by modifying the stiffness and or the damping rivin 2004 zhang et al 2018 utilized free layer visco elastic damping material to change the natural frequency of an axial piston pump and the experimental result showed that the vibration and noise of the pump at the second harmonic can be reduced by using damping material some scholars have found that the vibration and noise of piston pump can be effectively reduced by optimizing the shell structure of piston pump kunze and berneke 2006 palmen 2004 xu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 discovered that the noise of piston pump can be reduced by changing the materials of pump port valve seat through simulation and experimental methods another method is passive vibration and noise reduction technology generally the passive vibration and noise reduction technique mainly reduces the vibration of piston pump by installing vibration isolation device between the pump and the base rivin 2004 there is no need to make any changes to the pump structure when utilized the vibration isolation device which is economical and convenient and it is effective for vibration and noise control so this method has been widely applied su et al 1990 ibrahim 2008 made a comprehensive summary of the nonlinear passive vibration isolator li and xu 2017 presented the analytical model of floating raft isolation system and investigated its vibration attenuation performance however the structure of the floating raft isolation system is complex and the cost is high tang and brennan 2014 introduced the shock isolation characteristics of a high static low dynamic stiffness isolator the equivalent damping ratio and effective stiffness of the wire rope spring tuned mass dampers were experimentally studied by gerges and vickery 2003 but the low bearing capacity and low maintenance characteristics of the dampers limit its application chen et al 2016 studied the vibration characteristic of the rubber isolation system and evidenced the significance of the uncertainty and nonlinearity in rubber isolation system rubber isolator has many advantages such as compact structure simple usage and high load bearing capacity so it has been widely used in the field of vibration and noise control fan et al 1998 tárrago et al 2007 in particular due to its high load bearing capacity low cost and good performance of vibration and noise reduction rubber isolator is widely applied in heavy equipment such as piston pump etc the vibration attenuation performance of rubber isolator directly depends on its dynamic and static characteristics and the dynamic stiffness is the important characteristic of rubber isolator which has complex nonlinearity at present the literature are mainly focused on the simulation and experimental analysis of the rubber isolator materials rao et al 2004 the rubber isolator as the support of the pump group there are few literature on the impact of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the overall dynamic behavior of the pump structure therefore it is necessary to study the influence of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the vibration of piston pump in recent years ema has been more and more widely applied in the field of the vibration and noise reduction of piston pump wang et al 2018 xu et al 2016 optimized the piston pump housing using the ema technique and results showed that the average sound pressure level was reduced by about 2 0 db a at the discharge pressure of 250 bar kunze and berneke 2006 used the ema method to optimize the structure of piston pump and the experimental results indicated that the ema technique could effectively reduce the vibration and noise of piston pump therefore it is an economical and effective method to analyze the dynamic characteristics of pump structure by ema method to reduce the vibration and noise of piston pump in this paper ema method was selected to study the influence of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the dynamic of swhpp the vibration reduction effect of rubber isolators with different dynamic stiffness was measured and the influence of dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator on the vibration of pump was compared and analyzed 2 theory 2 1 modal model of swhpp as the mass and stiffness of swhpp are far greater than those of rubber isolator the swhpp can be seen as a rigid mass m and the rubber isolator can be considered as a spring damping unit the analysis model of swhpp with rubber isolator is showed in fig 1 the dynamic equation of swhpp can be depicted in the following form 1 m x c x k x f where m c and k are the matrices which represent the mass the damping and the stiffness of swhpp respectively x x and x are the acceleration velocity and displacement column vectors respectively f denotes the excitations that compose of hydrodynamic excitation and mechanical excitation xu et al 2015 eq 1 is transformed by fourier transformation 2 x ω h ω f ω the frequency response function h ω can be obtained by eq 2 3 h ω x ω x ω with 4 h ω r 1 n φ r l r t j ω λ r φ r l r h j ω λ r where the solution of eq 4 5 λ r ζ r ω r i 1 ζ r 2 ω r 6 f r ω r 2 π where ζ r is damping ratio φ r represents the modal shape vector f r is natural frequency and l r is the modal participation vector it can be obtained from the above discussion that the modal parameters of swhpp can be identified from the frequency response function h ω when measuring the responses x ω and excitation f ω simultaneously however the pump group and the rubber isolator are generally regarded as a whole system in practice the change of the dynamic characteristics of rubber isolator will vary the dynamics of the pump group system which will affect the vibration of the pump group 2 2 the vibration reduction effect of rubber isolator the vibration acceleration of swhpp can be expressed in the following form 7 p 201 g r m s a a 0 where rms a denotes the mean square root of the vibration acceleration a 0 is the reference acceleration a 0 1 10 6 m s2 the vibration level g is described by the total root mean square value of vibration acceleration 8 g a p where a p is the total area of the spectrum density curve which is calculated by the integral of the spectrum density function on the frequency the vibration reduction effect of rubber isolator is expressed by the value t 9 t g 1 g 2 g 1 100 where g 1 is the vibration level of swhpp g 2 is the vibration level of the base in the experiment the vibration reduction effect of rubber isolator is measured and compared and the influence of the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator on the vibration of the pump group is obtained 3 experiment all experiments in this paper are performed on a swhpp there are the advantages of low noise and large flow for the swhpp with this structure luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a 2016b 2019 and the main performance parameters of swhpp are shown in table 1 as shown in fig 2 four rubber isolators are installed at the base of the pump which are supplied by wuxi jiangda isolation company in order to study the effect of the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator on the vibration characteristics of the pump group four kinds of rubber isolators with different dynamic stiffness are selected and all rubber isolators have the same size since the dynamics of swhpp in the z direction are concerned so the parameters of the rubber isolator in the z direction are selected and the main parameters of the rubber isolators are detailed in table 2 3 1 ema of swhpp with different rubber isolators in this section the dynamic behavior of swhpp with different rubber isolators was analyzed using ema method fig 3 showed the ema experiment of swhpp 1 as shown in fig 3 the hammer excitation was conducted by a powerful hammer type hdfc dfc 1 at the excitation point in the z direction the powerful hammer was provided by the china orient institute of noise and vibration and its sensitivity is 0 47mv n 2 an accelerometer type 4514 b 001 brüel kjær was connected to the acquisition system lan xi type 3050 b 060 6ch brüel kjær and the experimental data was analyzed in pulse labshop 14 1 brüel kjær since the speed of the pump was 150r min the rotational frequency of the pump f 150 60 2 5 hz the frequency band analyzed in this paper was selected from 0 to 100 hz the sampling time was 16s and the sampling rate was 256 hz the sensitivity of the accelerometer is 10mv ms 2 4 results and discussions the frequency response functions of swhpp obtained by ema method are showed in fig 4 a b c and d are the frequency response functions of swhpp with rubber isolator wa400 wh400 be400 and bh400 respectively there are three peaks in each frequency response function in the frequency of 0 100 hz the natural frequencies of swhpp with different rubber isolators are listed in table 3 conclusions can be obtained from table 3 with the increase of the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator the natural frequencies of the pump group with different rubber isolators are also increasing however the first two natural frequencies vary greatly with respect to the third natural frequency of the pump group as shown in fig 5 the reason for this difference is stiffness nonlinearity of rubber isolator it means that the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator is positively related to the natural frequency of the pump group and the natural frequency of the pump can be adjusted according to changing the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator 5 the vibration of swhpp with different

of swhpp structure an experiment was established as shown in fig 6 fig 6 details the working principle of the experimental system swhpp 5 is driven by motor 6 to complete the process of inhaling low pressure water and excluding high pressure water the discharge pressure of swhpp 5 is adjusted by the throttle valve 9 and the pressure gauge 8 is used to measure the discharge pressure of the swhpp the sampling time is 16s the analysis frequency range is 0 100 hz and the sampling rate is 256 hz 1 as shown in fig 7 two accelerometers reference 4514 b 001 brüel kjær which mount on the pump and the

between the solid line and the dotted line indicates the vibration reduction effect of the rubber isolator from the figures it can be seen that the vibration amplitude of swhpp is larger than that of the base the vibration reduction effect of the rubber isolators wa400 and wh400 are better than those of the rubber isolators be400 and bh400 the vibration of swhpp and base with different rubber

the base is 67 0db 1 0 μm s2 and the corresponding dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator is 5800n cm the rubber isolator wa400 has the best vibration reduction effect and its value is 38 2 for the swhpp with different rubber isolators the vibration level of the pump decreases with the increase of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the contrary the vibration level of the base increases with the increase of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness the difference between the vibration of the pump and the base decreases as the dynamic stiffness of the isolator increases in other words the vibration reduction effect of rubber isolator decreases as its dynamic stiffness increases for the four kinds of rubber isolators when the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator is 41200n cm the vibration level of swhpp is minimal however the vibration level of the base transmitted by the isolator is the largest in practical engineering in order to reduce the vibration of swhpp the rubber isolator can be selected with the dynamic stiffness of 41200n cm in order to reduce the vibration of the base the rubber isolator can be selected with the dynamic stiffness of 5800n cm in order to describe the influence of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on vibration of swhpp in detail fig 9 was drawn from fig 9 it can be seen that the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator mainly affects the vibration of swhpp in the frequency of 0 20 hz the reason is that the change of dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator has a great influence on the natural frequency of the swhpp between 0 and 20 hz corresponding to table 3 and fig 5 which will affect the vibration peak of swhpp however the influence of the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolators on the vibration of the base is opposite as shown in fig 10 6 conclusions in this paper in order to study the dynamic behavior of swhpp with different rubber isolators an ema experiment was conducted the first three natural frequencies of swhpp identified by ema were compared it was found that the natural frequency of the pump structure increased with the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator increased and the dynamic stiffness of rubber

vibration reduction effect of rubber isolator is 38 2 37 7 18 0 and 13 8 respectively when the vibration level of swhpp is the largest the corresponding rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness is 5800n cm however when the vibration level of the base is the largest the corresponding rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness is 41200n cm the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator with the best vibration reduction effect is 5800n cm the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator mainly affects the natural frequency of swhpp in the frequency of 0 20 hz so the vibration of the pump with different rubber

rubber isolators when the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator is 5800n cm the vibration reduction effect of the isolator is the best which reaching 38 in addition the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator mainly affects the vibration of the pump in the frequency of 0 20 hz keywords dynamic stiffness rubber isolator natural frequency vibration seawater hydraulic piston pump 1 introduction swhpp is widely used in autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and submarines to adjust buoyancy due to its advantages of high pressure large flow and high volumetric efficiency however the swhpp is the main vibration and noise source of hydraulic system the vibration and noise generated by the pump will not only cause the fatigue damage of the equipment and affect the working life of equipment but also significantly reduce the quietness and concealment of the auvs and submarines with the development of auvs and submarines the research of vibration and noise reduction of the pump has got more and more attention johansson 2009 the vibration and noise reduction technology of piston pump can be divided into two categories one approach is to reduce vibration by optimizing the structure of piston pump which mainly changes the dynamic behavior of the pump by modifying the stiffness and or the damping rivin 2004 zhang et al 2018 utilized free layer visco elastic damping material to change the natural frequency of an axial piston pump and the experimental result showed that the vibration and noise of the pump at the second harmonic can be reduced by using damping material some scholars have found that the vibration and noise of piston pump can be effectively reduced by optimizing the shell structure of piston pump kunze and berneke 2006 palmen 2004 xu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 discovered that the noise of piston pump can be reduced by changing the materials of pump port valve seat through simulation and experimental methods another method is passive vibration and noise reduction technology generally the passive vibration and noise reduction technique mainly reduces the vibration of piston pump by installing vibration isolation device between the pump and the base rivin 2004 there is no need to make any changes to the pump structure when utilized the vibration isolation device which is economical and convenient and it is effective for vibration and noise control so this method has been widely applied su et al 1990 ibrahim 2008 made a comprehensive summary of the nonlinear passive vibration isolator li and xu 2017 presented the analytical model of floating raft isolation system and investigated its vibration attenuation performance however the structure of the floating raft isolation system is complex and the cost is high tang and brennan 2014 introduced the shock isolation characteristics of a high static low dynamic stiffness isolator the equivalent damping ratio and effective stiffness of the wire rope spring tuned mass dampers were experimentally studied by gerges and vickery 2003 but the low bearing capacity and low maintenance characteristics of the dampers limit its application chen et al 2016 studied the vibration characteristic of the rubber isolation system and evidenced the significance of the uncertainty and nonlinearity in rubber isolation system rubber isolator has many advantages such as compact structure simple usage and high load bearing capacity so it has been widely used in the field of vibration and noise control fan et al 1998 tárrago et al 2007 in particular due to its high load bearing capacity low cost and good performance of vibration and noise reduction rubber isolator is widely applied in heavy equipment such as piston pump etc the vibration attenuation performance of rubber isolator directly depends on its dynamic and static characteristics and the dynamic stiffness is the important characteristic of rubber isolator which has complex nonlinearity at present the literature are mainly focused on the simulation and experimental analysis of the rubber isolator materials rao et al 2004 the rubber isolator as the support of the pump group there are few literature on the impact of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the overall dynamic behavior of the pump structure therefore it is necessary to study the influence of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the vibration of piston pump in recent years ema has been more and more widely applied in the field of the vibration and noise reduction of piston pump wang et al 2018 xu et al 2016 optimized the piston pump housing using the ema technique and results showed that the average sound pressure level was reduced by about 2 0 db a at the discharge pressure of 250 bar kunze and berneke 2006 used the ema method to optimize the structure of piston pump and the experimental results indicated that the ema technique could effectively reduce the vibration and noise of piston pump therefore it is an economical and effective method to analyze the dynamic characteristics of pump structure by ema method to reduce the vibration and noise of piston pump in this paper ema method was selected to study the influence of rubber isolator s dynamic stiffness on the dynamic of swhpp the vibration reduction effect of rubber isolators with different dynamic stiffness was measured and the influence of dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator on the vibration of pump was compared and analyzed 2 theory 2 1 modal model of swhpp as the mass and stiffness of swhpp are far greater than those of rubber isolator the swhpp can be seen as a rigid mass m and the rubber isolator can be considered as a spring damping unit the analysis model of swhpp with rubber isolator is showed in fig 1 the dynamic equation of swhpp can be depicted in the following form 1 m x c x k x f where m c and k are the matrices which represent the mass the damping and the stiffness of swhpp respectively x x and x are the acceleration velocity and displacement column vectors respectively f denotes the excitations that compose of hydrodynamic excitation and mechanical excitation xu et al 2015 eq 1 is transformed by fourier transformation 2 x ω h ω f ω the frequency response function h ω can be obtained by eq 2 3 h ω x ω x ω with 4 h ω r 1 n φ r l r t j ω λ r φ r l r h j ω λ r where the solution of eq 4 5 λ r ζ r ω r i 1 ζ r 2 ω r 6 f r ω r 2 π where ζ r is damping ratio φ r represents the modal shape vector f r is natural frequency and l r is the modal participation vector it can be obtained from the above discussion that the modal parameters of swhpp can be identified from the frequency response function h ω when measuring the responses x ω and excitation f ω simultaneously however the pump group and the rubber isolator are generally regarded as a whole system in practice the change of the dynamic characteristics of rubber isolator will vary the dynamics of the pump group system which will affect the vibration of the pump group 2 2 the vibration reduction effect of rubber isolator the vibration acceleration of swhpp can be expressed in the following form 7 p 201 g r m s a a 0 where rms a denotes the mean square root of the vibration acceleration a 0 is the reference acceleration a 0 1 10 6 m s2 the vibration level g is described by the total root mean square value of vibration acceleration 8 g a p where a p is the total area of the spectrum density curve which is calculated by the integral of the spectrum density function on the frequency the vibration reduction effect of rubber isolator is expressed by the value t 9 t g 1 g 2 g 1 100 where g 1 is the vibration level of swhpp g 2 is the vibration level of the base in the experiment the vibration reduction effect of rubber isolator is measured and compared and the influence of the dynamic stiffness of rubber isolator on the vibration of the pump group is obtained 3 experiment all experiments in this paper are performed on a swhpp there are the advantages of low noise and large flow for the swhpp with this structure luo et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a 2016b 2019 and the main performance parameters of swhpp are shown in table 1 as shown in fig 2

22788,the development of the second generation intact stability criteria is ongoing in the international maritime organization and the level 1 and 2 criteria are almost agreed however validation verification studies of the level 2 criteria remain to be insufficient herein the mean frequencies of grim s effective waves are used and compared with the draught of the second check of the level 2 criteria for parametric roll therefore the encounter frequency assumption used in the draught second check is verified additionally it is shown that the number of samples of operational conditions should be at least 24 keywords parametric roll grim s effective wave mean frequency of grim s effective waves second check of the level 2 criteria second generation intact stability criteria 1 introduction the international maritime organization imo has been developing the second generation intact stability criteria which consist of most simplified criteria as the level 1 vulnerability criteria moderately simplified criteria as the level 2 vulnerability criteria the direct use of time domain numerical simulation in irregular waves as the direct stability assessment and operational criteria as the operational limitation guidance among them their level 1 and 2 criteria are almost agreed for pure loss of stability parametric roll surf riding broaching and dead ship condition imo 2015 2016 recent studies of the second generation intact stability criteria have focussed on four topics japan 2017 consistency between the level 1 and 2 criteria numerical modelling and possible simplification of the direct stability assessment operational limitation guidance and standards of excessive acceleration which are critical issues for establishing the second generation intact stability criteria in addition validations verifications of the level 2 criteria are important topics which remain to be an issue parametric roll is a dangerous roll phenomenon that needs to be covered by the second generation intact stability criteria this roll phenomenon is induced by periodic changes of the roll restoring coefficient mainly in longitudinal waves and could lead to loss and damage of cargoes a c11 class post panamax container ship lost more than 400 units in 1998 france et al 2003 and an 8160 teu container ship lost 517 units in 2014 danish maritime accident investigation board 2014 a phenomenon excited by periodic changes of a restoring coefficient such as parametric roll is classified to be a parametric oscillation and it can be estimated by a mathieu type equation by using the mathieu type equation the threshold for the occurrence of parametric roll can be obtained as follow 1 δ g m g m 4 α ω ϕ here gm is the metacentric height δgm is the amplitude of the gm variation α is linear roll damping coefficient and ω ϕ is the natural roll frequency the level 1 criterion against parametric roll requires the roll restoring variation not to exceed this threshold for the level 2 criteria against parametric roll the vulnerability is examined by estimating the occurrence probability of unsafe wave conditions there are two options first check and second check to assess the likelihood of dangerous parametric roll the first check employs the same idea as the level 1 criteria but explicitly considers the wave profile effect on a restoring variation the draught of the second check employs a mathieu equation with nonlinear restoring and damping moments estimates parametric roll amplitudes with various ship forward speeds in longitudinal waves and judges a condition to be dangerous when the amplitude exceeds 25 imo 2015 to estimate the parametric roll amplitude umeda et al proposed a mathieu type equation with quintic restoring cubic damping and direct wave excitation as an uncoupled roll model and applied an averaging method umeda et al 2004 this approach forms the foundation of the draught of the second check of the level 2 criteria against parametric roll imo 2016 the amplitude of the wave induced gm variation does not increase in proportion with the incident wave height hence the grim s effective concept grim 1961 is introduced to the current draught of the second check to convert the gm variation in irregular waves to that in equivalent regular waves by using this concept the vulnerability for parametric roll is estimated in regular longitudinal waves by sinusoidally changing the ship speed to simplify the criteria the frequency of gm variation is assumed to be equal to a wave encounter frequency in a wave whose length is equal to the ship length and is estimated by using the dispersion relation of deep water waves however the grim s effective waves are not considered as propagating waves because they are a variation of water surface along the ship whose instantaneous profile follows a cosine function thus the dispersion relation cannot be directly applied to grim s effective waves the wave encounter frequency needs to be calculated from grim s effective wave spectrum to examine this point we estimate parametric roll amplitudes using the mean frequencies of grim s effective waves and compare the vulnerabilities derived from the mean frequency with the current draught our results show good agreement demonstrating the appropriateness of the assumption used in the draught additionally it is shown that number of samples of operational conditions for ship courses should be at least 24 2 mathematical model 2 1 uncoupled roll model the level 2 criteria for parametric roll in the draught of the second generation intact stability criteria employ an uncoupled roll model to estimate parametric roll amplitudes the time varying restoring moments in waves are represented by the sum of calm water restoring and gm variation in waves as shown in eq 2 umeda et al 2004 2 ϕ 2 α ϕ γ ϕ 3 ω ϕ 2 g m m e a n g m g m a m p g m cos ω e t ϕ 1 π 2 ϕ 3 ω ϕ 2 ϕ l 3 ϕ 3 l 5 ϕ 5 0 here α and γ are the damping coefficients estimated by ikeda s simplified method kawahara et al 2012 with the lift component of ikeda s original method ikeda 2004 the symbol ω is the wave frequency and the subscripts ϕ and e represent the natural roll frequency and the wave encounter frequency respectively gm mean and gm amp are the mean and amplitude of the wave induced gm variation respectively l 3 and l 5 are the cubic and quintic coefficients of the hydrostatically calculated calm water gz curve divided by gm respectively 2 2 grim s effective wave detailed derivations of an extension of the grim s effective wave concept for short crested quartering waves made by umeda and yamakoshi 1991 are shown in the appendix the grim s effective wave was proposed to stochastically deal with nonlinear gm variations in irregular waves to convert irregular waves into longitudinal waves whose length is equal to the ship length the least squares method is applied and the wave profile along the ship is approximated by a cosine curve herein it is assumed that the gm variation amplitude is largest in longitudinal waves whose length is equal to the ship length and that the gm has maximum and minimum values at a wave trough and crest respectively the amplitude of a single oblique wave with frequency ω is converted into the effective amplitude of a longitudinal wave defined by 3 ζ a e g ω l p p χ ζ a g ω l p p χ ω 2 g l p p cos χ sin ω 2 2 g l p p cos χ π 2 ω 2 2 g l p p cos χ 2 where χ is the angle formed by the ship course with respect to the wave propagating direction g is the gravitational acceleration l pp is the ship length ζ a is the amplitude of the incident wave and ζ ae is the effective wave amplitude furthermore the spectrum of irregular waves is written as 4 s η e f f ω l p p α g ω l p p χ 2 s ω α where α is the wave propagating direction of each individual wave and s ω α and sη eff ω l pp α are the incident wave spectrum and grim s effective wave spectrum respectively then we derive the significant effective wave height based on the ittc spectrum as imo 2016 5 h e f f 4 0043 m 0 m n α π 2 α π 2 ω 0 ω ω n s η e f f ω l p p α d ω d α s ω a ω 5 exp b ω 4 a 173 h s 2 t 01 4 b 691 t 01 4 t 01 1 086 t z where h eff is the grim s effective wave height m n is the n th moment of the grim s effective wave spectrum h s is the significant wave height m and t z is the zero crossing mean wave period s notably h s and t z are taken from a wave scatter diagram in the north atlantic ocean iacs 2001 the mean wave encounter frequency ω e is defined to be the zero crossing mean frequency and is written as 6 ω e 0 ω ω 2 g u cos χ 2 s η e f f ω l p p χ d ω 0 s η e f f ω l p p χ d ω where u is the ship speed notably instead of eq 6 the current draught uses 7 ω e ω l ω l 2 g u cos χ where ω l 2 π g l p p and ω l is the frequency of the wave whose length is equal to the ship length derived from the dispersion relation of deep water waves 2 3 current draught of criteria we explain briefly the basic idea and procedure of the current draught of the second check since parametric roll is a roll resonance the wave encounter frequency governs the amplitude which depends on the ship speed and course hashimoto et al 2011 therefore the magnitude of the parametric roll needs to be examined for various ship speeds then the encounter frequencies are estimated in the current draught second check based on the assumption that a ship runs with service speed in different directions and each course is chosen with the same probability therefore the ship speed in the wave direction is obtained for each heading angle and shall be used for calculating the wave encounter frequency herein it is implicitly assumed that the gm variation due to waves is maximum in longitudinal waves so that the restoring variation is calculated for longitudinal waves for a simplicity sake the properties of longitudinal waves are estimated by the grim s effective wave concept as shown in section 2 2 therefore the vulnerability for parametric roll is examined in regular longitudinal waves by systematically changing the ship speed in the wave direction as eqs 8 10 imo 2015 8 c 2 1 n 1 k 0 n c 2 k u k 9 u k u max cos k n π k 0 1 2 n 10 c 2 k u k i 1 n w i c i u k where c2 is the dangerous wave occurrence probability to be used for examining the vulnerability n is the number of samples of operational conditions u k is the calculated ship speed in the wave direction and u max is the maximum ship speed notably the positive and negative u k indicates that the ship runs in following and heading waves respectively w i is the occurrence probability of the i th wave case and n is the number of wave cases c i u k has a value of one when the parametric roll amplitude in the i th wave case with ship speed u k exceeds 25 otherwise it has a value of zero to judge the accident of the c11 class post panamax containership as danger and to properly represent sample calculation using more than hundred existing ships the draught of the second check requires that the index c2 should be less than 0 06 imo 2015 3 averaging method temporal discretization methods such as the runge kutta method can be used to provide reliable solutions to nonlinear differential equations however obtaining all solutions is not straightforward herein we employ an averaging method hayashi 1985 which is one of the widely known methods to obtain periodic solutions of nonlinear differential equations and the parametric roll amplitude from eq 2 umeda et al 2004 maki et al 2011 and sakai et al 2018 have previously applied the averaging method to eq 2 3 1 applying the averaging method we rewrite eq 2 as eq 11 with a perturbation parameter ε 11 ϕ ω ˆ 2 ϕ ε f ϕ ϕ t this form is based on the assumption that the natural roll frequency is almost the same as the parametric roll frequency ω ˆ and that the damping and nonlinear components can be considered to be sufficiently small we assume that the periodic solutions of eq 11 are related to the general solutions when ε is zero such that 12 ϕ a cos ω ˆ t ξ ϕ ω ˆ a sin ω ˆ t ξ following the procedure of the averaging method the differential equations of a and ξ are obtained as 13 a α a 3 8 γ ω 2 a 3 1 4 ω ϕ 2 ω m a 1 1 2 π 2 a 2 sin 2 ξ 14 ξ ω ˆ 2 1 2 ω ϕ 2 ω ˆ 1 f 1 3 4 π 2 a 2 3 4 l 3 a 2 5 8 l 5 a 4 1 4 ω ϕ 2 ω ˆ m 1 1 π 2 a 2 cos 2 ξ where 15 f g m m e a n g m m g m a m p g m by setting the time derivatives of eqs 13 and 14 to zero the parameters a and ξ can be determined 4 calculations we estimate the parametric roll amplitudes using the averaging method by using two different methods for the wave encounter frequencies as eqs 6 and 7 thus verifying the draught second check criteria 4 1 subject ship and calculation conditions a c11 class post panamax container ship is used as the subject ship this ship has experienced heavy roll in actual seas due to parametric roll france et al 2003 hence this case is used to determine the standard of vulnerability indexes in the second generation intact stability criteria for parametric roll the gz curve in calm water is approximated by a quintic equation as shown in fig 1 the principal particulars are shown in table 1 5 results figs 2 and 3 show the comparison of c2 k u k in eq 10 and c2 in eq 8 derived using the mean frequencies of grim s effective waves and the wave frequency used in the draught second check the white circles represent results using the mean frequencies of grim s effective waves while the crosses represent results using the current draught of the second check fig 2 shows a slight shift of the peak of the current draught of the second check towards higher speeds in following waves however the difference between the two cases is not significant fig 3 also shows similar results between the two cases but clarifies that n 6 which was tentatively adopted by the imo imo 2015 is not sufficient this is because the value of c2 for n 6 could change if the number of samples of operational conditions increases it is essential to use the converged value of c2 for the c11 class post panamax containership when the number of samples of operational conditions increases fig 3 indicates that c2 value for n 6 is too large and c2 values for n 12 and n 18 are slightly smaller than the converged value thus c2 value for n 24 or larger can be regarded as a candidate for the threshold for the second check of the level 2 vulnerability criteria since the c2 values for n 24 are less than 0 06 the standard value 0 06 should be reduced so that the c11 class post panamax containership fails to pass the criteria it is noteworthy here that this number of samples of operational conditions is suitable at least for the c11 class post panamax containership to be used for the required value of the second check of the level 2 vulnerability criteria more rigorous approach applicable for any ships is available in japan 2016 by using a method for directly finding the worst speed by sakai et al 2018 6 discussion to investigate why such a simple assumption provides satisfactory approximations as shown in figs 2 and 3 we compare the mean frequencies of grim s effective waves and the frequency assumed in the draught of the second check in figs 4 6 herein the significant wave heights and mean wave frequencies of grim s effective waves are calculated for all sea states appearing in the north atlantic the conditions calculated in figs 4 6 are the zero forward speed the service speed in heading waves and the service speed in following waves the horizontal axis represents the corresponding non dimensionalised frequency with respect to the encounter frequency assumed in the draught of the second check for each calculated condition the black chain line which is located at a value of one in the horizontal axis indicates the frequency assumed in the draught of the second check figs 4 6 show that when the height of the effective waves is greater than 2 0 m the mean frequency is distributed near that of the draught of the second check this guarantees that assuming the wave frequency to be λ l pp 1 can represent the gm variation frequency the reason for the agreement shown in fig 4 is further demonstrated in fig 7 which shows that the transfer function g ω l pp χ 2 has the largest peak around the wave frequency of λ l pp 1 the smaller peaks of the transfer function can also explain the irregular waves converted into grim s effective waves whose non dimensionalised mean encounter frequencies are around 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 in fig 4 7 conclusions we verified the encounter frequency effect on the draught of the second check for parametric roll by a rigorous approach using the mean frequencies of grim s effective waves we showed that the gm variation frequency can be approximated using the frequency of waves with λ l pp 1 furthermore we showed that the number of samples of operational conditions should be at least n 24 to obtain a reliable value for c2 acknowledgements this work was supported by a grants in aid for scientific research from the japan society for the promotion of

eq a 7 the mean wave encounter frequency can be obtained as eq 6 
22788,the development of the second generation intact stability criteria is ongoing in the international maritime organization and the level 1 and 2 criteria are almost agreed however validation verification studies of the level 2 criteria remain to be insufficient herein the mean frequencies of grim s effective waves are used and compared with the draught of the second check of the level 2 criteria for parametric roll therefore the encounter frequency assumption used in the draught second check is verified additionally it is shown that the number of samples of operational conditions should be at least 24 keywords parametric roll grim s effective wave mean frequency of grim s effective waves second check of the level 2 criteria second generation intact stability criteria 1 introduction the international maritime organization imo has been developing the second generation intact stability criteria which consist of most simplified criteria as the level 1 vulnerability criteria moderately simplified criteria as the level 2 vulnerability criteria the direct use of time domain numerical simulation in irregular waves as the direct stability assessment and operational criteria as the operational limitation guidance among them their level 1 and 2 criteria are almost agreed for pure loss of stability parametric roll surf riding broaching and dead ship condition imo 2015 2016 recent studies of the second generation intact stability criteria have focussed on four topics japan 2017 consistency between the level 1 and 2 criteria numerical modelling and possible simplification of the direct stability assessment operational limitation guidance and standards of excessive acceleration which are critical issues for establishing the second generation intact stability criteria in addition validations verifications of the level 2 criteria are important topics which remain to be an issue parametric roll is a dangerous roll phenomenon that needs to be covered by the second generation intact stability criteria this roll phenomenon is induced by periodic changes of the roll restoring coefficient mainly in longitudinal waves and could lead to loss and damage of cargoes a c11 class post panamax container ship lost more than 400 units in 1998 france et al 2003 and an 8160 teu container ship lost 517 units in 2014 danish maritime accident investigation board 2014 a phenomenon excited by periodic changes of a restoring coefficient such as parametric roll is classified to be a parametric oscillation and it can be estimated by a mathieu type equation by using the mathieu type equation the threshold for the occurrence of parametric roll can be obtained as follow 1 δ g m g m 4 α ω ϕ here gm is the metacentric height δgm is the amplitude of the gm variation α is linear roll damping coefficient and ω ϕ is the natural roll frequency the level 1 criterion against parametric roll requires the roll restoring variation not to exceed this threshold for the level 2 criteria against parametric roll the vulnerability is examined by estimating the occurrence probability of unsafe wave conditions there are two options first check and second check to assess the likelihood of dangerous parametric roll the first check employs the same idea as the level 1 criteria but explicitly considers the wave profile effect on a restoring variation the draught of the second check employs a mathieu equation with nonlinear restoring and damping moments estimates parametric roll amplitudes with various ship forward speeds in longitudinal waves and judges a condition to be dangerous when the amplitude exceeds 25 imo 2015 to estimate the parametric roll amplitude umeda et al proposed a mathieu type equation with quintic restoring cubic damping and direct wave excitation as an uncoupled roll model and applied an averaging method umeda et al 2004 this approach forms the foundation of the draught of the second check of the level 2 criteria against parametric roll imo 2016 the amplitude of the wave induced gm variation does not increase in proportion with the incident wave height hence the grim s effective concept grim 1961 is introduced to the current draught of the second check to convert the gm variation in irregular waves to that in equivalent regular waves by using this concept the vulnerability for parametric roll is estimated in regular longitudinal waves by sinusoidally changing the ship speed to simplify the criteria the frequency of gm variation is assumed to be equal to a wave encounter frequency in a wave whose length is equal to the ship length and is estimated by using the dispersion relation of deep water waves however the grim s effective waves are not considered as propagating waves because they are a variation of water surface along the ship whose instantaneous profile follows a cosine function thus the dispersion relation cannot be directly applied to grim s effective waves the wave encounter frequency needs to be calculated from grim s effective wave spectrum to examine this point we estimate parametric roll amplitudes using the mean frequencies of grim s effective waves and compare the vulnerabilities derived from the mean frequency with the current draught our results show good agreement demonstrating the appropriateness of the assumption used in the draught additionally it is shown that number of samples of operational conditions for ship courses should be at least 24 2 mathematical model 2 1 uncoupled roll model the level 2 criteria for parametric roll in the draught of the second generation intact stability criteria employ an uncoupled roll model to estimate parametric roll amplitudes the time varying restoring moments in waves are represented by the sum of calm water restoring and gm variation in waves as shown in eq 2 umeda et al 2004 2 ϕ 2 α ϕ γ ϕ 3 ω ϕ 2 g m m e a n g m g m a m p g m cos ω e t ϕ 1 π 2 ϕ 3 ω ϕ 2 ϕ l 3 ϕ 3 l 5 ϕ 5 0 here α and γ are the damping coefficients estimated by ikeda s simplified method kawahara et al 2012 with the lift component of ikeda s original method ikeda 2004 the symbol ω is the wave frequency and the subscripts ϕ and e represent the natural roll frequency and the wave encounter frequency respectively gm mean and gm amp are the mean and amplitude of the wave induced gm variation respectively l 3 and l 5 are the cubic and quintic coefficients of the hydrostatically calculated calm water gz curve divided by gm respectively 2 2 grim s effective wave detailed derivations of an extension of the grim s effective wave concept for short crested quartering waves made by umeda and yamakoshi 1991 are shown in the appendix the grim s effective wave was proposed to stochastically deal with nonlinear gm variations in irregular waves to convert irregular waves into longitudinal waves whose length is equal to the ship length the least squares method is applied and the wave profile along the ship is approximated by a cosine curve herein it is assumed that the gm variation amplitude is largest in longitudinal waves whose length is equal to the ship length and that the gm has maximum and minimum values at a wave trough and crest respectively the amplitude of a single oblique wave with frequency ω is converted into the effective amplitude of a longitudinal wave defined by 3 ζ a e g ω l p p χ ζ a g ω l p p χ ω 2 g l p p cos χ sin ω 2 2 g l p p cos χ π 2 ω 2 2 g l p p cos χ 2 where χ is the angle formed by the ship course with respect to the wave propagating direction g is the gravitational acceleration l pp is the ship length ζ a is the amplitude of the incident wave and ζ ae is the effective wave amplitude furthermore the spectrum of irregular waves is written as 4 s η e f f ω l p p α g ω l p p χ 2 s ω α where α is the wave propagating direction of each individual wave and s ω α and sη eff ω l pp α are the incident wave spectrum and grim s effective wave spectrum respectively then we derive the significant effective wave height based on the ittc spectrum as imo 2016 5 h e f f 4 0043 m 0 m n α π 2 α π 2 ω 0 ω ω n s η e f f ω l p p α d ω d α s ω a ω 5 exp b ω 4 a 173 h s 2 t 01 4 b 691 t 01 4 t 01 1 086 t z where h eff is the grim s effective wave height m n is the n th moment of the grim s effective wave spectrum h s is the significant wave height m and t z is the zero crossing mean wave period s notably h s and t z are taken from a wave scatter diagram in the north atlantic ocean iacs 2001 the mean wave encounter frequency ω e is defined to be the zero crossing mean frequency and is written as 6 ω e 0 ω ω 2 g u cos χ 2 s η e f f ω l p p χ d ω 0 s η e f f ω l p p χ d ω where u is the ship speed notably instead of eq 6 the current draught uses 7 ω e ω l ω l 2 g u cos χ where ω l 2 π g l p p and ω l is the frequency of the wave whose length is equal to the ship length derived from the dispersion relation of deep water waves 2 3 current draught of criteria we explain briefly the basic idea and procedure of the current draught of the second check since parametric roll is a roll resonance the wave encounter frequency governs the amplitude which depends on the ship speed and course hashimoto et al 2011 therefore the magnitude of the parametric roll needs to be examined for various ship speeds then the encounter frequencies are estimated in the current draught second check based on the assumption that a ship runs with service speed in different directions and each course is chosen with the same probability therefore the ship speed in the wave direction is obtained for each heading angle and shall be used for calculating the wave encounter frequency herein it is implicitly assumed that the gm variation due to waves is maximum in longitudinal waves so that the restoring variation is calculated for longitudinal waves for a simplicity sake the properties of longitudinal waves are estimated by the grim s effective wave concept as shown in section 2 2 therefore the vulnerability for parametric roll is examined in regular longitudinal waves by systematically changing the ship speed in the wave direction as eqs 8 10 imo 2015 8 c 2 1 n 1 k 0 n c 2 k u k 9 u k u max cos k n π k 0 1 2 n 10 c 2 k u k i 1 n w i c i u k where c2 is the dangerous wave occurrence probability to be used for examining the vulnerability n is the number of samples of operational conditions u k is the calculated ship speed in the wave direction and u max is the maximum ship speed notably the positive and negative u k indicates that the ship runs in following and heading waves respectively w i is the occurrence probability of the i th wave case and n is the number of wave cases c i u k has a value of one when the parametric roll amplitude in the i th wave case with ship speed u k exceeds 25 otherwise it has a value of zero to judge the accident of the c11 class post panamax containership as danger and to properly represent sample calculation using more than hundred existing ships the draught of the second check requires that the index c2 should be less than 0 06 imo 2015 3 averaging method temporal discretization

22789,in this paper a novel version of orthonormal polynomial series expansion method is developed to analyze vibrations of bottom hull panels due to moving impacting fluid loads the initial phase of slamming is considered in the presented mathematical model wherein an elastic linear euler bernoulli beam of uniform thickness mimics the bottom panel structural behaviour the framework developed suppresses the gibbs phenomenon and captures the beam deflection flexural moment and shear force by direct integration the proposed solution exhibits a higher convergence rate compared to the conventional method in terms of the number of involved shape functions keywords slamming orthonormal polynomial convergence rate bottom hull panel 1 introduction a prominent consideration in the design of marine structures is the influence of a specific category of moving loads which produce hydrodynamic structural vibration caused by impacting waves these wave impacts lead to moving loads with large peaks traversing the bottom panels of floating bodies well known as slamming loads which may damage the structure and lead to fatigue therefore ongoing studies by many researchers have been attempting to develop experimental and numerical models for accurate dynamic response prediction of floating bodies subject to slamming loads faltinsen 2000 temarel et al 2016 wang and soares 2017 kapsenberg 2011 allen and battley 2015 full simulation of hydroelastic fluid structure interactions during slamming requires complex and voluminous calculations imposing a notable computational burden codes of practice in the design of highspeed crafts are typically simplified based on semi empirical approach treating the slamming pressure as a uniform static load on the hull panel american bureau of shipping abs 2013 however it is underlined by other researchers lv and grenestedt 2015 that this simplification may lead to loss of precision preventing a reasonable and reliable design accordingly vibration study of hull panels and pressure distribution of slamming loads were studied in different research works stenius et al 2011 simulated the hydrodynamic panel water impact of high speed craft using the finite element method fem and the eigenfunction expansion method for a thin beam incorporating inertial hydroelastic terms they indicated that hydroelastic effects can either amplify or decrease the dynamic response of the bottom panels investigation of hydroelasticity in marine panels was conducted by stenius et al 2013 through a large number of experiments providing semi empirical expressions for the pressure distribution they also performed quasi static solutions using fem by obtaining pressure values from a rigid wedge model slamming can be considered as a two phase loading scenario the initial phase during which a high intensity peak pressure followed by a roughly uniform pressure traverses the beam length and the vibration phase after the peak pressure leaves the beam the maximum dynamic response of hull panel in the course of the initial phase of slamming has been widely analyzed by lv and grenestedt 2013 through fourier sine transform and laplace carson transform in space and time respectively they considered an undamped simply supported euler bernoulli beam with a simplified two step load pattern they also followed their study by further exploration of the beam dynamic response in the vibration phase lv and grenestedt 2015 datta and siddiqui 2016 applied a semi analytical solution based on modal expansion method for a timoshenko beam with elastic rotational end conditions taking account of compressive axial force they studied the dynamic flexural and shear forces against hydrodynamic slamming loads different deadrise angles and beam end fixation rigidities the slamming pressure based on wagner theory wagner 1932 was used by wang and soares 2017 to accomplish a hydroelastic analysis of a kirchhoff plate using the modal expansion method they demonstrated that hydroelastic effects will be insignificant for low impact velocity and small wetted radial length of the wave wang and soares 2018 established a simplified model to capture the dynamic response of an elastic wedge by analytical modal analysis of a thin beam with different classical boundary conditions together with an analytical model of the pressure they verified their analytical results by a completely coupled model assuming arbitrary lagrangian eulerian in ls dyna software yu et al 2018 studied the dynamic interaction of a 3d wedge by normal mode method with fem discretization they remarked that the structural damping is not prominent prior to the flow separation whilst it can suppress the vibrations after the flow separation series expansion methods are extensively used in the moving load problems ebrahimi et al 2015 hassanabadi et al 2016 khoraskani et al 2016 ouyang 2011 yamchelou and nouri 2016 an overview of the published literature on the slamming induced vibrations of structures also reveals that analytical series expansion methods have been widely used to calculate vibration of bottom panels under slamming impact loads where a

carried out to ascertain the validity of the presented new modified method then the gibbs effects are illustrated and discussed with regard to the precision of approximate solution using a truncated series of the basic orthonormal polynomials eventually the convergence rate of the developed method is examined and compared to the conventional orthonormal polynomial series expansion method which will be referred to as conventional method hereafter 3 1 verification the presented method is applicable to general boundary conditions based on the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method it is convenient to handle different classical boundary conditions encompassing any combinations of clamped free and hinged hassanabadi et al 2013 for the purpose of assessing and verifying the developed solution a simply supported beam of length l 0 5 m is assumed the beam represents a strip of a steel bottom panel with unit width young s modulus e 210 gpa density ρ 7850 k g m 3 and deadrise angle β 10 the density of water is ρ w 1000 k g m 3 the beam is assumed to have zero initial conditions that is zero deflection and velocity the vertical speed of impact is constant and equals v 4 m s time histories of beam maximum deflection calculated by the present method using two orthonormal shape functions n 2 is plotted in fig 2 for three different beam thicknesses b 6 mm 12 mm and 25 mm the beam deflection is normalized by dividing the maximum dynamic response of the beam by the maximum static deflection maximum static response when the pressure peak passes the beam length the corresponding plots generated via modal expansion method with five modes from wang and soares 2018 are also provided in fig 2 as well it can be observed that the trend and amplitude of response time histories computed by the developed modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method agrees closely with those obtained by the modal expansion method 3 2 gibbs phenomenon gibbs phenomenon refers to the undesirable behaviour of fourier series representation of a piecewise differentiable original function with abrupt jump stade 2011 due to the jump at the discontinuity the quantities of series exhibit high oscillations in the neighbourhood of the original function s jump this leads to inaccurate calculations about the discontinuity point due to underestimation or overestimation of values by the finite series likewise orthonormal polynomial series expansion approximation of the beam responses due to slamming suffers from the gibbs effects this is due to the discontinuity of the pressure function derivatives as illustrated by an example in fig 3 this figure shows plots of normalized pressure function for different deadrise angles in this plot the horizontal axis is the normalized position along the beam length η l and the vertical axis is the normalized pressure it is evident that by decreasing the deadrise angle a spike emerges in the pressure where further reduction of deadrise angle intensifies the magnitude of this spike as the derivatives of pressure in the dry portion of the beam suddenly changes to zero this causes discontinuity in the distribution of the pressure derivatives along the beam length next replication of pressure on the beam using a series of basic orthonormal polynomials is further discussed conventional method in fact uses galerkin projection of the governing equation onto an orthonormal space spanned by the basic orthonormal polynomials thereby enforces the time varying multipliers a j t such that eq 11 holds the right side of eq 11 represents the coordinate of pressure function in the space defined by basic orthonormal polynomials ϕ j η in other words j 1 n f i t ϕ i η converges to p η t if n ranges to infinity to illustrate the convergence of the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method for pressure the approximation of p η t in form of finite series j 1 n f i t ϕ i η is plotted in figs 4 6 for different deadrise angles the bold line in black demonstrates the exact pressure functions defined by eq 8 which is being approximated by the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method with a different number of basic orthonormal polynomials as shown by color lines to ease the visualization of contributing shape functions 3 d plots of j 1 n f i t ϕ i η versus n are also provided in figs 4 6 for β 50 in fig 4 the pressure distribution p η t is rather smooth compared to β 20 and β 10 in figs 5 and 6 which rapid changes near the dry zone of the beam can be observed it is evident that the oscillatory behaviour of the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method right after the pressure peak is more pronounced for β 10 compared to higher deadrise angles it is also worth to note that gibbs effects are present at η 0 owing to the value of p η t at η 0 which is not consistent with the boundary conditions of the simply supported beam p 0 t 0 while ϕ i 0 0 as a consequence the approximation of p η t via a truncated series of shape functions which satisfies the beam boundary constraints ϕ i 0 ϕ i l 0 leads to the appearance of gibbs effects near the support of the beam at η 0 on the contrary a smooth approximation can be observed nearby the other end of the beam at η l as the pressure has zero value which is complies with the essential boundary condition of the basic orthonormal polynomials at this location it can also be noted that for smaller deadrise angle β 10 the series conforms slowly to the spike of the pressure as described above the gibbs phenomenon deteriorates the precision of the replication of the pressure via series expansion therefore as eq 11 implies the adverse effects caused by the gibbs phenomenon must influence the calculation of the beam response next the effects of this issue are further explored in assessing the convergence rates of the beam deflection flexural moment and shear force by comparing the conventional method and the improved results achieved by the developed modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method 3 3 comparison of the conventional method and the proposed modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method to assess the rate of convergence of the presented approach a simply supported beam of length l 0 5 m span is assumed as a representation of a strip of steel bottom panel with unit width 6 mm thickness young s modulus e 200 gpa density ρ 7800 k g m 3 the density of water is ρ w 1000 k g m 3 the beam is initially at rest and the vertical speed of impact is constant and equals to v 5 m s in figs 7 9 the beam deflection flexural moment and shear force are plotted against a different number of the contributing basic orthonormal polynomials i e n 1 2 3 4 5 10 20 40 the horizontal axes in these figures are normalized coordinate along the beam length η l and the vertical axes are the normalized response of the beam the normalized response of the beam is calculated by dividing the beam dynamic response by its maximum static response maximum static response when the pressure peak passes the beam length in fig 7 the convergence of the modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method and conventional method is examined for deadrise angle β 60 for which as discussed earlier the pressure distribution is rather smooth with moderate variation along the beam as it is evident from the plot of beam deflection flexural moment and shear force using more than one basic orthonormal polynomial for the modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method does not make an appreciable improvement in the precision such that no change in the quality of results can be observed within the scale of the diagrams however to achieve the same order of accuracy with the conventional method at least three basic orthonormal polynomials for deflection five basic orthonormal polynomials for flexural moment and 10 basic orthonormal polynomials for shear force must be employed the deadrise angle is decreased to β 30 for the numerical examples in fig 8 in order to increase the abrupt jump of pressure and intensify gibbs effects again for beam deflection flexural moment and shear force the modified method features very negligible improvement in the precision for a number of basic orthonormal polynomials higher than one which is an indication of the rapid converging rate of the presented method to attain the same level of accuracy in the conventional method at least 3 5 and 20 basic orthonormal polynomials are required for deflection flexural moment and shear force respectively by decreasing the deadrise angle to β 10 a high intensity spike of pressure is examined in the responses of beam plotted in fig 9 it should be also noticed that the speed at which the pressure traverses the beam length significantly increases for this deadrise angle therefore the higher modes of the beam are excited and the inertial term pertaining to the distributed mass of the beam i e ρ a 2 t 2 w η t in eq 12 requires higher modes to converge consequently the modified method with more than two basic orthonormal polynomials exhibits negligible improvement in the accuracy while in the previous examples in figs 7 and 8 merely one basic orthonormal polynomial was needed to attain the same level of precision similarly for the presented modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method due to the increased contribution of higher modes in ρ a 2 t 2 w η t the flexural moment and shear force require at least two basic orthonormal polynomials to achieve error less than 1 5 with closer attention to conventional method a remarkable error for one basic orthonormal polynomial can be acknowledged compared to the modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method whereby even employing merely one mode much closer results to those computed by n 40 is attained finally it can be concluded that the presented method is rapidly converging in comparison with the conventional method this can be attributed to different manner of calculating beam deflection flexural moment and shear force in this paper as given in eqs 13 22 and 23 in the conventional method the displacement field is computed by directly considering series expansion in eq 9 and the bending moment and shear force are calculated based on 24 m η t e i j 1 n a j t 2 x 2 ϕ j η 25 q η t e i j 1 n a j t 3 x 3 ϕ j η which decreases the speed of convergence this can be justified as eq 25 is the first derivative of eq 24 and by differentiating eq 25 the distribution of external load will be achieved purely by series expansion e i j 1 n a j t 4 x 4 ϕ j η the aforesaid series is expected to conform to pressure distribution p η t where the abrupt change of pressure function produces gibbs effects as was discussed in section 3 2 the gibbs effect is suppressed in the current solution as the reproduction of the response is not dependent on the spatial derivatives of the shape functions with regard to eqs 13 22 and 23 the functions p 4 η t p 2 η t and p 1 η t are used in the present method to calculate beam deflection flexural moment and shear force which are calculated by directly integrating the pressure function four two and one time s respectively in so doing the effects of discontinuity of p η t derivatives are being reflected in the response of the beam by exact integrations instead of purely relying on series expansion as in eqs 24 and 25 4 conclusions in this article the vibration of hull panels subject to slamming loads has been analyzed using a new version of orthonormal polynomial series expansion method in the presented version of the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method an efficient framework is proposed to attain the response of the structure the developed method does not require employing higher derivatives of orthonormal shape functions to post process the displacement field and internal forces in return it is based on the successive direct integration of the shape functions and pressure function consequently the gibbs effects are remarkably suppressed the number of contributing orthonormal shape functions has been widely probed in the computation of beam deflection flexural moment and shear force for both the developed modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method and the conventional method being free of spatial derivatives of basic orthonormal polynomials the current method is capable of yielding rapidly converging results

suppresses the gibbs phenomenon and captures the beam deflection flexural moment and shear force by direct integration the proposed solution exhibits a higher convergence rate compared to the conventional method in terms of the number of involved shape functions keywords slamming orthonormal polynomial convergence rate bottom hull panel 1 introduction a prominent consideration in the design of marine structures is the influence of a specific category of moving loads which produce hydrodynamic structural vibration caused by impacting waves these wave impacts lead to moving loads with large peaks traversing the bottom panels of floating bodies well known as slamming loads which may damage the structure and lead to fatigue therefore ongoing studies by many researchers have been attempting to develop experimental and numerical models for accurate dynamic response prediction of floating bodies subject to slamming loads faltinsen 2000 temarel et al 2016 wang and soares 2017 kapsenberg 2011 allen and battley 2015 full simulation of hydroelastic fluid structure interactions during slamming requires complex and voluminous calculations imposing a notable computational burden codes of practice in the design of highspeed crafts are typically simplified based on semi empirical approach treating the slamming pressure as a uniform static load on the hull panel american bureau of shipping abs 2013 however it is underlined by other researchers lv and grenestedt 2015 that this simplification may lead to loss of precision preventing a reasonable and reliable design accordingly vibration study of hull panels and pressure distribution of slamming loads were studied in different research works stenius et al 2011 simulated the hydrodynamic panel water impact of high speed craft using the finite element method fem and the eigenfunction expansion method for a thin beam incorporating inertial hydroelastic terms they indicated that hydroelastic effects can either amplify or decrease the dynamic response of the bottom panels investigation of hydroelasticity in marine panels was conducted by stenius et al 2013 through a large number of experiments providing semi empirical expressions for the pressure distribution they also performed quasi static solutions using fem by obtaining pressure values from a rigid wedge model slamming can be considered as a two phase loading scenario the initial phase during which a high intensity peak pressure followed by a roughly uniform pressure traverses the beam length and the vibration phase after the peak pressure leaves the beam the maximum dynamic response of hull panel in the course of the initial phase of slamming has been widely analyzed by lv and grenestedt 2013 through fourier sine transform and laplace carson transform in space and time respectively they considered an undamped simply supported euler bernoulli beam with a simplified two step load pattern they also followed their study by further exploration of the beam dynamic response in the vibration phase lv and grenestedt 2015 datta and siddiqui 2016 applied a semi analytical solution based on modal expansion method for a timoshenko beam with elastic rotational end conditions taking account of compressive axial force they studied the dynamic flexural and shear forces against hydrodynamic slamming loads different deadrise angles and beam end fixation rigidities the slamming pressure based on wagner theory wagner 1932 was used by wang and soares 2017 to accomplish a hydroelastic analysis of a kirchhoff plate using the modal expansion method they demonstrated that hydroelastic effects will be insignificant for low impact velocity and small wetted radial length of the wave wang and soares 2018 established a simplified model to capture the dynamic response of an elastic wedge by analytical modal analysis of a thin beam with different classical boundary conditions together with an analytical model of the pressure they verified their analytical results by a completely coupled model assuming arbitrary lagrangian eulerian in ls dyna software yu et al 2018 studied the dynamic interaction of a 3d wedge by normal mode method with fem discretization they remarked that the structural damping is not prominent prior to the flow separation whilst it can suppress the vibrations after the flow separation series expansion methods are extensively used in the moving load problems ebrahimi et al 2015 hassanabadi et al 2016 khoraskani et al 2016 ouyang 2011 yamchelou and nouri 2016 an overview of the published literature on the slamming induced vibrations of structures also reveals that analytical series expansion methods have been widely used to calculate vibration of bottom panels under slamming impact loads where a

carried out to ascertain the validity of the presented new modified method then the gibbs effects are illustrated and discussed with regard to the precision of approximate solution using a truncated series of the basic orthonormal polynomials eventually the convergence rate of the developed method is examined and compared to the conventional orthonormal polynomial series expansion method which will be referred to as conventional method hereafter 3 1 verification the presented method is applicable to general boundary conditions based on the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method it is convenient to handle different classical boundary conditions encompassing any combinations of clamped free and hinged hassanabadi et al 2013 for the purpose of assessing and verifying the developed solution a simply supported beam of length l 0 5 m is assumed the beam represents a strip of a steel bottom panel with unit width young s modulus e 210 gpa density ρ 7850 k g m 3 and deadrise angle β 10 the density of water is ρ w 1000 k g m 3 the beam is assumed to have zero initial conditions that is zero deflection and velocity the vertical speed of impact is constant and equals v 4 m s time histories of beam maximum deflection calculated by the present method using two orthonormal shape functions n 2 is plotted in fig 2 for three different beam thicknesses b 6 mm 12 mm and 25 mm the beam deflection is normalized by dividing the maximum dynamic response of the beam by the maximum static deflection maximum static response when the pressure peak passes the beam length the corresponding plots generated via modal expansion method with five modes from wang and soares 2018 are also provided in fig 2 as well it can be observed that the trend and amplitude of response time histories computed by the developed modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method agrees closely with those obtained by the modal expansion method 3 2 gibbs phenomenon gibbs phenomenon refers to the undesirable behaviour of fourier series representation of a piecewise differentiable original function with abrupt jump stade 2011 due to the jump at the discontinuity the quantities of series exhibit high oscillations in the neighbourhood of the original function s jump this leads to inaccurate calculations about the discontinuity point due to underestimation or overestimation of values by the finite series likewise orthonormal polynomial series expansion approximation of the beam responses due to slamming suffers from the gibbs effects this is due to the discontinuity of the pressure function derivatives as illustrated by an example in fig 3 this figure shows plots of normalized pressure function for different deadrise angles in this plot the horizontal axis is the normalized position along the beam length η l and the vertical axis is the normalized pressure it is evident that by decreasing the deadrise angle a spike emerges in the pressure where further reduction of deadrise angle intensifies the magnitude of this spike as the derivatives of pressure in the dry portion of the beam suddenly changes to zero this causes discontinuity in the distribution of the pressure derivatives along the beam length next replication of pressure on the beam using a series of basic orthonormal polynomials is further discussed conventional method in fact uses galerkin projection of the governing equation onto an orthonormal space spanned by the basic orthonormal polynomials thereby enforces the time varying multipliers a j t such that eq 11 holds the right side of eq 11 represents the coordinate of pressure function in the space defined by basic orthonormal polynomials ϕ j η in other words j 1 n f i t ϕ i η converges to p η t if n ranges to infinity to illustrate the convergence of the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method for pressure the approximation of p η t in form of finite series j 1 n f i t ϕ i η is plotted in figs 4 6 for different deadrise angles the bold line in black demonstrates the exact pressure functions defined by eq 8 which is being approximated by the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method with a different number of basic orthonormal polynomials as shown by color lines to ease the visualization of contributing shape functions 3 d plots of j 1 n f i t ϕ i η versus n are also provided in figs 4 6 for β 50 in fig 4 the pressure distribution p η t is rather smooth compared to β 20 and β 10 in figs 5 and 6 which rapid changes near the dry zone of the beam can be observed it is evident that the oscillatory behaviour of the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method right after the pressure peak is more pronounced for β 10 compared to higher deadrise angles it is also worth to note that gibbs effects are present at η 0 owing to the value of p η t at η 0 which is not consistent with the boundary conditions of the simply supported beam p 0 t 0 while ϕ i 0 0 as a consequence the approximation of p η t via a truncated series of shape functions which satisfies the beam boundary constraints ϕ i 0 ϕ i l 0 leads to the appearance of gibbs effects near the support of the beam at η 0 on the contrary a smooth approximation can be observed nearby the other end of the beam at η l as the pressure has zero value which is complies with the essential boundary condition of the basic orthonormal polynomials at this location it can also be noted that for smaller deadrise angle β 10 the series conforms slowly to the spike of the pressure as described above the gibbs phenomenon deteriorates the precision of the replication of the pressure via series expansion therefore as eq 11 implies the adverse effects caused by the gibbs phenomenon must influence the calculation of the beam response next the effects of this issue are further explored in assessing the convergence rates of the beam deflection flexural moment and shear force by comparing the conventional method and the improved results achieved by the developed modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method 3 3 comparison of the conventional method and the proposed modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method to assess the rate of convergence of the presented approach a simply supported beam of length l 0 5 m span is assumed as a representation of a strip of steel bottom panel with unit width 6 mm thickness young s modulus e 200 gpa density ρ 7800 k g m 3 the density of water is ρ w 1000 k g m 3 the beam is initially at rest and the vertical speed of impact is constant and equals to v 5 m s in figs 7 9 the beam deflection flexural moment and shear force are plotted against a different number of the contributing basic orthonormal polynomials i e n 1 2 3 4 5 10 20 40 the horizontal axes in these figures are normalized coordinate along the beam length η l and the vertical axes are the normalized response of the beam the normalized response of the beam is calculated by dividing the beam dynamic response by its maximum static response maximum static response when the pressure peak passes the beam length in fig 7 the convergence of the modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method and conventional method is examined for deadrise angle β 60 for which as discussed earlier the pressure distribution is rather smooth with moderate variation along the beam as it is evident from the plot of beam deflection flexural moment and shear force using more than one basic orthonormal polynomial for the modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method does not make an appreciable improvement in the precision such that no change in the quality of results can be observed within the scale of the diagrams however to achieve the same order of accuracy with the conventional method at least three basic orthonormal polynomials for deflection five basic orthonormal polynomials for flexural moment and 10 basic orthonormal polynomials for shear force must be employed the deadrise angle is decreased to β 30 for the numerical examples in fig 8 in order to increase the abrupt jump of pressure and intensify gibbs effects again for beam deflection flexural moment and shear force the modified method features very negligible improvement in the precision for a number of basic orthonormal polynomials higher than one which is an indication of the rapid converging rate of the presented method to attain the same level of accuracy in the conventional method at least 3 5 and 20 basic orthonormal polynomials are required for deflection flexural moment and shear force respectively by decreasing the deadrise angle to β 10 a high intensity spike of pressure is examined in the responses of beam plotted in fig 9 it should be also noticed that the speed at which the pressure traverses the beam length significantly increases for this deadrise angle therefore the higher modes of the beam are excited and the inertial term pertaining to the distributed mass of the beam i e ρ a 2 t 2 w η t in eq 12 requires higher modes to converge consequently the modified method with more than two basic orthonormal polynomials exhibits negligible improvement in the accuracy while in the previous examples in figs 7 and 8 merely one basic orthonormal polynomial was needed to attain the same level of precision similarly for the presented modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method due to the increased contribution of higher modes in ρ a 2 t 2 w η t the flexural moment and shear force require at least two basic orthonormal polynomials to achieve error less than 1 5 with closer attention to conventional method a remarkable error for one basic orthonormal polynomial can be acknowledged compared to the modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method whereby even employing merely one mode much closer results to those computed by n 40 is attained finally it can be concluded that the presented method is rapidly converging in comparison with the conventional method this can be attributed to different manner of calculating beam deflection flexural moment and shear force in this paper as given in eqs 13 22 and 23 in the conventional method the displacement field is computed by directly considering series expansion in eq 9 and the bending moment and shear force are calculated based on 24 m η t e i j 1 n a j t 2 x 2 ϕ j η 25 q η t e i j 1 n a j t 3 x 3 ϕ j η which decreases the speed of convergence this can be justified as eq 25 is the first derivative of eq 24 and by differentiating eq 25 the distribution of external load will be achieved purely by series expansion e i j 1 n a j t 4 x 4 ϕ j η the aforesaid series is expected to conform to pressure distribution p η t where the abrupt change of pressure function produces gibbs effects as was discussed in section 3 2 the gibbs effect is suppressed in the current solution as the reproduction of the response is not dependent on the spatial derivatives of the shape functions with regard to eqs 13 22 and 23 the functions p 4 η t p 2 η t and p 1 η t are used in the present method to calculate beam deflection flexural moment and shear force which are calculated by directly integrating the pressure function four two and one time s respectively in so doing the effects of discontinuity of p η t derivatives are being reflected in the response of the beam by exact integrations instead of purely relying on series expansion as in eqs 24 and 25 4 conclusions in this article the vibration of hull panels subject to slamming loads has been analyzed using a new version of orthonormal polynomial series expansion method in the presented version of the orthonormal polynomial series expansion method an efficient framework is proposed to attain the response of the structure the developed method does not require employing higher derivatives of orthonormal shape functions to post process the displacement field and internal forces in return it is based on the successive direct integration of the shape functions and pressure function consequently the gibbs effects are remarkably suppressed the number of contributing orthonormal shape functions has been widely probed in the computation of beam deflection flexural moment and shear force for both the developed modified orthonormal polynomial series expansion method and the conventional method being free of spatial derivatives of basic orthonormal polynomials the current method is capable of yielding rapidly converging results
