hobushian et al 2017 indicated that trmm 3b42v7 trmm 3b42rt cmorph and hydro estimator hydro underestimated precipitation in the subtropical slopes of the andes and the values of errors reduced during winter qin et al 2014 analyzed the trmm 3b42 trmm 3b42rt cmorph and gsmap1 satellite based products in china and reported that the trmm 3b42 model had more accurate estimations ombadi et al ombadi et al 2018 developed idf curves for the united states using persiann cdr and showed that a significant percentage of the generated idf curves were within the confidence interval of ground based data kyaw et al 2022 developed idf curves for myanmar by using trmm gpm imerg gsmap nrt and gsmap gc the results showed that gpm imerg and generalized extreme value gev were the best satellite and the best fitted distribution respectively doan et al 2022 developed idf curves with gumbel probability distribution for vietnam by using persiann ccs for 12 24 48 and 72 h kourtis et al 2022 developed idf curves with cmorph data and gumbel probability distributions for greece and showed that the accuracy increased under higher return periods javanmard et al 2010 evaluated trmm precipitation products with ground based data over iran and indicated that the trmm underestimated the annual and seasonal precipitation especially in the caspian sea coastline and the zagros mountains regions moazami et al 2016 compared trmm 3b42 rt persiann cmorph and trmm 3b42 v7 precipitation products across iran and showed that trmm 3b42 rt had the highest correlation with the ground based precipitation mosaffa et al 2020 evaluated the ability of different satellite based products chirps v2 0 cmorph persiann persiann cdr sm2rain cci trmm 3b42 v7 persiann ccs and trmm 3b42 rt to estimate the post and near real time precipitation in the karkheh river basin iran the results showed that persiann cdr and persiann ccs showed better estimations due to the complexity of climate systems near real time estimation of precipitation is crucial to mitigate climate disasters such as a flood therefore the abilities of satellite based precipitation in estimating precipitation for different return periods and durations should be quantified most of the earlier studies were focused on the statistical comparison of satellite based precipitation with ground based data i e babaousmail et al 2019 iqbal and athar 2018 mosaffa et al 2020 nashwan et al 2020 sharifi et al 2018 wei et al 2017 while investigations of precipitation in different return periods based on satellite based idf are generally lacking i e marra et al 2017 ombadi et al 2018 moreover a review of studies shows that less effort has been made to evaluate such post real time and near real time satellite precipitation products at a sub daily scale especially over iran this study presented a comprehensive evaluation of three common satellite based precipitation products incuding persiann ccs trmm 3b42rt v7 and cmorph hereafter called persiann trmm and cmorph respectively at 6 hourly daily monthly and annual time scales over iran moreover the satellite based idfs were developed to show the abilities of selected precipitation products in the near real time estimation of precipitation for different return periods this study aims to i evaluate the accuracy of post real time and near real time satellite based idf curves over different return periods and durations ii appraise the ability of the satellite based product to estimate the precipitation at different temporal scales 6 hourly to annual time scales and iii evaluate the accuracy of satellite based precipitation over different climate and topographic conditions of iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with an area of 1 645 000 km2 iran is extended between 25 and 40 n 44 64 e and bordered by the caspian sea to the north and the persian gulf and the oman sea to the south iran is located in arid and semi arid region with mean annual precipitation of 240 mm less than one third of the global precipitation javanmard et al 2010 mountains cover about 60 of the country with two main ranges as the alborz mountains in the north and the zagros mountains in the west and southwest central iran consists of two deserts called dasht e lut and dasht e kavir the combination of the coastal zone mountainous and deserts has a decisive role in the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation across the country where precipitation varies from 1000 mm in the northern areas to less than 50 mm in the central deserts kaboli et al 2021 according to the de martonne method rahimi et al 2013 tabari et al 2014 iran is divided into eight climatic zones extra arid a i 5 arid 5 a i 10 semi arid 10 a i 20 mediterranean 20 a i 24 semi humid 24 a i 28 humid 28 a i 35 pre humid type a 35 a i 55 and pre humid type b a i 55 fig 1 a in this study the altitude of synoptic stations is divided into four categories 24 500 m low altitudes 500 1000 m 1000 1500 m and 1500 2100 m high altitudes fig 1 b satellite based precipitation assessment was performed in these altitude categories 2 2 ground station and satellite data the 52 synoptic stations fig 1 were used in this study with continuous 6 hour precipitation data during 2003 2018 it is worth mentioning that none of these synoptic stations is located in the pre humid type b climate therefore this research has been conducted over the other seven climatic zones the satellite based data used in this study includes persiann ccs and trmm 3b42rt v7 near real time and cmorph post real time precipitation products with hourly time scales the persiann ccs data uses remote sensing techniques and artificial neural networks to estimate the global precipitation using infrared data in an hourly time and resolution of 0 04 0 04 spatial resolution from 2003 with spatial coverage from 60 s to 60 n globally this study considered 3 hour precipitation time series extracted from 2003 to 2018 for satellite precipitation this data is available at https chrsdata eng uci edu hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2007 nguyen et al 2019 the trmm satellite is a joint project between the japan aerospace exploration agency and nasa to monitor precipitation since 1997 it covers the study area between 50 s to 50 n with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and temporal resolution of three hours this data is available at https pmm nasa gov data access download trmm huffman et al 2007 the climate forecasting center cpc has made cmorph database data available to users since december 2002 with a temporal resolution of 30 with two spatial resolutions of 0 25 and 0 07 for the geographical area of 60 s to 60 n this data is available at https climatedataguide ucar edu climate data cmorph cpc morphing technique high resolution precipitation 60 s 60n joyce et al 2004 there are different methods for using satellite data such as interpolation delbari et al 2013 ramahaimandimby et al 2022 as satellite precipitation datasets are spatially continuous and show the precipitation rate per cell according to their spatial resolution the respective geographical cell of each satellite product was chosen in this study for each synoptic station 2 3 bias correction since satellite precipitation estimation is exposed to significant systematic errors and the application of this data causes uncertainty in the output it is necessary to correct such products this study corrected the precipitation data of three selected satellites using the power bias correction method this method uses a nonlinear power function eq 1 to correct the bias of the predicted precipitation which is based on matching the probability distribution function such as standard deviation mean and coefficient of variation with the observed precipitation 1 p a p sat b where p sat is the monthly precipitation estimated by the satellite mm p is the corrected precipitation mm and coefficients a and b are dimensionless coefficients for reducing the bias of the estimated precipitation in this study 80 of observed hourly precipitation of each synoptic station and corresponding precipitation cell were selected to calculate a and b coefficients by comparing different percentiles the remaining 20 of the data was applied for verifying these coefficients lafon et al 2013 vernimmen et al 2012 2 4 development of idf curves there are usually three steps to develop idf curves the maximum annual precipitation was extracted for specific periods in the first step then an appropriate probability distribution function was fitted to data and finally the precipitation intensity was calculated for each return period the gumbel log pearson type iii lp3 logistic and generalized extreme values gev distributions were evaluated to fit the maximum annual precipitation data due to their suitability for extreme values alhassoun 2011 noor et al 2021 in this section the corrected data obtained from the previous section was evaluated during 2015 2018 period according to the goodness of fit test results table s3 the most frequent distribution was the gumble distribution which has been used to develop the idf curves for all stations in this study this distribution is widely used to analyze the flood probability due to its high ability to estimate maximum flow events in this study the idf curves for 5 10 20 50 and 100 years return periods were calculated as follow 2 p t p ave ks 3 k 6 π 0 5772 ln ln t t 1 where p t is precipitation corresponding to return period t mm p ave is mean maximum precipitation k is gumbel frequency factor s is the standard deviation of precipitation t is return period finally the precipitation intensities i mm h were calculated based on eq 4 4 i t p t t d where i t is precipitation intensity and t d is precipitation duration alhassoun 2011 wilson 1990 2 5 statistical evaluation 6 hour precipitation of synoptic stations were used here as a reference to evaluate the satellite precipitation products satellite precipitation datasets are spatially continuous and show the precipitation rate per cell according to their spatial resolution the respective geographical cell of each satellite product was chosen for each synoptic station the pearson s correlation coefficient rp relative root mean square error rrmse and relative bias rbias as well as three probability indices including probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were applied to compare satellite based precipitation with the observed data pearson s correlation coefficient rp varies between 1 and 1 eq 5 was applied to assess the correlation between observed precipitation p oi and satellite precipitation p si the closer the correlation coefficient rp to 1 indicates the better and positive correlation between satellite products and observed precipitation 5 r p i 1 n p s i p s p o i p o i 1 n p s i p s 2 i 1 n p o i p o 2 where p o is the mean observed precipitation p s is the mean satellite based precipitation and n is the number of precipitation data the rrmse shows the variance of the measurement error for the satellite model in predicting the actual values eq 6 the closer rrmse to zero shows the better performance of the satellite product for estimating precipitation 6 r rmse 1 n i 1 n p s i p o i 2 p o where p o i is the observed precipitation in synoptic stations p s i is the estimated precipitation by the satellites and p o is the mean observed precipitation and n is the number of precipitation data relative bias rbias eq 7 was applied to compare the amount of bias at different time scales hourly daily monthly and annually it was defined as the mean difference between the observed p oi and the satellite based precipitation p si the positive and negative values of rbias indicate overestimation or underestimation of precipitation respectively 7 rbias i 1 n p s i p o i i 1 n p o i 100 the probability of detection pod the false alarm ratio far and the critical success index csi indicators were used to evaluate the performance of satellite products considering the occurrence and non occurrence of the rainfall events probability of detection pod was the ratio of the correct number of estimated precipitation events by satellites to observed precipitation eq 8 pod varies between zero and 1 the closer values to 1 show the better performance of the satellite to estimate precipitation events the false alarm ratio far ratio of the precipitation events number estimated by the satellite incorrectly to the total precipitation events eq 9 far varies between zero and 1 the closer values to 0 show the better ability of the satellite to capture the precipitation events finally the critical success index csi shows the ratio of precipitation events which have been correctly detected by satellites eq 10 the value of this index varies between zero and 1 when the value of this index closes to 1 the satellite will have the best performance in precipitation events estimation 8 pod a a c 9 far b a b 10 csi a a b c where a is the number of precipitation events that rain gauges and the satellite have recorded b is the number of precipitation events in which precipitation is estimated by satellite but was not recorded by rain gauges false alarms and c is the number of precipitation events in which precipitation is recorded only by rain gauges and is not estimated by satellite miss ebert 2007 wilks 2011 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of generated idf curves fig 2 shows the comparison of idf curves derived from the original satellites data and modified satellites data with observed precipitation based idf over the whole spatial domain of selected stations among original idf curves the cmorph satellite had the best accuracy 0 77 to 7 81 errors while the persiann trmm tended to underestimate 51 30 116 09 overestimate 45 37 to 52 85 the precipitation the results indicated that the post real time satellite precipitation products with long term datasets has better performance which is consistent with the noor et al 2021 and ombadi et al 2018 the modification of satellite based precipitation has increased the accuracy of derived idf curves furthermore the trmm and the persiann estimations have increased and decreased respectively which complied with the findings of ombadi et al 2018 the ranges of median errors were calculated as 57 11 to 60 25 and 35 24 to 33 94 for modified and original time series respectively while these values were significant 19 53 to 45 33 for 6 hour and 5 100 return periods the errors were less significant in longer durations i e 12 and 24 h in the case of 12 hr and 24 hr idf the median errors varied from 35 23 36 45 44 08 and 37 7 the increasing trend of accuracy with longer durations was occurred due to the higher accuracy of satellite precipitation over longer time scales and the temporal mismatch between remotely sensed and observed precipitation over shorter periods in addition the calculated median errors for all satellite products were more pronounced in high return periods due to the relatively short records of satellite data which is consistent with ombadi et al 2018 fig 2 the results showed that the modified persiann precipitation data had the best performance in 20 out of 52 synoptic stations the modified precipitation data shows higher outlier in humid pre humid and arid climates as the modified idf curves revealed better results in the rest stations the best modified satellites for each synoptic station were presented in fig 3 as can be seen the difference among products was not pronounced in different return periods the cmorph showed the highest accuracy in 3 95 of stations followed by persiann 16 3 and trmm 38 14 satellites according to table 1 the cmorph trmm persiann indicate the best performances in extra arid arid and semi arid climates respectively in addition the persiann had the best accuracy in humid climates especially in mediterranean semi humid and humid climates the trmm persiann and cmorph showed the best performances at the altitudes of 24 to 500 500 1000 and 1500 2100 meters respectively table 1 tables s1 and s2 indicated the idf curves correlation coefficients and rrmse to compare the original and modified method based on section 2 3 in different return periods and durations 3 2 evaluation of satellite based precipitation at different time scales over iran table 2 presents the statistical indices for the selected satellite based precipitation products at different time scales over iran the values of rp generally increased from hourly to daily and monthly scales which was consistent with ombadi et al 2021 however the rp decreased at the annual scale compared to the monthly scale due to having different correlations in different seasons of the year which was consistent with alijanian et al 2017 the selected satellite based products had a higher correlation in spring and autumn than winter at a seasonal scale in general trmm indicated the highest correlation on daily and hourly scales while cmorph followed by trmm had the highest rp values at monthly and annual scales this indicated that the trmm satellite as a near real time satellite had good accuracy for short term studies such as flood warning figs 4 and 5 presente selected satellites evaluation metrics and probability indices at hourly daily monthly and annual time scales the persiann had the maximum rp in western and southwestern iran and especially along the zagros highlands at different time scales fig 4 a while the minimum values of this index were calculated in the coastlines of the caspian sea bandar abbas and sabzevar stations in general trmm showed a high correlation at monthly time scale in most regions of iran the maximum correlation was calculated for trmm in southwestern iran and along with the persian gulf coastline especially in fasa rp 0 86 omidieh rp 0 83 and bushehr rp 0 88 stations whilethe lowest values of rp were calculated in northern northeastern and northwestern iran i e sabzevar ramsar urmia arak and sanandaj however the correlation decreased in the northern and central regions of iran that was consistent with the findings of alijanian et al 2017 javanmard et al 2010 and darand et al 2017 the results of the monthly correlation analysis also showed that cmorph had the highest correlation in the northwestern rp 0 63 western rp 0 64 southwestern rp 0 75 and southeastern rp 0 66 iran while the lowest values were calculated in northern and eastern regions the cmorph revealed higher values of rp at monthly and annual time sequences than the hourly and daily scales the maximum correlations were calculated for persiann in yasuj station hourly scale rp 0 30 trmm in fasa daily scale rp 0 63 bushehr monthly scale rp 0 88 abadeh annual scale rp 0 86 stations the rrmse values indicated that the selected satellite products were more accurate at larger time sequences such as monthly and annual scale the accuracy of satellite based precipitation datasets increased on longer time scales due to the increased information content about precipitation provided by infrared images on this time scale that was consistent with the studies of ombadi et al 2021 fig 4 b the maximum rrmse was calculated for persiann at different time sequences this satellite indicated higher accuracy in western southwestern and northeast iran while the rrmse increased significantly in central and eastern iran the lowest values of rrmse for cmorph were calculated for monthly and annual scales the minimum rrmse for trmm was obtained in central iran especially for yazd station the maximum rrmse for cmorph was calculated in northern northeastern southwestern and southern iran especially in sabzevar bandar abbas and arak stations this satellite showed the lowest accuracy in northwestern and central iran the mean rbais in all stations showed that trmm and cmorph underestimated precipitation by 56 and 8 respectively however persiann overestimated the precipitation by 143 fig 5 our results also showed the similar abilities of the selected satellites in hourly daily monthly and annual scales to estimate rain gauge stations however trmm underestimated precipitation by a mean of about 56 in all of the selected stations across iran except zabol station this satellite showed the minimum values rrmse in central iran that is consistent with studies by javanmard et al 2010 cmorph also underestimated the precipitation but less than the trmm across iran the calculated pod for cmorph 0 45 was higher than persiann 0 36 and trmm 0 05 over iran fig 5 which were consistent with mosaffa et al 2020 these maximum values of pod were calculated for eastern and northeastern iran while pod decreased towards the western and southern regions moazami et al 2016 indicated that persiann showed minimum pod values in western and southwestern iran after cmorph which is in accordance with our results the minimum values of far were calculated for persiann especially in eastern iran indicating the lower number of incorrect precipitation events detected by this satellite the calculated far for trmm 0 89 and cmorph 0 91 were considerably higher than persiann 0 13 over iran indicating the better capabilities of persiann in the detection of precipitation occurrence this funding was inconsistent with moazami et al 2016 and darand et al 2017 that reported the maximum pod far and csi values for the trmm satellite in iran the higher csi for persiann 0 34 in comparison with trmm 0 03 and cmorph 0 08 also confirmed the better accuracy of persiann in detecting the occurrence of precipitation over iran 3 3 assessment of satellite based precipitation in different climates according to fig 6 a the highest and lowest correlation values rp were calculated for mediterranean and humid climates respectively the rp for persiann increased from extra arid to mediterranean climates while decreasing in semi humid climate the minimum values of correlation for persiann were calculated for humid climates trmm indicated the maximum and minimum values of rp in mediterranean and humid climates respectively the cmorph showed maximum rp at annual time scale compared to hourly and daily scales in all climates the maximum rrmse for persiann were calculated in extra arid and arid climates at an 6 hour scale while trmm had the minimum rrmse in this semi arid climate fig 6 b also trmm indicated the best ability in precipitation estimation in mediterranean and semi arid climate however the maximum and minimum values of rrmse for cmorph were calculated in mediterranean and semi arid climates respectively the persiann overestimated the precipitation in all climates except humid and pre humid climates fig 6 c the raindrops may evaporate before reaching the ground tesfagiorgis et al 2011 especially in arid climates i e extra arid arid and semi arid climates leading to the overestimation of precipitation amount by satellites trmm and cmorph underestimated the precipitation especially in humid climates according to fig 6 d cmorph followed by persiann indicated the maximum values of pod in all climates in addition the persiann showed the better performance based on calculated far and csi indices for all climates trmm did not perform well in most climates according to calculated pod far and csi indices the maximum pod for persiann trmm and cmorph were calculated in semi arid climates pre humid climates and semi humid climates respectively the csi value for persiann was higher than other satellite precipitation products and the other two satellites do not perform well based on this index however trmm and cmoroh showed higher values of csi in humid and pre humid climates 3 4 altitude assessment of satellite based precipitation the calculated rp for persiann generally increased with altitude the maximum correlation for trmm was calculated at high altitudes 1500 2100 m for hourly and daily time scales as well as at low altitudes 24 to 200 m for monthly and annual time scales fig 7 a in general evaluation of trmm precipitation products showed that the correlation did not change dramatically at different altitudes the maximum correlation for cmorph precipitation products was obtained for altitudes of 1000 1500 m hourly and daily time scales and at low 24 to 500 m altitudes monthly and annual time scales fig 7 b showed that the persiann had the maximum rrmse in altitudes between 500 and 1000 m the minimum rrmse for this satellite was calculated in high altitudes 1500 2100 m at annual time scale the maximum rrmse for trmm and cmorph were calculated at altitudes between 24 1000 m for hourly time scales results also showed that the persiann ccs overestimated the precipitation while trmm and cmorph underestimated the precipitation at different altitudes across iran fig 7 c the maximum pod was calculated for persiann and trmm at altitudes of 1500 2100 m and cmorph at 500 1000 m the maximum far values showed the improper performance of trmm and cmorph satellites at all altitudes while persiann had acceptable far values especially at the altitude of 500 1000 m in general by correcting satellite data better results can be obtained from satellite data trmm and cmorph can be used at altitudes above 1000 m and persiann can be used at altitudes of 500 1000 m to develop idf curves persiann satellite can be used in most climates to develop idf curves all rainfall satellites have the best performance in iran on a monthly and annual scale respectively but in the hourly time scale persiann and trmm satellites perform better persiann performed more accurately in detecting the occurrence and non occurrence of precipitation between all satellites but overestimated precipitation due to the lack of hourly rain gauges for flood research in iran the application of persiann can be recommended for flood prone regions monitoring such as western and southwestern iran the cmorph showed better performance than other satellite products at monthly and annual time scales therefore applying this satellite in precipitation assessment studies in iran is recommended all three satellites showed acceptable performance in the western and southwestern iran near the persian gulf coastline and along the zagros mountains which is consistent with alijanian et al 2017 4 conclusions the present study evaluated the accuracy of three satellites persiann and trmm near real time and cmorph post real time for precipitation estimation over iran the results showed that the application of bias correction could significantly improve the accuracy of satellite products in precipitation estimation the derived idf curves from the cmorph satellite showed the maximum compliance with idf curves derived from observed precipitation while the persiann trmm overestimated underestimated the observed precipitation the evaluation of the satellites in different temporal scales indicated that persiann and trmm perform better on hourly time scales persiann performs better in detecting the occurrence and non occurrence of precipitation than other satellite products but overestimates precipitation this satellite has poor performance in arid regions for other flood prone areas such as northeastern and southeastern iran the selected satellites showed the same performances in detecting occurrence and precipitation trmm is a near real time satellite that has good accuracy for short term studies such as flood warning as a post real time satellite cmorph has suitable long term data for the development of idf curves it is suggested to use persiann satellite which is a near real time satellite for short term weather forecasting studies the trmm estimated precipitation well at different time scales especially hourly and daily scales while it showed poor performance in detecting precipitation occurrence although the cmorph does not perform well on hourly and daily time scales it was more accurate than other satellites in monthly and annual scales hence applying this satellite product to precipitation analysis in areas facing a lack of observed data is recommended this satellite showed insignificant sensitivity to altitude changes and works well for precipitation detection this satellite works better in southwestern and southeastern iran in this study 16 years of data 2003 2018 have been used as it is often assumed that at least 30 years are required to conclude fitting probability distributions and developing the idf curve this can be considered as a limitation of this study credit authorship contribution statement asieh mousavi dehaghani

these precipitation products aghakouchak et al 2009 recently various satellite based models have been proposed for precipitation estimation i e the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed

hobushian et al 2017 indicated that trmm 3b42v7 trmm 3b42rt cmorph and hydro estimator hydro underestimated precipitation in the subtropical slopes of the andes and the values of errors reduced during winter qin et al 2014 analyzed the trmm 3b42 trmm 3b42rt cmorph and gsmap1 satellite based products in china and reported that the trmm 3b42 model had more accurate estimations ombadi et al ombadi et al 2018 developed idf curves for the united states using persiann cdr and showed that a significant percentage of the generated idf curves were within the confidence interval of ground based data kyaw

curves with cmorph data and gumbel probability distributions for greece and showed that the accuracy increased under higher return periods javanmard et al 2010 evaluated trmm precipitation products with ground based data over iran and indicated that the trmm underestimated the annual and seasonal precipitation especially in the caspian sea coastline and the zagros mountains regions moazami et al 2016 compared trmm 3b42 rt persiann cmorph and trmm 3b42 v7 precipitation products across iran and showed that trmm 3b42 rt had the highest correlation with the ground based precipitation mosaffa et al 2020 evaluated the ability of different satellite based products chirps v2 0 cmorph persiann persiann cdr sm2rain cci trmm 3b42 v7 persiann ccs and trmm 3b42 rt to estimate the post and near real time precipitation in the karkheh river basin iran the results showed that persiann cdr and persiann ccs showed better estimations due to the complexity of climate systems near real time estimation of precipitation is crucial to mitigate climate disasters such as a flood therefore the abilities of satellite based precipitation in estimating precipitation for different return periods and durations should be quantified most of the earlier studies were focused on the statistical comparison of satellite based precipitation with ground based data i e babaousmail et al 2019 iqbal and athar 2018 mosaffa et al 2020 nashwan et al 2020 sharifi et al 2018 wei et al 2017 while investigations of precipitation in different return periods based on satellite based idf are generally lacking i e marra et al 2017 ombadi et al 2018 moreover a review of studies shows that less effort has been made to evaluate such post real time and near real time satellite precipitation products at a sub daily scale especially over iran this study presented a comprehensive evaluation of three common satellite based precipitation products incuding persiann ccs trmm 3b42rt v7 and cmorph hereafter called persiann trmm and cmorph respectively at 6 hourly daily monthly and annual time scales over iran moreover the satellite based idfs were developed to show the abilities of selected precipitation products in the near real time estimation of precipitation for different return periods this study aims to i evaluate the accuracy of post real time and near real time satellite based idf curves over different return periods and durations ii appraise the ability of the satellite based product to estimate the precipitation at different temporal scales 6 hourly to annual time scales and iii evaluate the accuracy of satellite based precipitation over different climate and topographic conditions of iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area with an area of 1 645 000 km2 iran is extended between 25 and 40 n 44 64 e and bordered by the caspian sea to the north and the persian gulf and the oman sea to the south iran is located in arid and semi arid region with mean annual precipitation of 240 mm less than one third of the global precipitation javanmard et al 2010 mountains cover about 60 of the country with two main ranges as the alborz mountains in the north and the zagros mountains in the west and southwest central iran consists of two deserts called dasht e lut and dasht e kavir the combination of the coastal zone mountainous and deserts has a decisive role in the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation across the country where precipitation varies from 1000 mm in the northern areas to less than 50 mm in the central deserts kaboli et al 2021 according to the de martonne method rahimi et al 2013 tabari et al 2014 iran is divided into eight climatic zones extra arid a i 5 arid 5 a i 10 semi arid 10 a i 20 mediterranean 20 a i 24 semi humid 24 a i 28 humid 28 a i 35 pre humid type a 35

fig 1 b satellite based precipitation assessment was performed in these altitude categories 2 2 ground station and satellite data the 52 synoptic stations fig 1 were used in this study with continuous 6 hour precipitation data during 2003 2018 it is worth mentioning that none of these synoptic stations is located in the pre humid type b climate therefore this research has been conducted over the other seven climatic zones the satellite based data used in this study includes persiann ccs and trmm 3b42rt v7 near real time and cmorph post real time precipitation products with hourly time scales the persiann ccs data uses remote sensing techniques and artificial neural networks to estimate the global precipitation using infrared data in an hourly time and resolution of 0 04 0 04 spatial

precipitation 60 s 60n joyce et al 2004 there are different methods for using satellite data such as interpolation delbari et al 2013 ramahaimandimby et al 2022 as satellite precipitation datasets are spatially continuous and show the precipitation rate per cell according to their spatial resolution the respective geographical cell of each satellite product was chosen in this study for each synoptic station 2 3 bias correction since satellite precipitation estimation is exposed to significant systematic errors and the application of this data causes uncertainty in the output it is necessary to correct such products this study corrected the precipitation data of three selected satellites using the power bias correction method this method uses a nonlinear power function eq 1 to correct the bias of the predicted precipitation which is based on matching the probability distribution function such as standard deviation mean and coefficient of variation with the observed precipitation 1 p a p sat b where p sat is the monthly precipitation estimated by the satellite mm p is the corrected precipitation mm and coefficients a and b are dimensionless coefficients for reducing the bias of the estimated precipitation in this study 80 of observed hourly precipitation of each synoptic station and corresponding precipitation cell were selected to calculate a and b coefficients by comparing different percentiles the remaining 20 of the data was applied for verifying these coefficients lafon et al 2013 vernimmen et al 2012 2 4 development of idf curves there are usually three steps to develop idf curves the maximum annual precipitation was extracted for specific periods in the first step then an appropriate probability distribution function was fitted to data and finally the precipitation intensity was calculated for each return period the gumbel log pearson type iii lp3 logistic and generalized extreme values gev distributions were evaluated to fit the maximum annual precipitation data due to their suitability for extreme values alhassoun 2011 noor et al 2021 in this section the corrected data obtained from the previous section was evaluated during 2015 2018 period according to the goodness of fit test results table s3 the most frequent distribution was the gumble distribution which has been used to develop the idf curves for all stations in this study this distribution is widely used to analyze the flood probability due to its high ability to estimate maximum flow events in this study the idf curves for 5 10 20 50 and 100 years return periods were calculated as follow 2 p t p ave ks 3 k 6 π 0 5772 ln ln t t 1 where p t is precipitation corresponding to return period t mm p ave is mean maximum precipitation k is gumbel frequency factor s is the standard deviation of precipitation t is return period finally the precipitation intensities i mm h were calculated based on eq 4 4 i t p t t d where i t is precipitation intensity and t d is precipitation duration alhassoun 2011 wilson 1990 2 5 statistical evaluation 6 hour precipitation of synoptic stations were used here as a reference to evaluate the satellite precipitation products satellite precipitation datasets are spatially continuous and show the precipitation rate per cell according to their spatial resolution the respective geographical cell of each satellite product was chosen for each synoptic station the pearson s correlation coefficient rp relative root mean square error rrmse and relative bias rbias as well as three probability indices including probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi were applied to compare satellite based precipitation with the observed data pearson s correlation coefficient rp varies between 1 and 1 eq 5 was applied to assess the correlation between observed precipitation p oi and satellite precipitation p si the closer the correlation coefficient rp to 1 indicates the better and positive correlation between satellite products and observed precipitation 5 r p i 1 n p s i p s p o i p o i 1 n p s i p s 2 i 1 n p o i p o 2 where p o is the mean observed precipitation p s is the mean satellite based precipitation and n is the number of precipitation data the rrmse shows the variance of the measurement error for the satellite model in predicting the actual values eq 6 the closer rrmse to zero shows the better performance of the satellite product for estimating precipitation 6 r rmse 1 n i 1 n p s i p o i 2 p o where p o i is the observed precipitation in synoptic stations p s i is the estimated precipitation by the satellites and p o is the mean observed precipitation and n is the number of precipitation data relative bias rbias eq 7 was applied to compare the amount of bias at different time scales hourly daily monthly and annually it was defined as the mean difference between the observed p oi and the satellite based precipitation p si the positive and negative values of rbias indicate overestimation or underestimation of precipitation respectively 7 rbias i 1 n p s i p o i i 1 n p o i 100 the probability of detection pod the false alarm ratio far and the critical success index csi indicators were used to evaluate the performance of satellite products considering the occurrence and non occurrence of the rainfall events probability of detection pod was the ratio of the correct number of estimated precipitation events by satellites to observed precipitation eq 8 pod varies between zero and 1 the closer values to 1 show the better performance of the satellite to estimate precipitation events the false alarm ratio far ratio of the precipitation events number estimated by the satellite incorrectly to the total precipitation events eq 9 far varies between zero and 1 the closer values to 0 show the better ability of the satellite to capture the precipitation events finally the critical success index csi shows the ratio of precipitation events which have been correctly detected by satellites eq 10 the value of this index varies between zero and 1 when the value of this index closes to 1 the satellite will have the best performance in precipitation events estimation 8 pod a a c 9 far b a b 10 csi a a b c where a is the number of precipitation events that rain gauges and the satellite have recorded b is the number of precipitation

gauges and is not estimated by satellite miss ebert 2007 wilks 2011 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of generated idf curves fig 2 shows the comparison of idf curves derived from the original satellites data and modified satellites data with observed precipitation based idf over the whole spatial domain of selected stations among original idf curves the cmorph satellite had the best accuracy 0 77 to 7 81 errors while the persiann trmm tended to underestimate 51 30 116 09 overestimate 45 37 to 52 85 the precipitation the results indicated that the post real time satellite precipitation products with long term datasets has better performance which is consistent with the noor et al 2021 and ombadi et al 2018 the modification of satellite based precipitation has increased the accuracy of derived idf curves furthermore the trmm and the persiann estimations have increased and decreased respectively which complied with the findings of ombadi et al 2018 the ranges of median errors were calculated as 57 11 to 60 25 and 35 24 to 33 94 for modified and original time series respectively while these values were significant 19 53 to 45 33 for 6 hour and 5 100 return periods the errors were less significant in longer durations i e 12 and 24 h in the case of 12 hr and 24 hr idf the median errors varied from 35 23 36 45 44 08 and 37 7 the increasing trend of accuracy with longer durations was occurred due to the higher accuracy of satellite precipitation over longer time scales and the temporal mismatch between remotely sensed and observed precipitation over shorter periods in addition the calculated median errors for all satellite products were more pronounced in high return periods due to the relatively short records of satellite data which is consistent with ombadi et al 2018 fig 2 the results showed that the modified persiann precipitation data had the best performance in 20 out of 52 synoptic stations the modified precipitation data shows higher outlier in humid pre humid and arid climates as the modified idf curves revealed better results in the rest stations the best modified satellites for each synoptic station were presented in fig 3 as can be seen the difference among products was not pronounced in different return periods the cmorph showed the highest accuracy in 3 95 of stations followed by persiann 16 3 and trmm 38 14 satellites according to table 1 the cmorph trmm persiann indicate the best performances in extra arid arid and semi arid climates respectively in addition the persiann had the best accuracy in humid climates especially in mediterranean semi humid and humid climates the trmm persiann and cmorph showed the best performances at the altitudes of 24 to 500 500 1000 and 1500 2100 meters respectively table 1 tables s1 and s2 indicated the idf curves correlation coefficients and rrmse to compare the original and modified method based on section 2 3 in different return periods and durations 3 2 evaluation of satellite based precipitation at different time scales over iran table 2 presents the statistical indices for the selected satellite based precipitation products at different time scales over iran the values of rp generally increased from hourly to daily and monthly scales which was consistent with ombadi et al 2021 however the rp decreased at the annual scale compared to the monthly scale due to having different correlations in different seasons of the year which was consistent with alijanian et al 2017 the selected satellite based products had a higher correlation in spring and autumn than winter at a seasonal scale in general trmm indicated the highest correlation on daily and hourly scales while cmorph followed by trmm had the highest rp values at monthly and annual scales this indicated that the trmm satellite as a near real time satellite had good accuracy for short term studies such as flood warning figs 4 and 5 presente selected satellites evaluation metrics and probability indices at hourly daily monthly and annual time scales the persiann had the maximum rp in western and southwestern iran and especially along the zagros highlands at different time scales fig 4 a while the minimum values of this index were calculated in the coastlines of the caspian sea bandar abbas and sabzevar stations in general trmm showed a high correlation at monthly time scale in most regions of iran the maximum correlation was calculated for trmm in southwestern iran and along with the persian gulf coastline especially in fasa rp 0 86 omidieh rp 0 83 and bushehr rp 0 88 stations whilethe lowest values of rp were calculated in northern northeastern and northwestern iran i e sabzevar ramsar urmia arak and sanandaj however the correlation decreased in the northern and central regions of iran that was consistent with the findings of alijanian et al 2017 javanmard et al 2010 and darand et al 2017 the results of the monthly correlation analysis also showed that cmorph had the highest correlation in the northwestern rp 0 63 western rp 0 64 southwestern rp 0 75 and southeastern rp 0 66 iran while the lowest values were calculated in northern and eastern regions the cmorph revealed higher values of rp at monthly and annual time sequences than the hourly and daily scales the maximum correlations were calculated for persiann in yasuj station hourly scale rp 0 30 trmm in fasa daily scale rp 0 63 bushehr monthly scale rp 0 88 abadeh annual scale rp 0 86 stations the rrmse values indicated that the selected satellite products were more accurate at larger time sequences such as monthly and annual scale the accuracy of satellite based precipitation datasets increased on longer time scales due to the increased information content about precipitation provided by infrared images on this time scale that was consistent with the studies of ombadi et al 2021 fig 4 b the maximum rrmse was calculated for persiann at different time sequences this satellite indicated higher accuracy in western southwestern and northeast iran while the rrmse increased significantly in central and eastern iran the lowest values of rrmse for cmorph were calculated for monthly and annual scales the minimum rrmse for trmm was obtained in central iran especially for yazd station the maximum rrmse for cmorph was calculated in northern northeastern southwestern and southern iran especially in sabzevar bandar abbas and arak stations this satellite showed the lowest accuracy in northwestern and central iran the mean rbais in all stations showed that trmm and cmorph underestimated precipitation by 56 and 8 respectively however persiann overestimated the precipitation by 143 fig 5 our results also showed the similar abilities of the selected satellites in hourly daily monthly and annual scales to estimate rain gauge stations however trmm underestimated precipitation by a mean of about 56 in all of the selected stations across iran except zabol station this satellite showed the minimum values rrmse in central iran that is consistent with studies by javanmard et al 2010 cmorph also underestimated the precipitation but less than the trmm across iran the calculated pod for cmorph 0 45 was higher than persiann 0 36 and trmm 0 05 over iran fig 5 which were consistent with mosaffa et al 2020 these maximum values of pod were calculated for eastern and northeastern iran while pod decreased towards the western and southern regions moazami et al 2016 indicated that persiann showed minimum pod values in western and southwestern iran after cmorph which is in accordance with our results the minimum values of far were calculated for persiann especially in eastern iran indicating the lower number of incorrect precipitation events detected by this satellite the calculated far for trmm 0 89 and cmorph 0 91 were considerably higher than persiann 0 13 over iran indicating the better capabilities of persiann in the detection of precipitation occurrence this funding was inconsistent with moazami et al 2016 and darand et al 2017 that reported the maximum pod far and csi values for the trmm satellite in iran the higher csi for persiann 0 34 in comparison with trmm 0 03 and cmorph 0 08 also confirmed the better accuracy of persiann in detecting the occurrence of precipitation over iran 3 3 assessment of satellite based precipitation in different climates according to fig 6 a the highest and lowest correlation values rp were calculated for mediterranean and humid climates respectively the rp for persiann increased from extra arid to mediterranean climates while decreasing in semi humid climate the minimum values of correlation for persiann were calculated for humid climates trmm indicated the maximum and minimum values of rp in mediterranean and humid climates respectively the cmorph showed maximum rp at annual time scale compared to hourly and daily scales in all climates the maximum rrmse for persiann were calculated in extra arid and arid climates at an 6 hour scale while trmm had the minimum rrmse in this semi arid climate fig 6 b also trmm indicated the best ability in precipitation estimation in mediterranean and semi arid climate however the maximum and minimum values of rrmse for cmorph were calculated in mediterranean and semi arid climates respectively the persiann overestimated the precipitation in all climates except humid and pre humid climates fig 6 c the raindrops may evaporate before reaching the ground tesfagiorgis et al 2011 especially in arid climates i e extra arid arid and semi arid climates leading to the overestimation of precipitation amount by satellites trmm and cmorph underestimated the precipitation especially in humid climates according to fig 6 d cmorph followed by persiann indicated the maximum values of pod in all climates in addition the persiann showed the better performance based on calculated far and csi indices for all climates trmm did not perform well in most climates according to calculated pod far and csi indices the maximum pod for persiann trmm and cmorph were calculated in semi arid climates pre humid climates and semi humid climates respectively the csi value for persiann was higher than other satellite precipitation products and the other two satellites do not perform well based on this index however trmm and cmoroh showed higher values of csi in humid and pre humid climates 3 4 altitude assessment of satellite based precipitation the calculated rp for persiann generally increased with altitude the maximum correlation for trmm was calculated at high altitudes 1500 2100 m for hourly and daily time scales as well as at low altitudes 24 to 200 m for monthly and annual time scales fig 7 a in general evaluation of trmm precipitation products showed that the correlation did not change dramatically at different altitudes the maximum correlation for cmorph precipitation products was obtained for altitudes of 1000 1500 m hourly and daily time scales and at low 24 to 500 m altitudes monthly and annual time scales fig 7 b showed that the persiann had the maximum rrmse in altitudes between 500 and 1000 m the minimum rrmse for this satellite was calculated in high altitudes 1500 2100 m at annual time scale the maximum rrmse for trmm and cmorph were calculated at altitudes between 24 1000 m for hourly time scales results also showed that the persiann ccs overestimated the precipitation while trmm and cmorph underestimated the precipitation at different altitudes across iran fig 7 c the maximum pod was calculated for persiann and trmm at altitudes of 1500 2100 m and cmorph at 500 1000 m the maximum far values showed the improper performance of trmm and cmorph satellites at all altitudes while persiann had acceptable far values especially at the altitude of 500 1000 m in general by correcting satellite data better results can be obtained from satellite data trmm and cmorph can be used at altitudes above 1000 m and persiann can be used at altitudes of 500 1000 m to develop idf curves persiann satellite can be used in most climates to develop idf curves all rainfall satellites have the best performance in iran on a monthly and annual scale respectively but in the hourly time scale persiann and trmm satellites perform better persiann performed more accurately in detecting the occurrence and non occurrence of precipitation between all satellites but overestimated precipitation due to the lack of hourly rain gauges for flood research in iran the application of persiann can be recommended for flood prone regions monitoring such as western and southwestern iran the cmorph showed better performance than other satellite products at monthly and annual time scales therefore applying this satellite in precipitation assessment studies in iran is recommended all three satellites showed acceptable performance in the western and southwestern iran near the persian gulf coastline and along the zagros mountains which is consistent with alijanian et al 2017 4 conclusions the present study evaluated the accuracy of three satellites persiann and trmm near real time and cmorph post real time for precipitation estimation over iran the results showed that the application of bias correction could significantly improve the accuracy of satellite products in precipitation estimation the derived idf curves from the cmorph satellite showed the maximum compliance with idf curves derived from observed precipitation while the persiann trmm overestimated underestimated the observed precipitation the evaluation of the satellites in different temporal scales indicated that persiann and trmm perform better on hourly time scales persiann performs better in detecting the occurrence and non occurrence of precipitation than other satellite products but overestimates precipitation this satellite has poor performance in arid regions for other flood prone areas such as northeastern and southeastern iran the selected satellites showed the same performances in detecting occurrence and precipitation trmm is a near real time satellite that has good accuracy for short term studies such as flood warning as a post real time satellite cmorph has suitable long term data for the development of idf curves it is suggested to use persiann satellite which is a near real time satellite for short term weather forecasting studies the trmm estimated precipitation well at different time scales especially hourly and daily scales while it showed poor performance in detecting precipitation occurrence although the cmorph does not perform well on hourly and daily time scales it was more accurate than other satellites in monthly and annual scales hence applying this satellite product to precipitation analysis in areas facing a lack of observed data is recommended this satellite showed insignificant sensitivity to altitude changes and works well for precipitation detection this satellite works better in southwestern and southeastern iran in this study 16 years of data 2003 2018 have been used as it is often assumed that at least 30 years are required to conclude fitting probability distributions and developing the idf curve this can be considered as a limitation of this study credit authorship contribution statement asieh mousavi dehaghani

groundwater is typically found in deeper coastal aquifers yechieli and sivan 2011 consequently palaeo seawater intrusion typically occurs through the uprising from deeper aquifers into aquifers closer to the ground surface re and zuppi 2011 however depending on the evolution of study area sources of palaeo seawater can also be found in the shallow aquifers carol et al 2021 vallejos et al 2018 standard techniques for identifying salinity sources in coastal aquifers rely on determining the relationship between major ions santucci et al 2016 since palaeo seawater and present seawater can have similar geochemical properties ion ratios cannot always be used to successfully identify palaeo seawater intrusion frollini et al 2022 because of the distinct isotopic fingerprint between these two previously mentioned sources of salinity environmental isotope analysis can be used to identify the presence of both palaeo seawater and present seawater in groundwater argamasilla et al 2017 due to the fact the previously mentioned methods require sample collection and laboratory analysis they are unsuitable for monitoring hourly and daily changes of surface and groundwater in the study area up

tool for water management of coastal systems abd elaty and zelenakova 2022 this is especially helpful during swi risk assessment analysis caused by the climate change projections in a similar manner zoning of coastal aquifer area based on tds salinity and geochemical features has been presented in study by vahidipour et al 2021 the kimje coastal area in korea has been the subject of research by kim et al 2005 where the relationship between observed time series of seawater elevation swl and groundwater level gwl versus electrical conductivity ec in piezometers has been established leading to the conclusion the groundwater quality is subjected to tidal influence similar methodology has been used to demonstrate tides affect the movement of the saltwater freshwater interface in jeju island korea kim et al 2006 jeju island has been again the subject of a research by kim et al 2008a who analysed the dynamic behaviour of saltwater freshwater interaction at five different coastal zones results showed gwl ec and temperature t have been affected by tidal variations and intensive precipitation monitoring systems have been proven as a tool with a capacity to capture for relevant information along the venice coast in italy where swi vulnerability has been assessed by taking into account ec gwl and distance to saline and freshwater sources da et al 2015 lovrinović et al 2021 investigated the capacity of two independent monitoring systems one in neretva valley and the second in the venice lagoon in italy based on observed gwl ec and t time series both monitoring systems have been found to be capable to offer necessary information for the identification of swi processes neretva valley represents the largest agricultural area in the coastal area of croatia conservation of the area means long term sustainability of the population living in the valley which further emphasises the need for the monitoring and understanding the transient nature of swi present hereby previous studies in neretva valley have been conducted as a pre project phases for water management infrastructure implementation hydrogeological characterization of neretva valley has been performed in the study of srzić et al 2020 while several studies dealt with swi related problems in neretva coastal system lovrinović et al 2022 2021 racetin et al 2020 romić et al 2020 zovko et al 2018 in this paper local responses of the shallow coastal aquifer groundwater features to different external loadings which are assumed to contribute the complexity of swi are investigated relying on observed values of gwl ec t water level from rivers neretva and mala neretva and surface and groundwater profiling results each piezometer location represents a different microsite along the study area with different boundary conditions representing specific local conditions and dominant loadings influencing groundwater the relationship between the loadings to the aquifer and the aquifer response is established by using spectrograms and coherence models based on the discrete fourier transform dft even though dft has found wide application in different scientific areas to our best knowledge this is the first time spectrograms and coherence models based on dft are being used for the analysis especially when influenced by swi besides the methodological approach the study enables the insight to up to date results and findings to not well explored case study of neretva coastal aquifer located in the southeastern croatia compared to previous publications being focused to this case study area hereby we summarise main differences and novelties i this paper covers neretva aquifer area including opuzen usce vidrice and jasenska areas thus increasing the generality of the findings ii the relevance of hydrometeorological conditions tidal oscillations and melioration system operative regimes has been investigated separately for different subareas of the case study iii this study relies on whole 2019 year of data sets thus enabling the insight to groundwater features phenomena at the time scale larger than seasonal characteristic iv applied methodology enables the insight to multiple external loadings impact simultaneously via the use of coherence model 2 study area 2 1 historical overview and geographical settings river neretva valley is located in the very southeastern part of croatia fig 1 specific part of the valley located between the adriatic sea to the west and town opuzen to the east has been considered as an area of interest of this paper through the 20th century the alluvial soil of the lower neretva valley has been identified as a highly potential agricultural area mainly by local population until the second half of 20th century most of 4200 ha of the neretva valley was mainly a marshland starting from 1960 s up to date an infrastructural development led to the construction of embankment diga creating a physical barrier between the study area and the adriatic sea fig 1 melioration channels and pumping stations with the implementation of firstly melioration and later flood protection and partially irrigation systems better agricultural conditions have been reached and kept up to date study area is alluvial delta fed by the alluvium from river neretva it is surrounded by karstic hills to the north as well as to the south and southwest terrain elevation of the valley s central part ranges between 2 50 to 2 00 m a s l nula trsta vertical datum is used as reference for all elevation data along the paper as well for absolute piezometric head values used within the paper while the embankment diga fig 1 is recognised as a border between adriatic sea and the inland to the west river neretva represents a natural boundary to the north while mala neretva mimics the border of the opuzen usce area to the south opuzen usce area can be divided into two specific sub areas respectively jasenska and crepina as seen in fig 1 vidrice area is separated melioration subsystem located to the south from river mala neretva and is surrounded by karstic hills to the east south and west along the vidrice area the terrain elevation ranges between 1 50 and 1 00 m a s l 2 2 climatological and meteorological conditions meteorological and climatological conditions along the study area have been provided by data sets observed at the meteorological station ploče operated by croatian hydrometeorological institute ploče station is located about 8 km to the west from the opuzen town and 2 km to the north west from the neretva mouth fig 1 during the reference period 2009 2019 cumulative annual precipitation ranged from 692 4 to 1768 mm year 1 through the hydrological year the area of interest is characterized by two main periods rain season characterizing period from november to april dominantly recognised by frequent precipitation and low air t and dry season which lasts from may to october with mainly sporadic precipitation occurrence and higher air t during the period 2010 2019 rain season cumulative precipitation ranged between 491 2 mm and 1273 8 mm while dry season cumulative precipitation ranged between 154 9 mm and 670 8 mm fig 2 2 3 geological and hydrogeological settings the geological definition of the study area has been determined by inspection and analysis of in situ geotechnical and geophysical investigations performed from 1906 s up to date elektrosond zagreb 1963 1962 geofizika zagreb 1966 1962 geoid beroš ltd 2014 geokon zagreb d d 2022 2013 2008 2005 institute igh plc 2013 2019 the upper layer representing unconfined aquifer unit consists of fine sands with local presence of clay and silt the thickness of clay and silt layers does not exceed 1 m thus representing local heterogeneities the sand layer is found throughout the study area with a thickness ranging from 1 to 10 m depending on the location fig 3 the gwl as found within the sand layer is kept below the sea level with mean annual value of 0 74 m a s l for p1 location as obtained from 2019 observations 1 93 m a s l for p2 and 1 22 m a s l for p4 under the sand layer a low conductive layer of clay is found the clay layer has a thickness of 10 12 m near the city of opuzen and increases up to 25 m towards the sea the further extension of this layer under the seabed from the coast to the offshore area is given as about 1400 m srzić et al 2020 beneath the clay layer a variable depth gravel layer is found confinement of this layer is confirmed in the study by srzić et al 2020 the depth of this layered roof is reported to be about 20 m in the east and up to 35 m in the west in the central area of interest and in the northern and southern areas a conglomerate layer is found at a depth of 40 45 m with a thickness of 1 3 m the discontinuity of this layer should be highlighted as this layer was not found in all available boreholes beneath the conglomerate layer is an expanse of gravel consisting mostly of fine and medium gravel the mean annual value of gwl in the confined gravel layer is higher than the mean annual value of swl faculty of civil engineering 2019 the base of the area is defined with limestone bedrock the bedrock was found to be zero on the edge of the neretva valley while in the central area called crepina it reaches a depth of 165 m institute igh plc 2013 2019 the determined values of hydraulic conductivity in the confined aquifer range from 7 10 4 to 7 5 10 3 m s 1 srzić et al 2020 across the entire study area with the effective porosity ranges from 0 15 to 0 25 while the values of specific storage range from 2 87 to 4 97 10 6 m 1 srzić et al 2020 confining geological unit made of clay is characterized by the hydraulic conductivity values ranging from 3 95 10 12 to 9 66 10 6 m s 1 geokon zagreb d d 2022 on average values of hydraulic conductivity of unconfined aquifer have been determined from 1 15 10 4 to 1 19 10 4 m s 1 the issue of upstream boundary condition recharge of the upper unconfined aquifer of interest for this study has been shown to be of minor impact to local hydrogeological and salinity conditions as shown in work by lovrinović et al 2021 and lovrinović et al 2022 instead the operation of the melioration system has been shown to overcome local features and effects of precipitation recharge either lateral inflows from the river neretva and mala neretva 2 4 hydrological conditions two main processes the amount of precipitation over the river basin and the operational regime of the mostar hydroelectric power plant located upstream from town mostar in bosnia and herzegovina define the river neretva discharge at the study area from 2009 2019 discharge ranged from 40 m3 s 1 to 2092 m3 s 1 the amount of 40 m3 s 1 represents the biological minimum of the mostar hydroelectric power plant the neretva river discharge shows significant seasonal fluctuations during the dry season from may to october the discharge fluctuates between 40 m3 s 1 and 250 m3 s 1 with occasional peaks above 250 m3 s 1 while rain season from november to april results with discharge values between 200 m3 s 1 and 1700 m3 s 1 discharge values higher than 1700 m3 s 1 corresponds to specific return periods and are adopted to specified occurrence probabilities hrvatske vode 2014 2 5 tidal characteristics the tides in the adriatic sea are of mixed diurnal semidiurnal type janeković and kuzmić 2005 srzić et al 2020 with significant differences in amplitudes between neap and spring tides the maximum amplitude of the tides in adriatic sea ranges from 15 cm in the southern part of the sea to 50 cm in the northern part janeković and kuzmić 2005 in a study by srzić et al 2020 for the period of august 2015 four dominant tidal constituents were identified within the sea level observations signature namely o1 and k1 as diurnal constituents and m2 and s2 as semi diurnal constituents 2 6 operative regimes as already explained neretva valley is surrounded by rivers neretva and mala neretva mala neretva is a branch of neretva river separated from the neretva river by the gates marked as oun and from the adriatic sea by the gates marked as uuu fig 1 mala neretva system is initially designed to receive excess discharge from the neretva river to protect the area from flooding when the discharge of the neretva river is greater than the capacity of the riverbed both gates should be opened to evacuate water downstream to the adriatic sea nowadays due to anthropogenic interventions in the area of the riverbed mala neretva this system initially planned for flood protection does not fulfil its original purpose instead it is used as a main source of freshwater during dry season where water is dispersed from for purpose of irrigation to prevent seawater intrusion into mala neretva uuu gates are regulated so the mala neretva water elevation is kept higher compared to the swl this gradient does not allow sea water cline intrude upstream from the mala neretva mouth contrary to the uuu the oun gates are opened rare usually only when the water level in mala neretva is higher than in neretva which happens during recession part of neretva river hydrograph after the occurrence of peak values in this way sea water cline from neretva riverbed is not allowed to intrude mala neretva thus enabling the refreshment of the volume found within the mala neretva system besides the intermittent refreshment from neretva riverbed during dry period mala neretva is constantly fed by fresh water from the channel maksimilijan whose intake is located upstream form metković town fig 1 this enables appropriate amount of fresh water which is used for irrigation of the central part of the area of interest including crepina area parallel to flood protection and irrigation systems along the area of interest melioration system is put into operation to keep the groundwater surface elevation below the pedological layer and to enable agricultural production in order to achieve the groundwater delineation a system of melioration channels was built whose purpose is to bring water to pumping stations intake basins the modric pumping station ps modric has an installed capacity of 19 6 m3 s 1 and is located at the mouth of mala neretva following fig 1 it collects the water from opuzen usce area and transfers it to the adriatic sea the prag pumping station ps prag has a capacity of 6 5 m3 s 1 fig 1 and is used for delineation of the water table within the vidrice area by pumping to the river mala neretva both pumping stations are turned on manually once a day during the night regime operation time is controlled by the supervisor of the pumping station and depends on local meteorological and hydrological conditions regardless of the operational time the water level in the pumping station s intake basin is observed at the beginning and end of the working shift normally at 10 pm and 8 am unless additional shifts are required during intensive precipitation events water level observations within the intake basins are available prior and post the pumping operation 3 methodology 3 1 ground and surface water monitoring system and approaches in the lower neretva valley a monitoring system has been installed to observe seawater intrusion parameters in piezometers fig 1 these parameters include groundwater level gwl electrical conductivity ec and temperature t at four locations sea and rivers surface elevations were observed sea level swl was measured near the mouth of river mala neretva whereas river surface elevations wl were measured at two locations of mala neretva one downstream from the gate in opuzen city marked as oun and the other uuu upstream from the gates near the mouth of the river in the vicinity of the city of opuzen the surface elevation of the neretva river has been observed gwl ec and t in an unconfined aquifer were measured at three locations using piezometers p1 p2 and p4 all piezometers included in the study were drilled 10 m below ground level with a 12 centimeter diameter hole the bottom 9 5 m of the pipe s screen height have been perforated gauges are installed two meters up from the piezometer bottom following the gwl in each shallow piezometer in river neretva coastal aquifer only deepest 7 8 m of each piezometer screen is located below the gwl deep piezometers consist solely of perforations in a deep confined aquifer with total heights of up to 3 m and are therefore considered as short screened piezometers piezometers with similar perforation heights as used in this study have been successfully used for seawater origin determination de oliveira gomes et al 2019 frollini et al 2022 pilla and torrese 2022 santucci et al 2016 and for identification of coastal aquifer external loadings and their influence to groundwater fadili et al 2018 shin and hwang 2020 zhang et al 2020 surface water monitoring locations are equipped with thalimedes ott gauge with a sampling frequency of 1 hour measuring range of 19 999 m resolution of 0 001 m and accuracy of 0 002 m ott orpheus mini vented gauge was used in all piezometers to observe gwl and set up to sampling frequency of 1 hour with measuring range from 0 to 40 m and resolution of 0 001 m a manta 2 40 gauges were also installed in all piezometers to observe groundwater ec and t in piezometers this gauge has a measuring range of 0 100 ms cm 1 with an accuracy of 1 and 0 0001 ms cm 1 resolution for the ec standardized to 25 c the t sensors range is 5 c to 50 c with resolution of 0 01 c and an accuracy of 0 1 c the timing of all gauges is synchronized all gauges and probes used as a setup within the neretva valley monitoring system are equipped with strain gauge transducers for measuring the pressure of ground and surface water the gauges and probes automatically convert pressure readings to a hydrostatic water pressure in low lying deltas it is crucial to observe pressure rather than hydraulic head to avoid misinterpretations of groundwater fluxes direction caused by fluids of variable density post et al 2007 for the purpose of this research time series obtained from the monitoring network during 2019 sea and river gauges provide year round data on the sea surface and river surface elevation gwl ec and t from borehole p1 and gwl from boreholes p2 and p4 due to malfunctioning probes ec and t in boreholes p2 and p4 are available from january to november the nula trsta vertical datum is used as a reference for all observed gwl swl and wl values just as it is for terrain elevation in order to gain insight into the vertical stratification of ec and t six profilings were performed throughout the 2019 profiling is performed on all piezometers and the mala neretva river they are conducted primarily during the dry season with the exception of the most recent profile which was conducted in november and did not include mala neretva table 1 the seba kll q 2 multiparameter probe was used to record gwl and ec t values at various depths the probe has the following measuring ranges 0 500 m water column for pressure 5 c to 50 c for t and 0 200 ms cm 1 for ec 3 2 time series spectrogram and coherence observed time series in boreholes whether the groundwater head or ec indicate the composition of various aquifer stresses each aquifer stress corresponds to a particular frequency or group of frequencies with amplitude period and phase corresponding to each frequency dong et al 2015 every periodic and aperiodic function in time is decomposed by the fourier transform into the sum of the sine and cosine functions proakis and manolakis 2006 observed signals represent discrete time series therefore the emphasis of fourier transform is on the discrete signals the formula for discrete fourier transform dft cooley et al 1969 is 1 x k n 0 n 1 x n e i 2 π kn n k 0 n 1 using euler s formula eq 1 can be written as 2 x k n 0 n 1 x n cos 2 π kn n i sin 2 π kn n k 0 n 1 or 3 x k a k i b k where x k is the value of the k th frequency in the frequency bin k is the number of frequency in the frequency bin n is the number of samples x n is the n th sample value and a k and b k are complex numbers the frequency resolution of a plot or frequency bin is defined as the sampling frequency divided by the number of samples the frequency of the k th position in the frequency bin is defined as 4 f k n f s n where f s is sampling frequency and n is the sample number plotting a k and b k in complex plane magnitude m and phase φ of each frequency can be calculated 5 m k a k b k φ k tan 1 b k a k typically dft results are displayed as amplitude spectral density asd or power spectral density psd normalizing the dft results by the number of samples entered in dft yields an asd and the squared value of the asd s amplitude yields a psd the periods and amplitudes of each calculated frequency can be easily deduced from the amplitude spectrum fuentes arreazola et al 2018 srzić et al 2020 turnadge et al 2019 stresses on the aquifer can be divided into periodic stresses such as tides daily changes in atmospheric pressure daily operating regime of pumping stations and non periodic stresses which are usually caused by a change in meteorological conditions or operating regime in the case of non periodic stresses such as precipitation the asd of the aquifer response will have a range of frequencies with different amplitudes to mimic the non periodic signal isermann and münchhof 2011 so a closer look at the time series in the frequency domain is necessary the coherence model was used to establish a measure of similarity as a function in phase shift between frequencies calculated from observed signals represent stresses on the aquifer and aquifer response signals the following is the formula for magnitude square coherence 6 r k g xy k φ 2 g xx k g yy k g xy k represents the cross power spectral density cpsd whereas g xx f and g yy f represent the psd of signals psd can also be described as the fourier transform of the auto covariance function while cpsd can be described as the fourier transform of the cross covariance function between two signals as a function of phase shift coherence values range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating complete coherence and 0 indicating incoherence since the coherence model does not include information about the amplitude size of the coherence frequencies it is possible to have significant coherence between both frequencies of interest and noise the welch method welch 1967 was used to avoid the interpretation of coherence between noise frequencies and to highlight the dominant frequencies first time series are partitioned into a finite number of smaller time series known as screens and then the welch method is applied to each screen moving a window over a data set on screen and calculating the asd or psd each time the window is moved is required by the welch method the average of all asds in a screen is recorded and all screens are combined to form a spectrogram which is an image depicting the distribution of all asds the spectrogram provides information about the spectrum s temporal evolution pérez gómez et al 2016 to ensure calculation consistency the welch method was applied to the spectrogram with the same window shape size and overlap points as the coherence model the results were calculated using modules from the scipy library which is integrated with python 3 7 the coherence models and welch s method scipy modules are based on the same study welch 1967 observed annual time series were divided into 24 periods referred to as screens with 15 day data for each screen see a appendix the coherence between two time series was calculated for each screen using a tukey window with a shape parameter of 0 25 and a window length of 120 data 5 days reliable monthly coherence results were determined the tukey window was shifted over 110 overlapping data points to generate 24 coherence models for each window in the results the mean value of all coherence models was interpreted 4 results to identify and elaborate processes influencing swi and its impact to groundwater dynamics within neretva case study we separately analyse three locations of interest along the study area those three locations correspond to fundamentally different areas respectively i piezometer p1 at diga area which is dominantly influenced by the swi ii piezometer p2 located at jasenska area which is a part of river neretva left bank area and iii p4 piezometer which is representative for vidrice melioration subsystem the analysis has been performed based on i continuous data series of ec t and gwl ii swl and wl and iii on groundwater and surface water profilings of t and ec performed six times during 2019 4 1 diga area fig 4 demonstrates the correspondence of trends of gwl in p1 and swl both trends imply the influence of atmospheric pressure which can be seen by the increase in the atmospheric pressure and the decrease in gwl and swl trends and vice versa the specific occurrence of such an inverse interdependence of these two variables of interest and the atmospheric pressure is especially evident during significant atmospheric pressure changes during late january mid and late february early april and may mid and late october and several changes during november and december 2019 during 2019 ps modric intake basin water elevation reflects the chainsaw feature which is a consequence of dominantly night operative regime fig 4 turbines are put into operation at the end of the day usually between 8 and 10 pm depending on local hydrological and meteorological conditions while the turnoff is usually scheduled between 6 and 9 am this feature is noticeable by the inspection of spectrogram in fig 5b where daily period is observed as present during the whole year of interest significant changes in the amplitude of the ps modric intake basin water surface elevation are present for larger periods during january 2019 when significant decrease in atmospheric pressure and precipitation occurrence are present the annual mean gwl at p1 equals to 1 09 m beneath than the mean swl indicating the presence of active seawater intrusion conditions badaruddin et al 2017 2015 in the studies by lovrinović et al 2022 2021 and srzić et al 2020 the tidal signal in the swl characterizing study area is identified of a mixed type with regular changes in the periods of spring and neap tides fig 4 observed dominant frequencies of gwl in p1 fig 5c correspond to the dominant frequencies of the sea level signal fig 5a with noticeable decrease in amplitudes due to the attenuation caused by the filtering effect of the aquifer media the semidiurnal component in the swl has a larger mean annual amplitude value 0 013 m compared to diurnal component 0 11 m while the opposite occurs in the p1 gwl respectively the semidiurnal component has a value of 0 028 m and the diurnal has a value of 0 03 m this is expected since the tidal efficiency is dominantly influenced by the signal period rather than the amplitude erskine 1991 jiao and tang 1999 specific yield in the unconfined aquifer can have several orders of magnitude higher values than the storativity in the confined aquifer and therefore the attenuation of sea level oscillations within the unconfined aquifer is larger guo et al 2007 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 compared to confined aquifer conditions srzić et al 2020 studies teo et al 2003 yeh et al 2010 have shown unconfined aquifers in coastal systems can be significantly affected by the swl fluctuations supporting the similarity with p1 observed gwl deeper inspection of the similarity between the p1 gwl and swl time series has been derived from the spectrogram analysis as shown in fig 5a and c hereby p1 gwl implies the similarity with swl when analysed in frequency domain dominant amplitude spectrum values correspond to mixed tide periods as observed by srzić et al 2020 confirming the dominance of the swl in the transient definition of p1 gwl the latter is expected due the fact p1 is located 80 m from the coastline and is therefore directly affected by the swl variations that couples the effect of the atmospheric pressure and tidal influence long term changes in atmospheric pressure are also visible in the spectrogram of swl and p1 gwl fig 5a and c for the frequencies corresponding to periods higher than daily highest amplitude values are present for the periods of january mid and late february early april and may mid and late october and several changes during november and december fig 5c those periods emphasize the nature of the cause of atmospheric pressure which is explained as a consequence of the air front movement along the pathway over different geographic locations dong et al 2015 merritt 2004 the latter is different and should be distinguished from the daily changes in atmospheric pressure mostly caused by day night regime of the t change the values of the coherence model are shown in fig 6 with the colour bar where total coherence is marked with red colour and no coherence with blue colour arrows indicate the phase in degrees between the same frequency in two signals with coherence determined as 0 6 or higher an arrow pointing to the right denotes no time lag between two constituents of signals of interest while an arrow pointing to the left means opposite phases of the corresponding constituents the arrow representation has been shown to be a suitable method for visualising time lags between frequencies in two signals briciu 2019 zhang et al 2020 also frequencies with periods between 2 and 4 h were removed from the spectrogram and coherence results because they correspond to noise frequencies dong et al 2015 and to improve the visibility of frequencies of interest mean annual coherence values of 0 95 and 0 99 have been determined between diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies corresponding to swl and gwl in p1 with an annual mean time lag of 2 68 h and 0 77 h standard deviation for the diurnal and a time lag of 1 58 h and 0 24 h standard deviation for the semidiurnal component fig 6a indicates the swl and gwl trends occur at the same time implying the cause different than tides following the significant interconnection between swl and p1 gwl we extend the analysis to ec assuming the swl as a driving force controlling the ec in p1 ec in p1 has a relatively constant value varying slightly between 48 16 ms cm 1 and 50 7 ms cm 1 throughout the year fig 4 coherence inspection between swl and p1 ec reveals significant values for periods corresponding to the tidal constituents in fig 6b annual mean values of ec time lag relative to swl corresponds to 2 49 h with coherence of 0 71 for diurnal constituent semidiurnal constituent corresponding time lag equals to 2 58 h with 0 73 coherence value the standard deviation values of 1 71 h and 0 91 h have been determined for annual time lags of the diurnal and semidiurnal constituents precipitation does not dominate the ec values in p1 compared to swl influence as can be seen in figs 4 and 5d the latter is a consequence of several factors i the position of the probe below the transition zone in p1 fig 7a ii proximity of the adriatic sea and iii precipitation occurred at the study area drains towards the melioration channel located 30 m inland from the p1 ec profiles fig 7a can be divided into two layers the first layer transition zone from the surface to a depth of 4 m a s l and the second layer from 4 m a s l to the position of the piezometer probe at 9 m a s l while ec profiles in unconfined aquifers in the seawater proximity usually show transition from freshwater to seawater in ec profiles kim et al 2008b 2006 shin and hwang 2020 hereby the transition zone detectable from fig 7 has a transition zone with a maximum difference between upper and lower values of 4 13 ms cm 1 by coupling the shape of the profiles of ec and the fact the gwl in p1 is found below swl suggests active seawater intrusion conditions along the diga area represented by p1 badaruddin et al 2017 2015 the layer below the transition zone does not show stratification in ec but vary up to maximum 1 96 ms cm 1 as observed between the first and fourth profiling the t profiles in p1 can be divided vertically into two sub layers same as for the ec the first layer up to a depth of 4 m shows vertically varying t while the second layer below 4 m has relatively constant t fig 7b changing from 18 to 23 c highest observed t in upper layer are observed on july 17th and august 22nd during the peak of the summer season while highest observed t in deeper layer are observed on august 22nd and september 18th this indicates the upper layer responds faster to changes in air t than the deeper layer which is controlled by the adriatic sea t p1 t increase from 18 80 c as observed on june 17th to maximum 23 10 c observed on august 22nd at the piezometer bottom is caused by its proximity to the adriatic sea and the influence of swi similar effect but with decreasing trend has been observed during the profiling performed on september 18th october 9th and finally november 25th when lowest observed t 18 c has been observed the p1 piezometer is located approximately 80 m from the coastline and 30 m distance from the melioration channel converging the water towards the ps modric intake basin by comparing the mean annual values the water level in the ps modric intake basin is determined at 2 74 m below the sea level indicating the presence of active seawater intrusion conditions within the area represented by p1 uniquely this causes a continuous inflow of seawater into the inland thus transferring the seawater inland active swi results in the salinization of the entire water column and the absence of fresh groundwater discharge to the sea badaruddin et al 2017 2015 this is confirmed by both the ec and t profiles in p1 fig 7a and b which reveals the presence of seawater in p1 assumption of the interdependence between p1 t and the adriatic sea t has been validated by use of available t time series unless the p1 t has been observed by the implemented monitoring system adriatic sea t at the study area has been taken by the available web service https seatemperature info hr hrvatska ploce temperatura vode html fig 8a and b although the a priori dependence is clearly visible from fig 8a fig 8b depicts a cross correlation model that provides additional confirmation of this the highest observed cross correlation coefficient between average daily adriatic sea t and average daily p1 t is 0 96 with a time lag corresponding to 6 days implying the p1 t being late for the sea t similar finding valid for the ec and piezometric head but with different time scales has been evidenced in the work by lovrinović et al 2022 for the period of august october 2021 unless the interdependence of the p1 deeper water column t and the adriatic sea t upper water column t above 4 m a s l is dominantly influenced by the t changes induced by insolation from the air t observed cross correlation coefficient between air t and p1 t corresponds to value of 0 86 with time lag of 18 days fig 8b demonstrating minor influence of air t to control the p1 t compared to sea t influence 4 2 jasenska area inspection of fig 9 initially emphasize interdependence between river neretva discharge ps modric intake basin surface water elevation and gwl in p2 following longer precipitation occurrence during rain season river neretva discharge is increased reflecting the p2 gwl increase during the dry season river neretva discharge is observed mainly below 250 m3 s 1 and gwl within the shallow aquifer follows the mean value of the surface water elevation observed in the ps modric basin thus demonstrating the superiority of ps modric operation in the definition of the groundwater regime as found along the whole opuzen usce area and especially jasenska sub area it is important to note p2 is located only 75 m away from the channel jasenska which strengthen the fact about the melioration system operative regime influence to p2 gwl the occurrence of precipitation is followed by an increase in p2 gwl figs 9 and 10a in the absence of precipitation during the dry period the mean gwl in p2 corresponds to the mean water level elevation in ps modric emphasizing the influence of ps modric s operational regime daily oscillations in p2 gwl are only detectable via the coherence model between the wl in ps modric and the gwl in p2 fig 11a these daily oscillations correspond to the ps modric s night and day operational schedule mean coherence values obtained between the ps modric level and gwl in p2 equals to 0 84 and 0 65 respectively for diurnal and semi diurnal frequencies during the dry period while precipitation reduces those values of 0 38 and 0 34 respectively fig 11a this difference distinguishes two periods with different factors controlling the p2 gwl unless the rain season causes the change in river neretva hydrological regime which acts to dominate gwl in jasenska shallow unconfined aquifer it is the ps modric driven melioration system which controls the gwl along the inland of opuzen usce area during dry season inspection of time lags between the ps modric water elevation induced by precipitation and p2 gwl from the coherence model shown in fig 11a reveals the simultaneous change in those variables during precipitation occurrence unless the p2 change driven by the ps modric operation during dry season is characterised by time lag of 3 23 h for diurnal related frequency transience of ec as observed at p2 shows different response to precipitation compared to gwl while the p2 gwl is increased due to the precipitation ec is reduced this is especially visible after precipitation of 30 mm day 1 or greater the highest drop in ec value has been observed between january 22nd and february 2nd when ec decreased by 29 1 ms cm 1 to a final value of 13 63 ms cm 1 figs 9 and 10b a similar effect is observed in may after a precipitation of 28 mm day 1 but with a less pronounced drop in ec although notable amount of precipitation occurred during november and december the response of ec values in p2 is missed due to probe malfunction during this period after the precipitation ends ec in jasenska area shows exponential recovery feature which reflects slow but significant influence of the external stress controlling the ec rise at the probe depth during the dry season when neretva discharge falls below 250 m3 s 1 ec values observed in p2 are usually above 50 ms cm 1 which is the evidence of significant volume of seawater affecting the radius of influence of the piezometer similar results were presented in the study by lovrinović et al 2021 precipitation effects in ec can also be seen in the spectrogram as an increase in drops during late january early february and early may fig 10b the coherence between ps modric water level and p2 ec fig 11b reveals values higher than 0 60 for the frequencies corresponding to the precipitation occurrence during late january early february mid july and mid september as well as for diurnal frequencies during summer the latter implies the interplay of precipitation and ps modric operative regime in ec control hereby the frequencies corresponding to the precipitation occurrence show negative phase of p2 ec relative to ps modric intake basin water elevation fig 11b which means the increase of the surface water elevation in the jasenska channel due to the operating regime of ps modric causes the decrease in p2 ec and vice versa the diurnal components of ps modric water level and p2 ec possess maximum coherence values of 0 88 and 0 87 respectively during july and august when the peak of the dry season occurs hereby the time lag of the ec relative to the cause of ec change equals to 15 17 h ec profiles fig 12a were obtained to a depth of 8 3 m a s l due to the probe location in piezometer with a maximum value of 45 16 ms cm 1 observed above the probe on october 9th fifth profiling while the minimum value above the probe has been observed on november 25th sixth profiling at 10 49 ms cm 1 the profiling has been performed after long rain period with an average daily river neretva discharge of 625 m3 s 1 and minor stratification in p2 ec noticed the profiling performed on june 17th show most significant ec values stratification this difference is a consequence of the decrease of the neretva discharge during the transition from rain to dry period indicating the freshwater from the rainy period is still present in the upper layer of the unconfined aquifer four profiles obtained during the dry period show a negligible difference among themselves and a kind of stable groundwater column contrary to ec and gwl t in p2 shows stability with minor changes except two isolated rainfalls during january 22nd and february 2nd when small decrease in gw t is noticed for the same reason as mentioned for ec t data series is not available during november and december t profiles fig 12b correspond to the recharge type of t profile kayane et al 1985 with constant t at the bottom and pronounced vertical stratification the main processes of recharge as seen in figs 9 and 12 are assumed as infiltration of precipitation into the aquifer and swi surface to ground t may represent t over a time scale with surface t referring to the effect of daily air t t observed at final depth may represent the average annual t or the mean t of a longer period as seen in fig 9 4 3 vidrice area p4 gwl has noticeable diurnal oscillations figs 13 and 14c with an increasing trend during precipitation events the highest precipitation induced increase has been observed on january 23rd when a precipitation of 70 3 mm day 1 caused increase of p4 gwl of 0 87 m trends of gwl in p4 and ps prag intake water elevation caused by precipitation during january april may and december coincide as shown in figs 13 14b and c and 15c diurnal oscillations of p4 gwl do not show transition between spring and neap tide fig 13 instead regular alternation of one maximum and one minimum daily are observed which corresponds to the operating regime of ps prag tidal efficiency of 0 76 has been identified during august between ps prag surface water elevation and p4 gwl representing the dominance of the ps prag operation in the p4 gwl definition the coherence model applied to ps prag water elevation and p4 gwl time series in fig 15c confirms corresponding diurnal variations with coherence value 0 99 and no time lag between during whole year since the distance in between is less than 20 m additional inspection of the influences to p4 gwl has been focused to mala neretva water elevation represented by uuu as explained within the chapter 2 mala neretva is closed system except during specific circumstances when oun or uuu gates are opened unless no oun manoeuvre has occurred during 2019 several opening manoeuvres of uuu have been captured based on the insight to uuu time series in fig 13 since the gates opening swl becomes a boundary condition defining the mala neretva water elevation periods referring to the uuu opening correspond to late january and early february early april and may as well as during november and december as can be seen in fig 13 and fig 14a due to the connection with the adriatic sea mala neretva water elevation shows presence of diurnal and semidiurnal components in its periodicity the coherence between uuu water level and gwl in p4 has a mean value of 0 7 for the frequency with period of 24 h with varying phase between them fig 15a this can be explained by the fact both signals are influenced by daily changes in atmospheric pressure in addition to gwl oscillations in p4 where daily oscillations of ps prag are detectable figs 14b and 15c thus creating different phases between these two signals observed p4 ec values fig 13 show p4 contains mostly brackish water during the dry period the ec values are mostly found below 3 ms cm 1 at the probe level while the rain period leads to increase up to 7 31 ms cm 1 from january 20th to january 22nd with on average daily precipitation of 19 1 mm day 1 ec increased from 3 56 ms cm 1 to 6 42 ms cm 1 ec reduction from 6 42 ms cm 1 to 4 93 ms cm 1 has been observed after the precipitation of 70 3 mm day 1 correspondence in the transient nature of p4 gwl and ec is supported by the spectrograms in fig 14c and d a closer look at those correspondence events shows two phenomena of the behaviour of ec in p4 i increase of ec occurs after the precipitation and ii when the precipitation overcomes approximately 40 mm day 1 ec decreases coherence evidences significant correlation between p4 gwl and ec especially during precipitation occurrence fig 15b unless precipitation exceed 40 mm day 1 the time lag shows ec change occurs with phase lag equals to half of the period corresponding to the frequency of interest this means the increase in gwl leads to reduction in ec the latter is shown to be sensitive to window size used during the coherence analysis performance the t time series in p4 show similar characteristics to the t observed at p2 the t shows mostly constant values throughout the year with isolated drops in the t during precipitation periods highest t drops are observed after heavy precipitation in late january and early february besides those two events the t in p4 ranges between 14 95 ºc and 19 11 ºc over the observed period inspection of ec and t profiles at p4 and mala neretva implies no interdependence figs 16a and 16b ec in p4 fluctuates from 2 40 to 3 15 ms cm 1 without the stratification in the unconfined aquifer highest t observed during profiling equals to 17 50 c and has been observed during sixth profiling performed on november 25th similar finding has been reported for jasenska area and p2 piezometer previously analysed interdependence between mala neretva water elevation and p4 gwl did not show similarity the inspection of ec profiles emphasizes almost freshwater as found along the mala neretva which supports the primary scope of mala neretva as a main source of fresh water suitable for irrigation of the area of interest 5 discussion in this paper an analysis has been presented with a goal to understand factors controlling the groundwater parameters transient nature along the neretva coastal aquifers system besides three fundamentally different subareas inspection as evidenced along the results section we extend the analysis to strengthen the findings up and empower their significance 5 1 active seawater intrusion conditions diga area has been determined as a main corridor for the inflow of seawater into the coastal aquifer system dominant controlling factors defining the groundwater quality within the shallow unconfined aquifer are the adriatic sea and melioration system channel parallel to the shoreline which converges towards the ps modric intake basin insight to the fig 17 emphasizes different swl conditions observed prior six in situ profiling performance not only in the mean swl but also in the tide occurrence referring to rising or falling tide by coupling ec profiling results shown in fig 7 and swl features in fig 17 it is evident highest ec values are observed during profiling done on june 17th and july 17th 2019 first and second profiling lowest observed ec values at the probe elevation have been observed during september 18th fourth profiling although highest mean swl has been observed during november 25th sixth profiling the latter did not lead to highest observed ec in p1 those features suggest it is not the mean swl the factor which controls the ec at diga groundwater in shallow aquifer although the micro tidal features characterizing the area of interest tidal changes define the inflow of the seawater volume into the coastal system and thus define ec regime fadili et al 2018 levanon et al 2017 2013 during profiling on june 17th and july 17th 2019 a rising tide has been observed with start noticed 3 4 h prior profiling has been done the time difference between the change of the tide from falling to rising and observed ec shows similarity with time lags observed from coherence analysis fig 6b due to the relative ratio between diga gwl and swl in this area swi is classified as the active badaruddin et al 2017 emphasizing the role of swl in the definition of gwl regime 5 2 benefits from frequency domain methods application although time domain models such as the cross correlation have been shown to be successful in identifying and interpreting processes controlling swi miyakoshi et al 2020 vallejos et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 observed time series containing noise can lead to incorrect conclusions in fig 18 a cross correlation model was applied to gwl and ec time series observed in p1 and swl time series to perform a cross correlation analysis observed time series are divided into four day periods for each four day period pre assumed dependent time series are shifted for one hour repeatedly unless maximum cross correlation value and appropriate time lag are determined signal with enhanced periodicity and low noise gwl in p1 showed significant cross correlation with swl being late between 1 and 3 h which is consistent with the coherence model results signal characterized by high noise ec showed negligible correlation with swl in addition the cross correlation between ec in p1 and swl showed the time lag varied strongly compared to the coherence model obtained time lag of ec relative to swl hereby the capacity of the frequency domain methods or strictly the coherence is shown to be superior over time domain methods in the time lag definition between two observed signals main potential limitation hereby stems from the methodological approach used since the presented method based on dft necessitates division of obtained time series into a finite number of screens and windows it is unsuitable for analysing short time series in this study the screen and window sizes are determined by the characteristics and lengths of the obtained time series in order to apply this methodology to a different region and different signals a screen and window size analysis must be performed and selected based on the observed signals characteristics and lengths a appendix 5 3 the source of seawater in an unconfined aquifer to distinguish the confined aquifer as a source of swi through the leakage we follow the outcomes of work by srzić et al 2020 hydrogeological characterization of the area of interest lead towards negligible leakage between confined and unconfined layers based on tidal methods application application of method by rahi and halihan 2013 confirmed the confinement of deep aquifer following the ratio of amplitude spectrum of diurnal and semidiurnal lunar and solar constituents first order data to confirm the existence of compact clay layer have been performed from the borehole drilled during 2022 at the opuzen usce area the clay layer has been evidenced with overall depth of 14 m and average hydraulic conductivity equals to 3 36 10 10 m s 1 geokon zagreb d d 2022 inspection of ec profiling as observed within d2 33 62 ms cm 1 and p2 44 30 ms cm 1 piezometers reflects higher ec values within p2 during dry period fig 19 the only difference from the latter is observed during rain period as a result of profiling performed on november 25th as presented from the work by krvavica et al 2021 krvavica and ružić 2020 river neretva discharge plays dominant role in the definition of the river water column salinity distribution unless during dry season when the discharge takes values usually less than 200 m3 s 1 river neretva shows stratification in the salinity increase in the discharge leads towards the salinity stratification diminishing taking into consideration discharge values during the period prior the profiling on november 25th has been performed one can see the discharge value exceeded 1100 m3 s 1 fig 9 which means river neretva was represented as a fresh water boundary condition which caused the refreshment of the aquifer to gain a deeper understanding of the salinization processes in an unconfined aquifer a total of 17 samples have been taken per piezeometer from 2019 to 2021 from the depth of approximately 9 m beneath the ground level samples have been taken from piezometer with seba kll water sampler in all samples the concentration of major ions is determined in the laboratory and the values of each major ion are expressed in meq l 1 each sample s ionic charge balance error is less than five percent which is considered an acceptable error level najib et al 2017 the ionic ratios of borehole samples are plotted in fig 20a c also the average ratio between the ions presented in fig 20a c is calculated for each piezometer table 2 the na cl ratios are close to 0 86 in all three piezometers table 2 and the ratios of na cl from all samples are located on the standard seawater freshwater mixing line fig 20a indicating the dominance of swi jiao and post 2019 the similarity between p1 and p2 s ca mg ratios 0 19 and 0 20 table 2 fig 20b can be explained by the presence of seawater since the ca mg ratio in seawater ranges from just below 0 2 up to 0 22 jiao and post 2019 the lower ca mg ratio in p1 and p2 in some water samples can be attributed to evaporation jiao and post 2019 the ca mg ratio in p4 is 1 42 table 2 which is the typical value of ca mg in limestone aquifers jiao and post 2019 the cl hco3 is often used as indicator of groundwater contamination with seawater al khatib and al najar 2011 the cl hco3 ratio fig 20c table 2 indicate diga and jasenska area are strongly affected by swi cl hco3 6 6 while vidrice area is moderately affected by swi 6 6 cl hco3 0 5 al khatib and al najar 2011 jiao and post 2019 it is also important to notice lowest cl hco3 ratio in p2 is observed on november 25th 2019 fig 20c after the significant precipitation occurred indicating the refreshment of the jasenska area additionally separate correlation matrices are computed for unconfined and confined aquifers except for hco3 there is a significant correlation between all major ions in both tables indicating both unconfined and confined aquifers derive their salinity from the same source bouderbala 2015 the significant correlation between cl and na k mg2 and ca2 suggests seawater is the primary source of salinization in both aquifers kharroubi et al 2012 qin et al 2013 tables 3 and 4 given the palaeo seawater can significantly salinize coastal aquifers as it has been evidenced worldwide carol et al 2021 dang et al 2022 delsman et al 2014 giambastiani et al 2013 goebel et al 2017 shi and jiao 2014 vallejos et al 2018 van engelen et al 2018 potential sources of seawater as found along the coastal aquifer systems are crucial to be distinguished and identified the identification of palaeo seawater can be determined by developing a palaeo numerical model of the study area with variable boundary conditions that follow marine transgression and regression during the past delsman et al 2014 van engelen et al 2018 by geophysical investigations goebel et al 2017 and by hydrogeochemical and isotopic analysis of groundwater samples dang et al 2022 frollini et al 2022 giambastiani et al 2013 very often the palaeo seawater shows hypersalinity compared to present seawater chang et al 2022 dang et al 2022 giambastiani et al 2013 jiao and post 2019 vallejos et al 2018 which makes them easily identified cl and tds values for each groundwater sample from the neretva valley unconfined aquifer are plotted in fig 21 according to the tds values four classifications of samples were made i freshwater with tds values between 0 and 1 5 g l 1 ii brackish water with tds values between 1 5 and 10 g l 1 iii saline water with tds values between 10 and 35 g l 1 and iv hypersaline water with tds values greater than 35 g l 1 the upper limit of 35 g l 1 for saline water is taken as present seawater has tds value around 35 g l 1 giambastiani et al 2013 groundwater samples from p4 correspond to brackish water with tds values between 1 62 and 2 57 g l 1 while samples from p2 correspond to brackish and saline water with tds values between 6 71 and 24 63 g l 1 fig 21 all samples from the p1 piezometer correspond to the saline water with tds values between 30 14 and 34 33 g l 1 fig 21 two potential facts can explain the absence of hypersaline water in a neretva system unconfined aquifer fig 21 first potential palaeo seawater has been washed out from the aquifer and second groundwater samples contain a mixture of different sources of salinity and freshwater thus leading the tds concentration to be below the present seawater the identification of palaeo seawater has been the subject of research at numerous coastal aquifer locations carol et al 2021 delsman et al 2014 giambastiani et al 2013 goebel et al 2017 vallejos et al 2018 delsman et al 2014 emphasized the significance of using a palaeo hydrogeological model to determine the present salinity of a coastal aquifer as opposed to a steady state model with present day boundary conditions goebel et al 2017 demonstrated the ability of electrical resistivity tomography to identify palaeo seawater in the deeper aquifer along the coast of monterey the studies based on isotopic analysis carol et al 2021 giambastiani et al 2013 vallejos et al 2018 demonstrated the paleo seawater has a substantial impact on the salinization of coastal aquifers same studies demonstrated groundwater samples are frequently a mixture of different salinity and freshwater sources leading to the fact paleo seawater can be present in both shallow and deep aquifers compared to the evidence of holocenic paleo seawater found within the shallow aquifer in the study by vallejos et al 2018 no deterministic evidence of the palaeo seawater has been determined in the neretva system shallow aquifer as a dominant source of p2 ec change e g salinity hereby we highlight the interplay between the river neretva salinity regime and channel jasenka regime lovrinović et al 2022 the main contributing factor relies in the decrease of the ec as observed within the p2 on november 25th 2019 induced by rapid increase in the river neretva discharge and thus freshening of the neretva water column fig 12a the latter implies lateral seawater inflow as a mechanism contributing to the groundwater salinity rather than the holocenic palaeo seawater however to fully understand the processes and sources of salinization of groundwater found within the shallow aquifer as well as the potential sources of palaeo seawater interplay and contribution to observed salinity in the entire neretva valley coastal aquifer a comprehensive geochemical and isotopic analysis of groundwater samples are necessary is mandatory and deserves further investigation 5 4 salinization of melioration sub system vidrice in the geological research performed along this area geokon zagreb d d 2022 several upcoming salt springs have been found therefore with the occurrence of precipitation firstly the brackish water from the springs is washed out towards ps prag basin as it is the converging point of the area driven by the low water level induced by ps prag operative regime which consequently leads to ec increase in p4 a similar phenomenon has been observed in the study of yang et al 2020 where ec in one of the piezometers increased with precipitation the coherence results do not suggest ec in p4 is influenced by either the operating regime of ps prag or the mala neretva water elevation although the proximity to both indicative confirmation of springs contribution to increased ec in p4 especially during precipitation occurrence has been reached through the profiling and sampling of surface water at predetermined locations along the intake channel of the ps prag subsequent determination of the ec has been performed in situ and under controlled environment laboratory conditions during dry and rain periods four surface water samples are collected during 2021 inspection of ec values shown in table 5 discover greater ec values as obtained from the samples taken near the upcoming springs sw 1 than near the ps prag sw 2 during both dry and rain periods it is also important to note ec values are higher during the rain season than during the dry season 6 conclusions this paper deals with the definition of the external parameters and mechanisms influencing swi and defining groundwater parameters respectively gwl ec and t in river neretva coastal aquifer system consisted of shallow unconfined aquifer confining clay layer and confined aquifer the work relies on three sources i time series observed through the implemented monitoring system and ii profilings performed in situ their analysis by application of dft spectrogram and coherence features analysis and iii major ion geochemical analysis and indicators besides the general conclusion three different sub areas along the melioration systems opuzen usce and vidrice show fundamentally different conditions and circumstances below we highlight main findings arose from the presented work diga area representing the embankment delineating opuzen usce area and the adriatic sea represent main corridor for the swi penetrating neretva coastal system due to the operation of the melioration system mean groundwater level as found within the shallow unconfined aquifer is found below the mean swl this uniquely leads to active swi conditions resulting in continuous inflow of the seawater to the inland this 2200 m long barrier between mouth of river neretva and river mala neretva presents a long term corridor for the swi occurrence into the neretva coastal system jasenska area gwl and ec regimes are fundamentally different and should be considered separately unless the gwl is balanced by river neretva water elevation and ps modric operative regime ec shows changes reflected on a larger temporal scale although the changes in gwl are relatively fast acting as a response to precipitation induced recharge and the regime of jasenska melioration channel water elevation ec shows slower response time scales although located 1200 m away from the river neretva left bed stratification of the salinity within the neretva river water column induces the lateral swi to the inland gwl in p4 characterizing vidrice melioration subsystem is shown to be fully determined by the operative regime of ps prag although the gwl regime is driven in this way ec is driven by the features of brackish upcoming springs found along the southern border of the vidrice area where karstic hills exceed ground level due to the fact the ground level found along this area is strictly beneath the mean sea level and fractured karstic massive found between the adriatic sea and vidrice area pathways for the seawater to feed the springs are enabled inspection of main ion geochemical analysis leads towards the conclusion the origin of the salinity of the gw within the shallow unconfined aquifer stems from the swi the latter is also supported by the fact of active swi presence due to the lower gwl relative to mean sea level unless the features of groundwater as found within the shallow unconfined aquifer show sensitivity to external loadings and local circumstances referring to hydrological conditions tidal features and pumping stations operative regimes confined aquifer shows stability in ec the latter is evidenced through similar result obtained in different periods of the hydrological year although the piezometric head of the confined aquifer is shown to be dominantly determined by the swl srzić et al 2020 ec does not behave in the same manner as evidenced from our study funding this research is funded by the contribution from the eu co financing and the interreg italy croatia cbc programme 2014 2020

work reported in this paper appendix a to ensure the relevance of the results arose from the spectrogram and coherence analysis an additional screen size and window size sensitivity analysis has been performed as a representative ps prag water level and p4 gwl were selected for further analysis because the fact the gwl in p4 contains periodic oscillations from ps prag and non periodic oscillations caused by precipitation the sensitivity of spectrograms and coherence models to window size is shown in fig a1 the screen size of 30 days is used in all spectrograms and coherence models shown in fig a1 window sizes of 5 10 15 and 20 days respectively were used to demonstrate the effect of window size on the results it can be seen that the window size affects the spectrogram and coherence results differently increasing the window size results in sharper spectrograms welch s method has been shown to compute asd effectively even when the number of windows in the screen is reduced to 6 fig a1j and k as mentioned earlier increasing the window size increases the number of frequencies in the frequency domain these frequencies represent usually noise while the number of frequencies with significant amplitude increases slightly e g diurnal constituent in sea level with the increase of window size will separate to lunar diurnal constituents k1 and o1 increasing the window size also results in the window being placed over a screen less often therefore for a screen size of 30 days and a window size of 5 days 60 times cpsd is calculated for each frequency for a screen size of 30 days and a window size of 20 days cpsd is calculated only 6 times table a1 which shows the interpretation reliability of the coherence results decreases as the window size increases for window sizes of 15 and 20 days the number of noise frequencies at which significant coherence is calculated increases as cpsd is calculated less often additional clarification of spectrogram and coherence model results was tested with different screen sizes 10 15 20 and 30 days respectively while the window size was set constant 5 days the variation in screen size means that the number of times asd is recorded in the spectrogram changes over analysed period for example a screen size of 30 days has 12 periods when asd is recorded while the screen size of 10 days has 36 periods when asd or coherence is recorded table a1 the smaller the difference between screen size and window size is the less reliable the coherence results will be spectrograms with larger screen size have lower ability to detect non periodic events of precipitation because these events last for a day or more and do not occur in every window found within larger screens fig a2 a and b with a screen size of 30 days show no precipitation effect in may while with the reduction of he screen amplitudes corresponding to the precipitation effect start to dominate the same effect is seen for all periods with precipitation occurrence spectrograms with screen sizes of 10 and 15 days show higher amplitudes in the frequencies corresponding to the trend change due to precipitation than spectrograms with screen size of 20 and 30 days a similar effect of precipitation is seen in the coherence models in fig a2 where the coherence model with a screen size of 30 days fig a2 c has the lowest ability to capture non periodic events fig a2l where the screen size is 10 days has shown the highest ability to describe non periodic events the coherence model with a screen size of 10 days has only 12 windows per screen which also makes it the lowest reliable among the models examined in fig a2 taking into account above mentioned effects of screen and window sizes on the spectrogram and coherence model results and considering the reliability of the coherence results due to the number of calculated cpsd in the coherence a screen size of 15 days and a window size of 5 days were selected as relevant for the

7746,study region river neretva coastal aquifer system located in the south eastern part of croatia study focus the study is focused to determination of the seasonal and non seasonal variations of the groundwater features when influenced by external loadings found at the study area based on time series observed from the monitoring systems in situ profiling and observed external loadings a spectrogram and coherence analysis is performed to detect the peculiarities of the groundwater regimes at three different subareas along the study area new hydrological insights for the region by using several methodological approaches this paper emphasizes the combined effects of precipitation river neretva hydrological regime melioration system operational regimes and tidal effects to the groundwater regime during the dry and rain seasons during the dry period groundwater regime is mainly influenced by the seawater intrusion directly from the sea and from the river neretva bed rain periods are characterized by the increase of the neretva discharge thus eliminating the seawater from the river bed this scenario results in improved quality of the groundwater while diga subarea faces active seawater intrusion jasenska s unconfined aquifer is fed by seawater from the river neretva during the dry season vidrice is the only area where groundwater quality decreases during rain season due to the presence of salinized springs and the fact the area is found below the mean sea level graphical abstract ga1 keywords river neretva coastal system seawater intrusion groundwater

to the ground surface re and zuppi 2011 however depending on the evolution of study area sources of palaeo seawater can also be found in the shallow aquifers carol et al 2021 vallejos et al 2018 standard techniques for identifying salinity sources in coastal aquifers rely on determining the relationship between major ions santucci et al 2016 since palaeo seawater and present seawater can have similar geochemical properties ion ratios cannot always be used to successfully identify palaeo seawater intrusion frollini et al 2022 because of the distinct isotopic fingerprint between these two previously mentioned sources of salinity environmental isotope analysis can be used to identify the presence of both palaeo seawater and present seawater in groundwater argamasilla et al 2017 due to the fact the previously mentioned methods require sample collection and laboratory analysis they are unsuitable for monitoring hourly and daily changes of surface and groundwater in the study area up to date various approaches emerged to understand the transient nature of swi the impact of swi can be predicted fairly accurate by using variable density numerical models and laboratory experiments kuan et al 2019 levanon et al 2019 paldor et al 2019 stein et al 2019 van engelen et al 2019 xu et al 2019 geochemical analysis has been proven as a successful tool for identifying salinization processes in coastal areas behera et al 2019 de oliveira gomes et al 2019 khan et al 2020 najib et al 2017 in addition to the aforementioned approaches time series analysis of data obtained from installed monitoring systems in coastal aquifers has been proven to be an efficient approach for determining hydrogeological parameters fuentes arreazola et al 2018 xia and li 2009 and identifying swi processes and salinity regimes of the groundwater as found within the coastal aquifer systems vallejos et al 2014 wood and harrington 2015 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 swi as found at specific coastal systems have been a research subject of multiple number of research groups during the ongoing decade numerical modelling approach has been used in the work by dibaj et al 2021 to investigate the peculiarities affecting swi in taiwan site australian national inventory of swi has been elaborated within the work by morgan and werner 2015 variable density modelling has been shown as a useful tool for water management of coastal systems abd elaty and zelenakova 2022 this is especially helpful during swi risk assessment analysis caused by the climate change projections in a similar manner zoning of coastal aquifer area based on tds salinity and geochemical features has been presented in study by vahidipour et al 2021 the kimje coastal area in korea has been the subject of research by kim et al 2005 where the relationship between observed time series of seawater elevation swl and groundwater level gwl versus electrical conductivity ec in piezometers has been established leading to the conclusion the groundwater quality is subjected to tidal influence similar methodology has been used to demonstrate tides affect the movement of the saltwater freshwater interface in jeju island korea kim et al 2006 jeju island has been again the subject of a research by kim et al 2008a who analysed the dynamic behaviour of saltwater freshwater interaction at five different coastal zones results showed gwl ec and temperature t have been affected by tidal variations and intensive precipitation monitoring systems have been proven as a tool with a capacity to capture for relevant information along the venice coast in italy where swi vulnerability has been assessed by taking into account ec gwl and distance to saline and freshwater sources da et al 2015 lovrinović et al 2021 investigated the capacity of two independent monitoring systems one in neretva valley and the second in the venice lagoon in italy based on observed gwl ec and t time series both monitoring systems have been found to be capable to offer necessary information for the identification of swi processes neretva valley represents the largest agricultural area in the coastal area of croatia conservation of the area means long term sustainability of the population living in the valley which further emphasises the need for the monitoring and understanding the transient nature of swi present hereby previous studies in neretva valley have been conducted as a pre project phases for water management infrastructure implementation hydrogeological characterization of neretva valley has been performed in the study of srzić et al 2020 while several studies dealt with swi related problems in neretva coastal system lovrinović et al 2022 2021 racetin et al 2020 romić et al 2020 zovko et al 2018 in this paper local responses of the shallow coastal aquifer groundwater features to different external loadings which are assumed to contribute the complexity of swi are investigated relying on observed values of gwl ec t water level from rivers neretva and mala neretva and surface and groundwater profiling results each piezometer location represents a different microsite along the study area with different boundary conditions representing specific local conditions and dominant loadings influencing groundwater the relationship between the loadings to the aquifer and the aquifer response is established by using spectrograms and coherence models based on the discrete fourier transform dft even though dft has found wide application in different scientific areas to our best knowledge this is the first time spectrograms and coherence models based on dft are being used for the analysis especially when influenced by swi besides the methodological approach the study enables the insight to up to date results and findings to not well explored case study of neretva coastal aquifer located in the southeastern croatia compared to previous publications being focused to this case study area hereby we summarise main differences and novelties i this paper covers neretva aquifer area including opuzen usce vidrice and jasenska areas thus increasing the generality of the findings ii the relevance of hydrometeorological conditions tidal oscillations and melioration system operative regimes has been investigated separately for different subareas of the case study iii this study relies on whole 2019 year of data sets thus enabling the insight to groundwater features phenomena at the time scale larger than seasonal characteristic iv applied methodology enables the insight to multiple external loadings impact simultaneously via the use of coherence model 2 study area 2 1 historical overview and geographical settings river neretva valley is located in the very southeastern part of croatia fig 1 specific part of the valley located between the adriatic sea to the west and town opuzen to the east has been considered as an area of interest of this paper through the 20th century the alluvial soil of the lower neretva valley has been identified as a highly potential agricultural area mainly by local population until the second half of 20th century most of 4200 ha of the neretva valley was mainly a marshland starting from 1960 s up to date an infrastructural development led to the construction of embankment diga creating a physical barrier between the study area and the adriatic sea fig 1 melioration channels and pumping stations with the implementation of firstly melioration and later flood protection and partially irrigation systems better agricultural conditions have been reached and kept up to date study area is alluvial delta fed by the alluvium from river neretva it is surrounded by karstic hills to the north as well as to the south and southwest terrain elevation of the valley s central part ranges between 2 50 to 2 00 m a s l nula trsta vertical datum is used as reference for all elevation data along the paper as well for absolute piezometric head values used within the paper while the embankment diga fig 1 is recognised as a border between adriatic sea and the inland to the west river neretva represents a natural boundary to the north while mala neretva mimics the border of the opuzen usce area to the south opuzen usce area can be divided into two specific sub areas respectively jasenska and crepina as seen in fig 1 vidrice area is separated melioration subsystem located to the south from river mala neretva and is surrounded by karstic hills to the east south and west along the vidrice area the terrain elevation ranges between 1 50 and 1 00 m a s l 2 2 climatological and meteorological conditions meteorological and climatological conditions along the study area have been provided by data sets observed at the meteorological station ploče operated by croatian hydrometeorological institute ploče station is located about 8 km to the west from the opuzen town and 2 km to the north west from the neretva mouth fig 1 during the reference period 2009 2019 cumulative annual precipitation ranged from 692 4 to 1768 mm year 1 through the hydrological year the area of interest is characterized by two main periods rain season characterizing period from november to april dominantly recognised by frequent precipitation and low air t and dry season which lasts from may to october with mainly sporadic precipitation occurrence and higher air t during the period 2010 2019 rain season cumulative precipitation ranged between 491 2 mm and 1273 8 mm while dry season cumulative precipitation ranged between 154 9 mm and 670 8 mm fig 2 2 3 geological and hydrogeological settings the geological definition of the study area has been determined by inspection and analysis of in situ geotechnical and geophysical investigations performed from 1906 s up to date elektrosond zagreb 1963 1962 geofizika zagreb 1966 1962 geoid beroš ltd 2014 geokon zagreb d d 2022 2013 2008 2005 institute igh plc 2013 2019 the upper layer representing unconfined aquifer unit consists of fine sands with local presence of clay and silt the thickness of clay and silt layers does not exceed 1 m thus representing local heterogeneities the sand layer is found throughout the study area with a thickness ranging from 1 to 10 m depending on the location fig 3 the gwl as found within the sand layer is kept below the sea level with mean annual value of 0 74 m a s l for p1 location as obtained from 2019 observations 1 93 m a s l for p2 and 1 22 m a s l for p4 under the sand layer a low conductive layer of clay is found the clay layer has a thickness of 10 12 m near the city of opuzen and increases up to 25 m towards the sea the further extension of this layer under the seabed from the coast to the offshore area is given as about 1400 m srzić et al 2020 beneath the clay layer a variable depth gravel layer is found confinement of this layer is confirmed in the study by srzić et al 2020 the depth of this layered roof is reported to be about 20 m in the east and up to 35 m in the west in the central area of interest and in the northern and southern areas a conglomerate layer is found at a depth of 40 45 m with a thickness of 1 3 m the discontinuity of this layer should be highlighted as this layer was not found in all available boreholes beneath the conglomerate layer is an expanse of gravel consisting mostly of fine and medium gravel the mean annual value of gwl in the confined gravel layer is higher than the mean annual value of swl faculty of civil engineering 2019 the base of the area is defined with limestone bedrock the bedrock was found to be zero on the edge of the neretva valley while in the central area called crepina it reaches a depth of 165 m institute igh plc 2013 2019 the determined values of hydraulic conductivity in the confined aquifer range from 7 10 4 to 7 5 10 3 m s 1 srzić et al 2020 across the entire study area with the effective porosity ranges from 0 15 to 0 25 while the values of specific storage range from 2 87 to 4 97 10 6 m 1 srzić et al 2020 confining geological unit made of clay is characterized by the hydraulic conductivity values ranging from 3 95 10 12 to 9 66 10 6 m s 1 geokon zagreb d d 2022 on average values of hydraulic conductivity of unconfined aquifer have been determined from 1 15 10 4 to 1 19 10 4 m s 1 the issue of upstream boundary condition recharge of the upper unconfined aquifer of interest for this study has been shown to be of minor impact to local hydrogeological and salinity conditions as shown in work by lovrinović et al 2021 and lovrinović et al 2022 instead the operation of the melioration system has been shown to overcome local features and effects of precipitation recharge either lateral inflows from the river neretva and mala neretva 2 4 hydrological conditions two main processes the amount of precipitation over the river basin and the operational regime of the mostar hydroelectric power plant located upstream from town mostar in bosnia and herzegovina define the river neretva discharge at the study area from 2009 2019 discharge ranged from 40 m3 s 1 to 2092 m3 s 1 the amount of 40 m3 s 1 represents the biological minimum of the mostar hydroelectric power plant the neretva river discharge shows significant seasonal fluctuations during the dry season from may to october the discharge fluctuates between 40 m3 s 1 and 250 m3 s 1 with occasional peaks above 250 m3 s 1 while rain season from november to april results with discharge values between 200 m3 s 1 and 1700 m3 s 1 discharge values higher than 1700 m3 s 1 corresponds to specific return periods and are adopted to specified occurrence probabilities hrvatske vode 2014 2 5 tidal characteristics the tides in the adriatic sea are of mixed diurnal semidiurnal type janeković and kuzmić 2005 srzić et al 2020 with significant differences in amplitudes between neap and spring tides the maximum amplitude of the tides in adriatic sea ranges from 15 cm in the southern part of the sea to 50 cm in the northern part janeković and kuzmić 2005 in a study by srzić et al 2020 for the period of august 2015 four dominant tidal constituents were identified within the sea level observations signature namely o1 and k1 as diurnal constituents and m2 and s2 as semi diurnal constituents 2 6 operative regimes as already explained neretva valley is surrounded by rivers neretva and mala neretva mala neretva is a branch of neretva river separated from the neretva river by the gates marked as oun and from the adriatic sea by the gates marked as uuu fig 1 mala neretva system is initially designed to receive excess discharge from the neretva river to protect the area from flooding when the discharge of the neretva river is greater than the capacity of the riverbed both gates should be opened to evacuate water downstream to the adriatic sea nowadays due to anthropogenic interventions in the area of the riverbed mala neretva this system initially planned for flood protection does not fulfil its original purpose instead it is used as a main source of freshwater during dry season where water is dispersed from for purpose of irrigation to prevent seawater intrusion into mala neretva uuu gates are regulated so the mala neretva water elevation is kept higher compared to the swl this gradient does not allow sea water cline intrude upstream from the mala neretva mouth contrary to the uuu the oun gates are opened rare usually only when the water level in mala neretva is higher than in neretva which happens during recession part of neretva river hydrograph after the occurrence of peak values in this way sea water cline from neretva riverbed is not allowed to intrude mala neretva thus enabling the refreshment of the volume found within the mala neretva system besides the intermittent refreshment from neretva riverbed during dry period mala neretva is constantly fed by fresh water from the channel maksimilijan whose intake is located upstream form metković town fig 1 this enables appropriate amount of fresh water which is used for irrigation of the central part of the area of interest including crepina area parallel to flood protection and irrigation systems along the area of interest melioration system is put into operation to keep the groundwater surface elevation below the pedological layer and to enable agricultural production in order to achieve the groundwater delineation a system of melioration channels was built whose purpose is to bring water to pumping stations intake basins the modric pumping station ps modric has an installed capacity of 19 6 m3 s 1 and is located at the mouth of mala neretva following fig 1 it collects the water from opuzen usce area and transfers it to the adriatic sea the prag pumping station ps prag has a capacity of 6 5 m3 s 1 fig 1 and is used for delineation of the water table within the vidrice area by pumping to the river mala neretva both pumping stations are turned on manually once a day during the night regime operation time is controlled by the supervisor of the pumping station and depends on local meteorological and hydrological conditions regardless of the operational time the water level in the pumping station s intake basin is observed at the beginning and end of the working shift normally at 10 pm and 8 am unless additional shifts are required during intensive precipitation events water level observations within the intake basins are available prior and post the pumping operation 3 methodology 3 1 ground and surface water monitoring system and approaches in the lower neretva valley a monitoring system has been installed to observe seawater intrusion parameters in piezometers fig 1 these parameters include groundwater level gwl electrical conductivity ec and temperature t at four locations sea and rivers surface elevations were observed sea level swl was measured near the mouth of river mala neretva whereas river surface elevations wl were measured at two locations of mala neretva one downstream from the gate in opuzen city marked as oun and the other uuu upstream from the gates near the mouth of the river in the vicinity of the city of opuzen the surface elevation of the neretva river has been observed gwl ec and t in an unconfined aquifer were measured at three locations using piezometers p1 p2 and p4 all piezometers included in the study were drilled 10 m below ground level with a 12 centimeter diameter hole the bottom 9 5 m of the pipe s screen height have been perforated gauges are installed two meters up from the piezometer bottom following the gwl in each shallow piezometer in river neretva coastal aquifer only deepest 7 8 m of each piezometer screen is located below the gwl deep piezometers consist solely of perforations in a deep confined aquifer with total heights of up to 3 m and are therefore considered as short screened piezometers piezometers with similar perforation heights as used in this study have been successfully used for seawater origin determination de oliveira gomes et al 2019 frollini et al 2022 pilla and torrese 2022 santucci et al 2016 and for identification of coastal aquifer external loadings and their influence to groundwater fadili et al 2018 shin and hwang 2020 zhang et al 2020 surface water monitoring locations are equipped with thalimedes ott gauge with a sampling frequency of 1 hour measuring range of 19 999 m resolution of 0 001 m and accuracy of 0 002 m ott orpheus mini vented gauge was used in all piezometers to observe gwl and set up to sampling frequency of 1 hour with measuring range from 0 to 40 m and resolution of 0 001 m a manta 2 40 gauges were also installed in all piezometers to observe groundwater ec and t in piezometers this gauge has a measuring range of 0 100 ms cm 1 with an accuracy of 1 and 0 0001 ms cm 1 resolution for the ec standardized to 25 c the t sensors range is 5 c to 50 c with resolution of 0 01 c and an accuracy of 0 1 c the timing of all gauges is synchronized all gauges and probes used as a setup within the neretva valley monitoring system are equipped with strain gauge transducers for measuring the pressure of ground and surface water the gauges and probes automatically convert pressure readings to a hydrostatic water pressure in low lying deltas it is crucial to observe pressure rather than hydraulic head to avoid misinterpretations of groundwater fluxes direction caused by fluids of variable density post et al 2007 for the purpose of this research time series obtained from the monitoring network during 2019 sea and river gauges provide year round data on the sea surface and river surface elevation gwl ec and t from borehole p1 and gwl from boreholes p2 and p4 due to malfunctioning probes ec and t in boreholes p2 and p4 are available from january to november the nula trsta vertical datum is used as a reference for all observed gwl swl and wl values just as it is for terrain elevation in order to gain insight into the vertical stratification of ec and t six profilings were performed throughout the 2019 profiling is performed on all piezometers and the mala neretva river they are conducted primarily during the dry season with the exception of the most recent profile which was conducted in november and did not include mala neretva table 1 the seba kll q 2 multiparameter probe was used to record gwl and ec t values at various depths the probe has the following measuring ranges 0 500 m water column for pressure 5 c to 50 c for t and 0 200 ms cm 1 for ec 3 2 time series spectrogram and coherence observed time series in boreholes whether the groundwater head or ec indicate the composition of various aquifer stresses each aquifer stress corresponds to a particular frequency or group of frequencies with amplitude period and phase corresponding to each frequency dong et al 2015 every periodic and aperiodic function in time is decomposed by the fourier transform into the sum of the sine and cosine functions proakis and manolakis 2006 observed signals represent discrete time series therefore the emphasis of fourier transform is on the discrete signals the formula for discrete fourier transform dft cooley et al 1969 is 1 x k n 0 n 1 x n e i 2 π kn n k 0 n 1 using euler s formula eq 1 can be written as 2 x k n 0 n 1 x n cos 2 π kn n i sin 2 π kn n k 0 n 1 or 3 x k a k i b k where x k is the value of the k th frequency in the frequency bin k is the number of frequency in the frequency bin n is the number of samples x n is the n th sample value and a k and b k are complex numbers the frequency resolution of a plot or frequency bin is defined as the sampling frequency divided by the number of samples the frequency of the k th position in the frequency bin is defined as 4 f k n f s n where f s is sampling frequency and n is the sample number plotting a k and b k in complex plane magnitude m and phase φ of each frequency can be calculated 5 m k a k b k φ k tan 1 b k a k typically dft results are displayed as amplitude spectral density asd or power spectral density psd normalizing the dft results by the number of samples entered in dft yields an asd and the squared value of the asd s amplitude yields a psd the periods and amplitudes of each calculated frequency can be easily deduced from the amplitude spectrum fuentes arreazola et al 2018 srzić et al 2020 turnadge et al 2019 stresses on the aquifer can be divided into periodic stresses such as tides daily changes in atmospheric pressure daily operating regime of pumping stations and non periodic stresses which are usually caused by a change in meteorological conditions or operating regime in the case of non periodic stresses such as precipitation the asd of the aquifer response will have a range of frequencies with different amplitudes to mimic the non periodic signal isermann and münchhof 2011 so a closer look at the time series in the frequency domain is necessary the coherence model was used to establish a measure of similarity as a function in phase shift between frequencies calculated from observed signals represent stresses on the aquifer and aquifer response signals the following is the formula for magnitude square coherence 6 r k g xy k φ 2 g xx k g yy k g xy k represents the cross power spectral density cpsd whereas g xx f and g yy f represent the psd of signals psd can also be described as the fourier transform of the auto covariance function while cpsd can be described as the fourier transform of the cross covariance function between two signals as a function of phase shift coherence values range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating complete coherence and 0 indicating incoherence since the coherence model does not include information about the amplitude size of the coherence frequencies it is possible to have significant coherence between both frequencies of interest and noise the welch method welch 1967 was used to avoid the interpretation of coherence between noise frequencies and to highlight the dominant frequencies first time series are partitioned into a finite number of smaller time series known as screens and then the welch method is applied to each screen moving a window over a data set on screen and calculating the asd or psd each time the window is moved is required by the welch method the average of all asds in a screen is recorded and all screens are combined to form a spectrogram which is an image depicting the distribution of all asds the spectrogram provides information about the spectrum s temporal evolution pérez gómez et al 2016 to ensure calculation consistency the welch method was applied to the spectrogram with the same window shape size and overlap points as the coherence model the results were calculated using modules from the scipy library which is integrated with python 3 7 the coherence models and welch s method scipy modules are based on the same study welch 1967 observed annual time series were divided into 24 periods referred to as screens with 15 day data for each screen see a appendix the coherence between two time series was calculated for each screen using a tukey window with a shape parameter of 0 25 and a window length of 120 data 5 days reliable monthly coherence results were determined the tukey window was shifted over 110 overlapping data points to generate 24 coherence models for each window in the results the mean value of all coherence models was interpreted 4 results to identify and elaborate processes influencing swi and its impact to groundwater dynamics within neretva case study we separately analyse three locations of interest along the study area those three locations correspond to fundamentally different areas respectively i piezometer p1 at diga area which is dominantly influenced by the swi ii piezometer p2 located at jasenska area which is a part of river neretva left bank area and iii p4 piezometer which is representative for vidrice melioration subsystem the analysis has been performed based on i continuous data series of ec t and gwl ii swl and wl and iii on groundwater and surface water profilings of t and ec performed six times during 2019 4 1 diga area fig 4 demonstrates the correspondence of trends of gwl in p1 and swl both trends imply the influence of atmospheric pressure which can be seen by the increase in the atmospheric pressure and the decrease in gwl and swl trends and vice versa the specific occurrence of such an inverse interdependence of these two variables of interest and the atmospheric pressure is especially evident during significant atmospheric pressure changes during late january mid and late february early april and may mid and late october and several changes during november and december 2019 during 2019 ps modric intake basin water elevation reflects the chainsaw feature which is a consequence of dominantly night operative regime fig 4 turbines are put into operation at the end of the day usually between 8 and 10 pm depending on local hydrological and meteorological conditions while the turnoff is usually scheduled between 6 and 9 am this feature is noticeable by the inspection of spectrogram in fig 5b where daily period is observed as present during the whole year of interest significant changes in the amplitude of the ps modric intake basin water surface elevation are present for larger periods during january 2019 when significant decrease in atmospheric pressure and precipitation occurrence are present the annual mean gwl at p1 equals to 1 09 m beneath than the mean swl indicating the presence of active seawater intrusion conditions badaruddin et al 2017 2015 in the studies by lovrinović et al 2022 2021 and srzić et al 2020 the tidal signal in the swl characterizing study area is identified of a mixed type with regular changes in the periods of spring and neap tides fig 4 observed dominant frequencies of gwl in p1 fig 5c correspond to the dominant frequencies of the sea level signal fig 5a with noticeable decrease in amplitudes due to the attenuation caused by the filtering effect of the aquifer media the semidiurnal component in the swl has a larger mean annual amplitude value 0 013 m compared to diurnal component 0 11 m while the opposite occurs in the p1 gwl respectively the semidiurnal component has a value of 0 028 m and the diurnal has a value of 0 03 m this is expected since the tidal efficiency is dominantly influenced by the signal period rather than the amplitude erskine 1991 jiao and tang 1999 specific yield in the unconfined aquifer can have several orders of magnitude higher values than the storativity in the confined aquifer and therefore the attenuation of sea level oscillations within the unconfined aquifer is larger guo et al 2007 ratner narovlansky et al 2020 compared to confined aquifer conditions srzić et al 2020 studies teo et al 2003 yeh et al 2010 have shown unconfined aquifers in coastal systems can be significantly affected by the swl fluctuations supporting the similarity with p1 observed gwl deeper inspection of the similarity between the p1 gwl and swl time series has been derived from the spectrogram analysis as shown in fig 5a and c hereby p1 gwl implies the similarity with swl when analysed in frequency domain dominant amplitude spectrum values correspond to mixed tide periods as observed by srzić et al 2020 confirming the dominance of the swl in the transient definition of p1 gwl the latter is expected due the fact p1 is located 80 m from the coastline and is therefore directly affected by the swl variations that couples the effect of the atmospheric pressure and tidal influence long term changes in atmospheric pressure are also visible in the spectrogram of swl and p1 gwl fig 5a and c for the frequencies corresponding to periods higher than daily highest amplitude values are present for the periods of january mid and late february early april and may mid and late october and several changes during november and december fig 5c those periods emphasize the nature of the cause of atmospheric pressure which is explained as a consequence of the air front movement along the pathway over different geographic locations dong et al 2015 merritt 2004 the latter is different and should be distinguished from the daily changes in atmospheric pressure mostly caused by day night regime of the t change the values of the coherence model are shown in fig 6 with the colour bar where total coherence is marked with red colour and no coherence with blue colour arrows indicate the phase in degrees between the same frequency in two signals with coherence determined as 0 6 or higher an arrow pointing to the right denotes no time lag between two constituents of signals of interest while an arrow pointing to the left means opposite phases of the corresponding constituents the arrow representation has been shown to be a suitable method for visualising time lags between frequencies in two signals briciu 2019 zhang et al 2020 also frequencies with periods between 2 and 4 h were removed from the spectrogram and coherence results because they correspond to noise frequencies dong et al 2015 and to improve the visibility of frequencies of interest mean annual coherence values of 0 95 and 0 99 have been determined between diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies corresponding to swl and gwl in p1 with an annual mean time lag of 2 68 h and 0 77 h standard deviation for the diurnal and a time lag of 1 58 h and 0 24 h standard deviation for the semidiurnal component fig 6a indicates the swl and gwl trends occur at the same time implying the cause different than tides following the significant interconnection between swl and p1 gwl we extend the analysis to ec assuming the swl as a driving force controlling the ec in p1 ec in p1 has a relatively constant value varying slightly between 48 16 ms cm 1 and 50 7 ms cm 1 throughout the year fig 4 coherence inspection between swl and p1 ec reveals significant values for periods corresponding to the tidal constituents in fig 6b annual mean values of ec time lag relative to swl corresponds to 2 49 h with coherence of 0 71 for diurnal constituent semidiurnal constituent corresponding time lag equals to 2 58 h with 0 73 coherence value the standard deviation values of 1 71 h and 0 91 h have been determined for annual time lags of the diurnal and semidiurnal constituents precipitation does not dominate the ec values in p1 compared to swl influence as can be seen in figs 4 and 5d the latter is a consequence of several factors i the position of the probe below the transition zone in p1 fig 7a ii proximity of the adriatic sea and iii precipitation occurred at the study area drains towards the melioration channel located 30 m inland from the p1 ec profiles fig 7a can be divided into two layers the first layer transition zone from the surface to a depth of 4 m a s l and the second layer from 4 m a s l to the position of the piezometer probe at 9 m a s l while ec profiles in unconfined aquifers in the seawater proximity usually show transition from freshwater to seawater in ec profiles kim et al 2008b 2006 shin and hwang 2020 hereby the transition zone detectable from fig 7 has a transition zone with a maximum difference between upper and lower values of 4 13 ms cm 1 by coupling the shape of the profiles of ec and the fact the gwl in p1 is found below swl suggests active seawater intrusion conditions along the diga area represented by p1 badaruddin et al 2017 2015 the layer below the transition zone does not show stratification in ec but vary up to maximum 1 96 ms cm 1 as observed between the first and fourth profiling the t profiles in p1 can be divided vertically into two sub layers same as for the ec the first layer up to a depth of 4 m shows vertically varying t while the second layer below 4 m has relatively constant t fig 7b changing from 18 to 23 c highest observed t in upper layer are observed on july 17th and august 22nd during the peak of the summer season while highest observed t in deeper layer are observed on august 22nd and september 18th this indicates the upper layer responds faster to changes in air t than the deeper layer which is controlled by the adriatic sea t p1 t increase from 18 80 c as observed on june 17th to maximum 23 10 c observed on august 22nd at the piezometer bottom is caused by its proximity to the adriatic sea and the influence of swi similar effect but with decreasing trend has been observed during the profiling performed on september 18th october 9th and finally november 25th when lowest observed t 18 c has been observed the p1 piezometer is located approximately 80 m from the coastline and 30 m distance from the melioration channel converging the water towards the ps modric intake basin by comparing the mean annual values the water level in the ps modric intake basin is determined at 2 74 m below the sea level indicating the presence of active seawater intrusion conditions within the area represented by p1 uniquely this causes a continuous inflow of seawater into the inland thus transferring the seawater inland active swi results in the salinization of the entire water column and the absence of fresh groundwater discharge to the sea badaruddin et al 2017 2015 this is confirmed by both the ec and t profiles in p1 fig 7a and b which reveals the presence of seawater in p1 assumption of the interdependence between p1 t and the adriatic sea t has been validated by use of available t time series unless the p1 t has been observed by the implemented monitoring system adriatic sea t at the study area has been taken by the available web service https seatemperature info hr hrvatska ploce temperatura vode html fig 8a and b although the a priori dependence is clearly visible from fig 8a fig 8b depicts a cross correlation model that provides additional confirmation of this the highest observed cross correlation coefficient between average daily adriatic sea t and average daily p1 t is 0 96 with a time lag corresponding to 6 days implying the p1 t being late for the sea t similar finding valid for the ec and piezometric head but with different time scales has been evidenced in the work by lovrinović et al 2022 for the period of august october 2021 unless the interdependence of the p1 deeper water column t and the adriatic sea t upper water column t above 4 m a s l is dominantly influenced by the t changes induced by insolation from the air t observed cross correlation coefficient between air t and p1 t corresponds to value of 0 86 with time lag of 18 days fig 8b demonstrating minor influence of air t to control the p1 t compared to sea t influence 4 2 jasenska area inspection of fig 9 initially emphasize interdependence between river neretva discharge ps modric intake basin surface water elevation and gwl in p2 following longer precipitation occurrence during rain season river neretva discharge is increased reflecting the p2 gwl increase during the dry season river neretva discharge is observed mainly below 250 m3 s 1 and gwl within the shallow aquifer follows the mean value of the surface water elevation observed in the ps modric basin thus demonstrating the superiority of ps modric operation in the definition of the groundwater regime as found along the whole opuzen usce area and especially jasenska sub area it is important to note p2 is located only 75 m away from the channel jasenska which strengthen the fact about the melioration system operative regime influence to p2 gwl the occurrence of precipitation is followed by an increase in p2 gwl figs 9 and 10a in the absence of precipitation during the dry period the mean gwl in p2 corresponds to the mean water level elevation in ps modric emphasizing the influence of ps modric s operational regime daily oscillations in p2 gwl are only detectable via the coherence model between the wl in ps modric and the gwl in p2 fig 11a these daily oscillations correspond to the ps modric s night and day operational schedule mean coherence values obtained between the ps modric level and gwl in p2 equals to 0 84 and 0 65 respectively for diurnal and semi diurnal frequencies during the dry period while precipitation reduces those values of 0 38 and 0 34 respectively fig 11a this difference distinguishes two periods with different factors controlling the p2 gwl unless the rain season causes the change in river neretva hydrological regime which acts to dominate gwl in jasenska shallow unconfined aquifer it is the ps modric driven melioration system which controls the gwl along the inland of opuzen usce area during dry season inspection of time lags between the ps modric water elevation induced by precipitation and p2 gwl from the coherence model shown in fig 11a reveals the simultaneous change in those variables during precipitation occurrence unless the p2 change driven by the ps modric operation during dry season is characterised by time lag of 3 23 h for diurnal related frequency transience of ec as observed at p2 shows different response to precipitation compared to gwl while the p2 gwl is increased due to the precipitation ec is reduced this is especially visible after precipitation of 30 mm day 1 or greater the highest drop in ec value has been observed between january 22nd and february 2nd when ec decreased by 29 1 ms cm 1 to a final value of 13 63 ms cm 1 figs 9 and 10b a similar effect is observed in may after a precipitation of 28 mm day 1 but with a less pronounced drop in ec although notable amount of precipitation occurred during november and december the response of ec values in p2 is missed due to probe malfunction during this period after the precipitation ends ec in jasenska area shows exponential recovery feature which reflects slow but significant influence of the external stress controlling the ec rise at the probe depth during the dry season when neretva discharge falls below 250 m3 s 1 ec values observed in p2 are usually above 50 ms cm 1 which is the evidence of significant volume of seawater affecting the radius of influence of the piezometer similar results were presented in the study by lovrinović et al 2021 precipitation effects in ec can also be seen in the spectrogram as an increase in drops during late january early february and early may fig 10b the coherence between ps modric water level and p2 ec fig 11b reveals values higher than 0 60 for the frequencies corresponding to the precipitation occurrence during late january early february mid july and mid september as well as for diurnal frequencies during summer the latter implies the interplay of precipitation and ps modric operative regime in ec control hereby the frequencies corresponding to the precipitation occurrence show negative phase of p2 ec relative to ps modric intake basin water elevation fig 11b which means the increase of the surface water elevation in the jasenska channel due to the operating regime of ps modric causes the decrease in p2 ec and vice versa the diurnal components of ps modric water level and p2 ec possess maximum coherence values of 0 88 and 0 87 respectively during july and august when the peak of the dry season occurs hereby the time lag of the ec relative to the cause of ec change equals to 15 17 h ec profiles fig 12a were obtained to a depth of 8 3 m a s l due to the probe location in piezometer with a maximum value of 45 16 ms cm 1 observed above the probe on october 9th fifth profiling while the minimum value above the probe has been observed on november 25th sixth profiling at 10 49 ms cm 1 the profiling has been performed after long rain period with an average daily river neretva discharge of 625 m3 s 1 and minor stratification in p2 ec noticed the profiling performed on june 17th show most significant ec values stratification this difference is a consequence of the decrease of the neretva discharge during the transition from rain to dry period indicating the freshwater from the rainy period is still present in the upper layer of the unconfined aquifer four profiles obtained during the dry period show a negligible difference among themselves and a kind of stable groundwater column contrary to ec and gwl t in p2 shows stability with minor changes except two isolated rainfalls during january 22nd and february 2nd when small decrease in gw t is noticed for the same reason as mentioned for ec t data series is not available during november and december t profiles fig 12b correspond to the recharge type of t profile kayane et al 1985 with constant t at the bottom and pronounced vertical stratification the main processes of recharge as seen in figs 9 and 12 are assumed as infiltration of precipitation into the aquifer and swi surface to ground t may represent t over a time scale with surface t referring to the effect of daily air t t observed at final depth may represent the average annual t or the mean t of a longer period as seen in fig 9 4 3 vidrice area p4 gwl has noticeable diurnal oscillations figs 13 and 14c with an increasing trend during precipitation events the highest precipitation induced increase has been observed on january 23rd when a precipitation of 70 3 mm day 1 caused increase of p4 gwl of 0 87 m trends of gwl in p4 and ps prag intake water elevation caused by precipitation during january april may and december coincide as shown in figs 13 14b and c and 15c diurnal oscillations of p4 gwl do not show transition between spring and neap tide fig 13 instead regular alternation of one maximum and one minimum daily are observed which corresponds to the operating regime of ps prag tidal efficiency of 0 76 has been identified during august between ps prag surface water elevation and p4 gwl representing the dominance of the ps prag operation in the p4 gwl definition the coherence model applied to ps prag water elevation and p4 gwl time series in fig 15c confirms corresponding diurnal variations with coherence value 0 99 and no time lag between during whole year since the distance in between is less than 20 m additional inspection of the influences to p4 gwl has been focused to mala neretva water elevation represented by uuu as explained within the chapter 2 mala neretva is closed system except during specific circumstances when oun or uuu gates are opened unless no oun manoeuvre has occurred during 2019 several opening manoeuvres of uuu have been captured based on the insight to uuu time series in fig 13 since the gates opening swl becomes a boundary condition defining the mala neretva water elevation periods referring to the uuu opening correspond to late january and early february early april and may as well as during november and december as can be seen in fig 13 and fig 14a due to the connection with the adriatic sea mala neretva water elevation shows presence of diurnal and semidiurnal components in its periodicity the coherence between uuu water level and gwl in p4 has a mean value of 0 7 for the frequency with period of 24 h with varying phase between them fig 15a this can be explained by the fact both signals are influenced by daily changes in atmospheric pressure in addition to gwl oscillations in p4 where daily oscillations of ps prag are detectable figs 14b and 15c thus creating different phases between these two signals observed p4 ec values fig 13 show p4 contains mostly brackish water during the dry period the ec values are mostly found below 3 ms cm 1 at the probe level while the rain period leads to increase up to 7 31 ms cm 1 from january 20th to january 22nd with on average daily precipitation of 19 1 mm day 1 ec increased from 3 56 ms cm 1 to 6 42 ms cm 1 ec reduction from 6 42 ms cm 1 to 4 93 ms cm 1 has been observed after the precipitation of 70 3 mm day 1 correspondence in the transient nature of p4 gwl and ec is supported by the spectrograms in fig 14c and d a closer look at those correspondence events shows two phenomena of the behaviour of ec in p4 i increase of ec occurs after the precipitation and ii when the precipitation overcomes approximately 40 mm day 1 ec decreases coherence evidences significant correlation between p4 gwl and ec especially during precipitation occurrence fig 15b unless precipitation exceed 40 mm day 1 the time lag shows ec change occurs with phase lag equals to half of the period corresponding to the frequency of interest this means the increase in gwl leads to reduction in ec the latter is shown to be sensitive to window size used during the coherence analysis performance the t time series in p4 show similar characteristics to the t observed at p2 the t shows mostly constant values throughout the year with isolated drops in the t during precipitation periods highest t drops are observed after heavy precipitation in late january and early february besides those two events the t in p4 ranges between 14 95 ºc and 19 11 ºc over the observed period inspection of ec and t profiles at p4 and mala neretva implies no interdependence figs 16a and 16b ec in p4 fluctuates from 2 40 to 3 15 ms cm 1 without the stratification in the unconfined aquifer highest t observed during profiling equals to 17 50 c and has been observed during sixth profiling performed on november 25th similar finding has been reported for jasenska area and p2 piezometer previously analysed interdependence between mala neretva water elevation and p4 gwl did not show similarity the inspection of ec profiles emphasizes almost freshwater as found along the mala neretva which supports the primary scope of mala neretva as a main source of fresh water suitable for irrigation of the area of interest 5 discussion in this paper an analysis has been presented with a goal to understand factors controlling the groundwater parameters transient nature along the neretva coastal aquifers system besides three fundamentally different subareas inspection as evidenced along the results section we extend the analysis to strengthen the findings up and empower their significance 5 1 active seawater intrusion conditions diga area has been determined as a main corridor for the inflow of seawater into the coastal aquifer system dominant controlling factors defining the groundwater quality within the shallow unconfined aquifer are the adriatic sea and melioration system channel parallel to the shoreline which converges towards the ps modric intake basin insight to the fig 17 emphasizes different swl conditions observed prior six in situ profiling performance not only in the mean swl but also in the tide occurrence referring to rising or falling tide by coupling ec profiling results shown in fig 7 and swl features in fig 17 it is evident highest ec values are observed during profiling done on june 17th and july 17th 2019 first and second profiling lowest observed ec values at the probe elevation have been observed during september 18th fourth profiling although highest mean swl has been observed during november 25th sixth profiling the latter did not lead to highest observed ec in p1 those features suggest it is not the mean swl the factor which controls the ec at diga groundwater in shallow aquifer although the micro tidal features characterizing the area of interest tidal changes define the inflow of the seawater volume into the coastal system and thus define ec regime fadili et al 2018 levanon et al 2017 2013 during profiling on june 17th and july 17th 2019 a rising tide has been observed with start noticed 3 4 h prior profiling has been done the time difference between the change of the tide from falling to rising and observed ec shows similarity with time lags observed from coherence analysis fig 6b due to the relative ratio between diga gwl and swl in this area swi is classified as the active badaruddin et al 2017 emphasizing the role of swl in the definition of gwl regime 5 2 benefits from frequency domain methods application although time domain models such as the cross correlation have been shown to be successful in identifying and interpreting processes controlling swi miyakoshi et al 2020 vallejos et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 observed time series containing noise can lead to incorrect conclusions in fig 18 a cross correlation model was applied to gwl and ec time series observed in p1 and swl time series to perform a cross correlation analysis observed time series are divided into four day periods for each four day period pre assumed dependent time series are shifted for one hour repeatedly unless maximum cross correlation value and appropriate time lag are determined signal with enhanced periodicity and low noise gwl in p1 showed significant cross correlation with swl being late between 1 and 3 h which is consistent with the coherence model results signal characterized by high noise ec showed negligible correlation with swl in addition the cross correlation between ec in p1 and swl showed the time lag varied strongly compared to the coherence model obtained time lag of ec relative to swl hereby the capacity of the frequency domain methods or strictly the coherence is shown to be superior over time domain methods in the time lag definition between two observed signals main potential limitation hereby stems from the methodological approach used since the presented method based on dft necessitates division of obtained time series into a finite number of screens and windows it is unsuitable for analysing short time series in this study the screen and window sizes are determined by the characteristics and lengths of the obtained time series in order to apply this methodology to a different region and different signals a screen and window size analysis must be performed and selected based on the observed signals characteristics and lengths a appendix 5 3 the source of seawater in an unconfined aquifer to distinguish the confined aquifer as a source of swi through the leakage we follow the outcomes of work by srzić et al 2020 hydrogeological characterization of the area of interest lead towards negligible leakage between confined and unconfined layers based on tidal methods application application of method by rahi and halihan 2013 confirmed the confinement of deep aquifer following the ratio of amplitude spectrum of diurnal and semidiurnal lunar and solar constituents first order data to confirm the existence of compact clay layer have been performed from the borehole drilled during 2022 at the opuzen usce area the clay layer has been evidenced with overall depth of 14 m and average hydraulic conductivity equals to 3 36 10 10 m s 1 geokon zagreb d d 2022 inspection of ec profiling as observed within d2 33 62 ms cm 1 and p2 44 30 ms cm 1 piezometers reflects higher ec values within p2 during dry period fig 19 the only difference from the latter is observed during rain period as a result of profiling performed on november 25th as presented from the work by krvavica et al 2021 krvavica and ružić 2020 river neretva discharge plays dominant role in the definition of the river water column salinity distribution unless during dry season when the discharge takes values usually less than 200 m3 s 1 river neretva shows stratification in the salinity increase in the discharge leads towards the salinity stratification diminishing taking into consideration discharge values during the period prior the profiling on november 25th has been performed one can see the discharge value exceeded 1100 m3 s 1 fig 9 which means river neretva was represented as a fresh water boundary condition which caused the refreshment of the aquifer to gain a deeper understanding of the salinization processes in an unconfined aquifer a total of 17 samples have been taken per piezeometer from 2019 to 2021 from the depth of approximately 9 m beneath the ground level samples have been taken from piezometer with seba kll water sampler in all samples the concentration of major ions is determined in the laboratory and the values of each major ion are expressed in meq l 1 each sample s ionic charge balance error is less than five percent which is considered an acceptable error level najib et al 2017 the ionic ratios of borehole samples are plotted in fig 20a c also the average ratio between the ions presented in fig 20a c is calculated for each piezometer table 2 the na cl ratios are close to 0 86 in all three piezometers table 2 and the ratios of na cl from all samples are located on the standard seawater freshwater mixing line fig 20a indicating the dominance of swi jiao and post 2019 the similarity between p1 and p2 s ca mg ratios 0 19 and 0 20 table 2 fig 20b can be explained by the presence of seawater since the ca mg ratio in seawater ranges from just below 0 2 up to 0 22 jiao and post 2019 the lower ca mg ratio in p1 and p2 in some water samples can be attributed to evaporation jiao and post 2019 the ca mg ratio in p4 is 1 42 table 2 which is the typical value of ca mg in limestone aquifers jiao and post 2019 the cl hco3 is often used as indicator of groundwater contamination with seawater al khatib and al najar 2011 the cl hco3 ratio fig 20c table 2 indicate diga and jasenska area are strongly affected by swi cl hco3 6 6 while vidrice area is moderately affected by swi 6 6 cl hco3 0 5 al khatib and al najar 2011 jiao and post 2019 it is also important to notice lowest cl hco3 ratio in p2 is observed on november 25th 2019 fig 20c after the significant precipitation occurred indicating the refreshment of the jasenska area additionally separate correlation matrices are computed for unconfined and confined aquifers except for hco3 there is a significant correlation between all major ions in both tables indicating both unconfined and confined aquifers derive their salinity from the same source bouderbala 2015 the significant correlation between cl and na k mg2 and ca2 suggests seawater is the primary source of salinization in both aquifers kharroubi et al 2012 qin et al 2013 tables 3 and 4 given the palaeo seawater can significantly salinize coastal aquifers as it has been evidenced worldwide carol et al 2021 dang et al 2022 delsman et al 2014 giambastiani et al 2013 goebel et al 2017 shi and jiao 2014 vallejos et al 2018 van engelen et al 2018 potential sources of seawater as found along the coastal aquifer systems are crucial to be distinguished and identified the identification of palaeo seawater can be determined by developing a palaeo numerical model of the study area with variable boundary conditions that follow marine transgression and regression during the past delsman et al 2014 van engelen et al 2018 by geophysical investigations goebel et al 2017 and by hydrogeochemical and isotopic analysis of groundwater samples dang et al 2022 frollini et al 2022 giambastiani et al 2013 very often the palaeo seawater shows hypersalinity compared to present seawater chang et al 2022 dang et al 2022 giambastiani et al 2013 jiao and post 2019 vallejos et al 2018 which makes them easily identified cl and tds values for each groundwater sample from the neretva valley unconfined aquifer are plotted in fig 21 according to the tds values four classifications of samples were made i freshwater with tds values between 0 and 1 5 g l 1 ii brackish water with tds values between 1 5 and 10 g l 1 iii saline water with tds values between 10 and 35 g l 1 and iv hypersaline water with tds values greater than 35 g l 1 the upper limit of 35 g l 1 for saline water is taken as present seawater has tds value around 35 g l 1 giambastiani et al 2013 groundwater samples from p4 correspond to brackish water with tds values between 1 62 and 2 57 g l 1 while samples from p2 correspond to brackish and saline water with tds values between 6 71 and 24 63 g l 1 fig 21 all samples from the p1 piezometer correspond to the saline water with tds values between 30 14 and 34 33 g l 1 fig 21 two potential facts can explain the absence of hypersaline water in a neretva system unconfined aquifer fig 21 first potential palaeo seawater has been washed out from the aquifer and second groundwater samples contain a mixture of different sources of salinity and freshwater thus leading the tds concentration to be below the present seawater the identification of palaeo seawater has been the subject of research at numerous coastal aquifer locations carol et al 2021 delsman et al 2014 giambastiani et al 2013 goebel et al 2017 vallejos et al 2018 delsman et al 2014 emphasized the significance of using a palaeo hydrogeological model to determine the present salinity of a coastal aquifer as opposed to a steady state model with present day boundary conditions goebel et al 2017 demonstrated the ability of electrical resistivity tomography to identify palaeo seawater in the deeper aquifer along the coast of monterey the studies based on isotopic analysis carol et al 2021 giambastiani et al 2013 vallejos et al 2018 demonstrated the paleo seawater has a substantial impact on the salinization of coastal aquifers same studies demonstrated groundwater samples are frequently a mixture of different salinity and freshwater sources leading to the fact paleo seawater can be present in both shallow and deep aquifers compared to the evidence of holocenic paleo seawater found within the shallow aquifer in the study by vallejos et al 2018 no deterministic evidence of the palaeo seawater has been determined in the neretva system shallow aquifer as a dominant source of p2 ec change e g salinity hereby we highlight the interplay between the river neretva salinity regime and channel jasenka regime lovrinović et al 2022 the main contributing factor relies in the decrease of the ec as observed within the p2 on november 25th 2019 induced by rapid increase in the river neretva discharge and thus freshening of the neretva water column fig 12a the latter implies lateral seawater inflow as a mechanism contributing to the groundwater salinity rather than the holocenic palaeo seawater however to fully understand the processes and sources of salinization of groundwater found within the shallow aquifer as well as the potential sources of palaeo seawater interplay and contribution to observed salinity in the entire neretva valley coastal aquifer a comprehensive geochemical and isotopic analysis of groundwater samples are necessary is mandatory and deserves further investigation 5 4 salinization of melioration sub system vidrice in the geological research performed along this area geokon zagreb d d 2022 several upcoming salt springs have been found therefore with the occurrence of precipitation firstly the brackish water from the springs is washed out towards ps prag basin as it is the converging point of the area driven by the low water level induced by ps prag operative regime which consequently leads to ec increase in p4 a similar phenomenon has been observed in the study of yang et al 2020 where ec in one of the piezometers increased with precipitation the coherence results do not suggest ec in p4 is influenced by either the operating regime of ps prag or the mala neretva water elevation although the proximity to both indicative confirmation of springs contribution to increased ec in p4 especially during precipitation occurrence has been reached through the profiling and sampling of surface water at predetermined locations along the intake channel of the ps prag subsequent determination of the ec has been performed in situ and under controlled environment laboratory conditions during dry and rain periods four surface water samples are collected during 2021 inspection of ec values shown in table 5 discover greater ec values as obtained from the samples taken near the upcoming springs sw 1 than near the ps prag sw 2 during both dry and rain periods it is also important to note ec values are higher during the rain season than during the dry season 6 conclusions this paper deals with the definition of the external parameters and mechanisms influencing swi and defining groundwater parameters respectively gwl ec and t in river neretva coastal aquifer system consisted of shallow unconfined aquifer confining clay layer and confined aquifer the work relies on three sources i time series observed through the implemented monitoring system and ii profilings performed in situ their analysis by application of dft spectrogram and coherence features analysis and iii major ion geochemical analysis and indicators besides the general conclusion three different sub areas along the melioration systems opuzen usce and vidrice show fundamentally different conditions and circumstances below we highlight main findings arose from the presented work diga area representing the embankment delineating opuzen usce area and the adriatic sea represent main corridor for the swi penetrating neretva coastal system due to the operation of the melioration system mean groundwater level as found within the shallow unconfined aquifer is found below the mean swl this uniquely leads to active swi conditions resulting in continuous inflow of the seawater to the inland this 2200 m long barrier between mouth of river neretva and river mala neretva presents a long term corridor for the swi occurrence into the neretva coastal system jasenska area gwl and ec regimes are fundamentally different and should be considered separately unless the gwl is balanced by river neretva water elevation and ps modric operative regime ec shows changes reflected on a larger temporal scale although the changes in gwl are relatively fast acting as a response to precipitation induced recharge and the regime of jasenska melioration channel water elevation ec shows slower response time scales although located 1200 m away from the river neretva left bed stratification of the salinity within the neretva river water column induces the lateral swi to the inland gwl in p4 characterizing vidrice melioration subsystem is shown to be fully determined by the operative regime of ps prag although the gwl regime is driven in this way ec is driven by the features of brackish upcoming springs found along the southern border of the vidrice area where karstic hills exceed ground level due to the fact the ground level found along this area is strictly beneath the mean sea level and fractured karstic massive found between the adriatic sea and vidrice area pathways for the seawater to feed the springs are enabled inspection of main ion geochemical analysis leads towards the conclusion the origin of the salinity of the gw within the shallow unconfined aquifer stems from the swi the latter is also supported by the fact of active swi presence due to the lower gwl relative to mean sea level unless the features of groundwater as found within the shallow unconfined aquifer show sensitivity to external loadings and local circumstances referring to hydrological conditions tidal features and pumping stations operative regimes confined aquifer shows stability in ec the latter is evidenced through similar result obtained in different periods of the hydrological year although the piezometric head of the confined aquifer is shown to be dominantly determined by the swl srzić et al 2020 ec does not behave in the same manner as evidenced from our study funding this research is funded by the contribution from the eu co financing and the interreg italy croatia cbc programme 2014 2020

work reported in this paper appendix a to ensure the relevance of the results arose from the spectrogram and coherence analysis an additional screen size and window size sensitivity analysis has been performed as a representative ps prag water level and p4 gwl were selected for further analysis because the fact the gwl in p4 contains periodic oscillations from ps prag and non periodic oscillations caused by precipitation the sensitivity of spectrograms and coherence models to window size is shown in fig a1 the screen size of 30 days is used in all spectrograms and coherence models shown in fig a1 window sizes of 5 10 15 and 20 days respectively were used to demonstrate the effect of window size on the results it can be seen that the window size affects the spectrogram and coherence results differently increasing the window size results in sharper spectrograms welch s method has been shown to compute asd effectively even when the number of windows in the screen is reduced to 6 fig a1j and k as mentioned earlier increasing the window size increases the number of frequencies in the frequency domain these frequencies represent usually noise while the number of frequencies with significant amplitude increases slightly e g diurnal constituent in sea level with the increase of window size will separate to lunar diurnal constituents k1 and o1 increasing the window size also results in the window being placed over a screen less often therefore for a screen size of 30 days and a window size of 5 days 60 times cpsd is calculated for each frequency for a screen size of 30 days and a window size of 20 days cpsd is calculated only 6 times table a1 which shows the interpretation reliability of the coherence results decreases as the window size increases for window sizes of 15 and 20 days the number of noise frequencies at which significant coherence is calculated increases as cpsd is calculated less often additional clarification of spectrogram and coherence model results was tested with different screen sizes 10 15 20 and 30 days respectively while the window size was set constant 5 days the variation in screen size means that the number of times asd is recorded in the spectrogram changes over analysed period for example a screen size of 30 days has 12 periods when asd is recorded while the screen size of 10 days has 36 periods when asd or coherence is recorded table a1 the smaller the difference between screen size and window size is the less reliable the coherence results will be spectrograms with larger screen size have lower ability to detect non periodic events of precipitation because these events last for a day or more and do not occur in every window found within larger screens fig a2 a and b with a screen size of 30 days show no precipitation effect in may while with the reduction of he screen amplitudes corresponding to the precipitation effect start to dominate the same effect is seen for all periods with precipitation occurrence spectrograms with screen sizes of 10 and 15 days show higher amplitudes in the frequencies corresponding to the trend change due to precipitation than spectrograms with screen size of 20 and 30 days a similar effect of precipitation is seen in the coherence models in fig a2 where the coherence model with a screen size of 30 days fig a2 c has the lowest ability to capture non periodic events fig a2l where the screen size is 10 days has shown the highest ability to describe non periodic events the coherence model with a screen size of 10 days has only 12 windows per screen which also makes it the lowest reliable among the models examined in fig a2 taking into account above mentioned effects of screen and window sizes on the spectrogram and coherence model results and considering the reliability of the coherence results due to the number of calculated cpsd in the coherence a screen size of 15 days and a window size of 5 days were selected as relevant for the

abstraction amount and its impact are not well understood in this study a new methodological approach was utilized to estimate the irrigation water abstraction amount which is based on groundwater level monitoring before during and at the end of the irrigation season 2021 2022 the monitoring was conducted on 361 hand dug wells distributed throughout the sub basin which is subdivided into east southwest and north zones new hydrological insights for the region groundwater abstraction for irrigation and associated groundwater level decline estimates are 10 6 106 m3 and 2 43 m in the east 4 2 106 m3 and 3 23 m in the southwest and 0 6 106 m3 and 1 32 m in the north these abstractions account for 103 97 and 62 of the mean annual groundwater recharge in the east southwest and north zones respectively groundwater is overexploited in the east and southwest zones although at the sub basin scale the amount of groundwater used for irrigation is small compared to the renewable groundwater resource however if groundwater based irrigation continues to expand especially in the east and southwest zones groundwater scarcity at the local scales will worsen adaptive management strategies are required to minimize the potential adverse effects on groundwater resources keywords groundwater level monitoring irrigation abstraction groundwater recharge lake tana sub basin ethiopia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in ethiopia the groundwater irrigation potential based on renewable groundwater resources was estimated to be 1 8 4 3 106 ha gowing et al 2016 however the actual groundwater use for irrigation is low compared to its potential though groundwater is a viable option for supplementing surface water resources for irrigation worqlul et al 2017 it has been estimated that only a very small proportion of the irrigation water use came from groundwater including from shallow wells used by small scale farmers kebede et al 2018 however the demand for groundwater in the multifaceted agricultural sector is currently rapidly growing a study in the raya and kobo valleys of ethiopia estimated that if half or a quarter of the crop water requirement could be satisfied from groundwater sustainable agriculture could increase by 40 80 of the total area pavelic et al 2012 the lake tana sub basin is one of the agricultural growth corridors for ethiopia s ambitious plan to expand irrigation because of its suitable water and land for irrigation development taye et al 2021 worqlul et al 2015 in the lake tana sub basin there is water use competition among water supply irrigation hydropower navigation and tourism and ecosystem needs such as sustaining wetlands base flow to streams and lake tana an increase in population aspiring for better livelihood urbanization industrial and irrigation expansions in the sub basin will escalate the water demand and conflict in water use in the future mamo et al 2021 irrigation using surface water is dominant in the uplands and groundwater use dominates in the plains around the lake worqlul et al 2015 groundwater is the sole source of water supply for urban and rural communities and industries in the lake tana sub basin on the basis of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace abiy and melesse 2017 revealed that the groundwater level or storage decreased by 18 37 cm between 2003 and 2013 in the lake tana sub basin besides there are significant groundwater level declines at the local scale for instance the water level decline in the kola diba well field due to overexploitation of the resource for water supply gebey et al 2022 unpublished and drying of springs and productive boreholes and tapping poor quality groundwater in some deep water supply boreholes especially during drought years adswe 2009 were observed diminishing of wetlands and dry season rivers flow was also observed in the sub basin mamo et al 2021 furthermore tigabu et al 2020a 2020b concluded that flow from the groundwater to surface water dominates in the gilgel abay catchment southwest zone in this study see section 2 and streams contribution to the groundwater in the gumara plain east zone section 2 decreased since 1994 while in the rib catchment east zone the flow system was reversed since 1990 from mainly surface water inflow to the groundwater to from the groundwater to the stream network system this seems to be mainly interlinked with unmanaged groundwater and surface water development and recharge reduction due to climate and land use changes groundwater recharge was revealed to fluctuate with the amount of rainfall inter annually but had a slight general decreasing trend from 1979 to 2016 mamo et al 2021 moreover according to yenehun 2022 a slight groundwater recharge decrease between 1986 and 2014 was observed in the sub basin associated with land use changes based on wetspass modeling on the other hand shallow groundwater based household irrigation is booming at an alarming rate from year to year in the sub basin which will cause adverse impacts on the groundwater availability and environmental flow and complicates the water use conflict most farmers use the shallow groundwater for household irrigation by digging hand dug wells within their farms for instance the number of shallow wells in fogera woreda district is more than 30 000 according to the woreda s record most of these farmers are those whose plots of land are far from the perennial rivers and where there is insufficient river flow in the downstream areas due to upstream irrigation activities the total small scale irrigated land area in the sub basin is 58 873 ha of which 12 7096 ha of the land is irrigated by groundwater taye et al 2022 the total groundwater use for small scale irrigation according to this study is 66 106 m3 per year the use of groundwater for irrigation will likely increase in the future as more people shift from surface water use due to water scarcity taye et al 2022 groundwater abstraction was estimated by an indirect method using the average water abstraction rate per hectare of 0 90 l s which was determined by experiments in selected 15 rivers diversions for irrigation taye et al 2021 and then multiplying it by the total irrigated area however the current groundwater abstraction for irrigation in the sub basin was not monitored and analyzed in detail therefore the amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation and its potential impacts need to be better assessed which can be an input for sustainable groundwater management processes a new methodological approach which is based on groundwater level change monitoring has been followed in this study as an independent method to estimate the amount of shallow groundwater abstraction for irrigation in the sub basin instead of conducting more time and budget intensive traditional approaches such as an inventory of the amount of shallow groundwater abstraction from each farmyard or using the crop water requirement approach previous groundwater level monitoring activities in the lake tana sub basin were fragmented and sporadic which were mainly done for educational purposes in this study a thorough groundwater level monitoring was conducted in areas where groundwater based irrigation is dominant the main objectives of this study were to estimate irrigation water abstraction from the shallow groundwater and evaluate how this affects the shallow groundwater resources of the lake tana sub basin primary data were collected through groundwater level monitoring in multiple seasons and the total groundwater based irrigated land area of kebeles i e the smallest political administration unit within districts of each zone was collected to attain the objectives and critical management questions were unraveled such as how much water is being currently abstracted from the shallow groundwater for irrigation is the irrigation abstraction comparable with the amount of groundwater recharge and what is the impact of groundwater based irrigation on groundwater availability the results of the study laid a foundation for decision support modeling research and the data and findings will give valuable insight to decision and policymakers in order to consider proper management interventions 2 study area 2 1 site description the lake tana sub basin is found in northwestern ethiopia at the head of the blue nile abbay river basin where the river originates from it is located within utm zone 37 wgs84 between 252788 and 396487 east and 1218577 and 1410176 north fig 1 the sub basin has a total area of 15321 km2 of which the lake occupies 3156 km2 tigabu et al 2020a 2020b for the purpose of systematic data analysis three groundwater development zones or corridors were delineated in the sub basin based on topography and groundwater flow direction making use of arcgis 10 8 software the zones are named east southwest and north zones fig 1 the physiography of the lake tana sub basin is shown as a hill shade in fig 1 which was prepared using shuttle radar topographic mission srtm digital elevation model 30 m by 30 m resolution dem data the elevation ranges from 1679 to 4089 m above sea level the hydrometeorology of the sub basin is characterized by a humid type of climate as determined on the basis of climate classification by thornthwaite 1948 and moist type by willmott and feddema 1992 methods as stipulated in feddema 2005 the rainfall pattern is unimodal with the main rain season between june and september several perennial and seasonal streams and rivers drain the sub basin and the main ones that account for 76 of the sub basin area are gilgel abay ribb gumara and megech catchments mamo 2015 2 2 characterization of the shallow aquifer system the hydrogeologic units which are exposed in the lake tana sub basin include different tertiary volcanics tertiary sekela basalt quaternary basalt quaternary fluvio lacustrine sediments and quaternary rhyolite dome fig 2 productivity of these aquifers is shown in fig 2 and the hydraulic and hydrologic characteristics of the aquifers are summarized in the supplementary material table a 1 according to mamo 2015 there are three aquifer systems in the lake tana sub basin which are the upper aquifer system uas middle aquifer system mas and lower aquifer system las from top to bottom the uas consists of the unconfined aquifer at the top and semi confined aquifer s underneath the unconfined aquifer system has a thickness of 100 150 m in the different parts of the sub basin the exposed tertiary volcanics quaternary basalt and the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifers constitute the unconfined aquifer part of the uas i e they constitute the shallow unconfined aquifer system groundwater in the shallow unconfined aquifer system flows from the surrounding uplands toward the lake and contributes to it abiy et al 2015 chebud and melesse 2009 mamo 2015 the unconfined aquifer is often used for towns water supply using boreholes of up to 150 m depth and for rural villages public water supply using shallow boreholes of up to 60 m deep rural household groundwater abstractions for small scale irrigation and drinking are being made using hand dug wells on the regolith and weathered mantle at the top of the basalt aquifer and on the top part of the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifer however there are no separate studies on the nature and hydraulic properties of the regolith and fluvio lacustrine sediments in the whole sub basin the regolith under investigation in this study is found in the entire southwest zone and western extreme parts of the east and north zones at the ground surface the soil spatially varies from clay to silty sand but in general the groundwater bearing soil is clayey sandy silt the fluvio lacustrine aquifer is found in most parts of the east and north zones the soil at the ground surface spatially varies from clay to sand but it is often silty clay however the aquifer supplying water to the wells is clayey sandy silt walker et al 2019a 2019b concluded based on isotopes 2h and 18o data that the regolith gets recharged from influent surface waters during the wet season around dangila area kilty catchment fig 3 furthermore according to mamo 2015 hydrochemistry data of hand dug wells springs and boreholes 150 m depth in volcanic terrains of the sub basin formed one cluster or sub group based on hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis suggesting that they are interlinked or from one groundwater system besides the unconfined volcanic aquifer 150 m depth has similar hydrochemical facies to perennial rivers during the dry season in the sub basin which shows that the aquifer feeds the rivers therefore the regolith with the underlying weathered and fractured basalt is one interconnected aquifer as well as the hand dug wells in unconsolidated sediments tap groundwater from the top part of the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifer pumping test data of eight hand dug wells in dangila area walker et al 2019a 2019b showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the regolith ranges during the dry season from 0 2 to 6 4 m d with mean and median of 2 3 and 1 6 m d respectively during the wet season the hydraulic conductivity was 2 8 22 3 m d with 9 7 and 6 5 m d mean and median values respectively the specific yield sy varies from 0 00001 to 0 32 and the mean and median values are 0 09 and 0 08 respectively the specific yield values of 0 03 0 08 and 0 23 for clay silt and sand johnson 1967 were used in this study to calculate the mean sy for clayey sandy silt regolith and sediments which are being under investigation in the lake tana sub basin 3 material and methods 3 1 data acquisition and materials precipitation 1995 2009 and hydrological 1995 2006 data were collected from the ethiopian meteorological institute and the ministry of water and energy respectively the location of the meteorological and hydrological stations used is shown in fig 3 srtm dem 30 m by 30 m data was used to generate elevations and prepare the hill shade map using the arcgis hydrology tool fig 1 sixty nine kebeles within eleven districts where groundwater based irrigation is considerable and significant were included in this study groundwater irrigated land areas were collected from each kebele s agricultural office in each irrigation zone dip meters and gps with one meter accuracy were used to measure the groundwater level and record the coordinates and surface elevations of the monitoring wells arcgis 10 8 was used to prepare the figures 3 2 groundwater recharge estimation groundwater recharge can be direct or diffuse from precipitation and irrigation losses induced indirect and localized from surface water bodies lateral and or vertical inter aquifer leakage and artificial recharge there are several methods direct and indirect to calculate the recharge rate de vries and simmers 2002 chloride mass balance cmb is the most widely used tracer method to estimate actual diffused recharge in the saturated zone scanlon et al 2006 and it was used in this study groundwater recharge rate r can be estimated based on the cmb approach using the following equation eq 1 erisksson and khunakasem 1969 1 r pe cp d cgw 2 pe p q where pe is effective precipitation p is precipitation and q is runoff in mm year cp and cgw represent the chloride cl concentration of the rainfall and groundwater respectively in mg l d is the dry chloride deposition the cmb method assumes the conservation of mass between the input of atmospheric cl and cl flux in the subsurface if sources in addition to precipitation contribute cl to the system the cl input from these sources needs to be quantified groundwater and rainfall cl data of mamo 2015 were used in this analysis eighty six groundwater points springs hand dug wells and boreholes with depths less than 126 m were selected for cmb analysis from the unconfined aquifer system where additional cl input from weathering of the rock matrix is negligible eleven shallow groundwater samples in the sub basin which seem to be polluted and those which have interacted with pockets of evaporites in the unconsolidated sediments and that have relatively higher cl content have been removed from these data besides 18 groundwater samples with cl concentrations less than that of the rainfall were omitted then 33 15 and 9 groundwater samples with cl concentrations of 1 3 18 mg l which are greater than the rainfall cl content were used in the east southwest and north zones respectively and their harmonic mean cgw in each zone was estimated and used in eq 1 groundwater sample sites which were used for cmb are shown in fig 3 the cl concentrations of rainfall samples which were collected every month for one hydrological year 2012 at four rain gauge stations in the lake tana sub basin bahir dar gonder gassay and gish abay sekela fig 3 were used to estimate cp the temporal average of chloride concentrations in each station was calculated and then spatially averaged for each zone southwest east and north zones dry deposition is problematic where there is a local source of salt cl in the landscape e g recirculation of salt from a salt lake scanlon et al 2006 and where there is atmospheric pollution from industrial gases and aerosols that contain substantial cl nyagwambo 2002 these conditions are not the case in the lake tana sub basin and the area is far from the sea besides the rainfall samples were collected using standard rain gauges and the measured cl content represents the bulk cl deposition which incorporates the dry deposition d hence the cl concentration measured for the rainy month encompasses dry deposition of the preceding month s i e it represents dry wet atmospheric cl deposition and therefore d is omitted in eq 1 temporal monthly precipitation records at a given station fig 3 were averaged and then a spatial averaging was made using all stations in each zone based on the thiessen polygonal method schumann 1998 direct runoff dro was used to represent runoff q in eq 2 dro was separated from the total river hydrograph based on lyn hollick 1979 digital filter algorithm using river analysis package rap which was developed by monash university melbourne australia a filter parameter alpha default value of 0 975 was used marsh et al 2003 then the weighted mean dro by rivers catchment areas was estimated for each zone and used in eq 2 table 1 recharge estimation was made for the southwest east and north zones besides to estimate the recharge rate over the entire lake tana sub basin spatial averaging of the rainfall amount dro cp and cgw were made at the sub basin scale 3 3 groundwater level monitoring preliminary groundwater irrigated areas were identified during prior desk work and refined during the fieldwork kebeles abstracting shallow groundwater for irrigation were selected based on consultation with districts agricultural offices and then irrigated localities within the kebeles were identified with support from the kebeles agricultural experts spatially representative monitoring wells were selected from the stock of wells in the irrigated areas of each kebele the number of monitoring wells per kebele varies depending on the total number of irrigation wells and the aerial extent of the kebele table a 2 groundwater level monitoring sites were selected on 361 hand dug wells hdw inventories were conducted for 240 wells tapping groundwater from the regolith the depth of these hand dug wells varies from 4 1 to 32 m with a mean and standard deviation of 12 66 and 4 59 m respectively besides 121 hand dug wells were inventoried in the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifer the depth of these wells spatially varies from 0 07 to 36 m and the mean and standard deviation are 16 73 and 9 49 m respectively water level measurement was done manually using water level probe i e dip meter with electrical sounder and light in the early morning one or two hours before withdrawals for irrigation and other uses commenced the device measures water level depth with 0 01 cm accuracy level the groundwater level monitoring was done in three phases the first phase phase 1 was conducted between 20 october and 12 november 2021 which is one month after the rainy season and before the beginning of irrigation activity the second monitoring phase 2 was done between 24 january and 15 february 2022 during the middle of the dry season and when irrigation abstraction was underway the third monitoring phase 3 was done between 5 and 24 may 2022 which is at the end of the dry season and irrigation activities during phase 1 hand dug wells that were being used for irrigation and drinking purposes separately were monitored wells for drinking use were intended to determine the natural water level fluctuation however some wells that were separately used for irrigation and drinking during phase 1 were found to be used both for irrigation and drinking purposes including for livestock watering during phases 2 and 3 besides some irrigation wells monitored during phases 1 and 2 were used both for drinking and irrigation purposes during phase 3 table 2 and table a 2 most of the monitored wells were used only for irrigation or both for irrigation and drinking purposes wells which were used for multiple irrigation drinking and livestock watering purposes account for 44 9 and 48 2 of the total monitored wells during phase 2 and phase 3 respectively the number and spatial distribution of the monitored irrigation wells are good and enough for the estimation of groundwater abstraction for irrigation the spatial distribution of monitoring wells are depicted in fig 4 3 4 estimation of groundwater based irrigation area and abstraction groundwater level changes between phases 1 and 2 and that of phases 1 and 3 were estimated for each monitoring well in each zone table a 2 the water level changes between phase 1 and phases 2 and 3 in the monitoring wells which were used for drinking both irrigation and drinking and livestock watering purposes were observed to be greater than those wells used only for irrigation use table a 2 which seem to be due to greater abstraction and therefore these data were not used for analysis the number of monitored wells which were being used for different purposes in each phase are shown in table 2 the mean and range of depth to the water levels in each phase and the total water level changes between phase 1 and phases 2 and 3 were estimated for irrigation wells in each zone depth to water levels for each phase and water level changes between monitoring phases are plotted using the arcgis tool to see the spatial variation furthermore to estimate the water level fluctuation due to natural outflows i e base flows to streams and the lake between phases 1 and 2 wells with the three exceptionally lowest changes in water level in each zone were omitted not to underestimate the natural outflow then five north zone nine southwest and ten east zone water level changes from the lowest which spatially represent the zones and are considered to represent the natural changes due to their relatively smaller values compared to others were averaged the least water level changes between phase 3 and phase 1 in ten in the east and north zones and five in the north zone monitoring wells which spatially represent each zone were averaged to represent the natural groundwater level change due to natural outflow the water level changes in monitoring wells that were being used only for irrigation purposes were considered to estimate the amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation groundwater abstraction for irrigation wi in m3 was estimated for each zone using the following equation eq 3 3 wi ht hn sy ai where ht and hn are the measured total and natural mean water level changes in meters respectively sy is the specific yield and ai is the total groundwater irrigated land area in m2 in the zone monitoring hand dug wells are dug in clayey sandy silt sediments and regolith at the top parts of the shallow unconfined lacustrine and volcanic aquifers respectively the average value of the specific yields of clay silt and sand see section 2 2 was estimated to be 0 113 and used as sy of the clayey sandy silt sediments in the groundwater abstraction estimation the total groundwater irrigated area in each zone was estimated as the sum of the total groundwater irrigated areas of kebeles found in each zone table a 2 the research approaches are summarized in fig 5 3 5 background theory for impact assessment the hydrologic budget of a hydrologic system is given as the volume of inputs minus the outputs from the system over any period equals the change in water stored hudak 2000 the groundwater balance in the study area can be given as follows eq 4 4 i o l s where i the inflow to the groundwater includes the different modes of recharges over the area r and the lateral groundwater inflow gi to the area from the upstream catchment area o is the outflow from the groundwater that includes irrigation wi water supply wd and livestock wls uses and the natural outflows as groundwater base flow to rivers in the area bf and the underflow from the area to the downstream area go evapotranspiration is considered in the outflow if the groundwater table is shallow evapotranspiration from the groundwater is considered negligible in the area as the depth to the groundwater level is often greater than 3 m l represents inter aquifer leakage and is generally unknown in the area and was not accounted for s is the change in groundwater storage therefore eq 4 can be written as eq 5 5 r gi wi wd wls bf go s in terms of the groundwater level increment during the wet season eq 5 can be given as eq 6 6 s hi r gi wi wd wls bf go where hi is the groundwater level increment and s is storativity specific yield for the study area units are in mm the natural outflow bf go is maximum when the groundwater level increment is maximum which is at the end of the rainy season therefore the annual groundwater level increment represents the annual available groundwater resource agwr for development in terms of the groundwater level decrement during the dry season and under natural or equilibrium conditions i e no abstraction the natural groundwater outflow equals the inflow and the following holds eq 7 7 s hd bf go r gi where hd is the groundwater level change or decrement during the dry season and r is the recharge from rainfall during the preceding wet season plus induced recharges units are in mm when there is an abstraction from the aquifer the system will be in disequilibrium condition and withdrawals are at the expense of the natural outflows when the natural outflow becomes zero the abstraction is supplied by a permanent groundwater storage depletion therefore the groundwater level decrement during the dry season is given as in eq 8 8 s hd wi wd wls bf go r gi go is less than or equal to gi this implies that abstractions wi wd wls plus base flow bf should be greater than or equal to the recharge r in eq 8 therefore if abstraction is greater than the recharge the natural outflow will be superseded and there will be a permanent groundwater storage depletion or water table decline according to chadha 2002 areas where groundwater development exceeds 85 of annual replenishment show a continuous decline in the groundwater table in the study area there is no sufficient static groundwater level data to estimate the gi and go based on darcy s method 4 results 4 1 estimated recharge rates groundwater recharge values are estimated to be 377 9 267 7 and 241 5 mm y in the southwest east and north zones respectively table 3 and fig 3 and 320 8 mm y at the sub basin scale the weighted average dro which is separated from the total stream flow was used as runoff q in eq 2 the dro might consist of a possible interflow component which can have a greater cl concentration than the vertical flow component due to evapotranspiration in the unsaturated zone during lateral flow in the root zone using cl concentration of rivers for runoff q in the computation gave unexpected high or low recharge values for the east and southwest zones which may be due to laboratory analytical problems with individual samples and were not accounted for in the recharge estimation therefore the estimated recharge values could be slightly overestimated the recharge values were estimated using 2012 cl and 1995 2009 hydrometeorological data however the recharge values can be fairly used for the purpose of this study during the year 2021 22 in the east and north zones groundwater feeds streams in the uplands table 1 and fig 3 the top part of the lacustrine sediments in the east and north plains fig 2 is often silty clay and the diffused recharge from the rainfall here could be lower than the respective mean recharge rate which was estimated by the cmb method however there is groundwater inflow from uplands beneath the river beds to the plains and the lake as can be observed from the difference between the recharge and mean separated base flow in each zone table 1 and fig 3 furthermore the groundwater level is often below the rivers beds in these plains and induced recharge occurs in the lacustrine sediments and surrounding volcanics from rivers which are sustained by the upland base flows during the dry season and from ponds that are created by inundated lake water and rivers floods during the rainy period therefore the recharge in the irrigated areas seems to be not less than the mean recharge estimated for each zone and it was considered to be equal to the mean recharge value estimated by the cmb method in the southwest groundwater feeds the streams in the uplands and there is groundwater runoff beneath the stream beds to the downstream irrigation areas table 1 and fig 3 the groundwater and stream interaction is unknown downstream of the gilgel abay and kilty hydrological stations fig 3 the groundwater recharge in the irrigated areas is considered to be equal to the mean estimated recharge rate by the cmb method for the zone the recharges from seepage in the irrigation furrows and induced recharge from streams due to a decline in the groundwater level were not known and not considered in each zone 4 2 depth to groundwater levels the statistics of depth to groundwater level below the ground surface in irrigation monitoring wells for the three phases are shown in table 4 the range mean and standard deviation are highest in the southwest zone and least in the north zone which could be due to the higher topographic slope in the former the spatial variation of groundwater level depth in each zone is depicted in figs 6 8 for phases 1 2 and 3 respectively the depth to the water level in all zones is variable spatially for the three phases it is highly variable in the southwest followed by in the east and least in the north zones groundwater level depth is generally lower in the upstream and downstream areas that are close to the lake than in the middle catchment areas in the southwest zone in the east zone lower water level depth is observed in the plain fluvio lacustrine sediments than in volcanic aquifers spatially variable depth to groundwater level was seen for the three phases in the north zone 4 3 groundwater level changes the groundwater level changes between phases 1 and 2 and phases 1 and 3 were calculated for each monitoring well in each zone table a 2 the statistical summary of water level changes between phases 1 and 2 and phases 1 and 3 in the southwest east and north zones is shown in table 5 the range mean and standard deviation of groundwater level changes between phases 1 and 2 and phases 1 and 3 are highest in the southwest zone and least in the north zone the water level change between phases 1 and 3 due to groundwater irrigation and the natural water level change is estimated to be 3 23 and 1 28 m in the southwest zone respectively in the east zone the water level changes due to irrigation and natural discharges are 2 43 and 1 31 m respectively the water level change due to irrigation use is 1 32 m while the natural water level change is 1 29 m in the north zone the water level change due to natural discharges are nearly equal in the three zones which seem to be because of the similarity in aquifers nature and are less than those of the estimated upstream base flows to rivers table 1 section 3 2 as would be expected due to lower relief and area in the monitored sites water level change due to groundwater irrigation is highest in the southwest and lowest in the north zones the number of irrigation wells used in the water level change calculation in the north zone is few because most of the wells were being used both for drinking and irrigation purposes the spatial variation of water level change between phases 1 and 2 and phases 1 and 3 are presented in figs 9 and 10 spatially variable water level change is observed in the southwest zone for both cases in general water level change is observed to be greater in the fluvio lacustrine sediments than in the volcanic aquifers in the east zone in the north zone the change in water level between phase 1 and phases 2 and 3 are spatially variable although the number of wells used is few 4 4 groundwater abstractions and irrigated areas the groundwater abstraction by irrigation between phase 1 and phase 2 is 5 5 106 2 2 106 and 0 12 106 m3 in the east southwest and north zones respectively table 6 the amount of groundwater abstraction between phases 1 and 3 is estimated to be about 10 6 106 4 2 106 and 0 6 106 m3 for the east southwest and north irrigation zones respectively table 6 the amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation is highest in the east and least in the north zones groundwater based irrigation is conducted for horticulture e g to grow fruits coffee chat sugarcane etc in the southwest mainly for vegetables in the east and in the north for fruits and maize the water level change due to irrigation abstraction in the southwest is highest than those of the east and north zones this shows higher groundwater use in the southwest which seems to be due to greater consumptive use of horticulture activities in the zone the east zone has the greatest irrigated land area of all zones and the groundwater abstraction for irrigation is highest in this zone the total groundwater abstraction for irrigation and the groundwater based irrigated area at the sub basin scale is 15 3 106 m3 y and 5378 ha respectively groundwater irrigated land area of each zone is shown in table 6 the recharge rates over the irrigation areas r and the groundwater level decrement due to abstraction for irrigation di sy times the change in the head due to irrigation are shown in table 7 for the east southwest and north zones groundwater irrigation abstraction exceeds and nearly equals the recharge in the east and southwest zones respectively table 7 which entails adverse impacts on domestic drinking and livestock uses and on environmental flow for ecosystem preservation 5 discussion based on the soil water balance 284 mm y and cmb 285 mm y methods that accounted for the runoff cl concentration mamo 2015 estimated an average recharge rate of 285 mm y for the lake tana sub basin the recharge in the present study is slightly overestimated compared to mamo 2015 because of not using cl concentration of the runoff see section 4 1 walker et al 2019a 2019b estimated actual recharge rates of 280 430 mm y based on different methods in the dangila area i e western extreme part of the southwest zone besides yenehun et al 2022 estimated recharge rates of 404 453 and 439 mm y for the southwest 355 372 and 435 mm y for the east zone 164 315 and 303 mm y for the north zone and mean values of 346 315 and 369 mm y for the entire sub basin based on cmb wetspass and water table fluctuation methods respectively the recharge rates by yenehun et al 2022 are generally a bit overestimated compared to the current study except the cmb method underestimated for the north zone and the wetspass method at the sub basin scale which gave a comparable estimate with the present recharge rate the total groundwater irrigated area in the sub basin based on the current study section 4 4 is less than that of taye et al 2022 see section 1 taye et al 2022 study included seven additional districts than the current study in the east southwest north and western uplands of the sub basin that develop springs and some sparse hand dug wells for irrigation which could have increased the irrigated area the total groundwater irrigation abstraction estimated in this study at the sub basin scale section 4 4 is about 4 folds less than that of taye et al 2022 section 1 the higher value of the groundwater abstraction by the previous study could be due to the greater irrigation area considered and mainly because of a higher water abstraction rate per hectare 0 90 l s used in the estimation which was found based on experiment on river diversions for irrigation irrigation over application was reported by taye et al 2021 in the area groundwater abstraction rates of 0 21 0 16 and 0 08 l s ha are estimated in this study for the southwest east and north zones respectively farmers use hand dug wells within their farmlands for irrigation and groundwater based irrigation is less subject to over application and seepage and evaporation losses compared to surface water diversion schemes therefore the present abstraction rates are reasonable estimates with regard to groundwater based irrigation two monitoring hand dug wells data of getenet 2017 in the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifer of the east zone showed a mean groundwater level increment of 3 01 m during the wet season besides the average groundwater level increment data of 10 monitoring wells amare 2018 which were spatially distributed in the southwest zone was 4 33 m these values suggest that the recharge rates during these years were greater than the respective mean recharge values estimated in this study the total groundwater level change decrement between phases 1 and 3 in this study table 5 is greater than the above mentioned increment values in the east and southwest zones the water level changes due to irrigation abstraction in the east and the southwest zones section 4 3 are 81 and 75 of these previous annual water level increments respectively these pieces of evidence show that the groundwater draft due to irrigation is high in the east zone and it is modest in the southwest zone even though the recharges were higher the ratios of the mean groundwater level decrements due to irrigation to the mean annual groundwater recharge over irrigation area in the east southwest and north zones are shown in table 7 these evidences show that the groundwater abstraction for irrigation exceeds the annual total recharge i e before subtracting the base flow in the east and is nearly equal in the southwest zones this suggests that the groundwater was overexploited and that the natural outflows were superseded and there was a permanent groundwater storage depletion at the local scale in the east zone and a continuous groundwater table decline is expected and nearly the base flow is to be surpassed in the southwest zone in the north zone the aquifer is moderately stressed moreover some wells were found dry during phase 3 monitoring table 3 and table a 2 groundwater availability will be worse if the groundwater based irrigation continues to expand especially in the east and southwest zones the mean base flow to rivers in the sub basin is 187 96 mm y 58 6 of the mean annual recharge table 2 and section 4 1 this base flow supplies dry season rivers flow and this water is being intensively used for household irrigation therefore the total renewable groundwater resource available for development is 132 84 mm y which gives a total groundwater resource of 1616 106 m3 y over the sub basin the total groundwater abstraction for irrigation use at the sub basin scale accounts for 1 of this annually available renewable groundwater resource this suggests that the groundwater development over the lake tana sub basin scale is in its infancy compared to the renewable groundwater resource and this may warrant additional small scale irrigation although groundwater overexploitation at the local scale in the east and southwest groundwater irrigated areas of this study was observed however the suitability of landforms for further household irrigation using hand dug wells in the sub basin needs to be assessed by additional separate studies besides mamo et al 2016 concluded that medium and large scale groundwater based irrigation development will dewater the groundwater reserve and reduce the flow of streams and inflow to the lake this adversely affects the existing and proposed surface water irrigation schemes and prior and proposed water supply uses and lets wetlands and the lake diminish mamo et al 2016 proposed mainly surface waters for irrigation and groundwater for water supply except in the sub catchments where there are no intensive rivers and groundwater development tana sub basin organization of the abay basin authority should pay attention to integrated groundwater surface water and land resources management in the sub basin managed conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water can be practiced as an alternative irrigation development option in the sub basin the proposed dams at the gumara and gilgel abay rivers in the east and southwest zones respectively should be materialized the reservoirs will allow for storing higher river flows during the wet season which can be used for community based irrigation during the subsequent dry season this will enable household farmers to rely more on surface water for irrigation and or to use groundwater sources in conjunction with the reservoirs and unregulated streams dry flow or to use the groundwater only in drought years this will reduce the current stress on the groundwater at the local scale and alleviates the adverse impacts of groundwater overexploitation on other domestic uses and ecosystem preservation it also enables sustainable groundwater development for the priority aspect of the drinking water supply 6 suggestions for future research in this study groundwater level monitoring was made on the entire lake tana sub basin where irrigation is practiced which is the first of its kind research for the area the following limitation should be considered when utilizing the result of the study the selection of water level changes in monitoring wells due to natural outflow is based on subjective judgment the water level changes left for natural outflow in each zone are far greater than 15 of the respective annual recharges which shows an overestimation of the water level changes for the natural outflow this suggests the possibility of underestimation of the water level change due to irrigation abstraction which might have led to the underestimation of the amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation future studies should better monitor the annual natural water table fluctuation using observation of hand dug wells in areas with no or sparse groundwater developing wells groundwater based irrigated land area was determined by the agricultural offices in each kebele by multiplying the irrigation potential of a hand dug well by the total number of hand dug wells within the kebele however the irrigation potential of the hand dug well may not be accurately determined which somehow influences the estimated amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation future researches may consider estimating the average farmland irrigated by a hand dug well on the basis of field experiments at the farmyard level in each zone the total groundwater based irrigated areas can also be estimated by remote sensing techniques in future studies the specific yield sy was used for a homogeneous aquifer condition while it may vary spatially which can have an influence on the estimated amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation future studies may consider determining the specific yield of sediments in the laboratory despite the limitations the results of the research give valuable clues and insights which impel sustainable groundwater development and appropriate management intervention planning especially at the local scale where groundwater based irrigation is being practiced 7 conclusions shallow groundwater abstraction for irrigation was estimated in this study based on groundwater level changes in the monitoring wells the groundwater abstraction for irrigation is higher than the mean annual recharge in the east and nearly equal in the southwest zones covering the gumara ribb and gilgel abay catchments this suggests that the groundwater was being overexploited creating permanent storage depletion and reducing environmental flow at the local scale in the east and southwest zones this entails groundwater scarcity and potential conflict among the different uses which will be worse if groundwater based irrigation expansion continues without proper planning monitoring and adaptive management the groundwater development for irrigation in the north zone is modest but the number of wells studied is few on the other hand the groundwater development for irrigation in terms of the annual renewable groundwater resource over the entire lake tana sub basin scale is in its infancy in contrast to the intensive groundwater use at the local scales in the sub basin construction of the proposed dams at gumara and gilgel abay rivers for irrigation and groundwater and surface water conjunctive use are recommended to alleviate groundwater scarcity at the local scale in the east and southwest zones moreover establishing a regulatory framework policy institution and stakeholder participation is recommended to control groundwater allocations and uses and bring compliances at the sub basin and especially at the local scales in each zone so as to keep abstractions not exceeding the available groundwater resources furthermore long term shallow groundwater level monitoring should be made by the tana sub basin organization throughout the lake tana sub basin and especially in the groundwater irrigated areas of each zone in order to observe the permanent trends of the groundwater level which can be used for subsequent management decisions groundwater flow modeling for decision support is recommended to be implemented for each zone which can be utilized for sustainable groundwater development and management planning credit authorship contribution statement we would like to thank the reviewers and the

7747,study region lake tana sub basin of the upper blue nile river basin ethiopia study focus groundwater use for small scale irrigation is increasing in the lake tana sub basin however the abstraction amount and its impact are not well understood in this study a new methodological approach was utilized to estimate the irrigation water abstraction amount which is based on groundwater level monitoring before during and at the end of the irrigation season 2021 2022 the monitoring was conducted on 361 hand dug wells distributed throughout the sub basin which is subdivided into east southwest and north zones new hydrological insights for the region groundwater abstraction for irrigation and associated groundwater level decline estimates are 10 6 106 m3 and 2 43 m in the east 4 2 106 m3 and 3 23 m in the southwest and 0 6 106 m3 and 1 32 m in the north these abstractions account for 103 97 and 62 of the mean annual groundwater recharge in the east southwest and north zones respectively groundwater is overexploited in the east and southwest zones although at the sub basin scale the amount of groundwater used for irrigation is small compared to the renewable groundwater resource however if groundwater based irrigation continues to expand especially in the east and southwest zones groundwater scarcity at the local scales will worsen adaptive management strategies are required to minimize the potential adverse effects on groundwater resources keywords groundwater level monitoring irrigation abstraction groundwater recharge lake tana sub basin ethiopia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in ethiopia the groundwater irrigation potential based on renewable groundwater resources was estimated to be 1 8 4 3 106 ha gowing et al 2016 however the actual groundwater use for irrigation is low compared to its potential though groundwater is a viable option for supplementing surface water resources for irrigation worqlul et al 2017 it has been estimated that only a very small proportion of the irrigation water use came from groundwater including from shallow wells used by small scale farmers kebede et al 2018 however the demand for groundwater in the multifaceted agricultural sector is currently rapidly growing a study in the raya and kobo valleys of ethiopia estimated that if half or a quarter of the crop water requirement could be satisfied from groundwater sustainable agriculture could increase by 40 80 of the total area pavelic et al 2012 the lake tana sub basin is one of the agricultural growth corridors for ethiopia s ambitious plan to expand irrigation because of its suitable water and land for irrigation development taye et al 2021 worqlul et al 2015 in the lake tana sub basin there is water use competition among water supply irrigation hydropower navigation and tourism and ecosystem needs such as sustaining wetlands base flow to streams and lake tana an increase in population aspiring for better livelihood urbanization industrial and irrigation expansions in the sub basin will escalate the water demand and conflict in water use in the future mamo et al 2021 irrigation using surface water is dominant in the uplands and groundwater use dominates in the plains around the lake worqlul et al 2015 groundwater is the sole source of water supply for urban and rural communities and industries in the lake tana sub basin on the basis of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace abiy and melesse 2017 revealed that the groundwater level or storage decreased by 18 37 cm between 2003 and 2013 in the lake tana sub basin besides there are significant groundwater level declines at the local scale for instance the water level decline in the kola diba well field due to overexploitation of the resource for water supply gebey et al 2022 unpublished and drying of springs and productive boreholes and tapping poor quality groundwater in some deep water supply boreholes especially during drought years adswe 2009 were observed diminishing of wetlands and dry season rivers flow was also observed in the sub basin mamo et al 2021 furthermore tigabu et al 2020a 2020b concluded that flow from the groundwater to surface water dominates in the gilgel abay catchment southwest zone in this study see section 2 and streams contribution to the groundwater in the gumara plain east zone section 2 decreased since 1994 while in the rib catchment east zone the flow system was reversed since 1990 from mainly surface water inflow to the groundwater to from the groundwater to the stream network system this seems to be mainly interlinked with unmanaged groundwater and surface water development and recharge reduction due to climate and land use changes groundwater recharge was revealed to fluctuate with the amount of rainfall inter annually but had a slight general decreasing trend from 1979 to 2016 mamo et al 2021 moreover according to yenehun 2022 a slight groundwater recharge decrease between 1986 and 2014 was observed in the sub basin associated with land use changes based on wetspass modeling on the other hand shallow groundwater based household irrigation is booming at an alarming rate from year to year in the sub basin which will cause adverse impacts on the groundwater availability and environmental flow and complicates the water use conflict most farmers use the shallow groundwater for household irrigation by digging hand dug wells within their farms for instance the number of shallow wells in fogera woreda district is more than 30 000 according to the woreda s record most of these farmers are those whose plots of land are far from the perennial rivers and where there is insufficient river flow in the downstream areas due to upstream irrigation activities the total small scale irrigated land area in the sub basin is 58 873 ha of which 12 7096 ha of the land is irrigated by groundwater taye et al 2022 the total groundwater use for small scale irrigation according to this study is 66 106 m3 per year the use of groundwater for irrigation will likely increase in the future as more people shift from surface water use due to water scarcity taye et al 2022 groundwater abstraction was estimated by an indirect method using the average water abstraction rate per hectare of 0 90 l s which was determined by experiments in selected 15 rivers diversions for irrigation taye et al 2021 and then multiplying it by the total irrigated area however the current groundwater abstraction for irrigation in the sub basin was not monitored and analyzed in detail therefore the amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation and its potential impacts need to be better assessed which can be an input for sustainable groundwater management processes a new methodological approach which is based on groundwater level change monitoring has been followed in this study as an independent method to estimate the amount of shallow groundwater abstraction for irrigation in the sub basin instead of conducting more time and budget intensive traditional approaches such as an inventory of the amount of shallow groundwater abstraction from each farmyard or using the crop water requirement approach previous groundwater level monitoring activities in the lake tana sub basin were fragmented and sporadic which were mainly done for educational purposes in this study a thorough groundwater level monitoring was conducted in areas where groundwater based irrigation is dominant the main objectives of this study were to estimate irrigation water abstraction from the shallow groundwater and evaluate how this affects the shallow groundwater resources of the lake tana sub basin primary data were collected through groundwater level monitoring in multiple seasons and the total groundwater based irrigated land area of kebeles i e the smallest political administration unit within districts of each zone was collected to attain the objectives and critical management questions were unraveled such as how much water is being currently abstracted from the shallow groundwater for irrigation is the irrigation abstraction comparable with the amount of groundwater recharge and what is the impact of groundwater based irrigation on groundwater availability the results of the study laid a foundation for decision support modeling research and the data and findings will give valuable insight to decision and policymakers in order to consider proper management interventions 2 study area 2 1 site description the lake tana sub basin is found in northwestern ethiopia at the head of the blue nile abbay river basin where the river originates from it is located within utm zone 37 wgs84 between 252788 and 396487 east and 1218577 and 1410176 north fig 1 the sub basin has a total area of 15321 km2 of which the lake occupies 3156 km2 tigabu et al 2020a 2020b for the purpose of systematic data analysis three groundwater development zones or corridors were delineated in the sub basin based on topography and groundwater flow direction making use of arcgis 10 8 software the zones are named east southwest and north zones fig 1 the physiography of the lake tana sub basin is shown as a hill shade in fig 1 which was prepared using shuttle radar topographic mission srtm digital elevation model 30 m by 30 m resolution dem data the elevation ranges from 1679 to 4089 m above sea level the hydrometeorology of the sub basin is characterized by a humid type of climate as determined on the basis of climate classification by thornthwaite 1948 and moist type by willmott and feddema 1992 methods as stipulated in feddema 2005 the rainfall pattern is unimodal with the main rain season between june and september several perennial and seasonal streams and rivers drain the sub basin and the main ones that account for 76 of the sub basin area are gilgel abay ribb gumara and megech catchments mamo 2015 2 2 characterization of the shallow aquifer system the hydrogeologic units which are exposed in the lake tana sub basin include different tertiary volcanics tertiary sekela basalt quaternary basalt quaternary fluvio lacustrine sediments and quaternary rhyolite dome fig 2 productivity of these aquifers is shown in fig 2 and the hydraulic and hydrologic characteristics of the aquifers are summarized in the supplementary material table a 1 according to mamo 2015 there are three aquifer systems in the lake tana sub basin which are the upper aquifer system uas middle aquifer system mas and lower aquifer system las from top to bottom the uas consists of the unconfined aquifer at the top and semi confined aquifer s underneath the unconfined aquifer system has a thickness of 100 150 m in the different parts of the sub basin the exposed tertiary volcanics quaternary basalt and the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifers constitute the unconfined aquifer part of the uas i e they constitute the shallow unconfined aquifer system groundwater in the shallow unconfined aquifer system flows from the surrounding uplands toward the lake and contributes to it abiy et al 2015 chebud and melesse 2009 mamo 2015 the unconfined aquifer is often used for towns water supply using boreholes of up to 150 m depth and for rural villages public water supply using shallow boreholes of up to 60 m deep rural household groundwater abstractions for small scale irrigation and drinking are being made using hand dug wells on the regolith and weathered mantle at the top of the basalt aquifer and on the top part of the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifer however there are no separate studies on the nature and hydraulic properties of the regolith and fluvio lacustrine sediments in the whole sub basin the regolith under investigation in this study is found in the entire southwest zone and western extreme parts of the east and north zones at the ground surface the soil spatially varies from clay to silty sand but in general the groundwater bearing soil is clayey sandy silt the fluvio lacustrine aquifer is found in most parts of the east and north zones the soil at the ground surface spatially varies from clay to sand but it is often silty clay however the aquifer supplying water to the wells is clayey sandy silt walker et al 2019a 2019b concluded based on isotopes 2h and 18o data that the regolith gets recharged from influent surface waters during the wet season around dangila area kilty catchment fig 3 furthermore according to mamo 2015 hydrochemistry data of hand dug wells springs and boreholes 150 m depth in volcanic terrains of the sub basin formed one cluster or sub group based on hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis suggesting that they are interlinked or from one groundwater system besides the unconfined volcanic aquifer 150 m depth has similar hydrochemical facies to perennial rivers during the dry season in the sub basin which shows that the aquifer feeds the rivers therefore the regolith with the underlying weathered and fractured basalt is one interconnected aquifer as well as the hand dug wells in unconsolidated sediments tap groundwater from the top part of the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifer pumping test data of eight hand dug wells in dangila area walker et al 2019a 2019b showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the regolith ranges during the dry season from 0 2 to 6 4 m d with mean and median of 2 3 and 1 6 m d respectively during the wet season the hydraulic conductivity was 2 8 22 3 m d with 9 7 and 6 5 m d mean and median values respectively the specific yield sy varies from 0 00001 to 0 32 and the mean and median values are 0 09 and 0 08 respectively the specific yield values of 0 03 0 08 and 0 23 for clay silt and sand johnson 1967 were used in this study to calculate the mean sy for clayey sandy silt regolith and sediments which are being under investigation in the lake tana sub basin 3 material and methods 3 1 data acquisition and materials precipitation 1995 2009 and hydrological 1995 2006 data were collected from the ethiopian meteorological institute and the ministry of water and energy respectively the location of the meteorological and hydrological stations used is shown in fig 3 srtm dem 30 m by 30 m data was used to generate elevations and prepare the hill shade map using the arcgis hydrology tool fig 1 sixty nine kebeles within eleven districts where groundwater based irrigation is considerable and significant were included in this study groundwater irrigated land areas were collected from each kebele s agricultural office in each irrigation zone dip meters and gps with one meter accuracy were used to measure the groundwater level and record the coordinates and surface elevations of the monitoring wells arcgis 10 8 was used to prepare the figures 3 2 groundwater recharge estimation groundwater recharge can be direct or diffuse from precipitation and irrigation losses induced indirect and localized from surface water bodies lateral and or vertical inter aquifer leakage and artificial recharge there are several methods direct and indirect to calculate the recharge rate de vries and simmers 2002 chloride mass balance cmb is the most widely used tracer method to estimate actual diffused recharge in the saturated zone scanlon et al 2006 and it was used in this study groundwater recharge rate r can be estimated based on the cmb approach using the following equation eq 1 erisksson and khunakasem 1969 1 r pe cp d cgw 2 pe p q where pe is effective precipitation p is precipitation and q is runoff in mm year cp and cgw represent the chloride cl concentration of the rainfall and groundwater respectively in mg l d is the dry chloride deposition the cmb method assumes the conservation of mass between the input of atmospheric cl and cl flux in the subsurface if sources in addition to precipitation contribute cl to the system the cl input from these sources needs to be quantified groundwater and rainfall cl data of mamo 2015 were used in this analysis eighty six groundwater points springs hand dug wells and boreholes with depths less than 126 m were selected for cmb analysis from the unconfined aquifer system where additional cl input from weathering of the rock matrix is negligible eleven shallow groundwater samples in the sub basin which seem to be polluted and those which have interacted with pockets of evaporites in the unconsolidated sediments and that have relatively higher cl content have been removed from these data besides 18 groundwater samples with cl concentrations less than that of the rainfall were omitted then 33 15 and 9 groundwater samples with cl concentrations of 1 3 18 mg l which are greater than the rainfall cl content were used in the east southwest and north zones respectively and their harmonic mean cgw in each zone was estimated and used in eq 1 groundwater sample sites which were used for cmb are shown in fig 3 the cl concentrations of rainfall samples which were collected every month for one hydrological year 2012 at four rain gauge stations in the lake tana sub basin bahir dar gonder gassay and gish abay sekela fig 3 were used to estimate cp the temporal average of chloride concentrations in each station was calculated and then spatially averaged for each zone southwest east and north zones dry deposition is problematic where there is a local source of salt cl in the landscape e g recirculation of salt from a salt lake scanlon et al 2006 and where there is atmospheric pollution from industrial gases and aerosols that contain substantial cl nyagwambo 2002 these conditions are not the case in the lake tana sub basin and the area is far from the sea besides the rainfall samples were collected using standard rain gauges and the measured cl content represents the bulk cl deposition which incorporates the dry deposition d hence the cl concentration measured for the rainy month encompasses dry deposition of the preceding month s i e it represents dry wet atmospheric cl deposition and therefore d is omitted in eq 1 temporal monthly precipitation records at a given station fig 3 were averaged and then a spatial averaging was made using all stations in each zone based on the thiessen polygonal method schumann 1998 direct runoff dro was used to represent runoff q in eq 2 dro was separated from the total river hydrograph based on lyn hollick 1979 digital filter algorithm using river analysis package rap which was developed by monash university melbourne australia a filter parameter alpha default value of 0 975 was used marsh et al 2003 then the weighted mean dro by rivers catchment areas was estimated for each zone and used in eq 2 table 1 recharge estimation was made for the southwest east and north zones besides to estimate the recharge rate over the entire lake tana sub basin spatial averaging of the rainfall amount dro cp and cgw were made at the sub basin scale 3 3 groundwater level monitoring preliminary groundwater irrigated areas were identified during prior desk work and refined during the fieldwork kebeles abstracting shallow groundwater for irrigation were selected based on consultation with districts agricultural offices and then irrigated localities within the kebeles were identified with support from the kebeles agricultural experts spatially representative monitoring wells were selected from the stock of wells in the irrigated areas of each kebele the number of monitoring wells per kebele varies depending on the total number of irrigation wells and the aerial extent of the kebele table a 2 groundwater level monitoring sites were selected on 361 hand dug wells hdw inventories were conducted for 240 wells tapping groundwater from the regolith the depth of these hand dug wells varies from 4 1 to 32 m with a mean and standard deviation of 12 66 and 4 59 m respectively besides 121 hand dug wells were inventoried in the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifer the depth of these wells spatially varies from 0 07 to 36 m and the mean and standard deviation are 16 73 and 9 49 m respectively water level measurement was done manually using water level probe i e dip meter with electrical sounder and light in the early morning one or two hours before withdrawals for irrigation and other uses commenced the device measures water level depth with 0 01 cm accuracy level the groundwater level monitoring was done in three phases the first phase phase 1 was conducted between 20 october and 12 november 2021 which is one month after the rainy season and before the beginning of irrigation activity the second monitoring phase 2 was done between 24 january and 15 february 2022 during the middle of the dry season and when irrigation abstraction was underway the third monitoring phase 3 was done between 5 and 24 may 2022 which is at the end of the dry season and irrigation activities during phase 1 hand dug wells that were being used for irrigation and drinking purposes separately were monitored wells for drinking use were intended to determine the natural water level fluctuation however some wells that were separately used for irrigation and drinking during phase 1 were found to be used both for irrigation and drinking purposes including for livestock watering during phases 2 and 3 besides some irrigation wells monitored during phases 1 and 2 were used both for drinking and irrigation purposes during phase 3 table 2 and table a 2 most of the monitored wells were used only for irrigation or both for irrigation and drinking purposes wells which were used for multiple irrigation drinking and livestock watering purposes account for 44 9 and 48 2 of the total monitored wells during phase 2 and phase 3 respectively the number and spatial distribution of the monitored irrigation wells are good and enough for the estimation of groundwater abstraction for irrigation the spatial distribution of monitoring wells are depicted in fig 4 3 4 estimation of groundwater based irrigation area and abstraction groundwater level changes between phases 1 and 2 and that of phases 1 and 3 were estimated for each monitoring well in each zone table a 2 the water level changes between phase 1 and phases 2 and 3 in the monitoring wells which were used for drinking both irrigation and drinking and livestock watering purposes were observed to be greater than those wells used only for irrigation use table a 2 which seem to be due to greater abstraction and therefore these data were not used for analysis the number of monitored wells which were being used for different purposes in each phase are shown in table 2 the mean and range of depth to the water levels in each phase and the total water level changes between phase 1 and phases 2 and 3 were estimated for irrigation wells in each zone depth to water levels for each phase and water level changes between monitoring phases are plotted using the arcgis tool to see the spatial variation furthermore to estimate the water level fluctuation due to natural outflows i e base flows to streams and the lake between phases 1 and 2 wells with the three exceptionally lowest changes in water level in each zone were omitted not to underestimate the natural outflow then five north zone nine southwest and ten east zone water level changes from the lowest which spatially represent the zones and are considered to represent the natural changes due to their relatively smaller values compared to others were averaged the least water level changes between phase 3 and phase 1 in ten in the east and north zones and five in the north zone monitoring wells which spatially represent each zone were averaged to represent the natural groundwater level change due to natural outflow the water level changes in monitoring wells that were being used only for irrigation purposes were considered to estimate the amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation groundwater abstraction for irrigation wi in m3 was estimated for each zone using the following equation eq 3 3 wi ht hn sy ai where ht and hn are the measured total and natural mean water level changes in meters respectively sy is the specific yield and ai is the total groundwater irrigated land area in m2 in the zone monitoring hand dug wells are dug in clayey sandy silt sediments and regolith at the top parts of the shallow unconfined lacustrine and volcanic aquifers respectively the average value of the specific yields of clay silt and sand see section 2 2 was estimated to be 0 113 and used as sy of the clayey sandy silt sediments in the groundwater abstraction estimation the total groundwater irrigated area in each zone was estimated as the sum of the total groundwater irrigated areas of kebeles found in each zone table a 2 the research approaches are summarized in fig 5 3 5 background theory for impact assessment the hydrologic budget of a hydrologic system is given as the volume of inputs minus the outputs from the system over any period equals the change in water stored hudak 2000 the groundwater balance in the study area can be given as follows eq 4 4 i o l s where i the inflow to the groundwater includes the different modes of recharges over the area r and the lateral groundwater inflow gi to the area from the upstream catchment area o is the outflow from the groundwater that includes irrigation wi water supply wd and livestock wls uses and the natural outflows as groundwater base flow to rivers in the area bf and the underflow from the area to the downstream area go evapotranspiration is considered in the outflow if the groundwater table is shallow evapotranspiration from the groundwater is considered negligible in the area as the depth to the groundwater level is often greater than 3 m l represents inter aquifer leakage and is generally unknown in the area and was not accounted for s is the change in groundwater storage therefore eq 4 can be written as eq 5 5 r gi wi wd wls bf go s in terms of the groundwater level increment during the wet season eq 5 can be given as eq 6 6 s hi r gi wi wd wls bf go where hi is the groundwater level increment and s is storativity specific yield for the study area units are in mm the natural outflow bf go is maximum when the groundwater level increment is maximum which is at the end of the rainy season therefore the annual groundwater level increment represents the annual available groundwater resource agwr for development in terms of the groundwater level decrement during the dry season and under natural or equilibrium conditions i e no abstraction the natural groundwater outflow equals the inflow and the following holds eq 7 7 s hd bf go r gi where hd is the groundwater level change or decrement during the dry season and r is the recharge from rainfall during the preceding wet season plus induced recharges units are in mm when there is an abstraction from the aquifer the system will be in disequilibrium condition and withdrawals are at the expense of the natural outflows when the natural outflow becomes zero the abstraction is supplied by a permanent groundwater storage depletion therefore the groundwater level decrement during the dry season is given as in eq 8 8 s hd wi wd wls bf go r gi go is less than or equal to gi this implies that abstractions wi wd wls plus base flow bf should be greater than or equal to the recharge r in eq 8 therefore if abstraction is greater than the recharge the natural outflow will be superseded and there will be a permanent groundwater storage depletion or water table decline according to chadha 2002 areas where groundwater development exceeds 85 of annual replenishment show a continuous decline in the groundwater table in the study area there is no sufficient static groundwater level data to estimate the gi and go based on darcy s method 4 results 4 1 estimated recharge rates groundwater recharge values are estimated to be 377 9 267 7 and 241 5 mm y in the southwest east and north zones respectively table 3 and fig 3 and 320 8 mm y at the sub basin scale the weighted average dro which is separated from the total stream flow was used as runoff q in eq 2 the dro might consist of a possible interflow component which can have a greater cl concentration than the vertical flow component due to evapotranspiration in the unsaturated zone during lateral flow in the root zone using cl concentration of rivers for runoff q in the computation gave unexpected high or low recharge values for the east and southwest zones which may be due to laboratory analytical problems with individual samples and were not accounted for in the recharge estimation therefore the estimated recharge values could be slightly overestimated the recharge values were estimated using 2012 cl and 1995 2009 hydrometeorological data however the recharge values can be fairly used for the purpose of this study during the year 2021 22 in the east and north zones groundwater feeds streams in the uplands table 1 and fig 3 the top part of the lacustrine sediments in the east and north plains fig 2 is often silty clay and the diffused recharge from the rainfall here could be lower than the respective mean recharge rate which was estimated by the cmb method however there is groundwater inflow from uplands beneath the river beds to the plains and the lake as can be observed from the difference between the recharge and mean separated base flow in each zone table 1 and fig 3 furthermore the groundwater level is often below the rivers beds in these plains and induced recharge occurs in the lacustrine sediments and surrounding volcanics from rivers which are sustained by the upland base flows during the dry season and from ponds that are created by inundated lake water and rivers floods during the rainy period therefore the recharge in the irrigated areas seems to be not less than the mean recharge estimated for each zone and it was considered to be equal to the mean recharge value estimated by the cmb method in the southwest groundwater feeds the streams in the uplands and there is groundwater runoff beneath the stream beds to the downstream irrigation areas table 1 and fig 3 the groundwater and stream interaction is unknown downstream of the gilgel abay and kilty hydrological stations fig 3 the groundwater recharge in the irrigated areas is considered to be equal to the mean estimated recharge rate by the cmb method for the zone the recharges from seepage in the irrigation furrows and induced recharge from streams due to a decline in the groundwater level were not known and not considered in each zone 4 2 depth to groundwater levels the statistics of depth to groundwater level below the ground surface in irrigation monitoring wells for the three phases are shown in table 4 the range mean and standard deviation are highest in the southwest zone and least in the north zone which could be due to the higher topographic slope in the former the spatial variation of groundwater level depth in each zone is depicted in figs 6 8 for phases 1 2 and 3 respectively the depth to the water level in all zones is variable spatially for the three phases it is highly variable in the southwest followed by in the east and least in the north zones groundwater level depth is generally lower in the upstream and downstream areas that are close to the lake than in the middle catchment areas in the southwest zone in the east zone lower water level depth is observed in the plain fluvio lacustrine sediments than in volcanic aquifers spatially variable depth to groundwater level was seen for the three phases in the north zone 4 3 groundwater level changes the groundwater level changes between phases 1 and 2 and phases 1 and 3 were calculated for each monitoring well in each zone table a 2 the statistical summary of water level changes between phases 1 and 2 and phases 1 and 3 in the southwest east and north zones is shown in table 5 the range mean and standard deviation of groundwater level changes between phases 1 and 2 and phases 1 and 3 are highest in the southwest zone and least in the north zone the water level change between phases 1 and 3 due to groundwater irrigation and the natural water level change is estimated to be 3 23 and 1 28 m in the southwest zone respectively in the east zone the water level changes due to irrigation and natural discharges are 2 43 and 1 31 m respectively the water level change due to irrigation use is 1 32 m while the natural water level change is 1 29 m in the north zone the water level change due to natural discharges are nearly equal in the three zones which seem to be because of the similarity in aquifers nature and are less than those of the estimated upstream base flows to rivers table 1 section 3 2 as would be expected due to lower relief and area in the monitored sites water level change due to groundwater irrigation is highest in the southwest and lowest in the north zones the number of irrigation wells used in the water level change calculation in the north zone is few because most of the wells were being used both for drinking and irrigation purposes the spatial variation of water level change between phases 1 and 2 and phases 1 and 3 are presented in figs 9 and 10 spatially variable water level change is observed in the southwest zone for both cases in general water level change is observed to be greater in the fluvio lacustrine sediments than in the volcanic aquifers in the east zone in the north zone the change in water level between phase 1 and phases 2 and 3 are spatially variable although the number of wells used is few 4 4 groundwater abstractions and irrigated areas the groundwater abstraction by irrigation between phase 1 and phase 2 is 5 5 106 2 2 106 and 0 12 106 m3 in the east southwest and north zones respectively table 6 the amount of groundwater abstraction between phases 1 and 3 is estimated to be about 10 6 106 4 2 106 and 0 6 106 m3 for the east southwest and north irrigation zones respectively table 6 the amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation is highest in the east and least in the north zones groundwater based irrigation is conducted for horticulture e g to grow fruits coffee chat sugarcane etc in the southwest mainly for vegetables in the east and in the north for fruits and maize the water level change due to irrigation abstraction in the southwest is highest than those of the east and north zones this shows higher groundwater use in the southwest which seems to be due to greater consumptive use of horticulture activities in the zone the east zone has the greatest irrigated land area of all zones and the groundwater abstraction for irrigation is highest in this zone the total groundwater abstraction for irrigation and the groundwater based irrigated area at the sub basin scale is 15 3 106 m3 y and 5378 ha respectively groundwater irrigated land area of each zone is shown in table 6 the recharge rates over the irrigation areas r and the groundwater level decrement due to abstraction for irrigation di sy times the change in the head due to irrigation are shown in table 7 for the east southwest and north zones groundwater irrigation abstraction exceeds and nearly equals the recharge in the east and southwest zones respectively table 7 which entails adverse impacts on domestic drinking and livestock uses and on environmental flow for ecosystem preservation 5 discussion based on the soil water balance 284 mm y and cmb 285 mm y methods that accounted for the runoff cl concentration mamo 2015 estimated an average recharge rate of 285 mm y for the lake tana sub basin the recharge in the present study is slightly overestimated compared to mamo 2015 because of not using cl concentration of the runoff see section 4 1 walker et al 2019a 2019b estimated actual recharge rates of 280 430 mm y based on different methods in the dangila area i e western extreme part of the southwest zone besides yenehun et al 2022 estimated recharge rates of 404 453 and 439 mm y for the southwest 355 372 and 435 mm y for the east zone 164 315 and 303 mm y for the north zone and mean values of 346 315 and 369 mm y for the entire sub basin based on cmb wetspass and water table fluctuation methods respectively the recharge rates by yenehun et al 2022 are generally a bit overestimated compared to the current study except the cmb method underestimated for the north zone and the wetspass method at the sub basin scale which gave a comparable estimate with the present recharge rate the total groundwater irrigated area in the sub basin based on the current study section 4 4 is less than that of taye et al 2022 see section 1 taye et al 2022 study included seven additional districts than the current study in the east southwest north and western uplands of the sub basin that develop springs and some sparse hand dug wells for irrigation which could have increased the irrigated area the total groundwater irrigation abstraction estimated in this study at the sub basin scale section 4 4 is about 4 folds less than that of taye et al 2022 section 1 the higher value of the groundwater abstraction by the previous study could be due to the greater irrigation area considered and mainly because of a higher water abstraction rate per hectare 0 90 l s used in the estimation which was found based on experiment on river diversions for irrigation irrigation over application was reported by taye et al 2021 in the area groundwater abstraction rates of 0 21 0 16 and 0 08 l s ha are estimated in this study for the southwest east and north zones respectively farmers use hand dug wells within their farmlands for irrigation and groundwater based irrigation is less subject to over application and seepage and evaporation losses compared to surface water diversion schemes therefore the present abstraction rates are reasonable estimates with regard to groundwater based irrigation two monitoring hand dug wells data of getenet 2017 in the fluvio lacustrine sediments aquifer of the east zone showed a mean groundwater level increment of 3 01 m during the wet season besides the average groundwater level increment data of 10 monitoring wells amare 2018 which were spatially distributed in the southwest zone was 4 33 m these values suggest that the recharge rates during these years were greater than the respective mean recharge values estimated in this study the total groundwater level change decrement between phases 1 and 3 in this study table 5 is greater than the above mentioned increment values in the east and southwest zones the water level changes due to irrigation abstraction in the east and the southwest zones section 4 3 are 81 and 75 of these previous annual water level increments respectively these pieces of evidence show that the groundwater draft due to irrigation is high in the east zone and it is modest in the southwest zone even though the recharges were higher the ratios of the mean groundwater level decrements due to irrigation to the mean annual groundwater recharge over irrigation area in the east southwest and north zones are shown in table 7 these evidences show that the groundwater abstraction for irrigation exceeds the annual total recharge i e before subtracting the base flow in the east and is nearly equal in the southwest zones this suggests that the groundwater was overexploited and that the natural outflows were superseded and there was a permanent groundwater storage depletion at the local scale in the east zone and a continuous groundwater table decline is expected and nearly the base flow is to be surpassed in the southwest zone in the north zone the aquifer is moderately stressed moreover some wells were found dry during phase 3 monitoring table 3 and table a 2 groundwater availability will be worse if the groundwater based irrigation continues to expand especially in the east and southwest zones the mean base flow to rivers in the sub basin is 187 96 mm y 58 6 of the mean annual recharge table 2 and section 4 1 this base flow supplies dry season rivers flow and this water is being intensively used for household irrigation therefore the total renewable groundwater resource available for development is 132 84 mm y which gives a total groundwater resource of 1616 106 m3 y over the sub basin the total groundwater abstraction for irrigation use at the sub basin scale accounts for 1 of this annually available renewable groundwater resource this suggests that the groundwater development over the lake tana sub basin scale is in its infancy compared to the renewable groundwater resource and this may warrant additional small scale irrigation although groundwater overexploitation at the local scale in the east and southwest groundwater irrigated areas of this study was observed however the suitability of landforms for further household irrigation using hand dug wells in the sub basin needs to be assessed by additional separate studies besides mamo et al 2016 concluded that medium and large scale groundwater based irrigation development will dewater the groundwater reserve and reduce the flow of streams and inflow to the lake this adversely affects the existing and proposed surface water irrigation schemes and prior and proposed water supply uses and lets wetlands and the lake diminish mamo et al 2016 proposed mainly surface waters for irrigation and groundwater for water supply except in the sub catchments where there are no intensive rivers and groundwater development tana sub basin organization of the abay basin authority should pay attention to integrated groundwater surface water and land resources management in the sub basin managed conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water can be practiced as an alternative irrigation development option in the sub basin the proposed dams at the gumara and gilgel abay rivers in the east and southwest zones respectively should be materialized the reservoirs will allow for storing higher river flows during the wet season which can be used for community based irrigation during the subsequent dry season this will enable household farmers to rely more on surface water for irrigation and or to use groundwater sources in conjunction with the reservoirs and unregulated streams dry flow or to use the groundwater only in drought years this will reduce the current stress on the groundwater at the local scale and alleviates the adverse impacts of groundwater overexploitation on other domestic uses and ecosystem preservation it also enables sustainable groundwater development for the priority aspect of the drinking water supply 6 suggestions for future research in this study groundwater level monitoring was made on the entire lake tana sub basin where irrigation is practiced which is the first of its kind research for the area the following limitation should be considered when utilizing the result of the study the selection of water level changes in monitoring wells due to natural outflow is based on subjective judgment the water level changes left for natural outflow in each zone are far greater than 15 of the respective annual recharges which shows an overestimation of the water level changes for the natural outflow this suggests the possibility of underestimation of the water level change due to irrigation abstraction which might have led to the underestimation of the amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation future studies should better monitor the annual natural water table fluctuation using observation of hand dug wells in areas with no or sparse groundwater developing wells groundwater based irrigated land area was determined by the agricultural offices in each kebele by multiplying the irrigation potential of a hand dug well by the total number of hand dug wells within the kebele however the irrigation potential of the hand dug well may not be accurately determined which somehow influences the estimated amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation future researches may consider estimating the average farmland irrigated by a hand dug well on the basis of field experiments at the farmyard level in each zone the total groundwater based irrigated areas can also be estimated by remote sensing techniques in future studies the specific yield sy was used for a homogeneous aquifer condition while it may vary spatially which can have an influence on the estimated amount of groundwater abstraction for irrigation future studies may consider determining the specific yield of sediments in the laboratory despite the limitations the results of the research give valuable clues and insights which impel sustainable groundwater development and appropriate management intervention planning especially at the local scale where groundwater based irrigation is being practiced 7 conclusions shallow groundwater abstraction for irrigation was estimated in this study based on groundwater level changes in the monitoring wells the groundwater abstraction for irrigation is higher than the mean annual recharge in the east and nearly equal in the southwest zones covering the gumara ribb and gilgel abay catchments this suggests that the groundwater was being overexploited creating permanent storage depletion and reducing environmental flow at the local scale in the east and southwest zones this entails groundwater scarcity and potential conflict among the different uses which will be worse if groundwater based irrigation expansion continues without proper planning monitoring and adaptive management the groundwater development for irrigation in the north zone is modest but the number of wells studied is few on the other hand the groundwater development for irrigation in terms of the annual renewable groundwater resource over the entire lake tana sub basin scale is in its infancy in contrast to the intensive groundwater use at the local scales in the sub basin construction of the proposed dams at gumara and gilgel abay rivers for irrigation and groundwater and surface water conjunctive use are recommended to alleviate groundwater scarcity at the local scale in the east and southwest zones moreover establishing a regulatory framework policy institution and stakeholder participation is recommended to control groundwater allocations and uses and bring compliances at the sub basin and especially at the local scales in each zone so as to keep abstractions not exceeding the available groundwater resources furthermore long term shallow groundwater level monitoring should be made by the tana sub basin organization throughout the lake tana sub basin and especially in the groundwater irrigated areas of each zone in order to observe the permanent trends of the groundwater level which can be used for subsequent management decisions groundwater flow modeling for decision support is recommended to be implemented for each zone which can be utilized for sustainable groundwater development and management planning credit authorship contribution statement we would like to thank the reviewers and the

7748,study region akaki is a headwater catchment of awash river basin that hosts the capital city of ethiopia addis ababa the area encompasses several agglomerated towns water supply and hydropower reservoirs and is characterized by a chain of mountains and floodplains due to basin rainfall and the expansion of urbanized areas the catchment is frequently affected by flooding study focus this study evaluates dynamic bayesian model averaging bma approach to improve rainfall estimation over the catchment by blending four high resolution satellite rainfall estimate sre products using daily data 2003 2019 observed at thirteen stations as a reference seven statistical metrics served to assess the point and spatial scale accuracy of the rainfall estimates new hydrological insights main findings from this study are i the blended product outperformed the individual sre products by notably improving correlation with in situ observed rainfall and reducing the error of the estimated rainfall ii the blended and individual sre products performed better in the highlands than the lowlands of the catchment and iii the amount of daily rainfall during the main rainy season was mostly overestimated by the individual sre products but was fairly estimated by the blended product this study showed the nonexistence of surpassing individual sre products and emphasized the blending of several products for gaining optimal results from each product graphical abstract ga1 keywords satellite rainfall estimates bayesian model averaging blending urban catchment evaluation of precipitation awash river basin akaki catchment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction quality of rainfall data in terms of accuracy and reliability plays an important role in water climate and environmental studies and applications across africa in particular access to quality data is challenging mainly due to a lack of support i e technical financial and administrative and political instabilities world bank 2012 wmo 2020 that often cause disruptions in the collection of data over the past three decades the number of rain gauge stations reduced from 50 to below 10 in the democratic republic of congo washington et al 2013 and from 400 to less than 50 in madagascar dinku 2019 even though 3000 stations are supposed to provide reliable time series across the african continent only 744 are installed and only 25 of them are up to the required standard satgé et al 2020 therefore to complement the existing rain gauge observations rainfall estimates by satellite products have been advocated as an alternative data source to fill the rainfall data gaps e g koriche and rientjes 2016 dembélé et al 2020 dosio et al 2021 the earliest studies that evaluate the performance of satellite rainfall estimate sre products over different parts of africa yielded highly discrepant outcomes across topographic settings climatic zones rainfall intensities seasons and types of sensors gebremicael et al 2019 showed that chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data exhibited adequate rainfall estimation performance over mountainous parts of northern ethiopian as compared to other products in contrast ayehu et al 2018 gebrechorkos et al 2018 and belete et al 2020 compared several products and reported good performance of chirps in different parts of eastern africa irrespective of topographic variability gebere et al 2015 compared three products and revealed the better performance of gsmap global satellite mapping of precipitation and persiann precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks in flat areas than in mountainous areas of eastern ethiopia the effect of topographic features on the performance of three sre products is reported by a study conducted in two lake catchments in the nile river basin haile et al 2013 the study revealed an underestimation of cmorph climate prediction center morphing technique and trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission products in capturing hourly rainfall over the lakes and nearby landscapes i e shores and islands whereas the products resulted in an overestimation in the case of mountainous areas ayugi et al 2019 showed that the accuracy of sre products can be related to climate zones because the study reveals the good performance of chirps persiann and arc africa rainfall climatology over arid semi arid humid and highland areas of kenya respectively according to haile et al 2010 and mekonnen et al 2021 the performance of sre products differs for respective rainfall rates the study considered seven sre products over the upper awash basin of ethiopia and showed better performance of the products in estimating rainfall rates 10 mm day than rainfall rates 10 mm day a study conducted over an arid region of egypt showed satisfactory performance of chirps in estimating rainfall at intensity 1 mm day but arc and gsmap performed well for rainfall intensity 1 mm day nashwan et al 2020 the influence of season on the accuracy of sre products is underlined in several studies a study conducted over the lake tana basin of ethiopia by fenta et al 2018 indicated the good performance of tamsat tropical applications of meteorology using satellite data and ground based observations during the main rainy season and chirps in the short rainy season as compared to the dry season gebere et al 2015 showed that persiann well captured accumulated rainfall during a dry season whereas trmm well performed during short rainy and long rainy seasons over eastern ethiopia the type of sensor is another factor that affects the performance of sre products over a specific region studies conducted in different parts of ethiopia with highland topography indicated a consistently good performance of microwave sensor based products such as cmorph and infrared sensor based products such as persiann in estimating daily rainfalls at higher and lower altitudes respectively romilly and gebremichael 2011 mekonnen et al 2021 in general this review indicates that there is no single sre product that surmounts over the other products e g maggioni et al 2016 le coz and van de giesen 2020 to overcome the limitations of using a single sre product combining information from gauged measurements and different sensors based multiple sre products has become an emerging approach which is widely known as blending e g beck et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 blending involves the optimal use of satellite sensors but also satellite rainfall products to provide optimal rainfall estimates where gauged rainfall serves as a reference to train the estimation algorithm in the process when multiple satellite rainfall products are used defining a proportional optimal and uncertainty disfavoring weightage for each sre product is essential to create a blended rainfall estimate to better match with the gauged rainfall the principle of blending is that the blended product is the outcome of the simultaneous weighing of individual sre products that attribute to the blended estimate for an optimum match with rain gauge observations for each time instant defined weights of individual sre products sum to 1 but weights may change for each time instant to seek optimum performance of the blending algorithm blending approaches can be broadly categorized under either geo statistical or non parametric geo statistical approaches consist of classical relatively simple and commonly applied merging approaches such as kriging based interpolations e g chappell et al 2013 and geographically weighted regression e g chao et al 2018 limitations of such approaches relate to their underlying assumptions that consider only stationary and gaussian type of data that is collected from well distributed and dense rain gauge networks erdin et al 2012 shi and wang 2021 non parametric approaches encompass data driven machine learning approaches such as kernel smoothing e g long et al 2016 quantile regression forests e g bhuiyan et al 2018 random forest e g baez villanueva et al 2020 and artificial neural networks e g hong et al 2021 among such approaches bayesian model averaging bma recently emerged and proved to be reliable robust and stable in its performance see ma et al 2021 yumnam et al 2022 the bma approach applies an optimal weightage for individual sre products by simultaneously computing weightages at each time step and location of gauging stations hu et al 2019 and ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 provide detailed descriptions of the differences between blending approaches studies that focused on blending rainfall products have exhibited several shortcomings related to their methods materials and outcomes studies often used sre products with relatively coarse spatial i e usually 0 1 0 1 0 25 0 25 e g kumar et al 2019 or temporal i e usually monthly e g woldemeskel et al 2013 chua et al 2022 resolutions to produce blended rainfall product at similar coarser resolutions for a period of a shorter span from 1 to 5years see zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 evaluation of blended rainfall products often has been at large river basins or international boundaries having an area of half a million km2 and beyond e g shen et al 2019 rahman and shang 2020 as a result blending high resolution sre products i e 0 1 0 1 at smaller spatial scales i e 2000 km2 for extended years is rare but is warranted if sres should serve local scale hydrological assessments such as flash flood hazard modelling or regional scale rainfall runoff simulations some algorithms in particular those categorized under geo statistical approaches apply static weightages that only vary with grid cells e g li and shao 2010 verdin et al 2016 reference data for some sre products that use rain gauge observations to improve the rainfall estimates rely on global gridded rainfall data from databases such as climate research unit cru and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc these databases often encompass unevenly distributed and less representative rain gauge stations across africa nikulin et al 2012 eklund et al 2016 as a result the accuracy of rainfall products that use gridded data as a reference can be lower than some individual sre products for instance chirps sre product funk et al 2015 consistently performed better than multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 rainfall product across continental africa awange et al 2019 and its river basins located in ethiopia taye et al 2020 and kenya omonge et al 2022 although there is a varying performance of sre products in capturing rainfall many studies merged a single sre product with gauged data e g teng et al 2017 lu et al 2020 rather than incorporating multiple products the overall aim of this study is to generate a high quality gridded rainfall estimation dataset to best capture spatiotemporal patterns and the magnitude of rainfall over a highly urbanized catchment to generate the dataset four sre products i e chirps cmorph persiann and tamsat were blended using the bma framework the sre products were selected because of their data accessibility over the study area at high spatial resolution i e 8 km 8 km or finer their availability at a daily time step and their long overlapping period 2003 2019 using seven statistical performance indicators this study i evaluates the quality of the blended rainfall product and individual sre products against daily gauged data that serve as a reference and ii examines the performance of rainfall estimates in representing spatial variability of monthly seasonal and annual rainfall using visual and statistical comparisons 2 study area the area of study is the akaki catchment which is located in the central part of ethiopia akaki catchment is one of the headwater catchments of the awash river basin as part of the great east african rift valley system the catchment is geographically situated between 8 76 n 9 22 n and 38 57 e 39 07 e and has an elevation that ranges between 2000 m and 3400 m fig 1 akaki catchment has a size of about 1500 km2 at the aba samuel hydropower dam which is the hydrological outlet of the catchment the catchment has a shared drainage boundary with two upland sub basins of the upper blue nile basin which are guder and muger catchments in the northwestern and northeastern parts respectively the area is targeted for this study because it has relatively good rainfall data from a network of gauging stations it constitutes complex land cover and topography and the area often experiences significant rainfall variability akaki catchment hosts addis ababa i e the capital city of ethiopia and many small agglomerated towns in addition to the urban land agriculture and forest land covers are of significant extent akaki catchment experiences a unimodal rainfall pattern with three distinct seasons mengistu et al 2019 shawul and chakma 2020 these seasons are i the short rainy season belg from february to may ii the main rainy kiremt season from june to september and iii the dry season bega from october to december and january of the subsequent year this seasonal variability is mainly governed by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz knoche et al 2014 jin et al 2021 fig 2 illustrates the three seasons using long term daily rainfall distribution at five selected stations in the catchment the outer periphery of the akaki catchment is surrounded by mountainous ridges including mount intoto in the northern mount wechecha in the western mount furi in the south western mount berek rufi in the north eastern and mount erer in south eastern directions malby et al 2007 and napoli et al 2019 describe that mountains have a palpable contribution to the formation of rainfall over a catchment by creating orographic clouds that result in frequent rainfall as a result stations located nearby the mountain chains located in the north i e mount intoto and berek received the highest annual rainfall 1100 1250 mm the lower amount of annual rainfall is recorded i e 670 900 mm at the stations in the southern part of the catchment which mainly is characterized by flat topography at lower elevations in general the spatial rainfall pattern over the akaki catchment is topography related and gradually decreases from the mountainous areas in the northern part of the catchment to the low lying and deprived area in the south as a headwater catchment the akaki river system is the main contributor to the awash river which serves irrigation activities but the river is also known to cause devastating floods two major river systems big akaki and little akaki that flow from the eastern and western escarpments of the catchment respectively originate from the mountains and flow through the akaki catchment to ultimately drain into the aba samuel hydropower reservoir three water supply reservoirs gefersa dire and legedadi are built on these river networks since the mountainous and urbanized catchment is frequently exposed to extreme rainfall events flash floods are frequent adugna et al 2019 jemberie and melesse 2021 bekele et al 2022 3 datasets 3 1 data from rainfall gauging stations in this study daily rainfall data 2003 2019 was obtained from the ethiopian meteorology institute http www ethiomet gov et which is responsible for monitoring the stations and managing the recordings the gauging network comprised twenty six stations of which thirteen were selected for further use table 1 as such thirteen stations were discarded because of their short recording span or a high number of missing values among the selected stations two i e cno and slt are located in the upper blue nile basin and the remaining are located in the awash basin table 2 shows the location coordinates and elevation of the selected stations with their corresponding name and distinct identifier code as used in this study missing data for all stations is less than 17 except for sdf since the sdf station is the only station that captured the rainfall near the mountain range of mount berek the station is not discarded 3 2 data from satellite rainfall estimates products for this study four microwave and infrared sensor based sre products were selected table 2 three products provide satellite sensor derived estimates only and one of the products incorporates information from a low density network of rain gauges that was made available for product developers the products provide data in a range from 18 to 40 years at daily or smaller time steps with relatively high spatial resolutions of i e 8 km 8 km or finer data from 2003 to 2019 is used in this study as for this period data is available for all sre products as well as for all selected gauging stations sre products can briefly be described as follows 1 chirp stands for climate hazards

this study is illustrated in fig 3 salient steps include preprocessing datasets blending sre products and performance evaluation of the estimated rainfall dataset over the akaki catchment detailed descriptions of these steps are provided in the respective sections below 4 1 pre processing of gauged rainfall data to certify the reliability and usability of the data gauged daily rainfall data from thirteen stations were tested for consistency and possible errors for each month a box and whisker plot served to statistically identify outliers using daily rainfall data from thirteen stations fig 4 while the boxes represented quartiles 25 and 75 percentiles and median 50 percentile the whiskers above the 75th i e upper whisker or below 25th i e lower whisker percentiles indicated values within 1 5 times of the inter quartile range in this study rainfall recordings that are lower than the lower whiskers i e 0 5 mm were ignored because of their irrelevance to the research aims of this study recordings higher than the upper whiskers were only nine in number and occurred at few stations after visual inspection these recordings were excluded for further analysis as the values may result from an erroneous recording by observers or by typing errors during digitization time series of gauged data also were evaluated by applying tests for homogeneity and stationarity to verify the existence of break points and abrupt changes respectively a homogeneity test served to identify station data with long term systematic shifts due to factors such as relocation of the gauging site and changes in measuring instrument and technique of measurement this test was performed using the transpmfred algorithm as implemented in the r environment based rhtests package wang and feng 2013 with 95 nominal level of confidence the result showed that daily rainfall time series at twelve stations have no or insignificant change points and thus the data is considered homogeneous time series at one of the stations i e cno shows a significant shift that was corrected using the quantile matching adjustments method available within the rhtests package stationarity of the data at all stations is verified by widely used augmented dickey fuller adf and phillips perron pp unit root tests in the r environment as suggested by longman et al 2020 missing values within the quality controlled rainfall data were filled in before interpolation using the daily time scale based linear regression lr method see annex 1 the method is selected as the interstation distances are relatively short in the small scale akaki catchment 4 2 pre processing of sre products the sre products used in this study were available at various time intervals i e half hourly to daily spatial resolutions i e 0 0375 0 0727 and file formats i e binary and netcdf to ensure the blending of the datasets each file was decompressed and different preprocessing stages were implemented in sequence the salient stages included format conversion aggregation of data to daily time step and clipping to the study domain finally all the datasets were re gridded into a unified spatial resolution of 0 0375 0 0375 4 km 4 km using the most commonly applied bilinear interpolation operator e g yang et al 2020 tadesse et al 2022 so that the resolution matches with the resolution of tamsat and persiann products all pre processing stages were conducted using linux machine based climate data operator cdo schulzweida 2020 and netcdf operator nco zender 2008 tools these tools were developed at the max planck institute for meteorology and the university of california respectively 4 3 dynamic bayesian model averaging bma for blending sre products with observed rainfall data a bma model raftery et al 2005 sloughter et al 2007 with space and time varying weightages was implemented in this study in this bayes theorem based blending approach the four sre products are independent and competing prediction members the weightage for sre product members is determined according to their relative contribution to predictive skill while using rain gauge sample training data corresponding to a certain predefined training window vrugt et al 2008 fraley et al 2010 steps involved in the determination of the weightages are i specify parameters such as number of iterations number of non zero observations convergence tolerance and power to transform data and ii determine weightages by introducing the time series data of input variables i e sre products control parameters and training window into the blending algorithm having gamma modeling function that considers the probability of zero rainfall the algorithm accounts for three variables that are i a dependent variable to be blended i e rainfall ii the corresponding observed rainfall data gauge rainfall with t recording period g y 1 y 2 y t and iii k number of sre products i e four in this study derived ensemble s s 1 s 2 s k based on the law of total probability the expression of the bma predictive probability density function pdf for generating blended rainfall data y reads p y g k 1 k p s k g p y s k g where p s k g is a posterior probability likelihood of the ensemble member sre and p y s k g is the posterior distribution of the blended rainfall data y generated member s k and the gauged training data g the first term is also known as a fractional statistical weightage w k that shows how well the member matches with the gauge and the sum of these weightages is equal to 1 in this study the expectation maximization em algorithm is used for automated optimal weightage iteration ma et al 2018a defining a training window with an optimum length of days and selecting a training dataset is critical to train the bma model with the objective of error reduction as a result of optimized weightages fang and li 2016 qi et al 2019 however the process of determining the optimum length of a training window is not straightforward as there are no standard requirements for the selection courtney et al 2013 also window length may change subject to the type of predictive variables study area liu xie 2014 and objective functions used for training for this study the window is determined by examining the sensitivity of nineteen model training windows that range in length from 10 to 100 days with discrete time increments of 5 days five stations that are well distributed in the catchment i e aab cfd drl int and sbt were selected as training sites to ensure the robustness and representativeness of respective training windows across different locations in addition considering their largest number of rainy days four non consecutive and wettest years over the catchment i e 2004 2006 2010 and 2013 were identified as periods for training to test the training windows for different climatic periods and rain distributions among the tested training windows the one that satisfies the following three criteria was selected these include i yielding minimal error as measured using objective functions ii showing insignificant error difference with its neighboring training windows i e an indication for stability with the change in training window and iii the window should be as short as possible shorter training windows are considered to reduce the loss of information that occurs due to rapid temporal changes in the pattern and regime of rainfall berrocal et al 2008 while longer training windows contain more data to better estimate bma parameters but series may not be appropriate to cope when regime of rainfall changes rapidly raftery et al 2005 after setting the length of the training window the bma weightages of the four sre products were computed at the location of each gauging station for the entire study period when at least two satellites recorded a rainfall event as such if there is a training window t with a length of 1st to the nth number of days then the weightage for the day n 1st is first determined using gauged rainfall data recorded during t n number of days for computing n 2nd daily weightage the rainfall data of the t 1st is inactivated and replaced by the data of t 2nd and the training window t spans from t 2nd to t n 1st fig 5 the process recursively goes forward by generating dynamic weightages until the end of the study period the daily optimal weightages generated at each of the stations were subsequently interpolated over the study area by applying a universal coordinate system i e world geodetic system 1984 wgs84 and universal transverse mercator utm zone 37 n https epsg io 32637 and normalized so that the sum equals one interpolation of the daily weightages data was conducted at a spatial resolution that unifies all sre products i e 4 km 4 km using the inverse distance weighting idw method the underlying principle of the method is that observations o at closer stations have a higher contribution to the estimation of interpolated values i than observations from more remote stations idw equation reads i i i 1 n 1 d i p o i i 1 n 1 d i p where d i is the euclidean distance between the location of gauge i and the ungauged grid point p is the distance weighting power i e 2 in this study and n is the number of gauging stations to generate a blended daily rainfall data estimate at each of the grid elements that cover the study area weightages are tied to their corresponding sre products hereafter this blended rainfall product is labeled as tam perchimor which stands for either the first or middle three consecutive letters of the individual sre products by ordering them based on their original spatial resolution from finer to coarser see table 2 in addition a hyphen is inserted to differentiate the satellite gauge tamsat product from the satellite only products i e persiann chirp and cmorph 4 4 performance assessment to examine the performance of the blended rainfall product as compared to the individual sre products point to pixel comparison and cross validation performance assessment approaches were implemented in the point to pixel comparison approach the average error of estimated rainfall datasets was defined by comparing sre products derived pixel values against gauged data recorded at the same geographic locations with the assumption of the recorded point time series data are reference observations for the counterpart pixels of the sre products to examine the performance of rainfall estimates at ungauged grid points the leave one out cross validation loocv technique is selected e g cai et al 2019 ossa moreno et al 2019 in loocv sre products based daily time series of one station is excluded by assuming it as un gauged in this study rainfall at the location of the excluded station is estimated by the idw interpolation technique using daily rainfall from the remaining twelve stations this procedure is repeated for all thirteen stations so the time series of each station is sequentially excluded from the analysis the accuracy of the interpolated daily time series for the excluded stations is assessed using different performance indicators by using the counterpart observed rain gauge data as a reference results of the performance evaluation approaches are presented using seven statistical performance indicators table 3 these include mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge and pearson s correlation coefficient cc different statistical indicators were considered to examine the performance of rainfall estimates based on their associated error that were measured from different perspectives analysis of these performance indicators is conducted using hydrogof package in the r environment to assess the space and time difference between the observed and estimated rainfall gridded maps are created at annual seasonal and monthly time steps at each grid cell of the entire catchment residual differences are computed by deducing the gridded sre products from the counterpart idw interpolated rain gauge data lastly for each time step and rainfall estimate bar plots are produced to show the magnitude and distribution of the residual differences by assigning the magnitude of residual difference in the abscissa x axis and the respective number of grid cells in the ordinate y axis in addition the mean of residual difference mrd is determined for each time step and rainfall estimate by dividing the total residual difference by the total number of grids this is to show how far the overall averaged residual difference deviated from the targeted zero difference 5 results 5 1 length of training window determining the length of a training window is critical and marks the initial step to defining the parameters of the bma algorithm these parameters involve the weightages for each sre product in this study to identify the optimum bma training window nineteen training windows are evaluated for four wettest years i e 2004 2006 2010 and 2013 and for five gauging stations i e aab cfd drl int and sbt that are distributed across the study area results of the evaluation of the training windows as obtained from three commonly used objective functions i e mae rmse and mbe willmott and matsuura 2006 are illustrated using box and whisker plots fig 6 the box and whisker plots are based on twenty data from four training periods i e the wettest years and five calibration sites i e the gauging stations mae and rmse show the magnitude of the mean error whereas mbe indicates the direction of the error bias in terms of underestimation and overestimation box whisker plots for each of the three objective functions differ in box size and distribution and thus indicate the effect of increment in the length of training windows from 10 days to 100 days the median of the plots exhibited a non consistent pattern for the shorter training windows i e less than 30 days which is caused by the high rainfall variability the median of the objective functions shows a smooth transition for medium and large training windows i e greater than 30 days and that reveals less attribution of rainfall variability with transition in the training data of consecutive training windows as the length of the training window increases the median for mae and rmse shows a gradually decaying smooth pattern however median values for mbe follow an overall increasing pattern with the length of the training window both the overall increasing i e for mae and rmse and decreasing patterns i e for mbe are pointed toward the desired value of each objective function i e zero this indicated that there is an overall error reduction in response to the increment in the length of the training window that occurs due to enlargement in the sample size of training data the difference in the interquartile range i e the length of boxes of the three objective functions is another important feature of the plots that can be attributed to the variability of data values mae and rmse show boxes of shorter length but relatively larger value ranges for rmse that can be attributed to the effect of squaring that assigns larger weight values when errors increase in contrast mbe exhibits boxes of longer length due to the expected range of variability between inconsistent overestimations and underestimations across different years of the training period and the location of gauging stations the shortest and most stable training windows appeared from 35 to 45 days and 40 50 days at the median of mae and rmse respectively this shows that windows of 40 and 45 days are consistently stable in terms of both objective functions for the two periods 45 days showed better performance in terms of mbe and thus 45 days is selected as the optimum training window for this study here the error may reduce even further if a training window of longer than 60 days was selected however it compromises the aim of this study that blending results should not be provided for too long windows because that obstructs the ability of the bma model to detect rapid changes in the occurrence of rainfall over a relatively small area of the akaki catchment the selected 45 days training window well harmonized with the range of training windows of 30 55 days that were reported by ji et al 2019 rahman et al 2020a and yin et al 2021 5 2 spatial and temporal pattern of weightages in bma approaches weightages are assigned based on the performance of respective sre products in reference to the gauged data therefore weightages directly indicate the relative contribution of each sre product to the blended rainfall estimate and predictive skill of the approach fig 7 illustrates the intra annual variability of daily accumulated fractional weightages for the four sre products and daily rainfall data the rainfall data was gauged at five well distributed stations during the wettest year i e 2010 over the catchment in all plots weightage of sre products corresponding to stations from similar topographic settings follows a similar pattern this may be attributed to the true rainfall pattern over the study area that is influenced by catchment orography due to the presence of mountain ranges i e mount intoto and mount berek at the northern and northwestern parts of the catchment as a result stations in highly elevated areas i e aab and int received a higher amount of rainfall however a lower amount of rainfall was recorded at drl and cfd stations that are located in the lowland plain areas at the south and southeastern part of the catchment including the outlet of the akaki river exceptionally the remaining selected stations i e sbt exhibit a unique property that follows patterns of stations at higher mountains and in lowland areas during different seasons this may be attributed to transitioning topography from high to low altitude that received moderate rainfall amount during the main rainy season that stretches from june september the weightage of tamsat exceeds that of other sre products at all stations excluding the station that received the lowest rainfall i e drl the dominance of tamsat weightage slightly changed as the season advanced towards august and september due to an increased weightage of persiann particularly at drl and sbt stations regardless of the space and time the weightage of chirp product shows an inverse relation with the amount of rainfall by showing a decreasing trend as the rainfall increases this indicates a notable performance of chirp in capturing a lower amount of rainfall events opposing this weightage of tamsat is higher with the magnitude of rainfall events but still holds the major contribution at a few stations i e aab and int during the period of no lower amount of rainfall events during the dry season that stretches from october to january the contribution of cmorph is dominant at low and moderate rainfall receiving stations cfd drl and sbt at the other stations aab and int weightage of tamsat dominated other sre products in both situations when cmorph and tamsat interchangeably exhibit higher weightage at different locations chirp consistently held most of the remaining weightage by jointly sharing the weightage accumulation with cmorph and tamsat significant weightage of persiann is noticeable at most of the stations during the periods of intermittent rainfall events which often occurred in the short rainy season i e february to may in the elevated area at the central and northern part of the catchment the highest weightage of the sre products varied with topography during the dry season the weightage of chirp and tamsat was highest in elevated areas at the central i e aab and the north i e int parts of the catchment respectively in general the sre products show large variability in weightage for all seasons and stations that results from varying performance of sre products across time and space therefore this finding emphasizes the necessity and signifies blending several products for improving the quality of rainfall estimates 5 3 comparison of satellite and blended rainfall in fig 8 scatterplots and the counterpart correlation coefficients are used to quantitatively illustrate agreement between the gridded estimated rainfall and measured rain gauge data here the blended rainfall product and four sre products are compared against the observed daily rainfall data 2003 2019 at aab cfd drl int and sbt gauging stations in most of the sub plots highly correlated data points are shown in the range of moderate rainfall intensities i e 5 20 mm day zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 this indicates that sre products and the blended rainfall product well captured light rainfall the highest correlation coefficients i e 0 46 0 53 and dense data points are observed near the 1 1 best fitting line at aab int and sbt stations particularly for the blended rainfall product but also for chirp and tamsat products unlikely for cfd and drl stations data points show that scatter and correlation coefficients are lower than any other data pair in particular the correlation coefficient at the drl station for all rainfall estimates i e 0 21 0 28 is lower by approximately half when compared to other stations this illustrates that the blended and individual rainfall estimates were promising in capturing rainfall amounts over a mountainous area but only poorly estimated rainfall at the lower elevation of the akaki catchment data points of cmorph and persiann products were highly dispersed and their correlation coefficient was low i e 0 35 0 41 across aab cfd and sbt gauging stations at stations located in the highland i e int 0 39 and 0 43 and lowland drl 0 23 and 0 21 good and poor results are noticeable respectively overall cmorph and persiann products performed less than chirp and tamsat products the result from pearson s correlation coefficient shows that the blended rainfall product surpassed the satellite only products i e chirp cmorph and persiann but coefficients are comparable with the satellite gauge product i e tamsat the higher correlation coefficient attained by tamsat product is attributed to the higher number of gauging stations that are used to develop the product for central parts of ethiopia tarnavsky et al 2014 which includes the area of the akaki catchment other studies also show good performance of tamsat over ethiopia e g young et al 2014 fenta et al 2018 dinku et al 2018 although a correlation coefficient is a useful performance indicator it only reveals a result about linearity between the observed and estimated rainfall therefore further analysis was performed that aimed at validation of the blended rainfall product and the individual sre products table 4 two approaches i e point to pixel and loocv and six performance indicators were applied using daily data 2003 2019 from the five stations as a reference the six statistical indicators were selected to measure average error i e mae and rmse to indicate over underestimation mbe and pbias and to describe the extent of agreement between the gauged and estimated rainfall nse and kge based on point to pixel and loocv based comparisons the error of rainfall estimation is reduced see mae and rmse and the extent of agreement has improved see nse and kge in blended rainfall product as compared to the individual sre products table 4 see green cells according to the result from point to pixel based error indices the blended rainfall product reduced i mae of chirp cmorph persiann and tamsat by 88 146 40 and 102 mm year respectively and ii rmse by 66 343 361 and 274 mm year respectively based on loocv based assessment the blended rainfall product shows error reduction in terms of i mae of chirp cmorph persiann and tamsat by 128 336 4 and 102 mm year respectively and ii rmse by 197 482 259 and 325 mm year respectively similarly the extent of agreement between the gauged data and the blended data significantly improved over the individual sre products with exception of tamsat opposing other satellite only products the value of nse and kge for the satellite gauge tamsat exhibited a close performance as the blended rainfall product table 4 see blue cells in terms of the direction of bias only persiann distinctively underestimated observed rainfall table 4 see orange cells in contrast the blended rainfall product and the remaining individual sre products overestimate the observed rainfall amount over the akaki catchment overall cmorph and persiann performed the least whereas tamsat and chirp exhibited better performance this finding well complies with other studies conducted in awash river basin ethiopia and east africa at large e g young et al 2014 bayissa et al 2017 dinku et al 2018 fenta et al 2018 mekonnen et al 2021 the main conclusion is that the blended rainfall product shows significant improvement over the individual satellite products 5 4 wet season based comparison of rainfall datasets the main rainy season of the akaki catchment extends from june to september with substantial differences in rainfall recorded across the gauging station the starting june and ending september months are characterized by moderate rainfall whereas july and august commonly experience a higher intensity and a large amount of accumulated rainfall fig 9 shows box and whisker plots that incorporate data from the blended and individual sre products with the daily rainfall recorded at aab cfd drl int and sbt gauging stations for the main rainy seasons 2003 2019 all rainfall products similarly mimicked the pattern of observed rainfall by attaining smaller and higher amounts of rainfall during the outward june and september and middle months july and august respectively in the first consecutive three months of the main rainy season cmorph and persiann consistently underestimated the median amount of daily rainfall in september cmorph slightly overestimated the median of daily rainfall recorded during the specified month but persiann uninterruptedly underestimated the median daily rainfall regardless of location and month across the main rainy season and at many gauging stations the blended rainfall product tamsat and chirp overestimated the gauged median daily rainfall particularly in the middle two months during the outward months the order of overestimation changed to blended chirp and tamsat at many of the stations the blended rainfall product and tamsat have shown similar medians in september in similar tamsat and chirp exhibited an equivalent median of daily rainfall in august the length of boxes in the plot i e inter quartile range shows the variation for the sample of observed data box length deviations of the four sre products from the gauged data are smaller during the middle two months as compared to larger differences for the first and last month during the entire main rainy season persiann and tamsat consistently showed tangible underestimation and overestimation of rainfall amounts respectively the remaining individual sre products i e chirp and cmorph showed an overestimation but with a smaller margin in particular the blended rainfall product fairly captured the inter quartile range of the gauged data and thus outperformed the individual sre products the occurrence of very high daily rainfall is represented by the upper whisker in all sub plots cmorph and persiann have shown low to high underestimation of heavy rainfall across all locations and datasets with exception of an overestimation that occurred at sbt and drl for july and september respectively tamsat consistently overestimated observed data as its upper whisker is consistently higher but shows an underestimation at int station particularly in june and july a slight underestimation of chirp and the blended rainfall product was noticed at cfd and drl stations during the first two months of the main rainy season june and july and later changed to an overestimation for august and september in addition during the last two months the rainfall products consistently show smaller underestimation at aab and int stations but overestimated the observed heavy rainfall at cfd drl and sbt stations overall the blended rainfall product showed a significant improvement over the individual sre products in capturing both median and very high daily rainfall during the main rainy season among the individual sre products cmorph and chirp performed relatively well in capturing median and very high daily rainfall during the main rainy season respectively 5 5 spatial variability of rainfall datasets fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of seasonally categorized mean monthly rainfall 2003 2019 over the akaki catchment for gauge observations the blended rainfall product and individual sre products during months of the dry and short rainy seasons the spatial pattern of gauge based rainfall over the study area exhibited relatively less variability and uniform distribution across the catchment this spatial pattern of mean monthly rainfall is well captured by the individual sre products and the blended dataset because satellites are often able to easily estimate no low rainfall amounts which are mostly expected to occur during these seasons in contrast to the considered rainfall estimates only cmorph highly overestimated mean monthly rainfall during these seasons at the western part of akaki catchment during the main rainy season the gauge based spatial rainfall pattern over the study area exhibited a rainfall decrement from the mountainous parts of the catchment in the northwestern parts to the low lying areas in the southeastern parts of the catchment this decreasing rainfall trend was shown by the blended rainfall product as well as the individual sre products but was relatively better captured by the blended rainfall product and cmorph compared to the observed mean monthly rainfall persiann showed high underestimation across many grid elements with exception of a few grids in the south in this less rainfall receiving part of the catchment persiann and cmorph well captured the observed mean monthly rainfall the remaining sre products i e chirp and tamsat showed a good performance in the northwestern part of the catchment but with a slight overestimation of mean monthly rainfall in other parts of the catchment in general the significant bias of the rainfall product prominently occurred during the main rainy season as compared to the dry or short rainy seasons of the catchment this implies the estimation of rainfall during the main rainy season is associated with higher uncertainty because of difficulties to capture extreme rainfall events which prominently occurred during this season all sre products and the blended rainfall product show significant spatial variability and are better performed over the northwestern than the southeastern part of the catchment for mean monthly rainfall particularly during the main rainy season the northwestern part is mainly characterized by mountainous ridges dominated by urban and forest and receives a higher amount of rainfall and season when compared to the flat plain areas at the southeastern of the study area therefore it can be concluded that the rainfall estimates were good at capturing rainfall over mountainous areas over the central area which mainly encompasses addis ababa city the mean monthly rainfall during the main rainy season was well captured by all rainfall products but was highly underestimated by persiann these results show that the blended rainfall product provided more reliable spatial precipitation estimates in many parts of the catchment and across various temporal scales by capturing both the spatial variability and the amount of observed rainfall 5 6 spatial difference of observed and estimated rainfall fig 11 illustrates the residual difference between the satellite based rainfall products and spatially interpolated gauged rainfall differences are indicated as spatially distributed residual differences of rainfall at monthly seasonal and annual time scales in the first column a residual difference of gridded mean monthly rainfall data is represented for each sre product and the blended dataset in this column of bar plots the residuals for the considered rainfall estimates are more concentrated near the targeted zero value but the mean of the residuals is slightly different the mean of residual difference mrd for monthly chirp and tamsat is 9 8 and 13 3 mm respectively which is negative and shows an underestimation in contrast persiann overestimated the interpolated observed rainfall data with the mrd of 19 9 mm although mrd for cmorph is 1 1 mm which nearly overlapped the targeted zero difference the result was achieved by equating the number of overestimated grid cells with several underestimated grid cells in the case of the blended dataset the distribution of residual differences is nearly flat the mean residual nearly matched the zero difference with mrd of 1 5 mm and the bars are relatively short that revealing the presence of a low number of grid cells for the respective value of residual differences the second column of bar plots shows the distribution of residual difference from gridded mean seasonal rainfall which was estimated using individual sre products and the blended dataset except for cmorph the distribution of residual difference for the remaining rainfall estimates is nearly flat with a symmetrical distribution of bars in the regions of overestimation and underestimation in this column the position of mrd with respect to the targeted zero difference for all rainfall estimates exhibits similarity trend as the mrd in the monthly column as indicated above the third column of bar plots shows the distribution of residuals from spatially distributed mean annual rainfall during the study period 2003 2019 the plots dominantly indicate a concentrated distribution of the residuals for all rainfall estimates while the distribution is skewed towards underestimation for chirp and tamsat the distribution is skewed to the region of overestimation in the case of cmorph and persiann for the blended dataset the mrd approached the target zero difference more than all individual sre products without notably skewing towards overestimation or underestimation residuals in general the blended dataset brought an improvement by significantly reducing the residual difference when compared to the individual sre products at all the evaluated time scales i e monthly seasonal and annual 6 discussion this study is one of the first to test and evaluate the blending of high resolution satellite products for an urbanized catchment with complex topography as a result comparing the findings of this study with others is challenging by the lack of comparative studies however there are few studies on a larger spatial domain that engulf the akaki catchment these are the awash river basin e g hirpa et al 2010 romilly and gebremichael 2011 adane et al 2021 and the upper awash sub basin e g mekonnen et al 2021 in addition since the akaki catchment is geographically located in the central part of ethiopia where the awash and the blue nile basin intersect areas within both river basins share similar characteristics by experiencing high rainfall and constituting complex topography romilly and gebremichael 2011 therefore the findings of this study are further discussed with reference to these studies in this study the effect of topographic variation on the performance of the rainfall estimates is demonstrated both the blended and the four individual sre products relatively performed better in capturing rainfall at the mountainous highland areas in the north than the rainfall over the lowland parts in the south of the akaki catchment the results of studies previously conducted in awash and upper blue nile basins strongly abide by this finding e g romilly and gebremichael 2011 abera et al 2016 belay et al 2019 mekonnen et al 2021 according to gebremichael et al 2014 and young et al 2014 a such strong influence of topographic variation on the performance of sre products is probably related to the efficiency of signal retrieval algorithm in detecting various processes in the rainfall formation systems over different topographic settings however there is a paradoxical result reported by fenta et al 2018 showing better performance of sre products in the lowlands than over the highlands as indicated by wedajo et al 2021 this likely can be attributed to the difference in topographic land cover and climatic conditions between the study areas the four individual high resolution sre products i e tamsat chirp persiann and cmorph considered in this study performed differently particularly most of the sre products including tamsat chirp and cmorph showed an overall overestimation of rainfall over the akaki catchment similarly wedajo et al 2021 compared four products i e chirps imerg trmm and tamsat for an area in the upper blue nile basin and also revealed an overestimation of the products opposingly persiann is the only product that underestimates the rainfall over the akaki catchment such results can be found in studies conducted for the awash and upper blue nile basins by hirpa et al 2010 and romilly and gebremichael 2011 respectively among the products tamsat showed a surpassing strength in better capturing the spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall over the akaki catchment in similar the outstanding performance of tamsat over different parts of ethiopia is shown young et al 2014 dinku et al 2018 mekonnen et al 2021 the high number of gauging stations used from the central part of ethiopia and the efficiency of a deployed algorithm i e apply geographically varying local calibration for developing tamsat contributed to its good performance greatre et al 2014 fenta et al 2018 dinku et al 2018 next to tamsat also chirp performed well in capturing rainfall over akaki catchment similar to the finding of this study other studies also reported comparable performance of tamsat to chirp fenta et al 2018 tadesse et al 2022 belete et al 2020 also showed similar performance but in that study chirps slightly performed better than tamsat according to dinku et al 2018 the close performance of the two products likely occurred because they shared the same dataset for bias correction i e chpclim and their difference emerged due to the algorithm difference used in the product development in contrast to the best sre products for the akaki catchment persiann exhibited the weakest performance in estimating rainfall over the study area other studies also depicted poor performance of the product over the regions of the upper blue nile basin bitew and gebremichael 2011 bayissa et al 2017 compared to persiann cmorph performed better in estimating rainfall over the akaki catchment and bartsotas et al 2018 also reported this in their study conducted over the subtropical area of blue nile overall the salient findings from the performance evaluation of the individual sre products strongly agree with studies conducted over nearby regions the most important finding of the current study is that bma resulted in an improved blended rainfall product few other studies at large scale regions in china and pakistan e g ma et al 2018b rahman et al 2020b yin et al 2021 li et al 2021 also indicated the favorable performance of blending as compared to single products further testing of bma as applied in this study in smaller catchments of different regions is highly recommended to improve the spatiotemporal quality of rainfall estimates this study also advocates further enriching the blending algorithm by developing more effective methodologies 7 conclusion this study successfully tested bayesian model averaging bma to develop a high quality blended rainfall dataset 2003 2019 using four high resolution sre products chirp cmorph persiann and tamsat the data set at daily time step is prepared for a highly urbanized 1500 km2 catchment in ethiopia the catchment experiences significant annual rainfall variability 670 1250 mm for blending bma derived weightages were generated at daily time steps and intertwined with their sre products daily wet season and mean annual rainfall performance evaluations were conducted for the blended rainfall product and the individual sre products that were intercompared and referenced to recorded rain gauge data the main conclusions are time series patterns of bma derived weightages for each sre product show large variability weightages of tamsat and chirp were consistently dominant across the rain gauge locations for periods of heavy and light rainfall respectively analysis of weightages of individual sre products during the dry season shows that weightages can be related to the topography of the catchment for the mountainous plane and low lying areas where tamsat chirp and cmorph show the highest weights respectively this indicates the nonexistence of outperforming individual rainfall products and signifies the need to evaluate the blending of several products for optimal utilization of each product findings reveal that i the quality of the blended rainfall dataset significantly improved when compared to the individual sre products ii the satellite gauge product i e tamsat showed comparable performance with the blended rainfall product iii except for persiann that underestimated the gauged rainfall the remaining sre products show overestimation and iv cmorph and persiann performed the least whereas tamsat and chirp showed good performance in capturing daily rainfall over akaki catchment assessment from spatial variability of mean annual and wet season rainfall indicated that the blended rainfall product and cmorph well captured observed rainfall across the catchment but the remaining individual sre products showed less spatial variability in terms of rainfall amount the blended rainfall product well matched the gauged data in many parts of the catchment including the mountainous areas in the northern part of the catchment assessing the spatially distributed residual difference between the interpolated rain gauge data and sre products showed that the blended rainfall product significantly reduced the residual difference at monthly seasonal and annual time scales the distribution of residual difference for the blended product is nearly flat the mean of residuals highly approached the targeted zero difference and the number of a grid cell for the respective value of residual differences is relatively smaller when compared to the individual sre products overall none of the individual satellite products outperformed the other individual products in capturing various aspects of the gauged rainfall data however the blended product outperformed the other products in many aspects this indicates that rainfall estimation largely improved from blending multiple satellite products that result in higher quality rainfall representations by improved matching to rain gauge rainfall credit authorship contribution

7748,study region akaki is a headwater catchment of awash river basin that hosts the capital city of ethiopia addis ababa the area encompasses several agglomerated towns water supply and hydropower reservoirs and is characterized by a chain of mountains and floodplains due to basin rainfall and the expansion of urbanized areas the catchment is frequently affected by flooding study focus this study evaluates dynamic bayesian model averaging bma approach to improve rainfall estimation over the catchment by blending four high resolution satellite rainfall estimate sre products using daily data 2003 2019 observed at thirteen stations as a reference seven statistical metrics served to assess the point and spatial scale accuracy of the rainfall estimates new hydrological insights main findings from this study are i the blended product outperformed the individual sre products by notably improving correlation with in situ observed rainfall and reducing the error of the estimated rainfall ii the blended and individual sre products performed better in the highlands than the lowlands of the catchment and iii the amount of daily rainfall during the main rainy season was mostly overestimated by the individual sre products but was fairly estimated by the blended product this study showed the nonexistence of surpassing individual sre products and emphasized the blending of several products for gaining optimal results from each product graphical abstract ga1 keywords satellite rainfall estimates bayesian model averaging blending urban catchment evaluation of precipitation awash river basin akaki catchment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction quality of rainfall data in terms of accuracy and reliability plays an important role in water climate and environmental studies and applications across africa in particular access to quality data is challenging mainly due to a lack of support i e technical financial and administrative and political instabilities world bank 2012 wmo 2020 that often cause disruptions in the collection of data over the past three decades the number of rain gauge stations reduced from 50 to below 10 in the democratic republic of congo washington et al 2013 and from 400 to less than 50 in madagascar dinku 2019 even though 3000 stations are supposed to provide reliable time series across the african continent only 744 are installed and only 25 of them are up to the required standard satgé et al 2020 therefore to complement the existing rain gauge observations rainfall estimates by satellite products have been advocated as an alternative data source to fill the rainfall data gaps e g koriche and rientjes 2016 dembélé et al 2020 dosio et al 2021 the earliest studies that evaluate the performance of satellite rainfall estimate sre products over different parts of africa yielded highly discrepant outcomes across topographic settings climatic zones rainfall intensities seasons and types of sensors gebremicael et al 2019 showed that chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data exhibited adequate rainfall estimation performance over mountainous parts of northern ethiopian as compared to other products in contrast ayehu et al 2018 gebrechorkos et al 2018 and belete et al 2020 compared several products and reported good performance of chirps in different parts of eastern africa irrespective of topographic variability gebere et al 2015 compared three products and revealed the better performance of gsmap global satellite mapping of precipitation and persiann precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks in flat areas than in mountainous areas of eastern ethiopia the effect of topographic features on the performance of three sre products is reported by a study conducted in two lake catchments in the nile river basin haile et al 2013 the study revealed an underestimation of cmorph climate prediction center morphing technique and trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission products in capturing hourly rainfall over the lakes and nearby landscapes i e shores and islands whereas the products resulted in an overestimation in the case of mountainous areas ayugi et al 2019 showed that the accuracy of sre products can be related to climate zones because the study reveals the good performance of chirps persiann and arc africa rainfall climatology over arid semi arid humid and highland areas of kenya respectively according to haile et al 2010 and mekonnen et al 2021 the performance of sre products differs for respective rainfall rates the study considered seven sre products over the upper awash basin of ethiopia and showed better performance of the products in estimating rainfall rates 10 mm day than rainfall rates 10 mm day a study conducted over an arid region of egypt showed satisfactory performance of chirps in estimating rainfall at intensity 1 mm day but arc and gsmap performed well for rainfall intensity 1 mm day nashwan et al 2020 the influence of season on the accuracy of sre products is underlined in several studies a study conducted over the lake tana basin of ethiopia by fenta et al 2018 indicated the good performance of tamsat tropical applications of meteorology using satellite data and ground based observations during the main rainy season and chirps in the short rainy season as compared to the dry season gebere et al 2015 showed that persiann well captured accumulated rainfall during a dry season whereas trmm well performed during short rainy and long rainy seasons over eastern ethiopia the type of sensor is another factor that affects the performance of sre products over a specific region studies conducted in different parts of ethiopia with highland topography indicated a consistently good performance of microwave sensor based products such as cmorph and infrared sensor based products such as persiann in estimating daily rainfalls at higher and lower altitudes respectively romilly and gebremichael 2011 mekonnen et al 2021 in general this review indicates that there is no single sre product that surmounts over the other products e g maggioni et al 2016 le coz and van de giesen 2020 to overcome the limitations of using a single sre product combining information from gauged measurements and different sensors based multiple sre products has become an emerging approach which is widely known as blending e g beck et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 blending involves the optimal use of satellite sensors but also satellite rainfall products to provide optimal rainfall estimates where gauged rainfall serves as a reference to train the estimation algorithm in the process when multiple satellite rainfall products are used defining a proportional optimal and uncertainty disfavoring weightage for each sre product is essential to create a blended rainfall estimate to better match with the gauged rainfall the principle of blending is that the blended product is the outcome of the simultaneous weighing of individual sre products that attribute to the blended estimate for an optimum match with rain gauge observations for each time instant defined weights of individual sre products sum to 1 but weights may change for each time instant to seek optimum performance of the blending algorithm blending approaches can be broadly categorized under either geo statistical or non parametric geo statistical approaches consist of classical relatively simple and commonly applied merging approaches such as kriging based interpolations e g chappell et al 2013 and geographically weighted regression e g chao et al 2018 limitations of such approaches relate to their underlying assumptions that consider only stationary and gaussian type of data that is collected from well distributed and dense rain gauge networks erdin et al 2012 shi and wang 2021 non parametric approaches encompass data driven machine learning approaches such as kernel smoothing e g long et al 2016 quantile regression forests e g bhuiyan et al 2018 random forest e g baez villanueva et al 2020 and artificial neural networks e g hong et al 2021 among such approaches bayesian model averaging bma recently emerged and proved to be reliable robust and stable in its performance see ma et al 2021 yumnam et al 2022 the bma approach applies an optimal weightage for individual sre products by simultaneously computing weightages at each time step and location of gauging stations hu et al 2019 and ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 provide detailed descriptions of the differences between blending approaches studies that focused on blending rainfall products have exhibited several shortcomings related to their methods materials and outcomes studies often used sre products with relatively coarse spatial i e usually 0 1 0 1 0 25 0 25 e g kumar et al 2019 or temporal i e usually monthly e g woldemeskel et al 2013 chua et al 2022 resolutions to produce blended rainfall product at similar coarser resolutions for a period of a shorter span from 1 to 5years see zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 evaluation of blended rainfall products often has been at large river basins or international boundaries having an area of half a million km2 and beyond e g shen et al 2019 rahman and shang 2020 as a result blending high resolution sre products i e 0 1 0 1 at smaller spatial scales i e 2000 km2 for extended years is rare but is warranted if sres should serve local scale hydrological assessments such as flash flood hazard modelling or regional scale rainfall runoff simulations some algorithms in particular those categorized under geo statistical approaches apply static weightages that only vary with grid cells e g li and shao 2010 verdin et al 2016 reference data for some sre products that use rain gauge observations to improve the rainfall estimates rely on global gridded rainfall data from databases such as climate research unit cru and global precipitation climatology centre gpcc these databases often encompass unevenly distributed and less representative rain gauge stations across africa nikulin et al 2012 eklund et al 2016 as a result the accuracy of rainfall products that use gridded data as a reference can be lower than some individual sre products for instance chirps sre product funk et al 2015 consistently performed better than multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017 rainfall product across continental africa awange et al 2019 and its river basins located in ethiopia taye et al 2020 and kenya omonge et al 2022 although there is a varying performance of sre products in capturing rainfall many studies merged a single sre product with gauged data e g teng et al 2017 lu et al 2020 rather than incorporating multiple products the overall aim of this study is to generate a high quality gridded rainfall estimation dataset to best capture spatiotemporal patterns and the magnitude of rainfall over a highly urbanized catchment to generate the dataset four sre products i e chirps cmorph persiann and tamsat were blended using the bma framework the sre products were selected because of their data accessibility over the study area at high spatial resolution i e 8 km 8 km or finer their availability at a daily time step and their long overlapping period 2003 2019 using seven statistical performance indicators this study i evaluates the quality of the blended rainfall product and individual sre products against daily gauged data that serve as a reference and ii examines the performance of rainfall estimates in representing spatial variability of monthly seasonal and annual rainfall using visual and statistical comparisons 2 study area the area of study is the akaki catchment which is located in the central part of ethiopia akaki catchment is one of the headwater catchments of the awash river basin as part of the great east african rift valley system the catchment is geographically situated between 8 76 n 9 22 n and 38 57 e 39 07 e and has an elevation that ranges between 2000 m and 3400 m fig 1 akaki catchment has a size of about 1500 km2 at the aba samuel hydropower dam which is the hydrological outlet of the catchment the catchment has a shared drainage boundary with two upland sub basins of the upper blue nile basin which are guder and muger catchments in the northwestern and northeastern parts respectively the area is targeted for this study because it has relatively good rainfall data from a network of gauging stations it constitutes complex land cover and topography and the area often experiences significant rainfall variability akaki catchment hosts addis ababa i e the capital city of ethiopia and many small agglomerated towns in addition to the urban land agriculture and forest land covers are of significant extent akaki catchment experiences a unimodal rainfall pattern with three distinct seasons mengistu et al 2019 shawul and chakma 2020 these seasons are i the short rainy season belg from february to may ii the main rainy kiremt season from june to september and iii the dry season bega from october to december and january of the subsequent year this seasonal variability is mainly governed by the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz knoche et al 2014 jin et al 2021 fig 2 illustrates the three seasons using long term daily rainfall distribution at five selected stations in the catchment the outer periphery of the akaki catchment is surrounded by mountainous ridges including mount intoto in the northern mount wechecha in the western mount furi in the south western mount berek rufi in the north eastern and mount erer in south eastern directions malby et al 2007 and napoli et al 2019 describe that mountains have a palpable contribution to the formation of rainfall over a catchment by creating orographic clouds that result in frequent rainfall as a result stations located nearby the mountain chains located in the north i e mount intoto and berek received the highest annual rainfall 1100 1250 mm the lower amount of annual rainfall is recorded i e 670 900 mm at the stations in the southern part of the catchment which mainly is characterized by flat topography at lower elevations in general the spatial rainfall pattern over the akaki catchment is topography related and gradually decreases from the mountainous areas in the northern part of the catchment to the low lying and deprived area in the south as a headwater catchment the akaki river system is the main contributor to the awash river which serves irrigation activities but the river is also known to cause devastating floods two major river systems big akaki and little akaki that flow from the eastern and western escarpments of the catchment respectively originate from the mountains and flow through the akaki catchment to ultimately drain into the aba samuel hydropower reservoir three water supply reservoirs gefersa dire and legedadi are built on these river networks since the mountainous and urbanized catchment is frequently exposed to extreme rainfall events flash floods are frequent adugna et al 2019 jemberie and melesse 2021 bekele et al 2022 3 datasets 3 1 data from rainfall gauging stations in this study daily rainfall data 2003 2019 was obtained from the ethiopian meteorology institute http www ethiomet gov et which is responsible for monitoring the stations and managing the recordings the gauging network comprised twenty six stations of which thirteen were selected for further use table 1 as such thirteen stations were discarded because of their short recording span or a high number of missing values among the selected stations two i e cno and slt are located in the upper blue nile basin and the remaining are located in the awash basin table 2 shows the location coordinates and elevation of the selected stations with their corresponding name and distinct identifier code as used in this study missing data for all stations is less than 17 except for sdf since the sdf station is the only station that captured the rainfall near the mountain range of mount berek the station is not discarded 3 2 data from satellite rainfall estimates products for this study four microwave and infrared sensor based sre products were selected table 2 three products provide satellite sensor derived estimates only and one of the products incorporates information from a low density network of rain gauges that was made available for product developers the products provide data in a range from 18 to 40 years at daily or smaller time steps with relatively high spatial resolutions of i e 8 km 8 km or finer data from 2003 to 2019 is used in this study as for this period data is available for all sre products as well as for all selected gauging stations sre products can briefly be described as follows 1 chirp stands for climate hazards group infrared precipitation product that is developed by the us geological survey usgs and the climate hazards group at the university of california funk et al 2015 data sources used to provide rainfall estimates include two global geosynchronous thermal infrared satellite observations that are globally gridded satellite grisat and climate prediction center cpc datasets and the monthly precipitation climatology chpclim data the cold cloud duration ccd information based on thermal infrared data and the tmpa 3b42 precipitation data funk et al 2015 the product provides precipitation data with a precision of 0 1 mm at quasi global coverage of 50 n 50 s and the latest version version 2 of the product can be acquired from https chc ucsb edu in netcdf file format 2 cmorph stands for climate prediction center morphing technique product that is provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa this product used passive micro wave from the sensors of multiple low orbit satellites for estimating precipitation joyce et al 2004 infrared radiation ir observations from multiple geostationary satellites are only used for interpolating rainfall intensity fields from consecutive microwave sensor data but are not applied in the process of estimating the rainfall cmorph precipitation product has quasi global coverage of 60 n 60 s and can be obtained from https www cpc ncep noaa gov in binary bz2 and control ctl file formats with 0 01 mm significance 3 persiann ccs hereinafter used as persiann is an infrared radiation based satellite rainfall estimate product with a full nomenclature of precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann cloud classification system ccs hong et al 2007 cloud imageries collected from several infrared geostationary satellites are used to develop the product by relating cloud top brightness temperature with rainfall rates the product is available with 1 mm precision for the areas between 60 n and 60 s and can be accessed from http chrs web uci edu in netcdf file format 4 tamsat stands for tropical applications of meteorology using satellite which is a rainfall estimate product over africa developed by the university of reading tarnavsky et al 2014 the product is developed by considering meteosat thermal infrared images derived from cold cloud top temperatures for identifying rain inducing clouds and observed stations data are used for the calibration of the tamsat rainfall estimation algorithm maidment et al 2017 a recent version of the product i e tamsat v3 1 is available with a precision of 0 1 mm on https www tamsat org uk in the netcdf file format that is used in this study 4 methodology the methodological approach adopted in this study is illustrated in fig 3 salient steps include preprocessing datasets blending sre products and performance evaluation of the estimated rainfall dataset over the akaki catchment detailed descriptions of these steps are provided in the respective sections below 4 1 pre processing of gauged rainfall data to certify the reliability and usability of the data gauged daily rainfall data from thirteen stations were tested for consistency and possible errors for each month a box and whisker plot served to statistically identify outliers using daily rainfall data from thirteen stations fig 4 while the boxes represented quartiles 25 and 75 percentiles and median 50 percentile the whiskers above the 75th i e upper whisker or below 25th i e lower whisker percentiles indicated values within 1 5 times of the inter quartile range in this study rainfall recordings that are lower than the lower whiskers i e 0 5 mm were ignored because of their irrelevance to the research aims of this study recordings higher than the upper whiskers were only nine in number and occurred at few stations after visual inspection these recordings were excluded for further analysis as the values may result from an erroneous recording by observers or by typing errors during digitization time series of gauged data also were evaluated by applying tests for homogeneity and stationarity to verify the existence of break points and abrupt changes respectively a homogeneity test served to identify station data with long term systematic shifts due to factors such as relocation of the gauging site and changes in measuring instrument and technique of measurement this test was performed using the transpmfred algorithm as implemented in the r environment based rhtests package wang and feng 2013 with 95 nominal level of confidence the result showed that daily rainfall time series at twelve stations have no or insignificant change points and thus the data is considered homogeneous time series at one of the stations i e cno shows a significant shift that was corrected using the quantile matching adjustments method available within the rhtests package stationarity of the data at all stations is verified by widely used augmented dickey fuller adf and phillips perron pp unit root tests in the r environment as suggested by longman et al 2020 missing values within the quality controlled rainfall data were filled in before interpolation using the daily time scale based linear regression lr method see annex 1 the method is selected as the interstation distances are relatively short in the small scale akaki catchment 4 2 pre processing of sre products the sre products used in this study were available at various time intervals i e half hourly to daily spatial resolutions i e 0 0375 0 0727 and file formats i e binary and netcdf to ensure the blending of the datasets each file was decompressed and different preprocessing stages were implemented in sequence the salient stages included format conversion aggregation of data to daily time step and clipping to the study domain finally all the datasets were re gridded into a unified spatial resolution of 0 0375 0 0375 4 km 4 km using the most commonly applied bilinear interpolation operator e g yang et al 2020 tadesse et al 2022 so that the resolution matches with the resolution of tamsat and persiann products all pre processing stages were conducted using linux machine based climate data operator cdo schulzweida 2020 and netcdf operator nco zender 2008 tools these tools were developed at the max planck institute for meteorology and the university of california respectively 4 3 dynamic bayesian model averaging bma for blending sre products with observed rainfall data a bma model raftery et al 2005 sloughter et al 2007 with space and time varying weightages was implemented in this study in this bayes theorem based blending approach the four sre products are independent and competing prediction members the weightage for sre product members is determined according to their relative contribution to predictive skill while using rain gauge sample training data corresponding to a certain predefined training window vrugt et al 2008 fraley et al 2010 steps involved in the determination of the weightages are i specify parameters such as number of iterations number of non zero observations convergence tolerance and power to transform data and ii determine weightages by introducing the time series data of input variables i e sre products control parameters and training window into the blending algorithm having gamma modeling function that considers the probability of zero rainfall the algorithm accounts for three variables that are i a dependent variable to be blended i e rainfall ii the corresponding observed rainfall data gauge rainfall with t recording period g y 1 y 2 y t and iii k number of sre products i e four in this study derived ensemble s s 1 s 2 s k based on the law of total probability the expression of the bma predictive probability density function pdf for generating blended rainfall data y reads p y g k 1 k p s k g p y s k g where p s k g is a posterior probability likelihood of the ensemble member sre and p y s k g is the posterior distribution of the blended rainfall data y generated member s k and the gauged training data g the first term is also known as a fractional statistical weightage w k that shows how well the member matches with the gauge and the sum of these weightages is equal to 1 in this study the expectation maximization em algorithm is used for automated optimal weightage iteration ma et al 2018a defining a training window with an optimum length of days and selecting a training dataset is critical to train the bma model with the objective of error reduction as a result of optimized weightages fang and li 2016 qi et al 2019 however the process of determining the optimum length of a training window is not straightforward as there are no standard requirements for the selection courtney et al 2013 also window length may change subject to the type of predictive variables study area liu xie 2014 and objective functions used for training for this study the window is determined by examining the sensitivity of nineteen model training windows that range in length from 10 to 100 days with discrete time increments of 5 days five stations that are well distributed in the catchment i e aab cfd drl int and sbt were selected as training sites to ensure the robustness and representativeness of respective training windows across different locations in addition considering their largest number of rainy days four non consecutive and wettest years over the catchment i e 2004 2006 2010 and 2013 were identified as periods for training to test the training windows for different climatic periods and rain distributions among the tested training windows the one that satisfies the following three criteria was selected these include i yielding minimal error as measured using objective functions ii showing insignificant error difference with its neighboring training windows i e an indication for stability with the change in training window and iii the window should be as short as possible shorter training windows are considered to reduce the loss of information that occurs due to rapid temporal changes in the pattern and regime of rainfall berrocal et al 2008 while longer training windows contain more data to better estimate bma parameters but series may not be appropriate to cope when regime of rainfall changes rapidly raftery et al 2005 after setting the length of the training window the bma weightages of the four sre products were computed at the location of each gauging station for the entire study period when at least two satellites recorded a rainfall event as such if there is a training window t with a length of 1st to the nth number of days then the weightage for the day n 1st is first determined using gauged rainfall data recorded during t n number of days for computing n 2nd daily weightage the rainfall data of the t 1st is inactivated and replaced by the data of t 2nd and the training window t spans from t 2nd to t n 1st fig 5 the process recursively goes forward by generating dynamic weightages until the end of the study period the daily optimal weightages generated at each of the stations were subsequently interpolated over the study area by applying a universal coordinate system i e world geodetic system 1984 wgs84 and universal transverse mercator utm zone 37 n https epsg io 32637 and normalized so that the sum equals one interpolation of the daily weightages data was conducted at a spatial resolution that unifies all sre products i e 4 km 4 km using the inverse distance weighting idw method the underlying principle of the method is that observations o at closer stations have a higher contribution to the estimation of interpolated values i than observations from more remote stations idw equation reads i i i 1 n 1 d i p o i i 1 n 1 d i p where d i is the euclidean distance between the location of gauge i and the ungauged grid point p is the distance weighting power i e 2 in this study and n is the number of gauging stations to generate a blended daily rainfall data estimate at each of the grid elements that cover the study area weightages are tied to their corresponding sre products hereafter this blended rainfall product is labeled as tam perchimor which stands for either the first or middle three consecutive letters of the individual sre products by ordering them based on their original spatial resolution from finer to coarser see table 2 in addition a hyphen is inserted to differentiate the satellite gauge tamsat product from the satellite only products i e persiann chirp and cmorph 4 4 performance assessment to examine the performance of the blended rainfall product as compared to the individual sre products point to pixel comparison and cross validation performance assessment approaches were implemented in the point to pixel comparison approach the average error of estimated rainfall datasets was defined by comparing sre products derived pixel values against gauged data recorded at the same geographic locations with the assumption of the recorded point time series data are reference observations for the counterpart pixels of the sre products to examine the performance of rainfall estimates at ungauged grid points the leave one out cross validation loocv technique is selected e g cai et al 2019 ossa moreno et al 2019 in loocv sre products based daily time series of one station is excluded by assuming it as un gauged in this study rainfall at the location of the excluded station is estimated by the idw interpolation technique using daily rainfall from the remaining twelve stations this procedure is repeated for all thirteen stations so the time series of each station is sequentially excluded from the analysis the accuracy of the interpolated daily time series for the excluded stations is assessed using different performance indicators by using the counterpart observed rain gauge data as a reference results of the performance evaluation approaches are presented using seven statistical performance indicators table 3 these include mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge and pearson s correlation coefficient cc different statistical indicators were considered to examine the performance of rainfall estimates based on their associated error that were measured from different perspectives analysis of these performance indicators is conducted using hydrogof package in the r environment to assess the space and time difference between the observed and estimated rainfall gridded maps are created at annual seasonal and monthly time steps at each grid cell of the entire catchment residual differences are computed by deducing the gridded sre products from the counterpart idw interpolated rain gauge data lastly for each time step and rainfall estimate bar plots are produced to show the magnitude and distribution of the residual differences by assigning the magnitude of residual difference in the abscissa x axis and the respective number of grid cells in the ordinate y axis in addition the mean of residual difference mrd is determined for each time step and rainfall estimate by dividing the total residual difference by the total number of grids this is to show how far the overall averaged residual difference deviated from the targeted zero difference 5 results 5 1 length of training window determining the length of a training window is critical and marks the initial step to defining the parameters of the bma algorithm these parameters involve the weightages for each sre product in this study to identify the optimum bma training window nineteen training windows are evaluated for four wettest years i e 2004 2006 2010 and 2013 and for five gauging stations i e aab cfd drl int and sbt that are distributed across the study area results of the evaluation of the training windows as obtained from three commonly used objective functions i e mae rmse and mbe willmott and matsuura 2006 are illustrated using box and whisker plots fig 6 the box and whisker plots are based on twenty data from four training periods i e the wettest years and five calibration sites i e the gauging stations mae and rmse show the magnitude of the mean error whereas mbe indicates the direction of the error bias in terms of underestimation and overestimation box whisker plots for each of the three objective functions differ in box size and distribution and thus indicate the effect of increment in the length of training windows from 10 days to 100 days the median of the plots exhibited a non consistent pattern for the shorter training windows i e less than 30 days which is caused by the high rainfall variability the median of the objective functions shows a smooth transition for medium and large training windows i e greater than 30 days and that reveals less attribution of rainfall variability with transition in the training data of consecutive training windows as the length of the training window increases the median for mae and rmse shows a gradually decaying smooth pattern however median values for mbe follow an overall increasing pattern with the length of the training window both the overall increasing i e for mae and rmse and decreasing patterns i e for mbe are pointed toward the desired value of each objective function i e zero this indicated that there is an overall error reduction in response to the increment in the length of the training window that occurs due to enlargement in the sample size of training data the difference in the interquartile range i e the length of boxes of the three objective functions is another important feature of the plots that can be attributed to the variability of data values mae and rmse show boxes of shorter length but relatively larger value ranges for rmse that can be attributed to the effect of squaring that assigns larger weight values when errors increase in contrast mbe exhibits boxes of longer length due to the expected range of variability between inconsistent overestimations and underestimations across different years of the training period and the location of gauging stations the shortest and most stable training windows appeared from 35 to 45 days and 40 50 days at the median of mae and rmse respectively this shows that windows of 40 and 45 days are consistently stable in terms of both objective functions for the two periods 45 days showed better performance in terms of mbe and thus 45 days is selected as the optimum training window for this study here the error may reduce even further if a training window of longer than 60 days was selected however it compromises the aim of this study that blending results should not be provided for too long windows because that obstructs the ability of the bma model to detect rapid changes in the occurrence of rainfall over a relatively small area of the akaki catchment the selected 45 days training window well harmonized with the range of training windows of 30 55 days that were reported by ji et al 2019 rahman et al 2020a and yin et al 2021 5 2 spatial and temporal pattern of weightages in bma approaches weightages are assigned based on the performance of respective sre products in reference to the gauged data therefore weightages directly indicate the relative contribution of each sre product to the blended rainfall estimate and predictive skill of the approach fig 7 illustrates the intra annual variability of daily accumulated fractional weightages for the four sre products and daily rainfall data the rainfall data was gauged at five well distributed stations during the wettest year i e 2010 over the catchment in all plots weightage of sre products corresponding to stations from similar topographic settings follows a similar pattern this may be attributed to the true rainfall pattern over the study area that is influenced by catchment orography due to the presence of mountain ranges i e mount intoto and mount berek at the northern and northwestern parts of the catchment as a result stations in highly elevated areas i e aab and int received a higher amount of rainfall however a lower amount of rainfall was recorded at drl and cfd stations that are located in the lowland plain areas at the south and southeastern part of the catchment including the outlet of the akaki river exceptionally the remaining selected stations i e sbt exhibit a unique property that follows patterns of stations at higher mountains and in lowland areas during different seasons this may be attributed to transitioning topography from high to low altitude that received moderate rainfall amount during the main rainy season that stretches from june september the weightage of tamsat exceeds that of other sre products at all stations excluding the station that received the lowest rainfall i e drl the dominance of tamsat weightage slightly changed as the season advanced towards august and september due to an increased weightage of persiann particularly at drl and sbt stations regardless of the space and time the weightage of chirp product shows an inverse relation with the amount of rainfall by showing a decreasing trend as the rainfall increases this indicates a notable performance of chirp in capturing a lower amount of rainfall events opposing this weightage of tamsat is higher with the magnitude of rainfall events but still holds the major contribution at a few stations i e aab and int during the period of no lower amount of rainfall events during the dry season that stretches from october to january the contribution of cmorph is dominant at low and moderate rainfall receiving stations cfd drl and sbt at the other stations aab and int weightage of tamsat dominated other sre products in both situations when cmorph and tamsat interchangeably exhibit higher weightage at different locations chirp consistently held most of the remaining weightage by jointly sharing the weightage accumulation with cmorph and tamsat significant weightage of persiann is noticeable at most of the stations during the periods of intermittent rainfall events which often occurred in the short rainy season i e february to may in the elevated area at the central and northern part of the catchment the highest weightage of the sre products varied with topography during the dry season the weightage of chirp and tamsat was highest in elevated areas at the central i e aab and the north i e int parts of the catchment respectively in general the sre products show large variability in weightage for all seasons and stations that results from varying performance of sre products across time and space therefore this finding emphasizes the necessity and signifies blending several products for improving the quality of rainfall estimates 5 3 comparison of satellite and blended rainfall in fig 8 scatterplots and the counterpart correlation coefficients are used to quantitatively illustrate agreement between the gridded estimated rainfall and measured rain gauge data here the blended rainfall product and four sre products are compared against the observed daily rainfall data 2003 2019 at aab cfd drl int and sbt gauging stations in most of the sub plots highly correlated data points are shown in the range of moderate rainfall intensities i e 5 20 mm day zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 this indicates that sre products and the blended rainfall product well captured light rainfall the highest correlation coefficients i e 0 46 0 53 and dense data points are observed near the 1 1 best fitting line at aab int and sbt stations particularly for the blended rainfall product but also for chirp and tamsat products unlikely for cfd and drl stations data points show that scatter and correlation coefficients are lower than any other data pair in particular the correlation coefficient at the drl station for all rainfall estimates i e 0 21 0 28 is lower by approximately half when compared to other stations this illustrates that the blended and individual rainfall estimates were promising in capturing rainfall amounts over a mountainous area but only poorly estimated rainfall at the lower elevation of the akaki catchment data points of cmorph and persiann products were highly dispersed and their correlation coefficient was low i e 0 35 0 41 across aab cfd and sbt gauging stations at stations located in the highland i e int 0 39 and 0 43 and lowland drl 0 23 and 0 21 good and poor results are noticeable respectively overall cmorph and persiann products performed less than chirp and tamsat products the result from pearson s correlation coefficient shows that the blended rainfall product surpassed the satellite only products i e chirp cmorph and persiann but coefficients are comparable with the satellite gauge product i e tamsat the higher correlation coefficient attained by tamsat product is attributed to the higher number of gauging stations that are used to develop the product for central parts of ethiopia tarnavsky et al 2014 which includes the area of the akaki catchment other studies also show good performance of tamsat over ethiopia e g young et al 2014 fenta et al 2018 dinku et al 2018 although a correlation coefficient is a useful performance indicator it only reveals a result about linearity between the observed and estimated rainfall therefore further analysis was performed that aimed at validation of the blended rainfall product and the individual sre products table 4 two approaches i e point to pixel and loocv and six performance indicators were applied using daily data 2003 2019 from the five stations as a reference the six statistical indicators were selected to measure average error i e mae and rmse to indicate over underestimation mbe and pbias and to describe the extent of agreement between the gauged and estimated rainfall nse and kge based on point to pixel and loocv based comparisons the error of rainfall estimation is reduced see mae and rmse and the extent of agreement has improved see nse and kge in blended rainfall product as compared to the individual sre products table 4 see green cells according to the result from point to pixel based error indices the blended rainfall product reduced i mae of chirp cmorph persiann and tamsat by 88 146 40 and 102 mm year respectively and ii rmse by 66 343 361 and 274 mm year respectively based on loocv based assessment the blended rainfall product shows error reduction in terms of i mae of chirp cmorph persiann and tamsat by 128 336 4 and 102 mm year respectively and ii rmse by 197 482 259 and 325 mm year respectively similarly the extent of agreement between the gauged data and the blended data significantly improved over the individual sre products with exception of tamsat opposing other satellite only products the value of nse and kge for the satellite gauge tamsat exhibited a close performance as the blended rainfall product table 4 see blue cells in terms of the direction of bias only persiann distinctively underestimated observed rainfall table 4 see orange cells in contrast the blended rainfall product and the remaining individual sre products overestimate the observed rainfall amount over the akaki catchment overall cmorph and persiann performed the least whereas tamsat and chirp exhibited better performance this finding well complies with other studies conducted in awash river basin ethiopia and east africa at large e g young et al 2014 bayissa et al 2017 dinku et al 2018 fenta et al 2018 mekonnen et al 2021 the main conclusion is that the blended rainfall product shows significant improvement over the individual satellite products 5 4 wet season based comparison of rainfall datasets the main rainy season of the akaki catchment extends from june to september with substantial differences in rainfall recorded across the gauging station the starting june and ending september months are characterized by moderate rainfall whereas july and august commonly experience a higher intensity and a large amount of accumulated rainfall fig 9 shows box and whisker plots that incorporate data from the blended and individual sre products with the daily rainfall recorded at aab cfd drl int and sbt gauging stations for the main rainy seasons 2003 2019 all rainfall products similarly mimicked the pattern of observed rainfall by attaining smaller and higher amounts of rainfall during the outward june and september and middle months july and august respectively in the first consecutive three months of the main rainy season cmorph and persiann consistently underestimated the median amount of daily rainfall in september cmorph slightly overestimated the median of daily rainfall recorded during the specified month but persiann uninterruptedly underestimated the median daily rainfall regardless of location and month across the main rainy season and at many gauging stations the blended rainfall product tamsat and chirp overestimated the gauged median daily rainfall particularly in the middle two months during the outward months the order of overestimation changed to blended chirp and tamsat at many of the stations the blended rainfall product and tamsat have shown similar medians in september in similar tamsat and chirp exhibited an equivalent median of daily rainfall in august the length of boxes in the plot i e inter quartile range shows the variation for the sample of observed data box length deviations of the four sre products from the gauged data are smaller during the middle two months as compared to larger differences for the first and last month during the entire main rainy season persiann and tamsat consistently showed tangible underestimation and overestimation of rainfall amounts respectively the remaining individual sre products i e chirp and cmorph showed an overestimation but with a smaller margin in particular the blended rainfall product fairly captured the inter quartile range of the gauged data and thus outperformed the individual sre products the occurrence of very high daily rainfall is represented by the upper whisker in all sub plots cmorph and persiann have shown low to high underestimation of heavy rainfall across all locations and datasets with exception of an overestimation that occurred at sbt and drl for july and september respectively tamsat consistently overestimated observed data as its upper whisker is consistently higher but shows an underestimation at int station particularly in june and july a slight underestimation of chirp and the blended rainfall product was noticed at cfd and drl stations during the first two months of the main rainy season june and july and later changed to an overestimation for august and september in addition during the last two months the rainfall products consistently show smaller underestimation at aab and int stations but overestimated the observed heavy rainfall at cfd drl and sbt stations overall the blended rainfall product showed a significant improvement over the individual sre products in capturing both median and very high daily rainfall during the main rainy season among the individual sre products cmorph and chirp performed relatively well in capturing median and very high daily rainfall during the main rainy season respectively 5 5 spatial variability of rainfall datasets fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of seasonally categorized mean monthly rainfall 2003 2019 over the akaki catchment for gauge observations the blended rainfall product and individual sre products during months of the dry and short rainy seasons the spatial pattern of gauge based rainfall over the study area exhibited relatively less variability and uniform distribution across the catchment this spatial pattern of mean monthly rainfall is well captured by the individual sre products and the blended dataset because satellites are often able to easily estimate no low rainfall amounts which are mostly expected to occur during these seasons in contrast to the considered rainfall estimates only cmorph highly overestimated mean monthly rainfall during these seasons at the western part of akaki catchment during the main rainy season the gauge based spatial rainfall pattern over the study area exhibited a rainfall decrement from the mountainous parts of the catchment in the northwestern parts to the low lying areas in the southeastern parts of the catchment this decreasing rainfall trend was shown by the blended rainfall product as well as the individual sre products but was relatively better captured by the blended rainfall product and cmorph compared to the observed mean monthly rainfall persiann showed high underestimation across many grid elements with exception of a few grids in the south in this less rainfall receiving part of the catchment persiann and cmorph well captured the observed mean monthly rainfall the remaining sre products i e chirp and tamsat showed a good performance in the northwestern part of the catchment but with a slight overestimation of mean monthly rainfall in other parts of the catchment in general the significant bias of the rainfall product prominently occurred during the main rainy season as compared to the dry or short rainy seasons of the catchment this implies the estimation of rainfall during the main rainy season is associated with higher uncertainty because of difficulties to capture extreme rainfall events which prominently occurred during this season all sre products and the blended rainfall product show significant spatial variability and are better performed over the northwestern than the southeastern part of the catchment for mean monthly rainfall particularly during the main rainy season the northwestern part is mainly characterized by mountainous ridges dominated by urban and forest and receives a higher amount of rainfall and season when compared to the flat plain areas at the southeastern of the study area therefore it can be concluded that the rainfall estimates were good at capturing rainfall over mountainous areas over the central area which mainly encompasses addis ababa city the mean monthly rainfall during the main rainy season was well captured by all rainfall products but was highly underestimated by persiann these results show that the blended rainfall product provided more reliable spatial precipitation estimates in many parts of the catchment and across various temporal scales by capturing both the spatial variability and the amount of observed rainfall 5 6 spatial difference of observed and estimated rainfall fig 11 illustrates the residual difference between the satellite based rainfall products and spatially interpolated gauged rainfall differences are indicated as spatially distributed residual differences of rainfall at monthly seasonal and annual time scales in the first column a residual difference of gridded mean monthly rainfall data is represented for each sre product and the blended dataset in this column of bar plots the residuals for the considered rainfall estimates are more concentrated near the targeted zero value but the mean of the residuals is slightly different the mean of residual difference mrd for monthly chirp and tamsat is 9 8 and 13 3 mm respectively which is negative and shows an underestimation in contrast persiann overestimated the interpolated observed rainfall data with the mrd of 19 9 mm although mrd for cmorph is 1 1 mm which nearly overlapped the targeted zero difference the result was achieved by equating the number of overestimated grid cells with several underestimated grid cells in the case of the blended dataset the distribution of residual differences is nearly flat the mean residual nearly matched the zero difference with mrd of 1 5 mm and the bars are relatively short that revealing the presence of a low number of grid cells for the respective value of residual differences the second column of bar plots shows the distribution of residual difference from gridded mean seasonal rainfall which was estimated using individual sre products and the blended dataset except for cmorph the distribution of residual difference for the remaining rainfall estimates is nearly flat with a symmetrical distribution of bars in the regions of overestimation and underestimation in this column the position of mrd with respect to the targeted zero difference for all rainfall estimates exhibits similarity trend as the mrd in the monthly column as indicated above the third column of bar plots shows the distribution of residuals from spatially distributed mean annual rainfall during the study period 2003 2019 the plots dominantly indicate a concentrated distribution of the residuals for all rainfall estimates while the distribution is skewed towards underestimation for chirp and tamsat the distribution is skewed to the region of overestimation in the case of cmorph and persiann for the blended dataset the mrd approached the target zero difference more than all individual sre products without notably skewing towards overestimation or underestimation residuals in general the blended dataset brought an improvement by significantly reducing the residual difference when compared to the individual sre products at all the evaluated time scales i e monthly seasonal and annual 6 discussion this study is one of the first to test and evaluate the blending of high resolution satellite products for an urbanized catchment with complex topography as a result comparing the findings of this study with others is challenging by the lack of comparative studies however there are few studies on a larger spatial domain that engulf the akaki catchment these are the awash river basin e g hirpa et al 2010 romilly and gebremichael 2011 adane et al 2021 and the upper awash sub basin e g mekonnen et al 2021 in addition since the akaki catchment is geographically located in the central part of ethiopia where the awash and the blue nile basin intersect areas within both river basins share similar characteristics by experiencing high rainfall and constituting complex topography romilly and gebremichael 2011 therefore the findings of this study are further discussed with reference to these studies in this study the effect of topographic variation on the performance of the rainfall estimates is demonstrated both the blended and the four individual sre products relatively performed better in capturing rainfall at the mountainous highland areas in the north than the rainfall over the lowland parts in the south of the akaki catchment the results of studies previously conducted in awash and upper blue nile basins strongly abide by this finding e g romilly and gebremichael 2011 abera et al 2016 belay et al 2019 mekonnen et al 2021 according to gebremichael et al 2014 and young et al 2014 a such strong influence of topographic variation on the performance of sre products is probably related to the efficiency of signal retrieval algorithm in detecting various processes in the rainfall formation systems over different topographic settings however there is a paradoxical result reported by fenta et al 2018 showing better performance of sre products in the lowlands than over the highlands as indicated by wedajo et al 2021 this likely can be attributed to the difference in topographic land cover and climatic conditions between the study areas the four individual high resolution sre products i e tamsat chirp persiann and cmorph considered in this study performed differently particularly most of the sre products including tamsat chirp and cmorph showed an overall overestimation of rainfall over the akaki catchment similarly wedajo et al 2021 compared four products i e chirps imerg trmm and tamsat for an area in the upper blue nile basin and also revealed an overestimation of the products opposingly persiann is the only product that underestimates the rainfall over the akaki catchment such results can be found in studies conducted for the awash and upper blue nile basins by hirpa et al 2010 and romilly and gebremichael 2011 respectively among the products tamsat showed a surpassing strength in better capturing the spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall over the akaki catchment in similar the outstanding performance of tamsat over different parts of ethiopia is shown young et al 2014 dinku et al 2018 mekonnen et al 2021 the high number of gauging stations used from the central part of ethiopia and the efficiency of a deployed algorithm i e apply geographically varying local calibration for developing tamsat contributed to its good performance greatre et al 2014 fenta et al 2018 dinku et al 2018 next to tamsat also chirp performed well in capturing rainfall over akaki catchment similar to the finding of this study other studies also reported comparable performance of tamsat to chirp fenta et al 2018 tadesse et al 2022 belete et al 2020 also showed similar performance but in that study chirps slightly performed better than tamsat according to dinku et al 2018 the close performance of the two products likely occurred because they shared the same dataset for bias correction i e chpclim and their difference emerged due to the algorithm difference used in the product development in contrast to the best sre products for the akaki catchment persiann exhibited the weakest performance in estimating rainfall over the study area other studies also depicted poor performance of the product over the regions of the upper blue nile basin bitew and gebremichael 2011 bayissa et al 2017 compared to persiann cmorph performed better in estimating rainfall over the akaki catchment and bartsotas et al 2018 also reported this in their study conducted over the subtropical area of blue nile overall the salient findings from the performance evaluation of the individual sre products strongly agree with studies conducted over nearby regions the most important finding of the current study is that bma resulted in an improved blended rainfall product few other studies at large scale regions in china and pakistan e g ma et al 2018b rahman et al 2020b yin et al 2021 li et al 2021 also indicated the favorable performance of blending as compared to single products further testing of bma as applied in this study in smaller catchments of different regions is highly recommended to improve the spatiotemporal quality of rainfall estimates this study also advocates further enriching the blending algorithm by developing more effective methodologies 7 conclusion this study successfully tested bayesian model averaging bma to develop a high quality blended rainfall dataset 2003 2019 using four high resolution sre products chirp cmorph persiann and tamsat the data set at daily time step is prepared for a highly urbanized 1500 km2 catchment in ethiopia the catchment experiences significant annual rainfall variability 670 1250 mm for blending bma derived weightages were generated at daily time steps and intertwined with their sre products daily wet season and mean annual rainfall performance evaluations were conducted for the blended rainfall product and the individual sre products that were intercompared and referenced to recorded rain gauge data the main conclusions are time series patterns of bma derived weightages for each sre product show large variability weightages of tamsat and chirp were consistently dominant across the rain gauge locations for periods of heavy and light rainfall respectively analysis of weightages of individual sre products during the dry season shows that weightages can be related to the topography of the catchment for the mountainous plane and low lying areas where tamsat chirp and cmorph show the highest weights respectively this indicates the nonexistence of outperforming individual rainfall products and signifies the need to evaluate the blending of several products for optimal utilization of each product findings reveal that i the quality of the blended rainfall dataset significantly improved when compared to the individual sre products ii the satellite gauge product i e tamsat showed comparable performance with the blended rainfall product iii except for persiann that underestimated the gauged rainfall the remaining sre products show overestimation and iv cmorph and persiann performed the least whereas tamsat and chirp showed good performance in capturing daily rainfall over akaki catchment assessment from spatial variability of mean annual and wet season rainfall indicated that the blended rainfall product and cmorph well captured observed rainfall across the catchment but the remaining individual sre products showed less spatial variability in terms of rainfall amount the blended rainfall product well matched the gauged data in many parts of the catchment including the mountainous areas in the northern part of the catchment assessing the spatially distributed residual difference between the interpolated rain gauge data and sre products showed that the blended rainfall product significantly reduced the residual difference at monthly seasonal and annual time scales the distribution of residual difference for the blended product is nearly flat the mean of residuals highly approached the targeted zero difference and the number of a grid cell for the respective value of residual differences is relatively smaller when compared to the individual sre products overall none of the individual satellite products outperformed the other individual products in capturing various aspects of the gauged rainfall data however the blended product outperformed the other products in many aspects this indicates that rainfall estimation largely improved from blending multiple satellite products that result in higher quality rainfall representations by improved matching to rain gauge rainfall credit authorship contribution

7749,study region ganga mahanadi godavari narmada and tapti river basins of india study focus the manuscript focuses on improving skills of the indian summer monsoon precipitation forecasts obtained from national center for medium range weather forecasting ncmrwf at both sub basin and gridded scale a well established bayesian joint probability bjp based statistical post processing approach operational in australia is used for the first time in india throughout diverse geographical extent the work evaluates how the post processor can be used in a summer monsoon dominated region like india the study informs whether annual or seasonal precipitation forecasts should be used as the length of data will play crucial role in both the cases the spread skill of the ensembles obtained from bjp approach and the ncmrwf is explored new hydrological insights for the region introduction of the bjp based post processing approach in india could help the forecast community to implement more robust approach in improving the skills of the forecasts our results show that instead of using the data of whole year only monsoonal precipitation forecasts are adequate to setup the bjp approach the calibrated forecasts obtained using three years of hindcast and observations data at grids and at the centroid of 177 sub basins are found to be more skillful the calibrated forecasts can discriminate between extreme and low precipitation events and have appropriate ensemble spread to capture precipitation peaks this study presents a guideline for water managers and forecasters to apply bjp approach to improve the forecasts graphical abstract ga1 keywords bayesian post processing precipitation forecasts indian summer monsoon ensembles ncmrwf sub basin scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfall exhibits high variability in magnitude frequency and distribution across space and time singhal et al 2022a singhal and jha 2021a india is largely dependent on precipitation for its economic growth and sustenance hence for a country like india the availability of precipitation forecasts is vital each year rainfall events of varying intensities cause floods in large part of the country during the monsoon months of june july august and september jjas leading to numerous casualties displacement of people and loss of property ray et al 2021 roxy et al 2017 reliable precipitation forecasts can help in issuing floods related warnings effective management of water resources and consequently inform better decision making singhal et al 2022b the quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs which are obtained from numerical weather prediction nwp models are primary estimations of a possible precipitation event in a region a few days or weeks in advance ahmed et al 2014 froude 2010 tian et al 2019 the deterministic qpfs obtained from the nwp models are single valued forecasts which represent a single best possible state of future weather deterministic qpfs often contain errors since single valued forecasts are unable to capture the uncertainty involved with weather patterns jha et al 2018 on the other hand probabilistic forecasts with several forecast members have the potential to represent multiple possible states of weather and thus capture the weather uncertainty however the disadvantage of producing ensemble forecasts using nwp models is that they are computationally very expensive when required for large areas and at long lead times and also the spread of ensemble is generally too narrow ramos et al 2013 schepen et al 2018 shrestha et al 2015 moreover the raw probabilistic forecasts are unsuitable to be used since they contain inherent systematic bias due to uncertainty in both the assimilation and physical parameterization processes of nwp models buizza 2018 maraun et al 2015 saminathan et al 2021 the nwp models are also influenced by the formulation horizontal vertical resolutions and the initial conditions of the model which influences the quality of the qpfs bowler et al 2008 nipen and stull 2011 therefore it is essential to post process the raw forecasts with statistical models before using them for operational purposes statistical post processing approaches are computationally inexpensive quick and easy to apply and capture the weather uncertainty quite well shrestha et al 2015 verkade et al 2013 yagli et al 2020 however statistical post processing of rainfall forecasts still remains a challenging task several statistical post processing approaches have been developed and implemented in the past to improve the skill of the raw forecast such as the analog method hamill and whitaker 2006 linear and non linear regression clark and hay 2004 verkade et al 2013 logistic regression hamill et al 2006 medina et al 2019 saminathan et al 2021 extended logistic regression roulin and vannitsem 2012 bayesian theory and fuzzy probability cai et al 2019 ensemble model output statistics emos approach gneiting et al 2005 li et al 2019 and copula based post processing techniques li et al 2021 however problems arising due to the irregular nature of precipitation large values of zero rainfall reduction of forecast skill with the increase in lead times and seasonal variations in rainfall patterns need to be addressed an approach based on joint probability of forecasts and long historical observations has been developed which has gained credible recognition in the field of statistical post processing the basic aim of this approach is to produce calibrated forecasts by establishing a joint probability distribution between forecasts as predictors and the observation data as predictands robertson et al 2013 wang et al 2009 previous studies suggest that the joint probability based distribution approaches offer advantage over the other post processing approaches li et al 2017 however to the best of our knowledge the potential of this approach to obtain calibrated forecasts is yet to be explored over india more recent analysis suggests that neglecting rainfall seasonality in post processing methods can produce forecasts that contain seasonal biases and display poorer skill wang et al 2019 in india the strong seasonality of precipitation due to the monsoon adds an additional challenge to the post processing of rainfall many previous applications of post processing methods where short records of nwp is used neglect the effects of rainfall seasonality shrestha et al 2016 however in case where the forecast data is available only for a small period it becomes a very interesting and challenging exercise to check if a post processor can still improve the forecasts the bayesian modelling based post processing approaches have been demonstrated to successfully generate skillful forecasts with shorter records of data for instance robertson et al 2013 used the rainfall post processing approach over murray darling basin australia to obtain calibrated forecasts using 20 months of data shrestha et al 2015 used 21 months of data to produce calibrated forecasts for different catchments of australia jha et al 2018 used 3 years of data for obtaining calibrated forecasts for a canadian basin hence the rpp model used in this manuscript has already been proven to be effective in producing skillful forecasts by obtaining parameters even from shorter data records moreover the results presented in the manuscript incorporated sampling variability while computing the verification measures this is done by applying bootstrapping approach with 5000 times sampling of the data records while calculating the uncertainties this gives a confidence about the robustness of the calibrated forecasts and justifies its ability to calibrate forecasts from operational agencies this study sets up the bayesian joint probability bjp model based rainfall post processing approach developed by robertson et al 2013 over five major river basins of india the main aim of the study is to post process the deterministic raw qpfs obtained from the national centre for medium range weather forecasting ncmrwf to produce ensembles calibrated qpfs for five daily lead times at sub basin scale the study has also been extended to establish the rpp model using the gridded ncmrwf forecasts applying rpp at the grid scale helps us to understand the influence of spatial resolution data length and lead times on the performance of the model ncmrwf is the national weather forecast center of india which performs medium range global assimilation and rainfall forecasts in real time at the spatial scale of 0 18 0 12 the calibrated qpfs are subsequently verified with the satellite derived integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg precipitation product das et al 2022 kumar singh et al 2019 li et al 2018 prakash et al 2018 prior to post processing the historical imerg rainfall are interpolated to same spatial scale as the ncmrwf forecasts which is 0 18 0 12 for the application of rpp on sub basin level the forecasts and observation data are interpolated to the centroid of each of the 177 sub basins following the sub basin average method two experiments are performed at each sub basin and gridded level to evaluate the performance of the approach in incorporating the seasonal behavior of rainfall in india in the first experiment we apply the post processor to calibrate the annual precipitation forecasts containing both the dry and wet season dry season mostly contains zero rainfall while in the second experiment we focus on calibrating the forecasts of the wet season jjas alone please note that although the input data provided to the model is annual we extract and present the results for the monsoon season only the study is important as it provides a reliable avenue to obtain daily calibrated qpfs both at the sub basin and the gridded scale which can help in streamflow forecasting flood warning agro met advisories and other related decision making the specific objectives of the study are 1 to set up a bjp model based post processing approach over the five river basins of india to produce sub basin averaged calibrated qpfs at 5 day lead times 2 to assess the performance of the post processing approach in producing the annual calibrated qpfs acq using the corresponding raw deterministic forecast 3 to evaluate the performance of post processing in producing seasonal calibrated qpfs scq using the corresponding raw deterministic forecast 4 to investigate the quality of the forecasts at varying rainfall intensities for both acq and scq 5 to investigate the potential of calibrated qpfs to reliably discriminate the precipitation events and non events for both acq and scq 6 to extend the study to gridded level and evaluate the gridded calibrated qpfs based on accuracy and skill of the forecasts 7 to examine the accuracy and spread of the post processed ensemble forecasts by comparing them to the available perturbed ensemble forecasts from ncmrwf for both acq and scq the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the details related to the study area and datasets section 3 describes the methodology implemented to post process the precipitation forecasts section 4 presents the results of post processing along with their evaluation section 5 discusses the results and section 6 deals with conclusions and the future scope of this study 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the study area includes five major river basins of india which are ganga godavari mahanadi narmada and tapti as depicted in fig 1 these rivers cover approximately 60 of the total geographical area of india and contribute to the major water availability in the country the ganga river originates in the high elevation region of uttarakhand and confluences into the bay of bengal in the east with elevation reaching up to 7000 m the river makes the northern part of india a highly fertile zone due to which agriculture becomes the predominant source of livelihood for most of the population further the narmada tapti and mahanadi basins are located in the central part of the country having lower elevation ranges while the godavari river basin is located in peninsular india characterized by some areas of higher elevation the basins receive most of the precipitation during the indian summer monsoon season singh and jha 2021 previous studies suggest that frequencies of higher magnitude precipitation in the region are increasing ghosh et al 2012 guhathakurta and revadekar 2017 which have led to frequent floods lakshmi et al 2019 the distribution of the 177 sub basins are as follows ganga comprises of the maximum sub basins 88 followed by godavari 50 mahanadi 20 tapti 10 and narmada 9 more details about the various river basins are presented in table 1 2 2 datasets the deterministic precipitation forecast obtained from ncmrwf and satellite derived data from imerg are used in this study the qpf from ncmrwf is used at the daily temporal resolution available at lead times of 1 5 days while the spatial resolution of the data is 0 18 x 0 12 moreover imerg v6 dataset is currently available at a spatial resolution of 0 1 x 0 1 and a half hour temporal resolution both the observation and forecast datasets are used over a time period of july 2018 to september 2021 more details of the datasets are provided in table 2 the half hour period 3imerghh data is aggregated to obtain the daily data and upscaled to the same resolution as ncmrwf i e 0 18 x 0 12 previous studies have found that upscaling of rainfall datasets do not significantly influence their characteristics or lead to possible loss of information due to the change in resolution imhoff et al 2020 nicótina et al 2008 the final data set for the observed rainfall contains 101 points in x direction 142 points in y direction with a total of 14 342 grids over the domain further both the datasets are interpolated at the centroid of each sub basin following the weighted area average method singh et al 2021 singhal and jha 2021b consequently a time series of rainfall at each sub basin is obtained after interpolation we also use the available perturbed ensemble forecasts from ncmrwf which comprises 11 ensemble members for comparison with the post processing generated forecast 3 methods in this section we first provide a brief description of the post processing approach followed by the utilization of the schaake shuffle technique and details about the metrics to verify the calibrated qpfs please note that each of the steps involved here is applied to obtain both the acq and scq in this study 3 1 the post processing approaches the post processing approach developed by robertson et al 2013 is a bjp model based statistical rainfall post processor that establishes a joint probability distribution between the raw qpfs and the corresponding observation data to produce calibrated qpfs the working principle of the post processing approach is based on three steps 1 transform the non normal distribution of the precipitation data forecast and observation into a bivariate normal distribution using the log sinh transformation eqs 1 and 2 2 infer the relevant parameters to model the joint probability of raw qpfs and observations which maximizes the likelihood of posterior parameter distribution and 3 back transform the forecast values to their original space 1 x fcst 1 β fcst sinh α fcst β fcst x 2 y obs 1 β obs sinh α obs β obs y where x fcst y obs represent the forecast and observation in transformed space the parameters involved in this transformation are represented by α fcst β fcst and α obs β obs for the forecast and observation respectively after transformation x fcst y obs is assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution given as x fcst y obs n μ σ p x fcst y obs n μ σ where σ and μ are defined as μ μ x fcst μ y obs σ σ x fcst 2 ρ x fcst ρ y obs σ x fcst σ y obs ρ x fcst ρ y obs σ x fcst σ y obs σ 2 y obs μ x fcst σ x fcst 2 and μ y obs σ 2 y obs represent the mean and standard deviation of the observation and forecast respectively and ρ x fcst ρ y obs is the correlation coefficient between x fcst and y obs the set of nine parameters used in modelling the joint distribution is the following s α fcst β fcst μ x fcst σ x fcst 2 α obs β obs μ y obs σ 2 y obs ρ x fcst ρ y obs the set of nine parameters is estimated using the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1994 based on maximizing the likelihood of the posterior distribution once the parameters are estimated the bivariate normal distribution conditioned on the raw qpfs is used to estimate the forecasts the forecast ensembles generation is done by randomly sampling from the conditional distribution the back transformation of the forecast values is done by using the inverse of x fcst and ŷ obs inverse of eqs 1 and 2 3 2 cross validation of calibrated forecasts in order to evaluate the performance of the post processor we adopt a leave one month out cross validation procedure in this procedure the data except for the left out month is used to estimate the parameters of the bjp model using the estimated parameters the precipitation for all the days of the left out month is estimated and verified with the corresponding observation data the procedure is repeated until all the available raw qpfs are calibrated 3 3 schaake shuffle the schaake shuffle is a technique that is applied to regain spatial co variability between neighboring locations and temporal persistence in predicted precipitation that are lost during the post processing of data from the nwp models schaake et al 2007 the steps involved in schaake shuffle are as follows i a forecast date is chosen and a sample of observation data is selected the observation sample and the ensemble have the same size selected from an observation period in the past ii the observation sample chosen above in step 1 is ranked in ascending order the ranking procedure is repeated similarly for the ensemble forecast data iii a date is chosen from the sample dataset of the observations subsequently the ranks of the observation sample are identified iv from the ensemble set of the forecasts a forecast having the same rank as that of the selected observations is chosen and v the steps 3 4 are repeated for all ensemble members 3 4 verification measures in this study we use various measures to verify the efficacy of the post processing method the measures used are bias percentage bias continuous rank probability score crps root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse relative operating characteristic roc and the spread skill analysis 3 4 1 bias percentage bias bias calculates the difference between the mean of the ensemble precipitation forecasts and the mean of the observations bias is defined as the percentage deviation of the mean of calibrated forecasts from the observations as shown in eq 3 3 bias 1 t f x fcst t 1 t f y obs t 1 t f y obs t 100 here x fcst could either be raw x rawfcst or post processed forecasts x fcst and y obs represents observation 3 4 2 continuous rank probability score crps the crps compares the cumulative distribution function cdf of the forecast f x fcst with the corresponding cdf of the observation f y obs 4 crps f x fcst t f y obs t 2 dt crps reduces to mean absolute error for deterministic qpfs and allows efficient comparison between ensemble and deterministic forecasts smaller values of crps are favorable closer to zero meaning that the forecasts are accurate and vice versa 3 4 3 root mean square error rmse rmse gives the standard deviation of the model prediction error and a smaller rmse value indicates better performance of the presented model 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n f x fcst t f y obs t 2 here x fcst could either be raw x rawfcst or post processed forecasts x fcst 3 4 4 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the nse is a normalized statistics that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise compared to the measured variance 6 nse 1 1 t f y obs t f x fcst t f x fcst t f y obs t y ˆ obs is the true mean of observation nse ranges from inf to 1 and values equal to 1 indicates a perfect match of the forecast to the observed data nse 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data inf nse 0 indicates that the observed mean is better predictor than the model 3 4 5 relative operating characteristic roc roc curves are used to evaluate the ability of a forecasting method to distinguish between events and non events and plot the hit rate against the false alarm rate the hit rate refers to the probability of a forecast to detect events that exceed a predefined precipitation threshold while the false alarm rate refers to the probability of a forecast predicting erroneous events robbins and titley 2018 for a skillful calibrated forecast hit rates are expected to exceed the false alarm rates and the roc curves are closer to the top left corner of the plot on the other hand the detecting ability of the forecast is considered low when the roc curves are closer to the diagonal the area under curve auc is calculated for each roc curve to distinguish the measure of separability the auc is expected to be higher than 0 6 for better distinguishing separate events 3 4 6 spread skill analysis the aim of the spread skill analysis is to compare the spread in forecast ensembles with the forecast error nester et al 2012 the forecast error is defined as the difference between the observations and the ensemble mean in this study we perform the spread skill analysis between the available 11 forecast members of the perturbed ncmrwf and the 300 generated members of acq and scq arranging them in increasing order followed by their grouping into ten bins consequently the average ensemble spread and forecast error from each bin is plotted 3 5 implementation of rpp in this study we apply rpp to obtain the calibrated qpfs over the indian river basins at two spatial scales i e at the centroids of each sub basin and at each individual grids to this end we analyse the performance of the rpp to post process monsoonal precipitation using two experiments at each of the two spatial scales first using the annual data producing acq and second with seasonal data producing scq for both the gridded and sub basin averaged precipitation the annual run used sub basin averaged forecast and observation precipitation at each sub basins for a period of 39 months from july 2018 to september 2021 whereas for seasonal run of rpp monsoon season june july august and september data of year 2019 2021 is used for validation a leave one month out cross validation strategy is applied as the data record used is of smaller time period specifically one month data is left for validation while data from other months are used for parameter estimation and optimization once the parameters are obtained the left one month data is used to produce calibrated forecasts with 300 ensemble members this is repeated for the five lead times of the ncmrwf forecast data at each sub basins of the study area it is noteworthy that the annual experiment uses annual data producing acq however for better comparison with scq we extract and present the results for monsoon season only the rpp calibrated qpfs at the sub basin scale are evaluated using the measures of bias percentage and crps the discriminating ability of the calibrated qpfs are investigated in terms of hit rate and false alarm rate using a precipitation threshold of 5 mm finally the spread skill of the calibrated ensemble forecasts is analyzed with respect to the available perturbed ensemble forecast from ncmrwf each of the mentioned evaluations is undertaken for both acq and scq at the lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days the rpp calibrated qpfs at the grid scale are evaluated using bias percentage and crps 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the calibrated qpfs at the sub basin scale here the performance of the calibrated forecasts in each sub basin acq and scq is evaluated using the measures of bias percent and crps at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days please note that the evaluation presented is for the monsoon season only in both cases of acq and scq 4 1 1 evaluation using percentage bias fig 2 shows the spatial plot of sub basin averaged bias percent of the raw qpf a1 a3 acq b1 b3 and scq c1 c3 at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for all the 177 sub basins we observe high spatial variability in the bias of the raw deterministic forecast as depicted in fig 2 a1 a3 the range of bias is also large with it ranging between 95 to 300 moreover we find greater variability among the sub basins of the ganga river western tapti and western godavari basins as opposed to the sub basins of other areas in all three lead times large bias over these sub basins could be attributed to the presence of mountainous regions orographic influence complex topography and frequent events of extreme precipitation further results suggest that the acq obtained after post processing the raw annual qpf shows improvement in the bias percent as depicted in fig 2 b1 b3 for the majority of the sub basins the bias values have decreased 20 to 20 as compared to the bias of raw qpf 95 300 in the case of acq the bias throughout the sub basins shows overestimation of precipitation values mostly in ganga and mahanadi basins with bias 5 10 and under estimation in all other sub basins with bias less than 3 furthermore in the case of scq we observe a significant reduction in the bias percent as shown in fig 2 c1 c3 the scqs show better performance in all three lead times however we find very few sub basins showing overestimation of the values at lead times 3 day and 5 day furthermore the majority of the sub basins show bias in the narrow range of 5 5 which means that calibration of the raw forecast using seasonal data performs better than the calibration using annual data moreover this also suggests that the quality of the calibrated qpf depends upon the length of data and not necessarily on the location and size of the area under study fig 3 shows the bias plots of the raw deterministic qpf acq and scq at the lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 day for the godavari larger basin and narmada smaller basin at 5 and 95 confidence intervals in both the basins we observe that the post processing approach is well able to reduce the bias in the raw qpf specifically in the case of godavari fig 3 a1 a3 we see that the bias in raw qpf has a large range between the positive and negative values in all three lead times from the calibrated results we observe that the performance of both acq and scq improves the quality of qpfs scq shows a relatively straight line originating near the zero bias mark and running as a straight line parallel to the x axis denoting stable and skillful generation of forecast across all the fifty sub basins similar observations can be made for all three lead times in contrast the acq performs better than the raw qpf however the results are slightly underestimated compared to the scq the 5 and 95 confidence intervals around both acq and scq show a decrease when compared to that of the raw qpf hence a narrow shaded area furthermore in the case of narmada fig 3 b1 b3 we observe nearly similar results to those observed for the godavari basin the raw qpf varies within a large range of positive and negative values which slightly increases with the increase in lead times compared to the godavari basin the acq of the narmada performs better less biased more stable however it is still underestimated when compared to the acq overall results from both the river basins suggest that the bias becomes least in scq which is followed by acq 4 1 2 evaluation using crps the crpss are estimated based on the 300 ensemble members generated using the post processing approach for both annual and seasonal calibrated qpfs fig 4 shows the spatial plot of sub basin averaged crps of the raw qpf a1 a3 acq b1 b3 and scq c1 c3 at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for all the 177 sub basins results show that in the case of raw qpf the crpss vary within 0 40 mm for all three lead times higher crps are observed in the godavari river basin bottom half of the sub basins while in the majority of the other sub basins it ranges between 5 and 20 mm only the finding remains the same in all three lead times with small variations further the results show that the raw qpfs have significantly improved upon calibration in both the cases of acq and scq the range of crps has reduced to 0 8 mm after calibration as opposed to 0 40 mm before calibration suggesting reasonable performance of the post processing approach the majority of the sub basins are within a narrow range of 0 5 mm while some sub basins in the upper ganga and western godavari show a higher range of crps 5 8 mm moreover the fig 4 shows that the spatial variability of crps of acq and scq are almost similar which is contrary to the results observed using bias percentage fig 5 shows the crps plots of the raw deterministic qpf along with acq and scq at the lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for the godavari and narmada river basins at 5 and 95 confidence intervals visual inspection suggests that the post processing approach is successful in reducing the crps in both the basins for both acq and scq specifically in the godavari basin fig 5 a1 a3 we find that the crps of raw qpf fluctuates between 7 and 35 mm among the sub basins the results show that the crps has significantly reduced in the case of both acq and scq upon post processing of the raw qpf moreover the plots of acq and scq are less differentiated and are located within close proximity however we find that scq performs slightly better than acq in all three lead times furthermore in the case of narmada fig 5 b1 b3 we observe similar results as the calibrated qpfs perform reasonably well as compared to the raw qpf the crps of the raw qpf is in higher range 8 15 mm while the calibrated qpfs acq and scq are observed in a narrow range of 2 5 mm similar to the observation in the case of the godavari basin the post processing approach shows comparable crps between acq and scq however the performance of scq is slightly better for all the sub basins of the narmada river 4 2 evaluation of qpfs at varying intensities in this section the performance of the calibrated forecasts acq and scq is evaluated at varying intensities at each sub basin using the multiple error statistics such as rmse bias and nse at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days the thresholds t of varying intensities are taken by carefully studying the daily sub basin averaged observation data for the selected time period to keep around 10 15 and 25 data values above the higher thresholds t 10 mm t 15 mm and t 20 mm per day are selected respectively according to that the precipitation values are equally divided by taking five threshold values of t 0 mm t 5 mm t 10 mm t 15 mm and t 20 mm per day fig 6 presents the spatial plots of error statistics calculated for sub basin averaged raw forecast from ncmrwf and qpfs from acq and scq in comparison with observation imerg at each sub basin using the t values for convenience the results are presented for precipitation of lead time day 1 at the five river basins of ganga godavari mahanadi narmada and tapti in fig 9 a1 to a5 b1 to b5 and c1 to c5 presents rmse calculated with observation for raw forecasts acq and scq at t 0 mm t 5 mm t 10 mm t 15 mm and t 20 mm per day respectively similarly results for bias and nse are presented in the next six columns d1 to i5 of the figure the collective understanding of fig 9 shows that the values from each error statics increases with increasing intensity of rainfall fig 6 a1 to a5 shows increasing rmse values with increasing intensity of the precipitation and varies between 20 and 70 mm day the rmse presented for acq fig 6 b1 to b5 and scq fig 6 c1 to c5 show lower rmse values ranging from 0 to 40 mm day increasing with higher intensities furthermore the bias values of raw forecast show increased negative bias with increasing intensities of rainfall fig 6 d1 to d5 the calibrated qpfs from both acq and scq show underestimation of the precipitation values at higher intensities fig 6 e1 to f5 similarly nse also supports that the acq and scq calibrated qpfs are underestimated at higher intensities of precipitation 4 3 evaluation of the discriminating ability of the calibrated qpfs in this section we use the roc plots to evaluate the ability of the calibrated qpfs to discriminate the precipitation events among the different sizes of the sub basin the sizes of the sub basins depend upon the smallest moderate and largest area in the respective river basins of godavari mahanadi narmada tapti and ganga precipitation of more than 80th percentile for each sub basin averaged daily precipitation is selected as the threshold for both annual and seasonal calibration at the lead times of 1 3 and 5 days fig 7 and fig 8 show the roc curves for the calibrated qpfs for events of precipitation greater than 80th percentile for each sub basin to produce acqs and scqs respectively the figures show that the post processed forecasts can discriminate between the events and non events in most sub basins in both the cases of acq fig 7 and scq fig 8 we observe that the roc curves are closer to the top left corner of the plot for the lead time 1 thus indicating a good ability of forecasts to discriminate between precipitation events however as the lead time increases the curves begin to move towards the diagonal thus representing a lower discriminating ability of lead timeat 3 day and 5 day when the daily precipitation is more than 80th percentile for instance in fig 7 b1 we find that the curve of lead time 1 is closer to the top left corner of the plot denoting a higher hit rate than false alarm rate while the curves of the other two lead times are closer to the diagonal in terms of auc too the value for the first lead time is found to be highest 0 795 followed by the second auc 0 727 and third lead time auc 0 657 similar inference can be drawn for other basins for instance in fig 7 e3 where the curve for the lead time 1 day in large sized sub basin of ganga signifies a larger probability of hit rate while the other two lead times have a lower probability larger probability of false alarm fig 8 presents the roc curves and auc values from scq which depicts results similar to the acq furthermore we observe that the temporal length of data used to set up the model has no significant influence over the discriminating ability of the forecast lead times since it remains largely the same for both acq and scq 4 4 spread skill analysis of the ensemble qpfs in this section we compare the spread skill of the model generated 300 ensemble members of acq and scq with the available perturbed forecasts from ncmrwf having 11 ensemble members fig 9 shows the forecast error versus spread of the ensembles for acq and scq along with the ncmrwf perturbed forecast for the lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days from the figure we observe that the ncmrwf perturbed ensemble contain high forecast error with minimal spread this is evident since the scatter points are located close to the y axis in all three lead times on the other hand the acq and scq are located along the diagonal 1 1 line suggesting good agreement between the magnitude of the error and spread of ensemble closer inspection of the plot suggests that the spread skill of scq is comparatively better than that of the scq across all three lead times the majority of the scatter points of acq are situated to the left side of the diagonal while those of the acq is well coinciding with the diagonal overall the results show that compared to the perturbed ensemble forecasts from ncmrwf the calibrated qpfs acq and scq have a significantly better spread of ensemble along with low forecast error moreover between acq and scq the spread skill of scq is higher 4 5 evaluation of the calibrated qpfs at the grid scale here the performance of the gridded calibrated forecasts both acq and scq in each basin is evaluated using the spatial maps bias percent and crps at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days please note that the evaluation is presented only for the monsoon season in both the cases of acq and scq 4 5 1 evaluation using spatial maps fig 10 presents the results of the calibrated qpfs in form of spatial maps at the gridded scale showing the gridded ncmrwf raw forecast a1 a3 imerg observation b1 b3 and rpp calibrated mean qpfs from acq c1 to c3 and scq d1 to d3 the primary aim of applying the post processing method is to bring the forecast closer to the observation visual inspection of fig 10 shows that rpp is capable of bringing the qpfs closer to the observation at all the basins throughout the lead times the acq shows higher values at upper part of the ganga basin which contains mountainous regions whereas the scq calibrated forecasts shows a spatially matching pattern with the imerg the pattern of higher values of precipitation observed in the north eastern part of ganga basin has been maintained by the scq calibrated qpfs the western part of the ganga basin attributes to lower precipitation as its farther away from the bay of bengal the similar pattern of lower precipitation is maintained in the acq and scq which explains that rpp can manage to produce calibrated forecasts even using forecasts containing excessive zero values in the time series the raw forecasts of a1 to a3 show overestimated values of up to 80 mm day at some places while imerg ranges from 0 to 22 mm day the application of rpp on each grid through acq and scq is capable of bringing the calibrated forecasts to the same range as observation i e 0 22 mm day 4 5 2 evaluation using percentage bias fig 11 shows the spatial plot of gridded bias percent of the raw qpf a1 a3 acq b1 b3 and scq c1 c3 at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for all the five river basins we observe high spatial variability in the bias of the raw deterministic forecasts as seen in fig 11 a1 a3 with bias values ranging from 50 400 the upper part of the ganga basin is showing high spatial variability if bias in comparison to the other basins large bias over the northern ganga basin could be attributed to the presence of mountainous regions orographic influence complex topography and frequent events of extreme precipitation further results suggest that the acq obtained after post processing the raw annual qpf shows improvement in the bias percent as depicted in fig 11 b1 b3 for majority of the grids the bias values decrease to 40 to 40 as compared to the bias of raw qpf 50 400 furthermore in the case of scq we observe a significant reduction in the bias percent as shown in fig 11 c1 c3 the bias for the majority of grids is in a narrow range of 10 40 which means that calibration of the raw forecast using seasonal data for gridded precipitation performs better than the calibration using annual data moreover this also suggests that the quality of the calibrated qpfs on gridded data with higher resolution depends upon the length of data and not necessarily on the location and size of the area under study both acq and scq performs similarly throughout all three lead times 1 day 3 day and 5 day suggesting ability of the rpp model to produce calibrated qpfs with less bias even at higher lead times 4 5 3 evaluation using crps the crpss are estimated based on the 300 ensemble members generated using the post processing approach for both the annual and seasonal calibrated qpfs fig 12 shows the spatial plot of mean crps of the gridded raw qpf a1 a3 acq b1 b3 and scq c1 c3 at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for all the basins for the raw ncmrwf gridded qpfs the mean crps varies from 0 to 65 mm for all three lead times the higher raw mean crps values are observed in the lower godavari basin and north eastern ganga basin further the results show that the raw gridded qpfs have significantly improved upon applying rpp for both acq and scq the range of crps has reduced to 0 20 mm after calibration as opposed to 0 65 mm before calibration suggesting reasonable performance of the post processing approach fig 12 b1 to b3 show increase in crps values with increasing lead times while scq fig 12 c1 to c3 is showing similar variability in crps throughout all the three lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 day moreover the fig 12 depicts that the scq calibrated gridded forecasts is performing better than the acq calibrated gridded forecasts 5 discussion the rainfall post processing approach applied in this study shows promising performance in improving the quality of the raw qpfs over the five river basins located across diverse landscapes in india results show that the approach is successfully able to reduce the bias in both the cases of acq and scq at both gridded and sub basin level the spatial plots and the line plots of the sub basin averaged results suggest that the bias has significantly reduced in scq close to zero compared to acq the reason for the better performance of the seasonal calibrated qpf could be that ncmrwf produces better forecasts for monsoon precipitation in india the distribution of both forecast and observed precipitation data in monsoon period is very different than the non monsoon period representing both monsoon and non monsoon data in a single run acq is inadequate moreover the calibrated qpfs also show significantly reduced crps for both acq and scq however the difference between the crpss of acq and scq is much less as opposed to the results from bias percentage scq showed considerably less bias compared to acq the crpss of both acq and scq are comparable when observed using spatial plots however when observed using the line plots we find that the scq performs slightly better than the acq this reiterates the fact that the post processor is more skillful and produces reliable ensemble forecasts with seasonal rainfall data having less zero rainfall values further the roc plots used to evaluate the ability of the calibrated qpfs to discriminate between the events hit rate probability and non events false alarm probability of precipitation show that the shorter lead times day 1 have greater ability to discriminate between events with respect to the longer lead times day 3 and day 5 moreover we observe that the discrimination performance of the calibrated forecasts increases with the increase in the size of the sub basin which indicates that the size of the basin influences the performance of the calibrated qpfs furthermore we observe that the discriminating ability of acq and scq are largely similar across the lead times and the various sub basin size this inference suggests that the temporal length of the data has no significant influence over the discriminating ability of the forecast lead times further we analyze the spread skill of the calibrated ensembles of both acq and scq by comparing them with the perturbed ensemble forecasts from ncmrwf and find that the acq and scq have considerably better ability to represent the forecast errors than the ncmrwf perturbed forecasts moreover between acq and scq the spread skill of scq is found to be better in addition to applying the rpp at the sub basin scale we also implemented the same at the individual grids of each basin upon analysis we find that similar to the observations made at the sub basin scale rpp is well able to produce calibrated qpfs at the gridded scale this suggests that the spatial scale involved in the post processing approach have minimal role in the changes of results however we observe that the change in seasonal length of data does have a significant role to play at the gridded scale for instance the calibrated qpfs performed relatively better when only the seasonal data is provided to the model as opposed to the annual data consequently at the gridded scale scq is found to be closer to the observation compared to acq one of the main reasons behind such an observation could be the presence of larger number of zero values in annual data compared to that of the seasonal data overall results show that the post processing approach is successful in preserving the spatial variation in calibrated qpfs from both annual and seasonal runs located across varied topography in india at both the sub basin as well as the gridded scale in this study we also evaluate the results of the sub basin with those at the gridded scale to understand the influence of spatial resolution data length and lead times on the performance of the rpp we observe that the performance of rpp does not depend upon the spatial scale of the data however its performance shows limitation when larger number of days with zero precipitation dry days are present in the data 6 conclusions availability of skillful and bias free precipitation forecasts are essential at the sub basin level for water management and decision making in this study we attempt to statistically post process deterministic qpfs obtained from the ncmrwf model and produce calibrated qpfs to this end a bayesian joint probability model is applied to the gridded and sub basin averaged precipitation over five river basins and lead times the model is run using the raw qpfs at two temporal lengths annual and seasonal to produce 300 reliable ensemble members of both acq and scq the spatio temporal correlations in the ensemble members of both acq and scq are further adjusted corresponding to the correlations observed in the historical observation data using the schaake shuffle the calibration of the raw qpfs is carried out for all the grids and the 177 sub basins of various sizes across five major river basins of india having diverse climatic and hydrological characteristics results show that the calibrated forecasts are less biased more skillful and more reliable than the deterministic forecast specifically the performance of seasonal calibrated qpf is better than that of the annual calibrated qpf moreover the calibrated qpfs can discriminate the extreme daily precipitation events and non events regardless of the size of the sub basins further in terms of the spread skill forecast error vs ensemble spread of forecasts we find that the skill of calibrated acq and scq is significantly better when compared to the available ncmrwf perturbed forecast with 11 ensemble members upon analysis of the results at the grid scale we find that the post processing approach works well using the data at the gridded scale this shows that the approach does not significantly depends upon the spatial scale however we observe that the presence of larger zero values in the annual data influences the results at the grid scale results from scq are comparatively better compared to those from acq in terms of lead times results at both the spatial scales shows deterioration in performance with increase in the lead times the study is significant since it generates daily calibrated qpfs at the sub basin scale which can be helpful to policy makers for streamflow forecasting reservoir operations and issuing warnings regarding flood the study area selected in the study is significantly dense in population where majority of the livelihood depends upon agriculture the post processing approach can be used to provide timely and reliable agro met advisory services to minimize crop loss the post processing approach can be further applied to a wide range of hydrological research future work will investigate the capability of the approach for grid based precipitation at fine spatial resolution moreover the efficacy of the approach can also be evaluated for producing continuous precipitation data with efficient forecasting skills at rain gauges credit authorship

operational in australia is used for the first time in india throughout diverse geographical extent the work evaluates how the post processor can be used in a summer monsoon dominated region like india the study informs whether annual or seasonal precipitation forecasts should be used as the length of data will play crucial role in both the cases the spread skill of the ensembles obtained from bjp approach and the ncmrwf is explored new hydrological insights for the region introduction of the bjp based post processing approach in india could help the forecast community to implement more robust approach in improving the skills of the forecasts our results show that instead of using the data of whole year only monsoonal precipitation forecasts are adequate to setup the bjp approach the calibrated forecasts obtained using three years of hindcast and observations data at grids and at the centroid of 177 sub basins are found to be more skillful the calibrated forecasts can discriminate between extreme and low precipitation events and have appropriate ensemble spread to capture precipitation peaks this study presents a guideline for water managers and forecasters to apply bjp approach to improve the forecasts graphical abstract ga1 keywords bayesian post processing precipitation forecasts indian summer monsoon ensembles ncmrwf sub basin scale data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfall exhibits high variability in magnitude frequency and distribution across space and time singhal et al 2022a singhal and jha 2021a india is largely dependent on precipitation for its economic growth and sustenance hence for a country like india the availability of precipitation forecasts is vital each year rainfall events of varying intensities cause floods in large part of the country during the monsoon months of june july august and september jjas leading to numerous casualties displacement of people and loss of property ray et al 2021 roxy et al 2017 reliable precipitation forecasts can help in issuing floods related warnings effective management of water resources and consequently inform better decision making singhal et al 2022b the quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs which are obtained from numerical weather prediction nwp models are primary estimations of a possible precipitation event in a region a few days or weeks in advance ahmed et al 2014 froude 2010 tian et al 2019 the deterministic qpfs obtained from the nwp models are single valued forecasts which represent a single best possible state of future weather deterministic qpfs often contain errors since single valued forecasts are unable to capture the uncertainty involved with weather patterns jha et al 2018 on the other hand probabilistic forecasts with several forecast members have the potential to represent multiple possible states of weather and thus capture the weather uncertainty however the disadvantage of producing ensemble forecasts using nwp models is that they are computationally very expensive when required for large areas and at long lead times and also the spread of ensemble is generally too narrow ramos et al 2013 schepen et al 2018 shrestha et al 2015 moreover the raw probabilistic forecasts are unsuitable to be used since they contain inherent systematic bias due to uncertainty in both the assimilation and physical parameterization processes of nwp models buizza 2018 maraun et al 2015 saminathan et al 2021 the nwp models are also influenced by the formulation horizontal vertical resolutions and the initial conditions of the model which influences the quality of the qpfs bowler et al 2008 nipen and stull 2011 therefore it is essential to post process the raw forecasts with statistical models before using them for operational purposes statistical post processing approaches are computationally inexpensive quick and easy to apply and capture the weather uncertainty quite well shrestha et al 2015 verkade et al 2013 yagli et al 2020 however statistical post processing of rainfall forecasts still remains a challenging task several statistical post processing approaches have been developed and implemented in the past to improve the skill of the raw forecast such as the analog method hamill and whitaker 2006 linear and non linear regression clark and hay 2004 verkade et al 2013 logistic regression hamill et al 2006 medina et al 2019 saminathan et al 2021 extended logistic regression roulin and vannitsem 2012 bayesian theory and fuzzy probability cai et al 2019 ensemble model output statistics emos approach gneiting et al 2005 li et al 2019 and copula based post processing techniques li et al 2021 however problems arising due to the irregular nature of precipitation large values of zero rainfall reduction of forecast skill with the increase in lead times and seasonal variations in rainfall patterns need to be addressed an approach based on joint probability of forecasts and long historical observations has been developed which has gained credible recognition in the field of statistical post processing the basic aim of this approach is to produce calibrated forecasts by establishing a joint probability distribution between forecasts as predictors and the observation data as predictands robertson et al 2013 wang et al 2009 previous studies suggest that the joint probability based distribution approaches offer advantage over the other post processing approaches li et al 2017 however to the best of our knowledge the potential of this approach to obtain calibrated forecasts is yet to be explored over india more recent analysis suggests that neglecting rainfall seasonality in post processing methods can produce forecasts that contain seasonal biases and display poorer skill wang et al 2019 in india the strong seasonality of precipitation due to the monsoon adds an additional challenge to the post processing of rainfall many previous applications of post processing methods where short records of nwp is used neglect the effects of rainfall seasonality shrestha et al 2016 however in case where the forecast data is available only for a small period it becomes a very interesting and challenging exercise to check if a post processor can still improve the forecasts the bayesian modelling based post processing approaches have been demonstrated to successfully generate skillful forecasts with shorter records of data for instance robertson et al 2013 used the rainfall post processing approach over murray darling basin australia to obtain calibrated forecasts using 20 months of data shrestha et al 2015 used 21 months of data to produce calibrated forecasts for different catchments of australia jha et al 2018 used 3 years of data for obtaining calibrated forecasts for a canadian basin hence the rpp model used in this manuscript has already been proven to be effective in producing skillful forecasts by obtaining parameters even from shorter data records moreover the results presented in the manuscript incorporated sampling variability while computing the verification measures this is done by applying bootstrapping approach with 5000 times sampling of the data records while calculating the uncertainties this gives a confidence about the robustness of the calibrated forecasts and justifies its ability to calibrate forecasts from operational agencies this study sets up the bayesian joint probability bjp model based rainfall post processing approach developed by robertson et al 2013 over five major river basins of india the main aim of the study is to post process the deterministic raw qpfs obtained from the national centre for medium range weather forecasting ncmrwf to produce ensembles calibrated qpfs for five daily lead times at sub basin scale the study has also been extended to establish the rpp model using the gridded ncmrwf forecasts applying rpp at the grid scale helps us to understand the influence of spatial resolution data length and lead times on the performance of the model ncmrwf is the national weather forecast center of india which performs medium range global assimilation and rainfall forecasts in real time at the spatial scale of 0 18 0 12 the calibrated qpfs are subsequently verified with the satellite derived integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg precipitation product das et al 2022 kumar singh et al 2019 li et al 2018 prakash et al 2018 prior to post processing the historical imerg rainfall are interpolated to same spatial scale as the ncmrwf forecasts which is 0 18 0 12 for the application of rpp on sub basin level the forecasts and observation data are interpolated to the centroid of each of the 177 sub basins following the sub basin average method two experiments are performed at each sub basin and gridded level to evaluate the performance of the approach in incorporating the seasonal behavior of rainfall in india in the first experiment we apply the post processor to calibrate the annual precipitation forecasts containing both the dry and wet season dry season mostly contains zero rainfall while in the second experiment we focus on calibrating the forecasts of the wet season jjas alone please note that although the input data provided to the model is annual we extract and present the results for the monsoon season only the study is important as it provides a reliable avenue to obtain daily calibrated qpfs both at the sub basin and the gridded scale which can help in streamflow forecasting flood warning agro met advisories and other related decision making the specific objectives of the study are 1 to set up a bjp model based post processing approach over the five river basins of india to produce sub basin averaged calibrated qpfs at 5 day lead times 2 to assess the performance of the post processing approach in producing the annual calibrated qpfs acq using the corresponding raw deterministic forecast 3 to evaluate the performance of post processing in producing seasonal calibrated qpfs scq using the corresponding raw deterministic forecast 4 to investigate the quality of the forecasts at varying rainfall intensities for both acq and scq 5 to investigate the potential of calibrated qpfs to reliably discriminate the precipitation events and non events for both acq and scq 6 to extend the study to gridded level and evaluate the gridded calibrated qpfs based on accuracy and skill of the forecasts 7 to examine the accuracy and spread of the post processed ensemble forecasts by comparing them to the available perturbed ensemble forecasts from ncmrwf for both acq and scq the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the details related to the study area and datasets section 3 describes the methodology implemented to post process the precipitation forecasts section 4 presents the results of post processing along with their evaluation section 5 discusses the results and section 6 deals with conclusions and the future scope of this study 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the study area includes five major river basins of india which are ganga godavari mahanadi narmada and tapti as depicted in fig 1 these rivers cover approximately 60 of the total geographical area of india and contribute to the major water availability in the country the ganga river originates in the high elevation region of uttarakhand and confluences into the bay of bengal in the east with elevation reaching up to 7000 m the river makes the northern part of india a highly fertile zone due to which agriculture becomes the predominant source of livelihood for most of the population further the narmada tapti and mahanadi basins are located in the central part of the country having lower elevation ranges while the godavari river basin is located in peninsular india characterized by some areas of higher elevation the basins receive most of the precipitation during the indian summer monsoon season singh and jha 2021 previous studies suggest that frequencies of higher magnitude precipitation in the region are increasing ghosh et al 2012 guhathakurta and revadekar 2017 which have led to frequent floods lakshmi et al 2019 the distribution of the 177 sub basins are as follows ganga comprises of the maximum sub basins 88 followed by godavari 50 mahanadi 20 tapti 10 and narmada 9 more details about the various river basins are presented in table 1 2 2 datasets the deterministic precipitation forecast obtained from ncmrwf and satellite derived data from imerg are used in this study the qpf from ncmrwf is used at the daily temporal resolution available at lead times of 1 5 days while the spatial resolution of the data is 0 18 x 0 12 moreover imerg v6 dataset is currently available at a spatial resolution of 0 1 x 0 1 and a half hour temporal resolution both the observation and forecast datasets are used over a time period of july 2018 to september 2021 more details of the datasets are provided in table 2 the half hour period 3imerghh data is aggregated to obtain the daily data and upscaled to the same resolution as ncmrwf i e 0 18 x 0 12 previous studies have found that upscaling of rainfall datasets do not significantly influence their characteristics or lead to possible loss of information due to the change in resolution imhoff et al 2020 nicótina et al 2008 the final data set for the observed rainfall contains 101 points in x direction 142 points in y direction with a total of 14 342 grids over the domain further both the datasets are interpolated at the centroid of each sub basin following the weighted area average method singh et al 2021 singhal and jha 2021b consequently a time series of rainfall at each sub basin is obtained after interpolation we also use the available perturbed ensemble forecasts from ncmrwf which comprises 11 ensemble members for comparison with the post processing generated forecast 3 methods in this section we first provide a brief description of the post processing approach followed by the utilization of the schaake shuffle technique and details about the metrics to verify the calibrated qpfs please note that each of the steps involved here is applied to obtain both the acq and scq in this study 3 1 the post processing approaches the post processing approach developed by robertson et al 2013 is a bjp model based statistical rainfall post processor that establishes a joint probability distribution between the raw qpfs and the corresponding observation data to produce calibrated qpfs the working principle of the post processing approach is based on three steps 1 transform the non normal distribution of the precipitation data forecast and observation into a bivariate normal distribution using the log sinh transformation eqs 1 and 2 2 infer the relevant parameters to model the joint probability of raw qpfs and observations which maximizes the likelihood of posterior parameter distribution and 3 back transform the forecast values to their original space 1 x fcst 1 β fcst sinh α fcst β fcst x 2 y obs 1 β obs sinh α obs β obs y where x fcst y obs represent the forecast and observation in transformed space the parameters involved in this transformation are represented by α fcst β fcst and α obs β obs for the forecast and observation respectively after transformation x fcst y obs is assumed to follow a bivariate normal distribution given as x fcst y obs n μ σ p x fcst y obs n μ σ where σ and μ are defined as μ μ x fcst μ y obs σ σ x fcst 2 ρ x fcst ρ y obs σ x fcst σ y obs ρ x fcst ρ y obs σ x fcst σ y obs σ 2 y obs μ x fcst σ x fcst 2 and μ y obs σ 2 y obs represent the mean and standard deviation of the observation and forecast respectively and ρ x fcst ρ y obs is the correlation coefficient between x fcst and y obs the set of nine parameters used in modelling the joint distribution is the following s α fcst β fcst μ x fcst σ x fcst 2 α obs β obs μ y obs σ 2 y obs ρ x fcst ρ y obs the set of nine parameters is estimated using the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1994 based on maximizing the likelihood of the posterior distribution once the parameters are estimated the bivariate normal distribution conditioned on the raw qpfs is used to estimate the forecasts the forecast ensembles generation is done by randomly sampling from the conditional distribution the back transformation of the forecast values is done by using the inverse of x fcst and ŷ obs inverse of eqs 1 and 2 3 2 cross validation of calibrated forecasts in order to evaluate the performance of the post processor we adopt a leave one month out cross validation procedure in this procedure the data except for the left out month is used to estimate the parameters of the bjp model using the estimated parameters the precipitation for all the days of the left out month is estimated and verified with the corresponding observation data the procedure is repeated until all the available raw qpfs are calibrated 3 3 schaake shuffle the schaake shuffle is a technique that is applied to regain spatial co variability between neighboring locations and temporal persistence in predicted precipitation that are lost during the post processing of data from the nwp models schaake et al 2007 the steps involved in schaake shuffle are as follows i a forecast date is chosen and a sample of observation data is selected the observation sample and the ensemble have the same size selected from an observation period in the past ii the observation sample chosen above in step 1 is ranked in ascending order the ranking procedure is repeated similarly for the ensemble forecast data iii a date is chosen from the sample dataset of the observations subsequently the ranks of the observation sample are identified iv from the ensemble set of the forecasts a forecast having the same rank as that of the selected observations is chosen and v the steps 3 4 are repeated for all ensemble members 3 4 verification measures in this study we use various measures to verify the efficacy of the post processing method the measures used are bias percentage bias continuous rank probability score crps root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse relative operating characteristic roc and the spread skill analysis 3 4 1 bias percentage bias bias calculates the difference between the mean of the ensemble precipitation forecasts and the mean of the observations bias is defined as the percentage deviation of the mean of calibrated forecasts from the observations as shown in eq 3 3 bias 1 t f x fcst t 1 t f y obs t 1 t f y obs t 100 here x fcst could either be raw x rawfcst or post processed forecasts x fcst and y obs represents observation 3 4 2 continuous rank probability score crps the crps compares the cumulative distribution function cdf of the forecast f x fcst with the corresponding cdf of the observation f y obs 4 crps f x fcst t f y obs t 2 dt crps reduces to mean absolute error for deterministic qpfs and allows efficient comparison between ensemble and deterministic forecasts smaller values of crps are favorable closer to zero meaning that the forecasts are accurate and vice versa 3 4 3 root mean square error rmse rmse gives the standard deviation of the model prediction error and a smaller rmse value indicates better performance of the presented model 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n f x fcst t f y obs t 2 here x fcst could either be raw x rawfcst or post processed forecasts x fcst 3 4 4 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the nse is a normalized statistics that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance noise compared to the measured variance 6 nse 1 1 t f y obs t f x fcst t f x fcst t f y obs t y ˆ obs is the true mean of observation nse ranges from inf to 1 and values equal to 1 indicates a perfect match of the forecast to the observed data nse 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data inf nse 0 indicates that the observed mean is better predictor than the model 3 4 5 relative operating characteristic roc roc curves are used to evaluate the ability of a forecasting method to distinguish between events and non events and plot the hit rate against the false alarm rate the hit rate refers to the probability of a forecast to detect events that exceed a predefined precipitation threshold while the false alarm rate refers to the probability of a forecast predicting erroneous events robbins and titley 2018 for a skillful calibrated forecast hit rates are expected to exceed the false alarm rates and the roc curves are closer to the top left corner of the plot on the other hand the detecting ability of the forecast is considered low when the roc curves are closer to the diagonal the area under curve auc is calculated for each roc curve to distinguish the measure of separability the auc is expected to be higher than 0 6 for better distinguishing separate events 3 4 6 spread skill analysis the aim of the spread skill analysis is to compare the spread in forecast ensembles with the forecast error nester et al 2012 the forecast error is defined as the difference between the observations and the ensemble mean in this study we perform the spread skill analysis between the available 11 forecast members of the perturbed ncmrwf and the 300 generated members of acq and scq arranging them in increasing order followed by their grouping into ten bins consequently the average ensemble spread and forecast error from each bin is plotted 3 5 implementation of rpp in this study we apply rpp to obtain the calibrated qpfs over the indian river basins at two spatial scales i e at the centroids of each sub basin and at each individual grids to this end we analyse the performance of the rpp to post process monsoonal precipitation using two experiments at each of the two spatial scales first using the annual data producing acq and second with seasonal data producing scq for both the gridded and sub basin averaged precipitation the annual run used sub basin averaged forecast and observation precipitation at each sub basins for a period of 39 months from july 2018 to september 2021 whereas for seasonal run of rpp monsoon season june july august and september data of year 2019 2021 is used for validation a leave one month out cross validation strategy is applied as the data record used is of smaller time period specifically one month data is left for validation while data from other months are used for parameter estimation and optimization once the parameters are obtained the left one month data is used to produce calibrated forecasts with 300 ensemble members this is repeated for the five lead times of the ncmrwf forecast data at each sub basins of the study area it is noteworthy that the annual experiment uses annual data producing acq however for better comparison with scq we extract and present the results for monsoon season only the rpp calibrated qpfs at the sub basin scale are evaluated using the measures of bias percentage and crps the discriminating ability of the calibrated qpfs are investigated in terms of hit rate and false alarm rate using a precipitation threshold of 5 mm finally the spread skill of the calibrated ensemble forecasts is analyzed with respect to the available perturbed ensemble forecast from ncmrwf each of the mentioned evaluations is undertaken for both acq and scq at the lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days the rpp calibrated qpfs at the grid scale are evaluated using bias percentage and crps 4 results 4 1 evaluation of the calibrated qpfs at the sub basin scale here the performance of the calibrated forecasts in each sub basin acq and scq is evaluated using the measures of bias percent and crps at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days please note that the evaluation presented is for the monsoon season only in both cases of acq and scq 4 1 1 evaluation using percentage bias fig 2 shows the spatial plot of sub basin averaged bias percent of the raw qpf a1 a3 acq b1 b3 and scq c1 c3 at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for all the 177 sub basins we observe high spatial variability in the bias of the raw deterministic forecast as depicted in fig 2 a1 a3 the range of bias is also large with it ranging between 95 to 300 moreover we find greater variability among the sub basins of the ganga river western tapti and western godavari basins as opposed to the sub basins of other areas in all three lead times large bias over these sub basins could be attributed to the presence of mountainous regions orographic influence complex topography and frequent events of extreme precipitation further results suggest that the acq obtained after post processing the raw annual qpf shows improvement in the bias percent as depicted in fig 2 b1 b3 for the majority of the sub basins the bias values have decreased 20 to 20 as compared to the bias of raw qpf 95 300 in the case of acq the bias throughout the sub basins shows overestimation of precipitation values mostly in ganga and mahanadi basins with bias 5 10 and under estimation in all other sub basins with bias less than 3 furthermore in the case of scq we observe a significant reduction in the bias percent as shown in fig 2 c1 c3 the scqs show better performance in all three lead times however we find very few sub basins showing overestimation of the values at lead times 3 day and 5 day furthermore the majority of the sub basins show bias in the narrow range of 5 5 which means that calibration of the raw forecast using seasonal data performs better than the calibration using annual data moreover this also suggests that the quality of the calibrated qpf depends upon the length of data and not necessarily on the location and size of the area under study fig 3 shows the bias plots of the raw deterministic qpf acq and scq at the lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 day for the godavari larger basin and narmada smaller basin at 5 and 95 confidence intervals in both the basins we observe that the post processing approach is well able to reduce the bias in the raw qpf specifically in the case of godavari fig 3 a1 a3 we see that the bias in raw qpf has a large range between the positive and negative values in all three lead times from the calibrated results we observe that the performance of both acq and scq improves the quality of qpfs scq shows a relatively straight line originating near the zero bias mark and running as a straight line parallel to the x axis denoting stable and skillful generation of forecast across all the fifty sub basins similar observations can be made for all three lead times in contrast the acq performs better than the raw qpf however the results are slightly underestimated compared to the scq the 5 and 95 confidence intervals around both acq and scq show a decrease when compared to that of the raw qpf hence a narrow shaded area furthermore in the case of narmada fig 3 b1 b3 we observe nearly similar results to those observed for the godavari basin the raw qpf varies within a large range of positive and negative values which slightly increases with the increase in lead times compared to the godavari basin the acq of the narmada performs better less biased more stable however it is still underestimated when compared to the acq overall results from both the river basins suggest that the bias becomes least in scq which is followed by acq 4 1 2 evaluation using crps the crpss are estimated based on the 300 ensemble members generated using the post processing approach for both annual and seasonal calibrated qpfs fig 4 shows the spatial plot of sub basin averaged crps of the raw qpf a1 a3 acq b1 b3 and scq c1 c3 at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for all the 177 sub basins results show that in the case of raw qpf the crpss vary within 0 40 mm for all three lead times higher crps are observed in the godavari river basin bottom half of the sub basins while in the majority of the other sub basins it ranges between 5 and 20 mm only the finding remains the same in all three lead times with small variations further the results show that the raw qpfs have significantly improved upon calibration in both the cases of acq and scq the range of crps has reduced to 0 8 mm after calibration as opposed to 0 40 mm before calibration suggesting reasonable performance of the post processing approach the majority of the sub basins are within a narrow range of 0 5 mm while some sub basins in the upper ganga and western godavari show a higher range of crps 5 8 mm moreover the fig 4 shows that the spatial variability of crps of acq and scq are almost similar which is contrary to the results observed using bias percentage fig 5 shows the crps plots of the raw deterministic qpf along with acq and scq at the lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for the godavari and narmada river basins at 5 and 95 confidence intervals visual inspection suggests that the post processing approach is successful in reducing the crps in both the basins for both acq and scq specifically in the godavari basin fig 5 a1 a3 we find that the crps of raw qpf fluctuates between 7 and 35 mm among the sub basins the results show that the crps has significantly reduced in the case of both acq and scq upon post processing of the raw qpf moreover the plots of acq and scq are less differentiated and are located within close proximity however we find that scq performs slightly better than acq in all three lead times furthermore in the case of narmada fig 5 b1 b3 we observe similar results as the calibrated qpfs perform reasonably well as compared to the raw qpf the crps of the raw qpf is in higher range 8 15 mm while the calibrated qpfs acq and scq are observed in a narrow range of 2 5 mm similar to the observation in the case of the godavari basin the post processing approach shows comparable crps between acq and scq however the performance of scq is slightly better for all the sub basins of the narmada river 4 2 evaluation of qpfs at varying intensities in this section the performance of the calibrated forecasts acq and scq is evaluated at varying intensities at each sub basin using the multiple error statistics such as rmse bias and nse at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days the thresholds t of varying intensities are taken by carefully studying the daily sub basin averaged observation data for the selected time period to keep around 10 15 and 25 data values above the higher thresholds t 10 mm t 15 mm and t 20 mm per day are selected respectively according to that the precipitation values are equally divided by taking five threshold values of t 0 mm t 5 mm t 10 mm t 15 mm and t 20 mm per day fig 6 presents the spatial plots of error statistics calculated for sub basin averaged raw forecast from ncmrwf and qpfs from acq and scq in comparison with observation imerg at each sub basin using the t values for convenience the results are presented for precipitation of lead time day 1 at the five river basins of ganga godavari mahanadi narmada and tapti in fig 9 a1 to a5 b1 to b5 and c1 to c5 presents rmse calculated with observation for raw forecasts acq and scq at t 0 mm t 5 mm t 10 mm t 15 mm and t 20 mm per day respectively similarly results for bias and nse are presented in the next six columns d1 to i5 of the figure the collective understanding of fig 9 shows that the values from each error statics increases with increasing intensity of rainfall fig 6 a1 to a5 shows increasing rmse values with increasing intensity of the precipitation and varies between 20 and 70 mm day the rmse presented for acq fig 6 b1 to b5 and scq fig 6 c1 to c5 show lower rmse values ranging from 0 to 40 mm day increasing with higher intensities furthermore the bias values of raw forecast show increased negative bias with increasing intensities of rainfall fig 6 d1 to d5 the calibrated qpfs from both acq and scq show underestimation of the precipitation values at higher intensities fig 6 e1 to f5 similarly nse also supports that the acq and scq calibrated qpfs are underestimated at higher intensities of precipitation 4 3 evaluation of the discriminating ability of the calibrated qpfs in this section we use the roc plots to evaluate the ability of the calibrated qpfs to discriminate the precipitation events among the different sizes of the sub basin the sizes of the sub basins depend upon the smallest moderate and largest area in the respective river basins of godavari mahanadi narmada tapti and ganga precipitation of more than 80th percentile for each sub basin averaged daily precipitation is selected as the threshold for both annual and seasonal calibration at the lead times of 1 3 and 5 days fig 7 and fig 8 show the roc curves for the calibrated qpfs for events of precipitation greater than 80th percentile for each sub basin to produce acqs and scqs respectively the figures show that the post processed forecasts can discriminate between the events and non events in most sub basins in both the cases of acq fig 7 and scq fig 8 we observe that the roc curves are closer to the top left corner of the plot for the lead time 1 thus indicating a good ability of forecasts to discriminate between precipitation events however as the lead time increases the curves begin to move towards the diagonal thus representing a lower discriminating ability of lead timeat 3 day and 5 day when the daily precipitation is more than 80th percentile for instance in fig 7 b1 we find that the curve of lead time 1 is closer to the top left corner of the plot denoting a higher hit rate than false alarm rate while the curves of the other two lead times are closer to the diagonal in terms of auc too the value for the first lead time is found to be highest 0 795 followed by the second auc 0 727 and third lead time auc 0 657 similar inference can be drawn for other basins for instance in fig 7 e3 where the curve for the lead time 1 day in large sized sub basin of ganga signifies a larger probability of hit rate while the other two lead times have a lower probability larger probability of false alarm fig 8 presents the roc curves and auc values from scq which depicts results similar to the acq furthermore we observe that the temporal length of data used to set up the model has no significant influence over the discriminating ability of the forecast lead times since it remains largely the same for both acq and scq 4 4 spread skill analysis of the ensemble qpfs in this section we compare the spread skill of the model generated 300 ensemble members of acq and scq with the available perturbed forecasts from ncmrwf having 11 ensemble members fig 9 shows the forecast error versus spread of the ensembles for acq and scq along with the ncmrwf perturbed forecast for the lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days from the figure we observe that the ncmrwf perturbed ensemble contain high forecast error with minimal spread this is evident since the scatter points are located close to the y axis in all three lead times on the other hand the acq and scq are located along the diagonal 1 1 line suggesting good agreement between the magnitude of the error and spread of ensemble closer inspection of the plot suggests that the spread skill of scq is comparatively better than that of the scq across all three lead times the majority of the scatter points of acq are situated to the left side of the diagonal while those of the acq is well coinciding with the diagonal overall the results show that compared to the perturbed ensemble forecasts from ncmrwf the calibrated qpfs acq and scq have a significantly better spread of ensemble along with low forecast error moreover between acq and scq the spread skill of scq is higher 4 5 evaluation of the calibrated qpfs at the grid scale here the performance of the gridded calibrated forecasts both acq and scq in each basin is evaluated using the spatial maps bias percent and crps at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days please note that the evaluation is presented only for the monsoon season in both the cases of acq and scq 4 5 1 evaluation using spatial maps fig 10 presents the results of the calibrated qpfs in form of spatial maps at the gridded scale showing the gridded ncmrwf raw forecast a1 a3 imerg observation b1 b3 and rpp calibrated mean qpfs from acq c1 to c3 and scq d1 to d3 the primary aim of applying the post processing method is to bring the forecast closer to the observation visual inspection of fig 10 shows that rpp is capable of bringing the qpfs closer to the observation at all the basins throughout the lead times the acq shows higher values at upper part of the ganga basin which contains mountainous regions whereas the scq calibrated forecasts shows a spatially matching pattern with the imerg the pattern of higher values of precipitation observed in the north eastern part of ganga basin has been maintained by the scq calibrated qpfs the western part of the ganga basin attributes to lower precipitation as its farther away from the bay of bengal the similar pattern of lower precipitation is maintained in the acq and scq which explains that rpp can manage to produce calibrated forecasts even using forecasts containing excessive zero values in the time series the raw forecasts of a1 to a3 show overestimated values of up to 80 mm day at some places while imerg ranges from 0 to 22 mm day the application of rpp on each grid through acq and scq is capable of bringing the calibrated forecasts to the same range as observation i e 0 22 mm day 4 5 2 evaluation using percentage bias fig 11 shows the spatial plot of gridded bias percent of the raw qpf a1 a3 acq b1 b3 and scq c1 c3 at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for all the five river basins we observe high spatial variability in the bias of the raw deterministic forecasts as seen in fig 11 a1 a3 with bias values ranging from 50 400 the upper part of the ganga basin is showing high spatial variability if bias in comparison to the other basins large bias over the northern ganga basin could be attributed to the presence of mountainous regions orographic influence complex topography and frequent events of extreme precipitation further results suggest that the acq obtained after post processing the raw annual qpf shows improvement in the bias percent as depicted in fig 11 b1 b3 for majority of the grids the bias values decrease to 40 to 40 as compared to the bias of raw qpf 50 400 furthermore in the case of scq we observe a significant reduction in the bias percent as shown in fig 11 c1 c3 the bias for the majority of grids is in a narrow range of 10 40 which means that calibration of the raw forecast using seasonal data for gridded precipitation performs better than the calibration using annual data moreover this also suggests that the quality of the calibrated qpfs on gridded data with higher resolution depends upon the length of data and not necessarily on the location and size of the area under study both acq and scq performs similarly throughout all three lead times 1 day 3 day and 5 day suggesting ability of the rpp model to produce calibrated qpfs with less bias even at higher lead times 4 5 3 evaluation using crps the crpss are estimated based on the 300 ensemble members generated using the post processing approach for both the annual and seasonal calibrated qpfs fig 12 shows the spatial plot of mean crps of the gridded raw qpf a1 a3 acq b1 b3 and scq c1 c3 at lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 days for all the basins for the raw ncmrwf gridded qpfs the mean crps varies from 0 to 65 mm for all three lead times the higher raw mean crps values are observed in the lower godavari basin and north eastern ganga basin further the results show that the raw gridded qpfs have significantly improved upon applying rpp for both acq and scq the range of crps has reduced to 0 20 mm after calibration as opposed to 0 65 mm before calibration suggesting reasonable performance of the post processing approach fig 12 b1 to b3 show increase in crps values with increasing lead times while scq fig 12 c1 to c3 is showing similar variability in crps throughout all the three lead times of 1 day 3 day and 5 day moreover the fig 12 depicts that the scq calibrated gridded forecasts is performing better than the acq calibrated gridded forecasts 5 discussion the rainfall post processing approach applied in this study shows promising performance in improving the quality of the raw qpfs over the five river basins located across diverse landscapes in india results show that the approach is successfully able to reduce the bias in both the cases of acq and scq at both gridded and sub basin level the spatial plots and the line plots of the sub basin averaged results suggest that the bias has significantly reduced in scq close to zero compared to acq the reason for the better performance of the seasonal calibrated qpf could be that ncmrwf produces better forecasts for monsoon precipitation in india the distribution of both forecast and observed precipitation data in monsoon period is very different than the non monsoon period representing both monsoon and non monsoon data in a single run acq is inadequate moreover the calibrated qpfs also show significantly reduced crps for both acq and scq however the difference between the crpss of acq and scq is much less as opposed to the results from bias percentage scq showed considerably less bias compared to acq the crpss of both acq and scq are comparable when observed using spatial plots however when observed using the line plots we find that the scq performs slightly better than the acq this reiterates the fact that the post processor is more skillful and produces reliable ensemble forecasts with seasonal rainfall data having less zero rainfall values further the roc plots used to evaluate the ability of the calibrated qpfs to discriminate between the events hit rate probability and non events false alarm probability of precipitation show that the shorter lead times day 1 have greater ability to discriminate between events with respect to the longer lead times day 3 and day 5 moreover we observe that the discrimination performance of the calibrated forecasts increases with the increase in the size of the sub basin which indicates that the size of the basin influences the performance of the calibrated qpfs furthermore we observe that the discriminating ability of acq and scq are largely similar across the lead times and the various sub basin size this inference suggests that the temporal length of the data has no significant influence over the discriminating ability of the forecast lead times further we analyze the spread skill of the calibrated ensembles of both acq and scq by comparing them with the perturbed ensemble forecasts from ncmrwf and find that the acq and scq have considerably better ability to represent the forecast errors than the ncmrwf perturbed forecasts moreover between acq and scq the spread skill of scq is found to be better in addition to applying the rpp at the sub basin scale we also implemented the same at the individual grids of each basin upon analysis we find that similar to the observations made at the sub basin scale rpp is well able to produce calibrated qpfs at the gridded scale this suggests that the spatial scale involved in the post processing approach have minimal role in the changes of results however we observe that the change in seasonal length of data does have a significant role to play at the gridded scale for instance the calibrated qpfs performed relatively better when only the seasonal data is provided to the model as opposed to the annual data consequently at the gridded scale scq is found to be closer to the observation compared to acq one of the main reasons behind such an observation could be the presence of larger number of zero values in annual data compared to that of the seasonal data overall results show that the post processing approach is successful in preserving the spatial variation in calibrated qpfs from both annual and seasonal runs located across varied topography in india at both the sub basin as well as the gridded scale in this study we also evaluate the results of the sub basin with those at the gridded scale to understand the influence of spatial resolution data length and lead times on the performance of the rpp we observe that the performance of rpp does not depend upon the spatial scale of the data however its performance shows limitation when larger number of days with zero precipitation dry days are present in the data 6 conclusions availability of skillful and bias free precipitation forecasts are essential at the sub basin level for water management and decision making in this study we attempt to statistically post process deterministic qpfs obtained from the ncmrwf model and produce calibrated qpfs to this end a bayesian joint probability model is applied to the gridded and sub basin averaged precipitation over five river basins and lead times the model is run using the raw qpfs at two temporal lengths annual and seasonal to produce 300 reliable ensemble members of both acq and scq the spatio temporal correlations in the ensemble members of both acq and scq are further adjusted corresponding to the correlations observed in the historical observation data using the schaake shuffle the calibration of the raw qpfs is carried out for all the grids and the 177 sub basins of various sizes across five major river basins of india having diverse climatic and hydrological characteristics results show that the calibrated forecasts are less biased more skillful and more reliable than the deterministic forecast specifically the performance of seasonal calibrated qpf is better than that of the annual calibrated qpf moreover the calibrated qpfs can discriminate the extreme daily precipitation events and non events regardless of the size of the sub basins further in terms of the spread skill forecast error vs ensemble spread of forecasts we find that the skill of calibrated acq and scq is significantly better when compared to the available ncmrwf perturbed forecast with 11 ensemble members upon analysis of the results at the grid scale we find that the post processing approach works well using the data at the gridded scale this shows that the approach does not significantly depends upon the spatial scale however we observe that the presence of larger zero values in the annual data influences the results at the grid scale results from scq are comparatively better compared to those from acq in terms of lead times results at both the spatial scales shows deterioration in performance with increase in the lead times the study is significant since it generates daily calibrated qpfs at the sub basin scale which can be helpful to policy makers for streamflow forecasting reservoir operations and issuing warnings regarding flood the study area selected in the study is significantly dense in population where majority of the livelihood depends upon agriculture the post processing approach can be used to provide timely and reliable agro met advisory services to minimize crop loss the post processing approach can be further applied to a wide range of hydrological research future work will investigate the capability of the approach for grid based precipitation at fine spatial resolution moreover the efficacy of the approach can also be evaluated for producing continuous precipitation data with efficient forecasting skills at rain gauges credit authorship
