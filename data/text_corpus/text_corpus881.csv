4405,this paper presents new results of 1d 4d electrical resistivity and electromagnetic surveys for the delineation of aquifer geometry and the detection of saline paleo water uprising along structural discontinuities these geophysical surveys were undertaken at the alluvial aquifer of the oltrepò pavese plain sector po valley northern italy at the investigated test site the alluvial aquifer is strongly conditioned by the presence of an important tectonic discontinuity whose localization and trace were better defined by this study this fault is responsible for the sudden deepening that affects the bedrock and is also responsible for the uprising of deep saline paleo waters which strongly influences the chemistry of groundwater during the campaign a variety of experimental setups were tested this provided an ideal opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth provided by groundwater sampling and stratigraphic electrical conductivity temperature and redox potential logs undertaken within the wells it also permitted an assessment of the usability of electrical and electromagnetic surveys in such a complex hydrogeological setting geophysical surveys revealed the presence of sharp and irregular contact between the alluvial aquifer and the underlying bedrock this is characterized by morphological irregularities which are likely to have been shaped either by tectonics and or by the paleo river s erosion the bedrock is affected by saline water contaminations which are likely localized along structural discontinuities which represent and facilitate the flow towards the alluvial aquifer detailed 3d and time lapse imaging revealed irregular shaped shallow saline water contaminations within the alluvial aquifer as well as temporal variability of groundwater salinity spatial distribution of contaminations and salinity degree are likely to be affected by different factors like the aperture of the discontinuities within the bedrock the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer as well as seasonal variations in terms of fresh water recharge keywords electrical resistivity electromagnetics time lapse hydrogeological model aquifer geometry saline paleo water uprising vogherese fault hydro geophysics 1 introduction among various geophysical methods potentially useful in solving a wide spectrum of prospecting and investigation problems when studying aquifers e g seismic micro gravimetric and time domain electromagnetic methods electrical resistivity and electromagnetic methods are well suited geophysical techniques to investigate and partially characterize shallow aquifers there have been many applications of electrical resistivity tomography ert and electrical methods in general to characterize aquifers coscia et al 2011 kazakis et al 2016a 2016b meyerhoff et al 2014 vogelgesang et al 2020 delineate alluvial aquifer heterogeneity bowling et al 2005 thickness and bedrock structure gómez et al 2019 monitor hydraulic processes kuras et al 2009 and aquifer discharge meyerhoff et al 2012 map saline water contaminations kazakis et al 2016a 2016b rainone et al 2015 as well as detect karst features torrese 2020 sinkholes and cavities torrese et al 2021 van schoor 2002 very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em has been typically used for the identification of fracture zones for groundwater exploration jamal and singh 2018 detection of fractures in the bedrock adepelumi et al 2006 geological boundaries and shear zones faults gnaneshwar et al 2011 but it has been also applied to map groundwater condition in sedimentary basins ohwoghere asuma et al 2020 and detect leachate plumes and groundwater pollution al tarazi et al 2008 this study involves electrical resistivity and vlf em methods due to their ability in detecting conductive bodies which represent the main geophysical targets of this research project in the investigated hydrogeological setting conductive bodies are related to saline water contaminations within the alluvial aquifer or along structural discontinuities within the bedrock as well as they are related to the clayey hydrogeological bedrock if the vlf em method provides quick detection of well coupled conductive bodies electrical resistivity methods provide more accurate and complete models furthermore electrical resistivity methods allow to outline the vertical and horizontal distribution of both low e g fine grained alluvial layers and high e g coarse grained alluvial layers resistivity bodies although 1d geophysical surveys allow to define subsoil layering and main geological boundaries 2d and especially 3d surveys allow to obtain more accurate and complete geophysical models and better define aquifer heterogeneity 4d surveys usually termed time lapse surveys where the fourth dimension is time allow to monitor time varying processes such as groundwater contamination the objectives of the study are to test the suitability of 1d 4d electrical resistivity and vlf em methods for the delineation of aquifer geometry and the detection of saline paleo water uprising along structural discontinuities and to verify advantages and limitations of the methods in a complex hydrogeological setting at the investigated test site the hydrogeological clayey bedrock may be affected by morphological irregularities and saline water contaminations furthermore localized zones of the alluvial aquifer may also be affected by shallow saline water contaminations these features of the hydrogeological system which represent the main geophysical targets of the study are all related to low resistivity volumes and may show similar electrical resistivity values this could generate vertical and lateral detectability issues in identifying such hydrogeological bodies a further issue could arise from the fact that shallow saline water contaminations within the alluvial aquifer may not have a main orientation as occurs for example along structural discontinuities for this reason the vlf em method unlike electrical resistivity methods may not be able to detect such features for this purposes we have tested and compared rapid and cost effective surveys vlf em undertaken over the entire investigated area for an expeditious assessment of buried conductive bodies that could be connected to the saline water uprising and more detailed and accurate investigations 1d 4d electrical resistivity to characterize restricted areas these geophysical surveys were undertaken at the alluvial aquifer of the oltrepò pavese plain sector po valley northern italy at the investigated test site the alluvial aquifer is strongly conditioned by the presence of an important tectonic discontinuity the vogherese fault a tectonic discontinuity buried below a few tens of meters of alluvial deposits this is responsible for the sudden deepening towards the north that affects the hydrogeological bedrock substratum and is also responsible for the uprising of deep saline paleo waters these sodium chloride na cl rich waters rise along the discontinuities faults fractures in the hydrogeological bedrock and flows into the overlying alluvial aquifer this particular setting conditions the distribution of saline waters into the alluvial aquifer they are evident in the southern sector of the plain where the thickness of the aquifer is lower and so the dilution power of the fresh ground waters is reduced this contamination prevents the exploitation of the aquifer not only for drinking water supply but also for agricultural and industrial use the origin of the na cl rich waters is connected to the brines very high density fluids that are remnants of evaporated marine waters in the late messinian late miocene trapped at the bottom of the po plain aquifer conti et al 2000 the occurrence of tectonic discontinuities within the hydrogeological bedrock allows the meteoric waters first to infiltrate and leach brines then rise towards the shallow aquifer according to some authors nanni and zuppi 1986 conti et al 2000 even the compressive forces that act along the po valley margins can squeeze the brines from the marine deposits causing this uprise of saline waters pilla et al 2010 showed that contamination from saline waters is not spatially and vertically homogeneous within the alluvial aquifer as highlighted by the hydrochemical investigations early results on the study of the saline water uprising occurring in the oltrepò pavese plain aquifer have been reported by bersan et al 2010 and pilla et al 2010 this study may provide further insights into the applicability and effectiveness of electrical resistivity and electromagnetic methods in the investigation of similar complex hydrogeological contexts where the aquifer s contamination by saline water is caused by mixing of freshwaters with brines as it happens for example in the european countries belgium denmark england estonia france italy spain darling et al 1997 desiderio and rusi 2004 dever et al 2001 hinsby et al 2001 bonnesen et al 2009 marandi and vallner 2010 in kansas and texas in the usa stueber et al 1998 or where the fossil salt waters located different kilometres far from the coastline are remainder of ancient marine ingressions as for example in togo morocco and vietnam akouvi et al 2008 bouchaou et al 2009 2 very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em method the theory that underlies the very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em technique is well described in the literature paterson and ronka 1971 phillips and richards 1975 ramesh babu et al 2007 the vlf em technique is a passive method that uses radiation from worldwide ground based military radio transmitters used for navigation operating in the vlf band 15 30 khz as the primary electromagnetic em field these transmitters generate plane em waves that can induce secondary eddy currents particularly in electrically conductive elongate 2 d targets the vlf em is based on the measure of the vertical hv and horizontal ho components of the secondary field generated by lateral changes in conductivity in earth materials herein that part of the vertical field which is in phase with the horizontal field is called the in phase component that part which is out of phase with the horizontal magnetic field is called the out of phase quadrature component vlf em profiles and maps are typically returned in terms of vertical hv to horizontal ho magnetic components hv ho termed dip angle data the presence of a well coupled i e the structure must be roughly aligned towards the transmitter conductive body such as fractures and faults is related to high hv ho values vlf em anomalies produced by water bearing fractures may be very similar to those produced by moist clay filled sealed fractures beard and lutro 2000 larger anomalies are expected for saline water bearing fractures vlf em has been widely used to prospect for conductive mineral deposits paál 1965 however it has been also used for rapid near surface geological mapping gnaneshwar et al 2011 parker 1980 phillips and richards 1975 saydam 1981 ramesh babu et al 2007 sundararajan et al 2006 3 electrical resistivity methods electrical resistivity methods are based on the estimation of the electrical resistivity of the subsoil and consist in the application of direct current into the ground by means of two current electrodes and the measure of the resulting voltage via two potential electrodes the depth of investigation depends on the distance between the current electrodes the arrangement of current and potential electrodes during the measurement is dependent on the chosen electrode array most frequently used arrays are the dipole dipole wenner schlumberger and pole dipole arrays e g kneisel 2006 schrott and sass 2008 the dipole dipole dd array uses two current electrodes on one side and two potential electrodes on the other side this method is especially suitable for the detection of vertical structures as it shows high lateral resolution main disadvantages are sensitivity to high near surface resistivity szalai and szarka 2008 the wenner w array comprises four equally spaced electrodes deployed in a line in which potential electrodes are located between current electrodes the method is especially suitable for the detection of horizontal structures e g layering as it shows high vertical resolution disadvantages comprise shallower penetration and less subsurface information in comparison with the dipole dipole array szalai et al 2009 the schlumberger s configuration is similar to the wenner array potential electrode spacing is constant but current electrode spacing is logarithmically increased the method is especially appropriate for the detection of horizontal structures since it shows high vertical resolution like the wenner array the pole dipole pd array is similar to the dipole dipole array but a current electrode termed remote electrode is so far away infinite distance that its location has negligible effect on the measurements this array shows high lateral resolution and penetration depth and even if it is more susceptible to noise contamination may present a good compromise between resolution and signal strength smith 1986 to obtain a true resistivity model of the subsurface an inversion procedure is needed loke and barker 1996 the three main methods of electric resistivity surveys are resistivity depth sounding rds resistivity profiling rp and electric imaging commonly termed electrical resistivity tomography ert in the resistivity depth sounding rds electrode spacing is progressively expanded to increase the depth of investigation and measure vertical resistivity variations differently in the resistivity profiling rp a constant electrode spacing is selected that senses the subsurface to the depth of interest and this constant array is moved along a profile to measure lateral resistivity variations electrical resistivity tomography ert provides an imaging of the subsurface electrical resistivity pattern and allows identifying subsurface structures in ert which is based on a multi electrode system each of the electrodes alternatively acts as a current and potential electrode its theory cf arato et al 2014 athanasiou et al 2007 buvat et al 2013 dahlin and loke 1998 daily and owen 1991 loke et al 2003 spiegel et al 1980 and application cf cassiani et al 2009 daily et al 1992 griffiths and barker 1993 guérin and benderitter 1995 guérin et al 2004 kuras et al 2009 ritz et al 1999 torrese 2020 are well documented in geophysical literature electrical resistivity methods allow characterizing the subsurface materials in terms of their electrical properties changes in electrical resistivity correlate with variation in solid material water saturation fluid conductivity and porosity which may be used to map stratigraphic units geological structure fractures cavities groundwater and anthropogenic structures electrical resistivity methods are well suited techniques to identify and map low resistivity structures as fine grained alluvial layers e g clayey and silty cover deposits clayey or marly bedrocks aquiclude or saline water contaminations as well as high resistivity structures as coarse grained alluvial layers e g sands and gravels or fresh water saturated alluvial deposits the resistivity signature of different hydrogeological bodies depends on the size of the target in relation to its depth and on the contrast between the resistivity of the target and that of the surrounding host rock the amplitude of resistivity anomalies is an inverse function of the distance between the measurement points and the target the deeper the target the lower the reliability for the method in identifying it the depth of investigation the vertical and horizontal resolutions of electrical resistivity surveys are linked to i the electrode spacing ii the configuration array iii the quadrupole sequence iv the signal to noise ratio s n ratio v the contrast between the resistivity of the target and the surrounding rock and or background resistivity 4 geological and hydrogeological setting of the test site the test site is located in the oltrepò pavese plain sector po valley northern italy fig 1 this sector is geologically characterized by alluvial quaternary deposits that cover miocene pliocene marine deposits with very low hydraulic conductivity formed by sandy marls sandstones conglomerates gypsum rich marls and calcareous marls pellegrini and vercesi 1995 the upper quaternary sediments mainly deposited by the action of po river and apennine streams fig 1 represent the main water bearing units of the area three different hydrogeological units can be defined within the quarternary deposits pre würmian 115 ky bp alluvial deposits middle ancient alluvial deposits recent and present alluvial deposits cavanna et al 1998 pilla et al 2007 fig 1 only the latter two hydrogeological units are affected by the presence of na cl rich waters the middle ancient alluvial deposits occupy most of the oltrepò pavese plain sector and are formed by alternating sand and gravel with interbedded clays or clayey silts the recent and present alluvial deposits distributed mainly along the po river were originated by the post würmian 11 7 ky bp depositional activity of this river the most important apennine streams also contributed to the deposition of these alluvial deposits the constant presence of a clayey silty covering which has a varying maximum thickness of between 10 and 15 m in the sectors close to the apennine margin and a minimum of 2 m in the meandering area of the po river limits infiltration and influences the aquifer recharge that occurs in correspondence of the coalescent fans originating from the deposition of apennine streams pilla et al 2007 recharge contribution from the po river must be excluded in fact groundwater flow direction is towards the po river with the exception of occasional flooding events pilla et al 2007 the aquifer is a single bedded unconfined aquifer although it becomes locally and temporarily during some periods of the year confined due to the presence of the clayey silty covering the structural setting of the oltrepò pavese plain is strongly conditioned by the presence of an important tectonic discontinuity known in literature as the vogherese fault boni 1967 fig 1 this fault has a ne sw direction at a regional scale from west of casteggio to the colle of s colombano in the area of pavia plain passing across the confluence of the ticino and po rivers boni 1967 boni 1967 suggested that it is a normal fault with hanging wall to the ne up to the barbianello area here it becomes an inverse fault to the south of pinarolo folding gradually towards west north of casteggio and voghera given the absence of specific recent studies on the subject and since the definition of the fault type is outside the scope of this study the vogherese fault has always been traced as a vertical fault on the cross sections of this paper the vogherese fault is responsible for the sudden deepening that affects the bedrock in the northern sector of the oltrepò pavese plain and is also responsible for the strong variability on the thickness of the aquifer the aquifer shows a thickness of a few meters in the southern sector that represents the upper block and hundreds meters in the northern sector the lower block braga and cerro 1988 cavanna et al 1998 regione lombardia and eni divisione agip 2002 agip 1994 fig 1 there are two deep boreholes depth up to 3 000 m in the area that were drilled for oil exploration regione lombardia and eni divisione agip 2002 the casanova lonati 1 borehole fig 1 which is located on the down lifted block of the vogherese fault intercepts the underlying marine origin deposits at a depth of 275 m brackish groundwater which rises along the fault and flows into the continental deposits is intercepted by the borehole at 136 m groundwater intercepts salt waters at 400 m derived from self potential and resistivity logs as well as formation testing formation tests found sodium chloride up to a concentration of 34 4 g l in the bedrock at depths of several hundred meters the second borehole the stradella 1 borehole fig 1 which is located on the up lifted block of the fault intercepts the underlying marine deposits at a depth of only 36 m this particular setting facilitates the uprising phenomenon of saline waters which shows itself at its best in the southern sector of the plain where the aquifer is thinner here the na cl rich waters cannot be diluted by the more abundant calcium bicarbonated groundwaters this outlined setting strongly influences the chemistry of groundwater the uprising of saline waters is also facilitated by structural discontinuities localized in the bedrock of marine origin these discontinuities represent preferential flow paths for the saline waters and facilitate the flow towards the alluvial aquifer this is demonstrated by the chloride distribution within the groundwater cameron et al 2018 pilla et al 2007 2010 the existence of these mineralised waters in the oltrepò pavese area is well known since roman times in fact the waters were and still are exploited for thermal purposes s colombano al lambro miradolo terme salice terme and rivanazzano terme are the most famous spa centres located near the investigated area however this contamination may prevent the exploitation of the aquifer not only for drinking water supply but also for agricultural and industrial use 4 1 hydrochemical facies of groundwater two main hydrochemical facies can be identified within the oltrepò pavese groundwater a calcium bicarbonated hydrofacies which characterises most of the groundwater of the alluvial aquifer a sodium chloride hydrofacies which locally characterises the groundwater in some sectors of the area along the vogherese fault bersan et al 2010 pilla et al 2007 2010 the calcium bicarbonated hydrofacies has low to medium mineralisation with electrical conductivity ec values ranging between 800 and 1 200 µs cm total dissolved solids tds ranging between 550 mg l and 850 mg l it is characterised by chlorides that do not exceed 100 mg l concentrations of bicarbonates vary between 300 and 700 mg l calcium varies between 50 and 200 mg l magnesium varies between 30 and 50 mg l and sulphates vary between 30 and 100 mg l pilla et al 2010 the sodium chloride hydrofacies has a significantly higher mineralisation but extremely variable over the area with ec values that can be above 12 000 μs cm above 8 400 mg l tds and are on average between 2 000 and 4 000 μs cm tds ranging between 1 400 mg l and 2 800 mg l the ec values are related to the solubilised chloride and sodium given that the concentrations of other major ions are relatively similar to those of the calcium bicarbonated water described earlier the variability of the na cl groundwater is associated with the different degrees of mixing between the shallower fresh groundwater and the deeper saline waters brines of the po plain no correlation was observed between the variation in the degree of salinity of the water and the piezometric level of the groundwater dissolution of gypsum rich marls in the miocene pliocene formations may have contributed in part to the sulphate concentration in the groundwater as these formations are of marine origin dissolution of these units could also account in part for the increased concentrations of sodium chloride in the groundwater hydrochemical investigations have shown three areas along the vogherese fault where the phenomenon seems to be more intense and widespread fig s1 in the supporting information fig 1 the test site area to the west of barbianello where the highest concentrations above 4 000 mg l of chlorides were recorded the sectors that includes mezzanino and albaredo arnaboldi where chloride concentrations can reach 3 000 mg l and finally the area to the north of casteggio where the chlorides can exceed 12 000 mg l while the distribution of the sodium chloride groundwater is controlled by the trend of the vogherese fault at a regional scale higher variability in the distribution of the saline groundwater is observed at a local scale within the test site 5 materials and methods 5 1 data collection during the campaign a variety of geophysical surveys and experimental setups were tested the study involved both investigations to explore a long transect fig 2 a and detailed investigations to characterize a restricted area fig 2b one dimensional 1d to four dimensional 4d electrical resistivity and very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em surveys were acquired at the test site along a transect approximately 3 000 m long along the strada provinciale delle saline salt pan provincial road crossing the fault zone in a n s direction and along a shorter profile transversal to it fig 2 a very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em profile vlf em 29 fig 2 2 200 m in length was acquired in october 2010 crossing the fault zone in a n s direction four resistivity depth soundings rds 1 4 fig 2 were acquired in august 2009 rds 1 3 and in june 2010 rds 4 along roughly e w profiles a schlumberger array was used with maximum ab 2 of 147 m 215 m 410 m and 180 m for rds 1 4 respectively a resistivity profiling rp 1 fig 2 2 160 m in length was acquired in july 2009 crossing the fault zone in a n s direction and overlapping to vlf em 29 a gradient array with aligned electrodes was used two to six measurements were acquired for each section with current electrode spacing ab 80 m and potential electrode spacing mn 10 m five 2d electrical resistivity tomography ert ert 1 5 were acquired in july 2010 along an approximately 2 600 m long transect crossing the fault zone and partially overlapping to vlf em 29 and rp 1 fig 2 another ert ert 6 was acquired in june 2014 at a transversal angle to the transect each profile is 470 m in length and was obtained using 48 electrodes spaced 10 m apart ert 1 5 which are part of the surveys involved to explore the long transect were collected using a 758 wenner schlumberger ws array quadrupoles ert 6 which is part of the surveys involved to characterize a restricted area detailed investigations was collected using a 564 wenner schlumberger ws array quadrupoles and a 570 pseudo pole dipole pspd array quadrupoles the pspd array comprised a remote electrode at a distance of 440 m from the profile and at a transversal angle to it it was not possible to set the remote electrode at an infinite distance for this reason it has been termed pseudo pole dipole rather than pole dipole a hybrid h array sequence comprised of 1 134 measurements was developed by the combination of ws and pspd array sequences four three dimensional 3d ert 3d ert 1 4 surveys were acquired between 2010 and 2015 fig 2 3d ert 1 and 3d ert 2 data were collected in july 2010 and september 2010 respectively ert 3 and ert 4 data collection was undertaken in june 2013 and repeated in may 2015 to carry out a time lapse 4d analysis a surface snake grid comprised of 12 4 electrodes spaced 10 m apart both along the x and y axes was used a sequence comprising 270 quadrupoles using all feasible x y and diagonal dipole dipole array configurations was used a wadi instrument by abem was used for acquiring all em data a fully automatic multi electrode resistivity meter syscal jr switch 48 by iris instruments 400 v max output voltage 1 200 ma max output current 100 w max output power http www iris instruments com syscal juniorsw html was used for acquiring all electrical resistivity data given the presence of an extremely variable groundwater mineralisation over the area we carried out ec measures rather than total dissolved solids tds in such a context ec is especially suitable for the differentiation between calcium bicarbonated and sodium chloride hydrofacies however it is worth pointing out that tds is preferable in presence of a lower variability in water mineralization since for example calcium bicarbonated waters show a lower ec than sodium chloride waters with similar tds a pasi bfk 100 hydrostatic probe was used for measuring piezometric levels a wtw cond 3401 conductivity meter was used for acquiring electrical conductivity and temperature data and a wtw ph 340 ion was used for acquiring ph and redox potential data groundwater sampling from the wells was carried out with a cellai 504s peristaltic pump major ions were analyzed in the laboratory of università di pavia with a dionex dx 120 chromatograph while volumetric analysis was used for the determination of alkalinity 5 2 data processing and inversion a fraser filter fraser 1969 1981 was used to provide a simple scheme for semi quantitative interpretation of very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em data and obtain the equivalent current densities ogilvy and lee 1991 sundararajan et al 2006 at a constant depth which would cause a magnetic field if f i fi represents the collected data so f1 f2 f3 and f4 represent four equal spaced consecutive dip angle hv ho readings and x represents the space between each station along the profile 1 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 x is the fraser filter of those four values since x is constant it can be ignored and the fraser filter considered to be 2 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 the use of this filter allows a reduction of noise through a low pass filter and the removal of the asymmetry inherent in dip angle data the magnitudes of the currents that would have to flow at different depths to produce a given anomaly have been obtained through this filter applied for different measured intervals n x with n 1 2 3 4 5 6 kriging geostatistical gridding methods have been used to interpolate the filtered values and achieve the section shown in fig 3 a the depth of penetration p of the vlf em investigation can be estimated on average just over 20 m based on 3 3 p 500 ρ f with f used frequency ρ average shallow resistivity obtained from electrical resistivity surveys smoothing was not applied to resistivity profiling rp data fig 3b inverse resistivity profiles from resistivity depth soundings rdss fig 3c were obtained through inversion of the experimental curve electrical resistivity tomography ert data required a more robust data processing and inversion data processing involved the removal of outliers from the apparent resistivity data some problematic data with unrealistically high standard deviation high resistivity and or negative resistivity in 2d surveys were all removed from apparent data data inversion was performed using ertlab solver release 1 3 1 by geostudi astier s r l multi phase technologies llc based on tetrahedral finite element modelling fem as regards the pseudo pole dipole pspd array the exact finite location x y z coordinates of the remote electrode was considered during data processing razafindratsima and lataste 2014 robain et al 1999 instead of the infinite location of the remote electrode provided for by theoretical pole dipole pd array tetrahedral discretization was used in both forward and inverse modelling the foreground region was discretized using a 5 m cell size for all 2d and 3d erts i e half the electrode spacing to give the model high accuracy the background region was discretized using an increasing element size towards the outside of the domain according to the sequence 1 1 2 4 and 8 the foreground element size the forward modelling was performed using mixed boundary conditions dirichlet neumann and a tolerance stop criterion of 1 0e 7 for a symmetric successive over relaxation conjugate gradient ssorcg iterative solver data inversion was based on a least squares smoothness constrained approach labrecque et al 1996 noise was appropriately managed using a data weighting algorithm morelli and labrecque 1996 that allows the variance matrix after each data point iteration that was poorly fitted by the model to be adaptively changed the inverse modelling was performed using a maximum number of internal inverse preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg iterations of 5 and a tolerance stop criterion for inverse pcg iterations of 0 001 the amount of roughness from one iteration to the next was controlled to assess maximum layering a low value of reweight constant 0 1 was set with the objective of generating maximum heterogeneity the inverse resistivity models figs 4 7 10 12 were obtained by inverting the datasets acquired through single arrays or by merging and jointly inverting datasets from different arrays which can deliver better detectability and imaging and hence provide more accurate inverse models szalai et al 2009 torrese 2020 and more reliable ert imaging de la vega et al 2003 seaton and burbey 2002 inversion involved the application of homogeneous starting models that set at each node the average measured apparent resistivity value the final inverse resistivity models were chosen based on the minimum data residual or misfit error 5 3 cross validation of geophysical results with well logs the test site provided an ideal opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth the study involved six shallow water wells for irrigational purposes available at the site well 69 well 73 well 75 well 80 well 81 and well 82 fig 2 these wells were drilled prior to the present study with destructive rotary or auger techniques until the top of the impermeable bedrock all the wells are fully screened although no logs of chip samples are available and these wells do not provide accurate stratigraphic logs they still provide information regarding the depth to bedrock below alluvial deposits well 69 well 73 well 75 well 81 and well 82 located in the s sector respect to the fault trace intercept the bedrock figs 4 7 conversely well 80 located in the n sector does not intercept it piezometric level measures water sampling and analysis major ions table s1 in the supporting information and electrical conductivity ec logs have been undertaken within well 75 well 81 and well 82 fig 4 piezometric level measures water sampling and analysis major ions electrical conductivity temperature and redox potential logs have been undertaken within well 81 figs 7 9 10 11 pilla et al 2010 in this study water salinity was classified according to these classes fresh water with ec 500 μs cm slightly brackish water with ec ranging between 500 and 4 000 μs cm moderately brackish water with ec ranging between 4 000 and 8 000 μs cm highly brackish water with ec ranging between 8 000 and 12 000 μs cm saltwater with ec ranging between 12 000 and 70 000 μs cm brine with ec 70 000 μs cm table s2 in the supporting information the term saline water was used to define a highly mineralized water and includes both brackish water and saltwater water sampling and electrical conductivity logs show an extremely variable mineralisation over the test site with ec changes up to 9 000 µs cm up to 6 200 mg l tds fig 4 and fig s2 in the supporting information the variability of the na cl groundwater is associated with the different degrees of mixing between the shallower fresh groundwater and the deeper saline waters specifically well 81 resistivity and temperature logs carried out the 5th june 2013 and the 4th july 2013 as well as the redox potential log carried out the 4th july 2013 are reported in fig 7 if analyzing in detail the resistivity log undertaken the 5th june 2013 which was used for the cross validation of 3d and time lapse 4d geophysical surveys fig 7 it can be found a transition between slightly brackish groundwater 1 430 μs cm on average 1 000 mg l tds 1 10 m of depth june 2013 to underlying moderately brackish groundwater 5 262 μs cm on average 3 700 mg l tds 11 15 m of depth june 2013 at 11 m depth likewise the temperature log 5th june 2013 fig 7 shows a transition between shallower relative colder groundwater an average temperature of 12 8 c 3 10 m of depth june 2013 and deeper relative warmer groundwater an average temperature of 13 5 c 11 15 m of depth june 2013 at 11 m depth 6 results 6 1 the long transect revealing general hydrogeological setting the greater anomaly identified along very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em 29 salt waters at 400 680 m figs 3a and 5c is associated with a shallow saline water contamination i e a conductive buried bodies steeply dipping and well coupled with the em transmitter this anomaly can be identified slightly south of a strong apparent resistivity variation along resistivity profiling rp 1 at 650 m vogherese fault fig 3b this identifies a change between two zones the increase in apparent resistivity along rp 1 from approximately 7ohm m to 20ohm m towards the north from progressive meter 650 m to 0 m is indicative of the deepening of the bedrock north of the vogherese fault this is also consistent with resistivity depth sounding rds results which indicate a deepening of the bedrock from depth of 11 m rds 2 to depth of 47 m rds 3 the low apparent resistivity values towards the south from 2 160 m to 650 m fig 3b indicate a shallow depth of the bedrock south of the vogherese fault in particular the apparent resistivity values along rp 1 in this area are essentially related to a qualitative description of the geometry of the bedrock although the latter remains at a shallow depth 11 m at 600 m as indicated by rds 2 and 21 m at 2 160 m as indicated by rds 1 fig 3c the apparent resistivity values indicate local shallowing of the bedrock from 1 500 m to 1 750 m where the values are typical of the bedrock resistivity 3 4ohm m higher apparent resistivity values indicate a deepening of the bedrock at 1 900 m fig 3b these evidences allow to accurately localize the vogherese fault at the investigate site this hydrogeological configuration is confirmed by rds 1 3 fig 3c which identify shallow bedrock to the south and the above mentioned deepening of the bedrock to the north and is also congruent with the stratigraphic logs of the wells indeed well 69 well 73 well 75 well 81 and well 82 located in the s sector respect to the fault trace intercept the bedrock figs 4 7 conversely well 80 located in the n sector does not intercept it this hydrogeological setting based on vlf em rp and rds results is confirmed by more accurate and complete electrical resistivity tomography ert 1 5 and 3d ert 1 2 surveys figs 4 and 5 in these inverse resistivity models warm colours from green to red are associated with freshwater saturated alluvial deposits e g freshwater saturated clayey to sandy deposits cool colours from purple to blue are associated with clayey and silty cover deposits saline water saturated alluvial deposits e g saline water saturated sandy to gravelly deposits or with the clayey bedrock locally saline water saturated the inverse models indicate sharp and irregular contact between the alluvial aquifer and the underlying hydrogeological bedrock the hydrogeological bedrock 3 6 ohm m at the base of the alluvial aquifer 20 40 ohm m is characterized by morphological irregularities which are likely to have been shaped either by tectonics vogherese fault zone and or by the paleo river s erosion in the southern area of the investigated transect south of the fault the thickness of the aquifer varies between 10 m and 30 m fig 4b e this depth increases northward due to the vogherese fault deep bedrock db fig 4a these evidences are consistent with well observations regarding bedrock depth fig 4 the bedrock is affected by saltwater contaminations which show resistivity values lower than 3 ohm m these contaminations are likely localized along structural discontinuities which represent preferential flow paths for the saline waters and facilitate the flow towards the alluvial aquifer the resistivity imaging obtained for the long transect which was cross validated with electrical conductivity logs revealed an extremely variable mineralisation of the groundwater over the test site contamination related low resistivity anomalies cool colors within the aquifer correspond to electrical conductivity values up to 9 000 µs cm up to 6 200 mg l tds e g well 81 and well 82 in fig 4 and fig s2 in the supporting information high resistivity anomalies warm colors within the aquifer are found in correspondence of contamination free zones e g well 75 in fig 4 the variability of electrical resistivity with depth fig 4 is associated with the different degrees of mixing between the shallower fresh groundwater and the deeper saline waters both the 2d and 3d ert surveys pointed out the existence of localised and restricted zones of salinisation within the aquifer these zones show resistivity values ranging between 3 and 8 ohm m fig 4 specifically the aforementioned greater anomaly identified along vlf em 29 salt waters at 400 680 m figs 3a and 5c corresponds to the shallow saline water plume extracted from 3d ert 1 2 5 7 5 9 ohm m fig 5a b this is a detailed 3d imaging of the irregular shaped shallow saltwater contamination within the alluvial aquifer in general the groundwater salinity starts to increase at depths of between 5 and 8 m e g well 75 well 81 well 82 fig 4 and fig s2 in the supporting information this can increase to depths of 10 15 m like in the case of well 81 figs 7 and 9 in other cases the depth is just below ground level like in some areas near the test site where saline waters were found in the surface drainage network which is buried in the first few meters of the drift deposits the correlation between changes in the ec logs and changes in the ert resistivity is not always observed if the wells are not located in correspondence with the geophysical surveys well ert distance ranging between 80 m and 215 m fig s2 in the supporting information for example the ec log of well 82 shows that the salinity starts to increase at a depth of 5 m corresponding to a saltwater contamination within the alluvial aquifer revealed by ert 2 fig 4 and fig s2b in the supporting information otherwise the ec logs of well 81 and well 75 show a change in conductivity unrelated to the change in resistivity of ert 1 and ert 4 respectively fig 4 and fig s2a c in the supporting information this suggests an extremely variable mineralisation of groundwater over the test site correlation between changes in the ec log and changes in the ert resistivity is observed between well 81 and ert 6 and 3d ert 3 4 figs 7 and 9 in this case the well is located in correspondence with the geophysical surveys 6 2 detailed investigation and time lapse monitoring electrical resistivity tomography ert 6 which was acquired at a transversal angle to the longer transect fig 2 confirmed the hydrogeological configuration which shows a shallow bedrock to the east and a deepening of the bedrock to the west fig 6 caused by the vogherese fault ert 6 results together with ert 1 figs 4a and 5d results allowed achieving detailed localization and trace of the vogherese fault which appears to have an ene wsw orientation at the scale of the test site fig 1b c in addition ert 6 confirmed the presence of restricted zones of the bedrock affected by saline water contaminations which are likely localised and restricted zones along structural discontinuities comparison between the imaging achieved by different arrays revealed that the wenner schlumberger ws array fig 6a showed higher vertical resolution and a tendency to enhance layering in identifying alluvial deposits and deep saltwater contaminations furthermore it showed larger signal amplitude but lower penetration depth the pseudo pole dipole pspd array fig 6b showed higher lateral resolution above all at depth and more compact and vertically extended bodies furthermore it showed greater penetration depth in delineating the two deep saltwater contaminations even if this array is more susceptible to noise contamination may present a good compromise between resolution and signal strength the hybrid h array fig 6c developed by the combination of ws and pspd arrays suggested that is worth combining and jointly inverting data obtained with arrays that differ in depth of investigation and resolution it delivered an imaging that is the result of the combination of the vertical resolution of ws high lateral resolution and great penetration depth of pspd furthermore comparison between narrow scale range extractions fig 7 from ert 6 ws and pspd arrays and the overlapping xz slice from 3d ert 3 4 dd array revealed that the dipole dipole dd array fig 7c showed higher lateral resolution in identifying lateral heterogeneities within alluvial deposits and in delineating the saltwater contamination in this portion of the aquifer the variety of experimental setups tested provided an ideal opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth provided by groundwater sampling and analysis stratigraphic electrical conductivity temperature and redox potential logs undertaken within well 81 fig 7 ert 6 and 3d ert 3 4 revealed well 81 is localized 50 m west of a saltwater contamination figs 6 and 7 this is the reason why the well intercepts brackish groundwater rather than salt groundwater well 81 logs found at 11 m of depth a drop in resistivity ec log along with an increase of temperature and a decrease of redox potential of groundwater fig 7 this well transition zone occurs in a portion of the aquifer in which based on the bulk resistivity indicated by the ert surveys the aquifer should be characterized by coarser deposits specifically maximum resistivity values can be found at a depth between 11 m and 12 m which would indicate the likely presence of a clean sand layer contaminated by brackish water this suggests that the distribution of saline water contaminations is a hydraulic conductivity controlled process at the plume scale within alluvial deposits as shown in fig 8 comparison between the resistivity profiles extracted from the variety of experimental setups tested along well 81 axis and the ec log converted into resistivity showed that 2d pspd and 2d h fig 9 revealed the clean sand layer at 11 m of depth i e just below the transition zone between slightly brackish and moderately brackish waters at depths 10 m the ec log shows similar resistivity values due to the presence of slightly brackish water with constant salinity conversely the profiles extracted from the geophysical models show an increase in resistivity with depth due to a decrease in clay content with depth at depths 12 m both the ec log and the profiles extracted from the geophysical models show a decrease in resistivity with depth due to the presence of moderately brackish water and the increase in salinity with depth resistivity depth sounding rds despite of its one dimensional feature showed a drop in resistivity at the same depth 2d ws and 3d dd showed 2 m and 1 m underestimation of depth respectively comparison between the resistivity profiles along the well axis revealed that the higher is the accuracy of the geophysical method the larger is the measured resistivity variation range fig 9 3d ert 3 4 fig 10 provided a good correlation with well 81 logs in this portion of the aquifer deep saline waters which reach the alluvial aquifer during upward migration diffuse and mix with the fresh groundwater of the shallow aquifer therefore originating different degrees of groundwater salinity within the aquifer from saltwater to fresh water different resistivity range extractions from the 3d resistivity block can be related to different degrees of groundwater salinity fig 10a c here the 3d geophysical imaging cross validated by well logs provided the opportunity to map the irregular shaped shallow saltwater to highly brackish water plume contaminating the alluvial aquifer the saltwater to highly brackish water plume which contaminates a sandy body within the alluvial deposits corresponds to the plume extracted from 3d ert 3 4 4 9 3 ohm m fig 10a this plume was detected by the 3d survey only indeed this survey is able to generate a more complete and accurate model with respect to 1d and 2d surveys the 2013 3d resistivity block 3rd june 2013 provides good correlation with well 81 logs 5th june 2013 fig 10 moderately brackish water shows lower redox potential and higher temperature than the overlying slightly brackish water time lapse monitoring of the saltwater to highly brackish water plume contaminating the alluvial aquifer was carried out by inverting the two data sets collected in late spring 2013 and 2015 it revealed the regions of the model in which change has occurred in terms of electrical resistivity a decrease in size of the saltwater to highly brackish water plume figs 10a and 11a and an increase in resistivity values of the alluvial aquifer figs 10b c and 11b c due to groundwater salinity dilution during late spring of 2015 have been observed this is consistent with the percentage ratio between 2015 and 2013 resistivity block models fig 12 the isosurface 100 fig 12b suggests the region of the model where no change has occurred between 2015 and 2013 differently the isosurface 105 fig 12c suggests the region of the model where saltwater dilution has occurred between 2015 and 2013 i e 5 higher resistivity values in addition the isosurface 105 fig 12c also suggests a decrease in resistivity values of the clayey and silty cover deposits during late spring of 2015 due to previous day rainfall 7 discussion although the interpretation of electromagnetic and resistivity anomalies is not always straightforward van schoor 2002 the cross validation of geophysical results with extensive ground truth allowed definition of the general hydrogeological setting of the investigated area as well as detailed investigation of localized and restricted zones of the aquifer which are crucial elements for the understanding of the saltwater contamination process geophysical surveys revealed the presence of sharp and irregular contact between the alluvial aquifer and the underlying hydrogeological bedrock this is characterized by morphological irregularities which are likely to have been shaped either by tectonics vogherese fault zone and or by the paleo river s erosion although in the southern investigated area south of the fault the thickness of the aquifer varies between 10 and 30 m the bedrock depth increases northward due to the vogherese fault these evidences are consistent with well observations regarding bedrock depth geophysical results allowed achieving detailed localization and trace of the vogherese fault which appears to have an ene wsw orientation at the scale of the test site in addition geophysical surveys revealed that the bedrock is affected by saline water contaminations which are likely localized along structural discontinuities which represent preferential flow paths for the saline waters and facilitate the flow towards the alluvial aquifer detailed 3d and time lapse imaging revealed irregular shaped shallow saltwater contaminations within the alluvial aquifer as well as temporal variability of groundwater salinity the overall simplified hydrogeological conceptual model of the test site is shown in fig 13 this model represents the main features of the shallow aquifer as revealed by geophysical surveys cross validated with well logs data the tested geophysical surveys proved to be effective techniques for the localization and characterization of localized and restricted saline water contaminations which are crucial elements for the exploitation management of the aquifer not only for drinking water supply but also for agricultural and industrial use specifically it is worth considering that although very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em surveys are more rapid than the more reliable electrical resistivity tomography ert surveys not all saline water contaminations are detectable by vlf em only steeply dipping and well coupled with the transmitter conductive bodies are able to generate electromagnetic em anomalies considering only saline water contamination related anomalies on a total of 21 anomalies revealed along the transect figs 3 and 4 62 of vlf em anomalies are consistent with ert anomalies while 10 are partially consistent 67 of resistivity profiling rp anomalies are consistent with ert anomalies while 5 are partially consistent on a total of 14 vlf em anomalies consistent with ert anomalies and associated with saltwater contaminations with a width ranging between 8 m and 195 m 50 are associated with saltwater contaminations boundaries 50 are associated with saltwater contaminations bodies the study provided key performance indicators of electrode arrays in delineating this and similar hydrogeological settings the merging and joint inversion of datasets from different arrays provided more accurate inverse models as also suggested by szalai et al 2009 and torrese 2020 this is due to the combination of the high vertical resolution of wenner schlumberger ws high lateral resolution of dipole dipole dd and pseudo pole dipole pspd in presence of flat contact between the aquifer and the underlying bedrock the ws array achieved better detectability and imaging otherwise in presence of sharp and irregular contact between the aquifer and the underlying bedrock and of localized and restricted saline water contaminations as found in most of the investigated area dd and pspd arrays provided better detectability and imaging the study confirmed that the main drawback of electrical resistivity tomography ert method in such a hydrogeological context is that it is not always possible to distinguish between a morphological irregularity of the clayey bedrock and a localized and restricted saline water contamination this is due to the fact that saline water filled coarse deposits may have an electrical resistivity very close to a clayey bedrock moreover in the absence of a specific calibration well the resistivity range to be associated with the saline water contamination is not known overall at the investigated test site saltwater saturated clayey bedrock shows resistivity values lower than 3 ohm m while saltwater saturated sandy alluvial deposits show resistivity values ranging between 3 ohm m and 8 ohm m brackish water saturated alluvial deposits show resistivity values 8 ohm m even if these ranges of values can be considered representative for such a hydrogeological setting it is worth underlining that the resistivity of such hydrogeological bodies does not depend on the water conductivity only but also on porosity and clay content of the solid material moreover the resistivity signature depends even on the size of the body in relation to its depth and on the contrast between the resistivity of the body and that of the surrounding rock this is the reason why the same hydrogeological body can show slightly different resistivity values even in the same site contamination from saline waters is not spatially and vertically homogeneous within the alluvial aquifer as also highlighted by the hydrochemical investigations this non homogeneity is likely to be affected by different factors like the aperture of the discontinuities within the hydrogeological bedrock the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer as well as seasonal variations in terms of fresh water recharge and groundwater pumping the hypothesis that water salinity degree and spatial distribution of saline water contaminations is a hydraulic conductivity controlled process at the plume scale within alluvial deposits was verified by undertaking a lithological parameterization from geophysical results specifically we estimated the clay content of the alluvial deposits affected by the brackish water plume investigated by 1d to 4d electrical resistivity surveys and cross validated with well 81 logs given the presence of groundwater at different salinity conditions we used the algorithm proposed by ryjov and sudoplatov 1990 this algorithm can be used to estimate the clay content in clayey sandy formations knowing the resistivity of the formation and the salinity of the groundwater shevnin et al 2006 2007 rainone et al 2015 the estimation was based on the bulk resistivity extracted from 3d ert 3 4 in correspondence of well 81 axis orange profile in fig 9 and the pore water electrical conductivity obtained from well 81 resistivity log purple profile in fig 9 an indicative estimate of clay content cc valid for cation exchange capacity cec of clay 1 73 g l clay porosity 0 55 sand porosity 0 22 radius of clay pores 3 10 9 m was obtained along the well axis fig 9 this estimate suggests a decrease in clay content with depth as indicated also by the stratigraphic log ranging from 13 to 5 with the exception of the presence of a clean sand layer between 11 m and 12 m of depth figs 7 and 9 the presence of this layer is also suggested by the corrected formation factor fc computed along the well axis by applying the johnson et al 1986 modification of the waxman and smits equation waxman and smits 1968 4 c t 1 f c c w 2 c s λ where c t is the bulk electrical conductivity of the formation extracted along the well axis from 3d ert 3 4 orange profile in fig 9 f c is the corrected formation factor c w is the electrical conductivity of pore water c s 1 μs assumed as a representative value from wildenschild et al 2000 is the surface electrical conductivity of the clay λ 8 μm assumed as a representative value from wildenschild et al 2000 is the length parameter weighted volume to surface area ratio that is a measure of the dynamically interconnected pore size two dimensional and three dimensional ert surveys agree with well logs in indicating that deep saline paleo waters show a dilution during upward migration this is due to the mixing with shallow fresh groundwater furthermore the hydrodynamic flow of shallow fresh groundwater would tend to relegate the highly mineralized groundwater to the lower sections of the aquifer time lapse ert surveys provided some suggestions about the temporal variability of groundwater salinity groundwater salinity dilution revealed by the 2015 block model figs 11 and 12 with respect to the 2013 block model figs 10 and 12 is likely due to 52 lower rainfall during spring 2015 with respect to spring 2013 the fact that the temporal variability of groundwater salinity is connected to the variability in the discharge of uprising saltwater suggests that the uprise of saltwater is likely to be induced by an increase in hydraulic head within the main apennine groundwater following rainfall or snow melting events this system seems to be in hydraulic connection with a deeper aquifer that hosts saline waters pilla et al 2010 and re and zuppi 2011 suggested a pressure transfer through a piston flow mechanism which can produce a mass transfer where saline waters are forced to rise along discontinuities and reach the shallow aquifer that was observed to coincide with aquifer recharge maximum values of water table on the other hand the 2015 block model shows a decrease in resistivity of the upper clayey deposits fig 12 this is due to previous day rainfall affecting only very shallow resistivity values forthcoming studies based on continuous piezometric and hydrochemical monitoring of the alluvial aquifer groundwater correlated to rainfall or snow melting events in the nearby apennines will allow to verify the piston flow mechanism based hypothesis furthermore next research steps to enhance the present study will concern the extension of the geophysical study in other areas of the oltrepò pavese plain sector further transects crossing the fault zone and detailed investigations will be carried out at selected test sites this will allow us to verify the extent of the hydrogeological conditions revealed by this study the geophysical study will be integrated with an in depth hydrochemical study accompanied by continuous piezometric and hydrochemical monitoring of the alluvial aquifer groundwater this will be aimed at obtaining further insights into the spatial distribution of saline water contaminations and the mechanisms underlying the upward migration of saline paleo water its diffusion and mixing with the fresh groundwater of the shallow aquifer 8 conclusions we presented new results of the application of 1d 4d electrical resistivity and electromagnetic surveys for the delineation of aquifer geometry and the detection of saline paleo water uprising along structural discontinuities these geophysical surveys were undertaken at the alluvial aquifer of the oltrepò pavese plain sector po valley northern italy at the investigated test site the alluvial aquifer is strongly conditioned by the presence of an important tectonic discontinuity whose localization and trace were better defined by this study this fault is responsible for the sudden deepening that affects the hydrogeological bedrock and is also responsible for the uprising of deep saline paleo waters which strongly influences the chemistry of groundwater during the campaign a variety of experimental setups were tested this provided an ideal opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth provided by groundwater sampling and analysis stratigraphic electrical conductivity temperature and redox potential logs undertaken within the wells it also permitted an assessment of the usability of electrical and electromagnetic surveys in such a complex hydrogeological setting geophysical surveys revealed the presence of sharp and

and or by the paleo river s erosion the bedrock is affected by saline water contaminations which are likely localized along structural discontinuities which represent preferential flow paths for the saline waters and facilitate the flow towards the alluvial aquifer detailed 3d and time lapse imaging revealed irregular shaped shallow saltwater contaminations within the alluvial aquifer as well as temporal variability of groundwater salinity contamination from saline waters is not spatially and vertically homogeneous within the alluvial aquifer spatial distribution of contaminations and salinity degree are likely to be affected by different factors like the aperture of the discontinuities within the hydrogeological bedrock the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer as well as seasonal variations in terms of fresh water recharge the temporal variability of groundwater salinity revealed by time lapse imaging would suggest that the uprise of deep saline paleo saltwater is likely to be induced by a pressure transfer mechanism that may force saline waters to rise along discontinuities and reach the shallow alluvial aquifer the results from our study are applicable in similar hydrogeological contexts where the aquifer s contamination by saltwater is caused by mixing of freshwaters with brines or where the fossil salt waters located different kilometers far from the

4405,this paper presents new results of 1d 4d electrical resistivity and electromagnetic surveys for the delineation of aquifer geometry and the detection of saline paleo water uprising along structural discontinuities these geophysical surveys were undertaken at the alluvial aquifer of the oltrepò pavese plain sector po valley northern italy at the investigated test site the alluvial aquifer is strongly conditioned by the presence of an important tectonic discontinuity whose localization and trace were better defined by this study this fault is responsible for the sudden deepening that affects the bedrock and is also responsible for the uprising of deep saline paleo waters which strongly influences the chemistry of groundwater during the campaign a variety of experimental

investigation problems when studying aquifers e g seismic micro gravimetric and time domain electromagnetic methods electrical resistivity and electromagnetic methods are well suited geophysical techniques to investigate and partially characterize shallow aquifers there have been many applications of electrical resistivity tomography ert and electrical methods in general to characterize aquifers coscia et al 2011 kazakis et al 2016a 2016b meyerhoff et al 2014 vogelgesang et al 2020 delineate alluvial aquifer heterogeneity bowling et al 2005 thickness and bedrock structure gómez et al 2019 monitor hydraulic processes kuras et al 2009 and aquifer discharge meyerhoff et al 2012 map saline water contaminations kazakis et al 2016a 2016b rainone et al 2015 as well as detect karst features torrese 2020 sinkholes and cavities torrese et al 2021 van schoor 2002 very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em has been typically used for the identification of fracture zones for groundwater exploration jamal and singh 2018 detection of fractures in the bedrock adepelumi et al 2006 geological boundaries and shear zones faults gnaneshwar et al 2011 but it has been also applied to map groundwater condition in sedimentary basins ohwoghere asuma et al 2020 and detect leachate plumes and groundwater pollution al tarazi et al 2008 this study involves electrical resistivity and vlf em methods due to their ability in detecting conductive bodies which represent the main geophysical targets of this research project in the investigated hydrogeological setting conductive bodies are related to saline water contaminations within the alluvial aquifer or along structural discontinuities within the bedrock as well as they are related to the clayey hydrogeological bedrock if the vlf em method provides quick detection of well coupled conductive bodies electrical resistivity methods provide more accurate and complete models furthermore electrical resistivity methods allow to outline the vertical and horizontal distribution of both low e g fine grained alluvial layers and high e g coarse grained alluvial layers resistivity bodies although 1d geophysical surveys allow to define subsoil layering and main geological boundaries 2d and especially 3d surveys allow to obtain more accurate and complete geophysical models and better define aquifer heterogeneity 4d surveys usually termed time lapse surveys where the fourth dimension is time allow to monitor time varying processes such as groundwater contamination the objectives of the study are to test the suitability of 1d 4d electrical resistivity and vlf em methods for the delineation of aquifer geometry and the detection of saline paleo water uprising along structural discontinuities and to verify advantages and limitations of the methods in a complex hydrogeological setting at the investigated test site the hydrogeological clayey bedrock may be affected by morphological irregularities and saline water contaminations furthermore localized zones of the alluvial aquifer may also be affected by shallow saline water contaminations these features of the hydrogeological system which represent the main geophysical targets of the study are all related to low resistivity volumes and may show similar electrical resistivity values this could generate vertical and lateral detectability issues in identifying such hydrogeological bodies a further issue could arise from the fact that shallow saline water contaminations within the alluvial aquifer may not have a main orientation as occurs for example along structural discontinuities for this reason the vlf em method unlike electrical resistivity methods may not be able to detect such features for this purposes we have tested and compared rapid and cost effective surveys vlf em undertaken over the entire investigated area for an expeditious assessment of buried conductive bodies that could be connected to the saline water uprising and more detailed and accurate investigations 1d 4d electrical resistivity to characterize restricted areas these geophysical surveys were undertaken at the alluvial aquifer of the oltrepò pavese plain sector po valley northern italy at the investigated test site the alluvial aquifer is strongly conditioned by the presence of an important tectonic discontinuity the vogherese fault a tectonic discontinuity buried below a few tens of meters of alluvial deposits this is responsible for the sudden deepening towards the north that affects the hydrogeological bedrock substratum and is also responsible for the uprising of deep saline paleo waters these sodium chloride na cl rich waters rise along the discontinuities faults fractures in the hydrogeological bedrock and flows into the overlying alluvial aquifer this particular setting conditions the distribution of saline waters into the alluvial aquifer they are evident in the southern sector of the plain where the thickness of the aquifer is lower and so the dilution power of the fresh ground waters is reduced this contamination prevents the exploitation of the aquifer not only for drinking water supply but also for agricultural and industrial use the origin of the na cl rich waters is connected to the brines very high density fluids that are remnants of evaporated marine waters in the late messinian late miocene trapped at the bottom of the po plain aquifer conti et al 2000 the occurrence of tectonic discontinuities within the hydrogeological bedrock allows the meteoric waters first to infiltrate and leach brines then rise towards the shallow aquifer according to some authors nanni and zuppi 1986 conti et al 2000 even the compressive forces that act along the po valley margins can squeeze the brines from the marine deposits causing this uprise of saline waters pilla et al 2010 showed that contamination from saline waters is not spatially and vertically homogeneous within the alluvial aquifer as highlighted by the hydrochemical investigations early results on the study of the saline water uprising occurring in the oltrepò pavese plain aquifer have been reported by bersan et al 2010 and pilla et al 2010 this study may provide further insights into the applicability and effectiveness of electrical resistivity and electromagnetic methods in the investigation of similar complex hydrogeological contexts where the aquifer s contamination by saline water is caused by mixing of freshwaters with brines as it happens for example in the european countries belgium denmark england estonia france italy spain darling et al 1997 desiderio and rusi 2004 dever et al 2001 hinsby et al 2001 bonnesen et al 2009 marandi and vallner 2010 in kansas and texas in the usa stueber et al 1998 or where the fossil salt waters located different kilometres far from the coastline are remainder of ancient marine ingressions as for example in togo morocco and vietnam akouvi et al 2008 bouchaou et al 2009 2 very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em method the theory that underlies the very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em technique is well described in the literature paterson and ronka 1971 phillips and richards 1975 ramesh babu et al 2007 the vlf em technique is a passive method that uses radiation from worldwide ground based military radio transmitters used for navigation operating in the vlf band 15 30 khz as the primary electromagnetic em field these transmitters generate plane em waves that can induce secondary eddy currents particularly in electrically conductive elongate 2 d targets the vlf em is based on the measure of the vertical hv and horizontal ho components of the secondary field generated by lateral changes in conductivity in earth materials herein that part of the vertical field which is in phase with the horizontal field is called the in phase component that part which is out of phase with the horizontal magnetic field is called the out of phase quadrature component vlf em profiles and maps are typically returned in terms of vertical hv to horizontal ho magnetic components hv ho termed dip angle data the presence of a well coupled i e the structure must be roughly aligned towards the transmitter conductive body such as fractures and faults is related to high hv ho values vlf em anomalies produced by water bearing fractures may be very similar to those produced by moist clay filled sealed fractures beard and lutro 2000 larger anomalies are expected for saline water bearing fractures vlf em has been widely used to prospect for conductive mineral deposits paál 1965 however it has been also used for rapid near surface geological mapping gnaneshwar et al 2011 parker 1980 phillips and richards 1975 saydam 1981 ramesh babu et al 2007 sundararajan et al 2006 3 electrical resistivity methods electrical resistivity methods are based on the estimation of the electrical resistivity of the subsoil and consist in the application of direct current into the ground by means of two current electrodes and the measure of the resulting voltage via two potential electrodes the depth of investigation depends on the distance between the current electrodes the arrangement of current and potential electrodes during the measurement is dependent on the chosen electrode array most frequently used arrays are the dipole dipole wenner schlumberger and pole dipole arrays e g kneisel 2006 schrott and sass 2008 the dipole dipole dd array uses two current electrodes on one side and two potential electrodes on the other side this method is especially suitable for the detection of vertical structures as it shows high lateral resolution main disadvantages are sensitivity to high near surface resistivity szalai and szarka 2008 the wenner w array comprises four equally spaced electrodes deployed in a line in which potential electrodes are located between current electrodes the method is especially suitable for the detection of horizontal structures e g layering as it shows high vertical resolution disadvantages comprise shallower penetration and less subsurface information in comparison with the dipole dipole array szalai et al 2009 the schlumberger s configuration is similar to the wenner array potential electrode spacing is constant but current electrode spacing is logarithmically increased the method is especially appropriate for the detection of horizontal structures since it shows high vertical resolution like the wenner array the pole dipole pd array is similar to the dipole dipole array but a current electrode termed remote electrode is so far away infinite distance that its location has negligible effect on the measurements this array shows high lateral resolution and penetration depth and even if it is more susceptible to noise contamination may present a good compromise between resolution and signal strength smith 1986 to obtain a true resistivity model of the subsurface an inversion procedure is needed loke and barker 1996 the three main methods of electric resistivity surveys are resistivity depth sounding rds resistivity profiling rp and electric imaging commonly termed electrical resistivity tomography ert in the resistivity depth sounding rds electrode spacing is progressively expanded to increase the depth of investigation and measure vertical resistivity variations differently in the resistivity profiling rp a constant electrode spacing is selected that senses the subsurface to the depth of interest and this constant array is moved along a profile to measure lateral resistivity variations electrical resistivity tomography ert provides an imaging of the subsurface electrical resistivity pattern and allows identifying subsurface structures in ert which is based on a multi electrode system each of the electrodes alternatively acts as a current and potential electrode its theory cf arato et al 2014 athanasiou et al 2007 buvat et al 2013 dahlin and loke 1998 daily and owen 1991 loke et al 2003 spiegel et al 1980 and application cf cassiani et al 2009 daily et al 1992 griffiths and barker 1993 guérin and benderitter 1995 guérin et al 2004 kuras et al 2009 ritz et al 1999 torrese 2020 are well documented in geophysical literature electrical resistivity methods allow characterizing the subsurface materials in terms of their electrical properties changes in electrical resistivity correlate with variation in solid material water saturation fluid conductivity and porosity which may be used to map stratigraphic units geological

layers e g clayey and silty cover deposits clayey or marly bedrocks aquiclude or saline water contaminations as well as high resistivity structures as coarse grained alluvial layers e g sands and gravels or fresh water saturated alluvial deposits the resistivity signature of different hydrogeological bodies depends on the size of the target in relation to its depth and on the contrast between the resistivity of the target and that of the surrounding host rock the amplitude of resistivity anomalies is an inverse function of the distance between the measurement points and the target the

background resistivity 4 geological and hydrogeological setting of the test site the test site is located in the oltrepò pavese plain sector po valley northern italy fig 1 this sector is geologically characterized by alluvial quaternary deposits that cover miocene pliocene marine deposits with very low hydraulic conductivity formed by sandy marls sandstones conglomerates gypsum rich marls and calcareous marls pellegrini and vercesi 1995 the upper quaternary sediments mainly deposited by the action of po river and apennine streams fig 1 represent the main water bearing units of the area three different hydrogeological units can be defined within the quarternary deposits pre würmian 115 ky bp alluvial deposits middle ancient alluvial deposits recent and present alluvial deposits cavanna et al 1998 pilla et al 2007 fig 1 only the latter two hydrogeological units are affected by the presence of na cl rich waters the middle ancient alluvial deposits occupy most of the oltrepò pavese plain sector and are formed by alternating sand and gravel with interbedded clays or clayey silts the recent and present alluvial deposits distributed mainly along the po river were originated by the post würmian 11 7 ky bp depositional activity of this river the most important apennine streams also contributed to the deposition of these alluvial deposits the constant presence of a clayey silty covering which has a varying maximum thickness of between 10 and 15 m in the sectors close to the apennine margin and a minimum of 2 m in the meandering area of the po river limits infiltration and influences the aquifer recharge that occurs in correspondence of the coalescent fans originating from the deposition of apennine streams pilla et al 2007 recharge contribution from the po river must be excluded in fact groundwater flow direction is towards the po river with the exception of occasional flooding events pilla et al 2007 the aquifer is a single bedded unconfined aquifer although it becomes locally and temporarily during some periods of the year confined due to the presence of the clayey silty covering the structural setting of the oltrepò pavese plain is strongly conditioned by the presence of an important tectonic discontinuity known in literature as the vogherese fault boni 1967 fig 1 this fault has a ne sw direction at a regional scale from west of casteggio to the colle of s colombano in the area of pavia plain passing across the confluence of the ticino and po rivers boni 1967 boni 1967 suggested that it is a normal fault with hanging wall to the ne up to the barbianello area here it becomes an inverse fault to the south of pinarolo folding gradually towards west north of casteggio and voghera given the absence of specific recent studies on the subject and since the definition of the fault type is outside the scope of this study the vogherese fault has always been traced as a vertical fault on the cross sections of this paper the vogherese fault is responsible for the sudden deepening that affects the bedrock in the northern sector of the oltrepò pavese plain and is also responsible for the strong variability on the thickness of the aquifer the aquifer shows a thickness of a few meters in the southern sector that represents the upper block and hundreds meters in the northern sector the lower block braga and cerro 1988 cavanna et al 1998 regione lombardia and eni divisione agip 2002 agip 1994 fig 1 there are two deep boreholes depth up to 3 000 m in the area that were drilled for oil exploration regione lombardia and eni divisione agip 2002 the casanova lonati 1 borehole fig 1 which is located on the down lifted block of the vogherese fault intercepts the underlying marine origin deposits at a depth of 275 m brackish groundwater which rises along the fault and flows into the continental deposits is intercepted by the borehole at 136 m groundwater intercepts salt waters at 400 m derived from self potential and resistivity logs as well as formation testing formation tests found sodium chloride up to a concentration of 34 4 g l in the bedrock at depths of several hundred meters the second borehole the stradella 1 borehole fig 1 which is located on the up lifted block of the fault intercepts the underlying marine deposits at a depth of only 36 m this particular setting facilitates the uprising phenomenon of saline waters which shows itself at its best in the southern sector of the plain where the aquifer is thinner here the na cl rich waters cannot be diluted by the more abundant calcium bicarbonated groundwaters this outlined setting strongly influences the chemistry of groundwater the uprising of saline waters is also facilitated by structural discontinuities localized in the bedrock of marine origin these discontinuities represent preferential flow paths for the saline waters and facilitate the flow towards the alluvial aquifer this is demonstrated by the chloride distribution within the groundwater cameron et al 2018 pilla et al 2007 2010 the existence of these mineralised waters in the oltrepò pavese area is well known since roman times in fact the waters were and still are exploited for thermal purposes s colombano al lambro miradolo terme salice terme and rivanazzano terme are the most famous spa centres located near the investigated area however this contamination may prevent the exploitation of the aquifer not only for drinking water supply but also for agricultural and industrial use 4 1 hydrochemical facies of groundwater two main hydrochemical facies can be identified within the oltrepò pavese groundwater a calcium bicarbonated hydrofacies which characterises most of the groundwater of the alluvial aquifer a sodium chloride hydrofacies which locally characterises the groundwater in some sectors of the area along the vogherese fault bersan et al 2010 pilla et al 2007 2010 the calcium bicarbonated hydrofacies has low to medium mineralisation with electrical conductivity ec values ranging between 800 and 1 200 µs cm total dissolved solids tds ranging between 550 mg l and 850 mg l it is characterised by chlorides that do not exceed 100 mg l concentrations of bicarbonates vary between 300 and 700 mg l calcium varies between 50 and 200 mg l magnesium varies between 30 and 50 mg l and sulphates vary between 30 and 100 mg l pilla et al 2010 the sodium chloride hydrofacies has a significantly higher mineralisation but extremely variable over the area with ec values that can be above 12 000 μs cm above 8 400 mg l tds and are on average between 2 000 and 4 000 μs cm tds ranging between 1 400 mg l and 2 800 mg l the ec values are related to the solubilised chloride and sodium given that the concentrations of other major ions are relatively similar to those of the calcium bicarbonated water described earlier the variability of the na cl groundwater is associated with the different degrees of mixing between the shallower fresh groundwater and the deeper saline waters brines of the po plain no correlation was observed between the variation in the degree of salinity of the water and the piezometric level of the groundwater dissolution of gypsum rich marls in the miocene pliocene formations may have contributed in part to the sulphate concentration in the groundwater as these formations are of marine origin dissolution of these units could also account in part for the increased concentrations of sodium chloride in the groundwater hydrochemical investigations have shown three areas along the vogherese fault where the phenomenon seems to be more intense and widespread fig s1 in the supporting information fig 1 the test site area to the west of barbianello where the highest concentrations above 4 000 mg l of chlorides were recorded the sectors that includes mezzanino and albaredo arnaboldi where chloride concentrations can reach 3 000 mg l and finally the area to the north of casteggio where the chlorides can exceed 12 000 mg l while the distribution of the sodium chloride groundwater is controlled by the trend of the vogherese fault at a regional scale higher variability in the distribution of the saline groundwater is observed at a local scale within the test site 5 materials and methods 5 1 data collection during the campaign a variety of geophysical surveys and experimental setups were tested the study involved both investigations to explore a long transect fig 2 a and detailed investigations to characterize a restricted area fig 2b one dimensional 1d to four dimensional 4d electrical resistivity and very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em surveys were acquired at the test site along a transect approximately 3 000 m long along the strada provinciale delle saline salt pan provincial road crossing the fault zone in a n s direction and along a shorter profile transversal to it fig 2 a very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em profile vlf em 29 fig 2 2 200 m in length was acquired in october 2010 crossing the fault zone in a n s direction four resistivity depth soundings rds 1 4 fig 2 were acquired in august 2009 rds 1 3 and in june 2010 rds 4 along roughly e w profiles a schlumberger array was used with maximum ab 2 of 147 m 215 m 410 m and 180 m for rds 1 4 respectively a resistivity profiling rp 1 fig 2 2 160 m in length was acquired in july 2009 crossing the fault zone in a n s direction and overlapping to vlf em 29 a gradient array with aligned electrodes was used two to six measurements were acquired for each section with current electrode spacing ab 80 m and potential electrode spacing mn 10 m five 2d electrical resistivity tomography ert ert 1 5 were acquired in july 2010 along an approximately 2 600 m long transect crossing the fault zone and partially overlapping to vlf em 29 and rp 1 fig 2 another ert ert 6 was acquired in june 2014 at a transversal angle to the transect each profile is 470 m in length and was obtained using 48 electrodes spaced 10 m apart ert 1 5 which are part of the surveys involved to explore the long transect were collected using a 758 wenner schlumberger ws array quadrupoles ert 6 which is part of the surveys involved to characterize a restricted area detailed investigations was collected using a 564 wenner schlumberger ws array quadrupoles and a 570 pseudo pole dipole pspd array quadrupoles the pspd array comprised a remote electrode at a distance of 440 m from the profile and at a transversal angle to it it was not possible to set the remote electrode at an infinite distance for this reason it has been termed pseudo pole dipole rather than pole dipole a hybrid h array sequence comprised of 1 134 measurements was developed by the combination of ws and pspd array sequences four three dimensional 3d ert 3d ert 1 4 surveys were acquired between 2010 and 2015 fig 2 3d ert 1 and 3d ert 2 data were collected in july 2010 and september 2010 respectively ert 3 and ert 4 data collection was undertaken in june 2013 and repeated in may 2015 to carry out a time lapse 4d analysis a surface snake grid comprised of 12 4 electrodes spaced 10 m apart both along the x and y axes was used a sequence comprising 270 quadrupoles using all feasible x y and diagonal dipole dipole array configurations was used a wadi instrument by abem was used for acquiring all em data a fully automatic multi electrode resistivity meter syscal jr switch 48 by iris instruments 400 v max output voltage 1 200 ma max output current 100 w max output power http www iris instruments com syscal juniorsw html was used for acquiring all electrical resistivity data given the presence of an extremely variable groundwater mineralisation over the area we carried out ec measures rather than total dissolved solids tds in such a context ec is especially suitable for the differentiation between calcium bicarbonated and sodium chloride hydrofacies however it is worth pointing out that tds is preferable in presence of a lower variability in water mineralization since for example calcium bicarbonated waters show a lower ec than sodium chloride waters with similar tds a pasi bfk 100 hydrostatic probe was used for measuring piezometric levels a wtw cond 3401 conductivity meter was used for acquiring electrical conductivity and temperature data and a wtw ph 340 ion was used for acquiring ph and redox potential data groundwater sampling from the wells was carried out with a cellai 504s peristaltic pump major ions were analyzed in the laboratory of università di pavia with a dionex dx 120 chromatograph while volumetric analysis was used for the determination of alkalinity 5 2 data processing and inversion a fraser filter fraser 1969 1981 was used to provide a simple scheme for semi quantitative interpretation of very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em data and obtain the equivalent current densities ogilvy and lee 1991 sundararajan et al 2006 at a constant depth which would cause a magnetic field if f i fi represents the collected data so f1 f2 f3 and f4 represent four equal spaced consecutive dip angle hv ho readings and x represents the space between each station along the profile 1 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 x is the fraser filter of those four values since x is constant it can be ignored and the fraser filter considered to be 2 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 the use of this filter allows a reduction of noise through a low pass filter and the removal of the asymmetry inherent in dip angle data the magnitudes of the currents that would have to flow at different depths to produce a given anomaly have been obtained through this filter applied for different measured intervals n x with n 1 2 3 4 5 6 kriging geostatistical gridding methods have been used to interpolate the filtered values and achieve the section shown in fig 3 a the depth of penetration p of the vlf em investigation can be estimated on average just over 20 m based on 3 3 p 500 ρ f with f used frequency ρ average shallow resistivity obtained from electrical resistivity surveys smoothing was not applied to resistivity profiling rp data fig 3b inverse resistivity profiles from resistivity depth soundings rdss fig 3c were obtained through inversion of the experimental curve electrical resistivity tomography ert data required a more robust data processing and inversion data processing involved the removal of outliers from the apparent resistivity data some problematic data with unrealistically high standard deviation high resistivity and or negative resistivity in 2d surveys were all removed from apparent data data inversion was performed using ertlab solver release 1 3 1 by geostudi astier s r l multi phase technologies llc based on tetrahedral finite element modelling fem as regards the pseudo pole dipole pspd array the exact finite location x y z coordinates of the remote electrode was considered during data processing razafindratsima and lataste 2014 robain et al 1999 instead of the infinite location of the remote electrode provided for by theoretical pole dipole pd array tetrahedral discretization was used in both forward and inverse modelling the foreground region was discretized using a 5 m cell size for all 2d and 3d erts i e half the electrode spacing to give the model high accuracy the background region was discretized using an increasing element size towards the outside of the domain according to the sequence 1 1 2 4 and 8 the foreground element size the forward modelling was performed using mixed boundary conditions dirichlet neumann and a tolerance stop criterion of 1 0e 7 for a symmetric successive over relaxation conjugate gradient ssorcg iterative solver data inversion was based on a least squares smoothness constrained approach labrecque et al 1996 noise was appropriately managed using a data weighting algorithm morelli and labrecque 1996 that allows the variance matrix after each data point iteration that was poorly fitted by the model to be adaptively changed the inverse modelling was performed using a maximum number of internal inverse preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg iterations of 5 and a tolerance stop criterion for inverse pcg iterations of 0 001 the amount of roughness from one iteration to the next was controlled to assess maximum layering a low value of reweight constant 0 1 was set with the objective of generating maximum heterogeneity the inverse resistivity models figs 4 7 10 12 were obtained by inverting the datasets acquired through single arrays or by merging and jointly inverting datasets from different arrays which can deliver better detectability and imaging and hence provide more accurate inverse models szalai et al 2009 torrese 2020 and more reliable ert imaging de la vega et al 2003 seaton and burbey 2002 inversion involved the application of homogeneous starting models that set at each node the average measured apparent resistivity value the final inverse resistivity models were chosen based on the minimum data residual or misfit error 5 3 cross validation of geophysical results with well logs the test site provided an ideal opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth the study involved six shallow water wells for irrigational purposes available at the site well 69 well 73 well 75 well 80 well 81 and well 82 fig 2 these wells were drilled prior to the present study with destructive rotary or auger techniques until the top of the impermeable bedrock all the wells are fully screened although no logs of chip samples are available and these wells do not provide accurate stratigraphic logs they still provide information regarding the depth to bedrock below alluvial deposits well 69 well 73 well 75 well 81 and well 82 located in the s sector respect to the fault trace intercept the bedrock figs 4 7 conversely well 80 located in the n sector does not intercept it piezometric level measures water sampling and analysis major ions table s1 in the supporting information and electrical conductivity ec logs have been undertaken within well 75 well 81 and well 82 fig 4 piezometric level measures water sampling and analysis major ions electrical conductivity temperature and redox potential logs have been undertaken within well 81 figs 7 9 10 11 pilla et al 2010 in this study water salinity was classified according to these classes fresh water with ec 500 μs cm slightly brackish water with ec ranging between 500 and 4 000 μs cm moderately brackish water with ec ranging between 4 000 and 8 000 μs cm highly brackish water with ec ranging between 8 000 and 12 000 μs cm saltwater with ec ranging between 12 000 and 70 000 μs cm brine with ec 70 000 μs cm table s2 in the supporting information the term saline water was used to define a highly mineralized water and includes both brackish water and saltwater water sampling and electrical conductivity logs show an extremely variable mineralisation over the test site with ec changes up to 9 000 µs cm up to 6 200 mg l tds fig 4 and fig s2 in the supporting information the variability of the na cl groundwater is associated with the different degrees of mixing between the shallower fresh groundwater and the deeper saline waters specifically well 81 resistivity and temperature logs carried out the 5th june 2013 and the 4th july 2013 as well as the redox potential log carried out the 4th july 2013 are reported in fig 7 if analyzing in detail the resistivity log undertaken the 5th june 2013 which was used for the cross validation of 3d and time lapse 4d geophysical surveys fig 7 it can be found a transition between slightly brackish groundwater 1 430 μs cm on average 1 000 mg l tds 1 10 m of depth june 2013 to underlying moderately brackish groundwater 5 262 μs cm on average 3 700 mg l tds 11 15 m of depth june 2013 at 11 m depth likewise the temperature log 5th june 2013 fig 7 shows a transition between shallower relative colder groundwater an average temperature of 12 8 c 3 10 m of depth june 2013 and deeper relative warmer groundwater an average temperature of 13 5 c 11 15 m of depth june 2013 at 11 m depth 6 results 6 1 the long transect revealing general hydrogeological setting the greater anomaly identified along very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em 29 salt waters at 400 680 m figs 3a and 5c is associated with a shallow saline water contamination i e a conductive buried bodies steeply dipping and well coupled with the em transmitter this anomaly can be identified slightly south of a strong apparent resistivity variation along resistivity profiling rp 1 at 650 m vogherese fault fig 3b this identifies a change between two zones the increase in apparent resistivity along rp 1 from approximately 7ohm m to 20ohm m towards the north from progressive meter 650 m to 0 m is indicative of the deepening of the bedrock north of the vogherese fault this is also consistent with resistivity depth sounding rds results which indicate a deepening of the bedrock from depth of 11 m rds 2 to depth of 47 m rds 3 the low apparent resistivity values towards the south from 2 160 m to 650 m fig 3b indicate a shallow depth of the bedrock south of the vogherese fault in particular the apparent resistivity values along rp 1 in this area are essentially related to a qualitative description of the geometry of the bedrock although the latter remains at a shallow depth 11 m at 600 m as indicated by rds 2 and 21 m at 2 160 m as indicated by rds 1 fig 3c the apparent resistivity values indicate local shallowing of the bedrock from 1 500 m to 1 750 m where the values are typical of the bedrock resistivity 3 4ohm m higher apparent resistivity values indicate a deepening of the bedrock at 1 900 m fig 3b these evidences allow to accurately localize the vogherese fault at the investigate site this hydrogeological configuration is confirmed by rds 1 3 fig 3c which identify shallow bedrock to the south and the above mentioned deepening of the bedrock to the north and is also congruent with the stratigraphic logs of the wells indeed well 69 well 73 well 75 well 81 and well 82 located in the s sector respect to the fault trace intercept the bedrock figs 4 7 conversely well 80 located in the n sector does not intercept it this hydrogeological setting based on vlf em rp and rds results is confirmed by more accurate and complete electrical resistivity tomography ert 1 5 and 3d ert 1 2 surveys figs 4 and 5 in these inverse resistivity models warm colours from green to red are associated with freshwater saturated alluvial deposits e g freshwater saturated clayey to sandy deposits cool colours from purple to blue are associated with clayey and silty cover deposits saline water saturated alluvial deposits e g saline water saturated sandy to gravelly deposits or with the clayey bedrock locally saline water saturated the inverse models indicate sharp and irregular contact between the alluvial aquifer and the underlying hydrogeological bedrock the hydrogeological bedrock 3 6 ohm m at the base of the alluvial aquifer 20 40 ohm m is characterized by morphological irregularities which are likely to have been shaped either by tectonics vogherese fault zone and or by the paleo river s erosion in the southern area of the investigated transect south of the fault the thickness of the aquifer varies between 10 m and 30 m fig 4b e this depth increases northward due to the vogherese fault deep bedrock db fig 4a these evidences are consistent with well observations regarding bedrock depth fig 4 the bedrock is affected by saltwater contaminations which show resistivity values lower than 3 ohm m these contaminations are likely localized along structural discontinuities which represent preferential flow paths for the saline waters and facilitate the flow towards the alluvial aquifer the resistivity imaging obtained for the long transect which was cross validated with electrical conductivity logs revealed an extremely variable mineralisation of the groundwater over the test site contamination related low resistivity anomalies cool colors within the aquifer correspond to electrical conductivity values up to 9 000 µs cm up to 6 200 mg l tds e g well 81 and well 82 in fig 4 and fig s2 in the supporting information high resistivity anomalies warm colors within the aquifer are found in correspondence of contamination free zones e g well 75 in fig 4 the variability of electrical resistivity with depth fig 4 is associated with the different degrees of mixing between the shallower fresh groundwater and the deeper saline waters both the 2d and 3d ert surveys pointed out the existence of localised and restricted zones of salinisation within the aquifer these zones show resistivity values ranging between 3 and 8 ohm m fig 4 specifically the aforementioned greater anomaly identified along vlf em 29 salt waters at 400 680 m figs 3a and 5c corresponds to the shallow saline water plume extracted from 3d ert 1 2 5 7 5 9 ohm m fig 5a b this is a detailed 3d imaging of the irregular shaped shallow saltwater contamination within the alluvial aquifer in general the groundwater salinity starts to increase at depths of between 5 and 8 m e g well 75 well 81 well 82 fig 4 and fig s2 in the supporting information this can increase to depths of 10 15 m like in the case of well 81 figs 7 and 9 in other cases the depth is just below ground level like in some areas near the test site where saline waters were found in the surface drainage network which is buried in the first few meters of the drift deposits the correlation between changes in the ec logs and changes in the ert resistivity is not always observed if the wells are not located in correspondence with the geophysical surveys well ert distance ranging between 80 m and 215 m fig s2 in the supporting information for example the ec log of well 82 shows that the salinity starts to increase at a depth of 5 m corresponding to a saltwater contamination within the alluvial aquifer revealed by ert 2 fig 4 and fig s2b in the supporting information otherwise the ec logs of well 81 and well 75 show a change in conductivity unrelated to the change in resistivity of ert 1 and ert 4 respectively fig 4 and fig s2a c in the supporting information this suggests an extremely variable mineralisation of groundwater over the test site correlation between changes in the ec log and changes in the ert resistivity is observed between well 81 and ert 6 and 3d ert 3 4 figs 7 and 9 in this case the well is located in correspondence with the geophysical surveys 6 2 detailed investigation and time lapse monitoring electrical resistivity tomography ert 6 which was acquired at a transversal angle to the longer transect fig 2 confirmed the hydrogeological configuration which shows a shallow bedrock to the east and a deepening of the bedrock to the west fig 6 caused by the vogherese fault ert 6 results together with ert 1 figs 4a and 5d results allowed achieving detailed localization and trace of the vogherese fault which appears to have an ene wsw orientation at the scale of the test site fig 1b c in addition ert 6 confirmed the presence of restricted zones of the bedrock affected by saline water contaminations which are likely localised and restricted zones along structural discontinuities comparison between the imaging achieved by different arrays revealed that the wenner schlumberger ws array fig 6a showed higher vertical resolution and a tendency to enhance layering in identifying alluvial deposits and deep saltwater contaminations furthermore it showed larger signal amplitude but lower penetration depth the pseudo pole dipole pspd array fig 6b showed higher lateral resolution above all at depth and more compact and vertically extended bodies furthermore it showed greater penetration depth in delineating the two deep saltwater contaminations even if this array is more susceptible to noise contamination may present a good compromise between resolution and signal strength the hybrid h array fig 6c developed by the combination of ws and pspd arrays suggested that is worth combining and jointly inverting data obtained with arrays that differ in depth of investigation and resolution it delivered an imaging that is the result of the combination of the vertical resolution of ws high lateral resolution and great penetration depth of pspd furthermore comparison between narrow scale range extractions fig 7 from ert 6 ws and pspd arrays and the overlapping xz slice from 3d ert 3 4 dd array revealed that the dipole dipole dd array fig 7c showed higher lateral resolution in identifying lateral heterogeneities within alluvial deposits and in delineating the saltwater contamination in this portion of the aquifer the variety of experimental setups tested provided an ideal opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth provided by groundwater sampling and analysis stratigraphic electrical conductivity temperature and redox potential logs undertaken within well 81 fig 7 ert 6 and 3d ert 3 4 revealed well 81 is localized 50 m west of a saltwater contamination figs 6 and 7 this is the reason why the well intercepts brackish groundwater rather than salt groundwater well 81 logs found at 11 m of depth a drop in resistivity ec log along with an increase of temperature and a decrease of redox potential of groundwater fig 7 this well transition zone occurs in a portion of the aquifer in which based on the bulk resistivity indicated by the ert surveys the aquifer should be characterized by coarser deposits specifically maximum resistivity values can be found at a depth between 11 m and 12 m which would indicate the likely presence of a clean sand layer contaminated by brackish water this suggests that the distribution of saline water contaminations is a hydraulic conductivity controlled process at the plume scale within alluvial deposits as shown in fig 8 comparison between the resistivity profiles extracted from the variety of experimental setups tested along well 81 axis and the ec log converted into resistivity showed that 2d pspd and 2d h fig 9 revealed the clean sand layer at 11 m of depth i e just below the transition zone between slightly brackish and moderately brackish waters at depths 10 m the ec log shows similar resistivity values due to the presence of slightly brackish water with constant salinity conversely the profiles extracted from the geophysical models show an increase in resistivity with depth due to a decrease in clay content with depth at depths 12 m both the ec log and the profiles extracted from the geophysical models show a decrease in resistivity with depth due to the presence of moderately brackish water and the increase in salinity with depth resistivity depth sounding rds despite of its one dimensional feature showed a drop in resistivity at the same depth 2d ws and 3d dd showed 2 m and 1 m underestimation of depth respectively comparison between the resistivity profiles along the well axis revealed that the higher is the accuracy of the geophysical method the larger is the measured resistivity variation range fig 9 3d ert 3 4 fig 10 provided a good correlation with well 81 logs in this portion of the aquifer deep saline waters which reach the alluvial aquifer during upward migration diffuse and mix with the fresh groundwater of the shallow aquifer therefore originating different degrees of groundwater salinity within the aquifer from saltwater to fresh water different resistivity range extractions from the 3d resistivity block can be related to different degrees of groundwater salinity fig 10a c here the 3d geophysical imaging cross validated by well logs provided the opportunity to map the irregular shaped shallow saltwater to highly brackish water plume contaminating the alluvial aquifer the saltwater to highly brackish water plume which contaminates a sandy body within the alluvial deposits corresponds to the plume extracted from 3d ert 3 4 4 9 3 ohm m fig 10a this plume was detected by the 3d survey only indeed this survey is able to generate a more complete and accurate model with respect to 1d and 2d surveys the 2013 3d resistivity block 3rd june 2013 provides good correlation with well 81 logs 5th june 2013 fig 10 moderately brackish water shows lower redox potential and higher temperature than the overlying slightly brackish water time lapse monitoring of the saltwater to highly brackish water plume contaminating the alluvial aquifer was carried out by inverting the two data sets collected in late spring 2013 and 2015 it revealed the regions of the model in which change has occurred in terms of electrical resistivity a decrease in size of the saltwater to highly brackish water plume figs 10a and 11a and an increase in resistivity values of the alluvial aquifer figs 10b c and 11b c due to groundwater salinity dilution during late spring of 2015 have been observed this is consistent with the percentage ratio between 2015 and 2013 resistivity block models fig 12 the isosurface 100 fig 12b suggests the region of the model where no change has occurred between 2015 and 2013 differently the isosurface 105 fig 12c suggests the region of the model where saltwater dilution has occurred between 2015 and 2013 i e 5 higher resistivity values in addition the isosurface 105 fig 12c also suggests a decrease in resistivity values of the clayey and silty cover deposits during late spring of 2015 due to previous day rainfall 7 discussion although the interpretation of electromagnetic and resistivity anomalies is not always straightforward van schoor 2002 the cross validation of geophysical results with extensive ground truth allowed definition of the general hydrogeological setting of the investigated area as well as detailed investigation of localized and restricted zones of the aquifer which are crucial elements for the understanding of the saltwater contamination process geophysical surveys revealed the presence of sharp and irregular contact between the alluvial aquifer and the underlying hydrogeological bedrock this is characterized by morphological irregularities which are likely to have been shaped either by tectonics vogherese fault zone and or by the paleo river s erosion although in the southern investigated area south of the fault the thickness of the aquifer varies between 10 and 30 m the bedrock depth increases northward due to the vogherese fault these evidences are consistent with well observations regarding bedrock depth geophysical results allowed achieving detailed localization and trace of the vogherese fault which appears to have an ene wsw orientation at the scale of the test site in addition geophysical surveys revealed that the bedrock is affected by saline water contaminations which are likely localized along structural discontinuities which represent preferential flow paths for the saline waters and facilitate the flow towards the alluvial aquifer detailed 3d and time lapse imaging revealed irregular shaped shallow saltwater contaminations within the alluvial aquifer as well as temporal variability of groundwater salinity the overall simplified hydrogeological conceptual model of the test site is shown in fig 13 this model represents the main features of the shallow aquifer as revealed by geophysical surveys cross validated with well logs data the tested geophysical surveys proved to be effective techniques for the localization and characterization of localized and restricted saline water contaminations which are crucial elements for the exploitation management of the aquifer not only for drinking water supply but also for agricultural and industrial use specifically it is worth considering that although very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em surveys are more rapid than the more reliable electrical resistivity tomography ert surveys not all saline water contaminations are detectable by vlf em only steeply dipping and well coupled with the transmitter conductive bodies are able to generate electromagnetic em anomalies considering only saline water contamination related anomalies on a total of 21 anomalies revealed along the transect figs 3 and 4 62 of vlf em anomalies are consistent with ert anomalies while 10 are partially consistent 67 of resistivity profiling rp anomalies are consistent with ert anomalies while 5 are partially consistent on a total of 14 vlf em anomalies consistent with ert anomalies and associated with saltwater contaminations with a width ranging between 8 m and 195 m 50 are associated with saltwater contaminations boundaries 50 are associated with saltwater contaminations bodies the study provided key performance indicators of electrode arrays in delineating this and similar hydrogeological settings the merging and joint inversion of datasets from different arrays provided more accurate inverse models as also suggested by szalai et al 2009 and torrese 2020 this is due to the combination of the high vertical resolution of wenner schlumberger ws high lateral resolution of dipole dipole dd and pseudo pole dipole pspd in presence of flat contact between the aquifer and the underlying bedrock the ws array achieved better detectability and imaging otherwise in presence of sharp and irregular contact between the aquifer and the underlying bedrock and of localized and restricted saline water contaminations as found in most of the investigated area dd and pspd arrays provided better detectability and imaging the study confirmed that the main drawback of electrical resistivity tomography ert method in such a hydrogeological context is that it is not always possible to distinguish between a morphological irregularity of the clayey bedrock and a localized and restricted saline water contamination this is due to the fact that saline water filled coarse deposits may have an electrical resistivity very close to a clayey bedrock moreover in the absence of a specific calibration well the resistivity range to be associated with the saline water contamination is not known overall at the investigated test site saltwater saturated clayey bedrock shows resistivity values lower than 3 ohm m while saltwater saturated sandy alluvial deposits show resistivity values ranging between 3 ohm m and 8 ohm m brackish water saturated alluvial deposits show resistivity values 8 ohm m even if these ranges of values can be considered representative for such a hydrogeological setting it is worth underlining that the resistivity of such hydrogeological bodies does not depend on the water conductivity only but also on porosity and clay content of the solid material moreover the resistivity signature depends even on the size of the body in relation to its depth and on the contrast between the resistivity of the body and that of the surrounding rock this is the reason why the same hydrogeological body can show slightly different resistivity values even in the same site contamination from saline waters is not spatially and vertically homogeneous within the alluvial aquifer as also highlighted by the hydrochemical investigations this non homogeneity is likely to be affected by different factors like the aperture of the discontinuities within the hydrogeological bedrock the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer as well as seasonal variations in terms of fresh water recharge and groundwater pumping the hypothesis that water salinity degree and spatial distribution of saline water contaminations is a hydraulic conductivity controlled process at the plume scale within alluvial deposits was verified by undertaking a lithological parameterization from geophysical results specifically we estimated the clay content of the alluvial deposits affected by the brackish water plume investigated by 1d to 4d electrical resistivity surveys and cross validated with well 81 logs given the presence of groundwater at different salinity conditions we used the algorithm proposed by ryjov and sudoplatov 1990 this algorithm can be used to estimate the clay content in clayey sandy formations knowing the resistivity of the formation and the salinity of the groundwater shevnin et al 2006 2007 rainone et al 2015 the estimation was based on the bulk resistivity extracted from 3d ert 3 4 in correspondence of well 81 axis orange profile in fig 9 and the pore water electrical conductivity obtained from well 81 resistivity log purple profile in fig 9 an indicative estimate of clay content cc valid for cation exchange capacity cec of clay 1 73 g l clay porosity 0 55 sand porosity 0 22 radius of clay pores 3 10 9 m was obtained along the well axis fig 9 this estimate suggests a decrease in clay content with depth as indicated also by the stratigraphic log ranging from 13 to 5 with the exception of the presence of a clean sand layer between 11 m and 12 m of depth figs 7 and 9 the presence of this layer is also suggested by the corrected formation factor fc computed along the well axis by applying the johnson et al 1986 modification of the waxman and smits equation waxman and smits 1968 4 c t 1 f c c w 2 c s λ where c t is the bulk electrical conductivity of the formation extracted along the well axis from 3d ert 3 4 orange profile in fig 9 f c is the corrected formation factor c w is the electrical conductivity of pore water c s 1 μs assumed as a representative value from wildenschild et al 2000 is the surface electrical conductivity of the clay λ 8 μm assumed as a representative value from wildenschild et al 2000 is the length parameter weighted volume to surface area ratio that is a measure of the dynamically interconnected pore size two dimensional and three dimensional ert surveys agree with well logs in indicating that deep saline paleo waters show a dilution during upward migration this is due to the mixing with shallow fresh groundwater furthermore the hydrodynamic flow of shallow fresh groundwater would tend to relegate the highly mineralized groundwater to the lower sections of the aquifer time lapse ert surveys provided some suggestions about the temporal variability of groundwater salinity groundwater salinity dilution revealed by the 2015 block model figs 11 and 12 with respect to the 2013 block model figs 10 and 12 is likely due to 52 lower rainfall during spring 2015 with respect to spring 2013 the fact that the temporal variability of groundwater salinity is connected to the variability in the discharge of uprising saltwater suggests that the uprise of saltwater is likely to be induced by an increase in hydraulic head within the main apennine groundwater following rainfall or snow melting events this system seems to be in hydraulic connection with a deeper aquifer that hosts saline waters pilla et al 2010 and re and zuppi 2011 suggested a pressure transfer through a piston flow mechanism which can produce a mass transfer where saline waters are forced to rise along discontinuities and reach the shallow aquifer that was observed to coincide with aquifer recharge maximum values of water table on the other hand the 2015 block model shows a decrease in resistivity of the upper clayey deposits fig 12 this is due to previous day rainfall affecting only very shallow resistivity values forthcoming studies based on continuous piezometric and hydrochemical monitoring of the alluvial aquifer groundwater correlated to rainfall or snow melting events in the nearby apennines will allow to verify the piston flow mechanism based hypothesis furthermore next research steps to enhance the present study will concern the extension of the geophysical study in other areas of the oltrepò pavese plain sector further transects crossing the fault zone and detailed investigations will be carried out at selected test sites this will allow us to verify the extent of the hydrogeological conditions revealed by this study the geophysical study will be integrated with an in depth hydrochemical study accompanied by continuous piezometric and hydrochemical monitoring of the alluvial aquifer groundwater this will be aimed at obtaining further insights into the spatial distribution of saline water contaminations and the mechanisms underlying the upward migration of saline paleo water its diffusion and mixing with the fresh groundwater of the shallow aquifer 8 conclusions we presented new results of the application of 1d 4d electrical resistivity and electromagnetic surveys for the delineation of aquifer geometry and the detection of saline paleo water uprising along structural discontinuities these geophysical surveys were undertaken at the alluvial aquifer of the oltrepò pavese plain sector po valley northern italy at the investigated test site the alluvial aquifer is strongly conditioned by the presence of an important tectonic discontinuity whose localization and trace were better defined by this study this fault is responsible for the sudden deepening that affects the hydrogeological bedrock and is also responsible for the uprising of deep saline paleo waters which strongly influences the chemistry of groundwater during the campaign a variety of experimental setups were tested this provided an ideal opportunity to cross validate geophysical results with extensive ground truth provided by groundwater sampling and analysis stratigraphic electrical conductivity temperature and redox potential logs undertaken within the wells it also permitted an assessment of the usability of electrical and electromagnetic surveys in such a complex hydrogeological setting geophysical surveys revealed the presence of sharp and irregular contact between the alluvial aquifer and the underlying hydrogeological bedrock this is characterized by morphological irregularities which are likely to have been shaped either by tectonics and or by the paleo river s erosion the bedrock is affected by saline water contaminations which are likely localized along structural discontinuities which represent preferential flow paths for the saline waters and facilitate the flow towards the alluvial aquifer detailed 3d and time lapse imaging revealed irregular shaped shallow saltwater contaminations within the alluvial aquifer as well as temporal variability of groundwater salinity contamination from saline waters is not spatially and vertically homogeneous within the alluvial aquifer spatial distribution of contaminations and salinity degree are likely to be affected by different factors like the aperture of the discontinuities within the hydrogeological bedrock the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer as well as seasonal variations in terms of fresh water recharge the temporal variability of groundwater salinity revealed by time lapse imaging would suggest that the uprise of deep saline paleo saltwater is likely to be induced by a pressure transfer mechanism that may force saline waters to rise along discontinuities and reach the shallow alluvial aquifer the results from our study are applicable in similar hydrogeological contexts where the aquifer s contamination by saltwater is caused by mixing of freshwaters with brines or where the fossil salt waters located different kilometers far from the

4406,the multi peaking phenomenon in a breakthrough curve btc is a typical character of solute transport in complex flow fields such as a karst aquifer previous understanding and modeling techniques for the single peaked btcs would no longer be adequate for the multi peaked one in a traditional non fickian model the overall non fickian effect is simply the summation of contributions from each immobile zone or heterogeneous flow path therefore a resultant btc is not sensitive to the exact location of the immobile zones on the pathway of solute and the local peaks cannot be reproduced effectively in this study we introduce a fractional in time transient storage ts model ftts in which the ts zones are arranged in series e g triggered at specific times to simulate different locations of each ts zone or immobile zone along the river channel the simulation power of the ftts was tested by simulating observations from a tracer experiment conducted in a subterranean river and data generated from two synthetic cases meanwhile the simulation results of the ftts were compared with those from the fractional mobile immobile model fmim and the multi rate transient storage model mrts results show that both ftts and mrts models could well simulate the multi peaking phenomenon in btc and perform better than fmim further to that compared to mrts the ftts is a more efficient model because 1 when containing the same number of ts zones the ftts performs significantly better and 2 when achieving similar accuracy the ftts uses fewer ts terms corresponding to a smaller number of parameters than mrts moreover all ts terms in the ftts can form a one to one correspondence with the local peaks of btc which may be helpful for better characterizing the internal morphology of a flow field keywords multi peak fractional model transient storage breakthrough curves 1 introduction breakthrough curves btcs with long tails were commonly observed in solute transports in the field and can be well described by various non fickian models such as the fractional advection dispersion equations fades kelly et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the continuous time random walks ctrw burnell et al 2017 scher et al 2010 and the multi rate mass transfer mrmt model haggerty and gorelick 1995 1998 the traditional nonlocal approaches only considered the btc with distinct rising and receding limbs i e a unique peak however btcs may not follow this pattern in a real world flow field many studies had proved that the multi peaking phenomenon that usually appears in the heavy tailing btcs is a typical feature of solute transport in complex flow fields dewaide et al 2018 field and pinsky 2000 field and leij 2012 goldscheider et al 2008 göppert and goldscheider 2007 le borgne et al 2013 perrin and luetscher 2008 siirila woodburn et al 2015 tinet et al 2019 yin et al 2020 local peaks in a btc are important when predicting contaminant transport neglecting local peaks in a predicted btc could result in an incorrect conclusion for risk analysis of a pollution incident especially when pollutants are highly toxic mainly interpreted as an effect of auxiliary conduits field and leij 2012 goldscheider et al 2008 perrin and luetscher 2008 siirila woodburn et al 2015 smart 1988 tinet et al 2019 the multi peaked btcs could also be shaped by many other factors such as immobile zones and flow field morphology by conducting a tracer experiment in a subterranean river dewaide et al 2018 proved that the existence of underground lakes could result in a double peaked btc in a laboratory experiment field and leij 2012 showed that waterfalls and turbulence in the splash zone in the flow path could temporarily detain solutes and also cause local peaks in a btc besides it has been found that the existence of islands in a river can also result in multi peaked btcs anderson and phanikumar 2011 other important factors causing multi peaked btcs are the dual domain advection or permeability in porous media yin et al 2020 the kinetic sorption in nonconservative solutes rainfall dilution göppert and goldscheider 2007 etc compared with the trailing phenomenon the local peaks in a btc were poorly studied this may due to the following reasons 1 subsampling of data may mask nonmonotonicity of the observed btcs siirila woodburn et al 2015 2 with the increase of the migration distance in a river the local peaks are less obvious due to the diffusion effect le borgne et al 2013 thus unobvious small peaks may be regarded as measurement errors and ignored 3 in most cases individual btc was reported in terms of ensemble averages thus the presence of local maxima was practically eliminated in either the advancing or receding limbs of the curve siirila woodburn et al 2015 as the exist of multi peaked btcs had been proven by more and more studies our prior cognition that characterizes the flow field by single peak btc would no longer be adequate e g tracers transport in the subterranean river in the karst area in most of the traditional non local models the generated btc which represents the overall non fickian effect is simply the summation of contributions from each immobile phase or other non local feature of a flow field therefore the morphology of a btc is not sensitive to the exact location size and capacity of a specific immobile zone in the pathway of solute which can be a major limitation for these models to reproduce the local peaks in a btc in early studies a multi peaked btc was usually fitted by the multi dispersion model mdm käss 1998 leibundgut et al 2009 the basic idea of the mdm is that each peak is separately described using a single ade that represents an independent flow path the final multi peaked btc is the weighted mean concentration from all ades the mdm theory is only an approximation since solute transport along different flow paths generally would not be independent field and leij 2012 developed a dual advection dispersion equation dade in which two conduits interact through a first order mass transfer coefficient although this model could reproduce the dual peaked btcs in a karst aquifer the application of this model requires careful evaluation of the aquifer tracer test design and tracer test implementation because it is only appropriate for cases that are confirmed to contain ramiform conduits some typical conditions e g large storage zones may also result in local peaks in a btc fig 1 and fitting the dade to such btc could lead to incorrect interpretations further to that it could hardly determine a conduit correspond to which local peak in their experiments see physical experiment 2 in field and leij 2012 recently tinet et al 2019 introduced the om made one dimensional model for multiple advection dispersion and storage in exchanging zones model in which all parallel and exchanging flow zones are divided into reaches along the direction of flow see their fig 1 and each reach is subdivided into discrete segments with equal length in practice however om made is hard to decide in advance how many reaches and zones are needed for a given case besides the values of the various parameters need to be set by a trial and error approach which becomes a tedious and difficult task with the increasing number of reaches especially considering the increased model complexity it may suffer from equifinality as the understanding of immobile zone and main channel interactions deepened non local models with more transient storage ts terms have been introduced to describe solute transport in a coastal stream network briggs et al 2009 briggs et al 2010 introduced a ts model that could separate the relative contributions of the hyporheic zone and the surface storage zone in this model each ts term simply represents the total retention effects of the corresponding type of storage zones thus the morphology of resultant btcs are not sensitive to a specific storage zone anderson and phanikumar 2011 used a multi rate ts model mrts that contains three storage zones arranged in series i e exchange triggered sequentially to successfully reproduced a bimodal btc generated by a 3 d hydrodynamic and transport model in their work the mrts used three ts terms to generate only one local peak i e the ts zones could not form a one to one correspondence with local peaks therefore if there were multiple local peaks in the btc it is difficult to determine in advance how many ts terms are needed in this model the one to one relationship between a ts zone and a local peak is helpful not only to the prediction of pollutant transport but also the depiction of the internal structure of the flow field commonly the multi peaked btcs are also characterized by the heavy tailing phenomenon field and pinsky 2000 fractional mobile immobile model fmim that assumes a power law residence time distribution rtd in the immobile zone was usually used to describe the long tail of a btc schumer et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 but the fmim usually overestimate the exponential tail of a btc in a complex flow field the transport of solute could be characterized by both exponential and power law trapping to describe this phenomenon in detail sun et al 2020a introduced a fractional in time model with a transient storage term in which the long term power law trapping effect could be described by the fractional in time term and the short term exponential trapping could be well described by the transient storage term by using a tempered fractional model lu et al 2018 proved that this model could also well captures both power law and exponential tailing of a btc although this model could fit the tailing phenomenon well it could not reproduce the local peaks in a btc more recently yin et al 2020 developed a dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm in which the distributed order fractional in time derivative engine was used to simulate the bimodal sub diffusive transport dynamics of solute in a heterogeneous media all these studies showed that the fractional derivative model is a promising tool to simulate the complex characteristics of a flow field in a stream system solute transport is characterized by various immobile zones a detailed description of the immobile zones would be greatly helpful to accurately simulate both the tailing and multi peaking phenomena in a btc based on this assumption in this work we introduce a fractional in time transient storage model ftts that contains multiple ts terms arranged in series in the ftts the multiple ts terms are supposed to simulate different immobile zones in different locations and the fractional in time term is supposed to simulate the hyporheic zone that may cover the whole flow field research questions that will be addressed in this work include 1 can this newly developed model well reproduce the local peaks in a btc 2 if so does the ftts perform better than the mrts 3 as a general rule complex models contain more parameters and tend to perform better but when considering the number of parameters is the ftts a more effective model than the fmim 4 in the ftts can the ts terms form one to one correspondence to local peaks in btc to address these questions we first extend the fmim model to a ftts then we verify our numerical scheme against analytical solutions of the ade and the fmim at last we fit it to the observed and synthetic data to compare its simulation power with the mrts the rest of this paper is arranged as follows in section 2 we introduce the ftts to verify the numerical scheme in section 3 we first compare the results of ftts to analytical solutions of ade and fmim then to assess the simulation power of the ftts we apply it to fit three tracer experiment data sets from maocun subterranean river msr in a karst area and two synthetic cases the results are discussed in section 4 we summarize our results in the conclusion section 2 method 2 1 the fmim model when the ade is generalized with fractional derivative in time the underlying stochastic particle motion process is based on power law waiting time distribution zhang et al 2009 to distinguish explicitly the mobile main channel and immobile storage zone status schumer et al 2003 developed the following fractional order mobile immobile model fmim using fractional calculus 1 c t β γ c t γ ν c x d 2 c x 2 0 γ 1 where c denotes the main channel mobile concentration γ is the derivative order and β t γ 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient the term γ t γ represents the fractional derivative v is velocity l t 1 and d l 2 t 1 is the dispersion coefficient when γ 1 the fmim reduces to the classic ade with a retardation factor 1 β an analytical solution to eq 1 with a pulse initial condition on an unbounded domain can be computed using a stable subordinator density schumer et al 2003 and was implemented in fracfit kelly et al 2017 2 2 the mrts model in the mrts model the storage zones are arranged in series and the solute concentration is described as anderson and phanikumar 2011 2 β 0 c m t i 1 n β i s t t i s t t i 1 c im i t v c m x d 2 c m x 2 3 c im i t t i c m c im i where i 1 n t 1 t 2 t i t i 1 t n t i is the trigger time for the i th immobile zone c im i is the concentration for the i th immobile zone t i is the first order mass exchange rate the parameter β t i is the capacity coefficient to account for the mass in the i th storage zone immobile region β 0 is the capacity coefficient for the river i e the cross sectional area of the stream channel s denotes the heaviside step function s t 0 1 t 0 t 0 which has the property at any given time 4 s t t i s t t i 1 0 1 0 t i t t i t t i 1 t t i 1 it can be seen from eq 4 that the summation effect from all immobile zones reduces to the contribution from a single immobile zone at any given time eqs 2 and 3 were solved using a fourth order accurate compact scheme with spectral like resolution anderson and phanikumar 2011 phanikumar et al 2007 2 3 the ftts model in a complex open channel e g a spatially heterogeneous river transportation of solute will be affected by various immobile zones the deep hyporheic zones could usually result in a btc with a power law tail which could be well described by a fractional in time ade model zhang et al 2009 on the other hand the surface immobile zones e g a side pool and a large lake could have a fast mass exchange with the main channel and could be well simulated by a ts term in the model briggs et al 2010 but this kind of immobile zones usually distributed at a specific location connect to a river this means that a surface storage zone will take effect on the transport of solutes at a specific time and accordingly give the motivation for using a trigger time in each ts term to capture the local mass exchanges 5 c m t β γ γ c m t γ i n s t i β i c im i t v c m x d 2 c m x 2 β γ t γ γ 1 γ β i s t i i e i t t i c m x 0 c im i x 0 0 where γ is the fractional derivate order γ is the gamma function and other symbols were explained above according to the property of the step equation the i th immobile zone does not work until time t i the mathematical derivation for eq 5 and the concentration evolution for the immobile phase could be seen in the appendix after being triggered the immobile zone would continuously impact the passing tracers even when the subsequent immobile zones are triggered which is different from mrts since the riemann liouville rl fractional derivative of a constant is not zero which can cause problems in the boundary conditions the fractional derivative in the ftts is solved using the caputo definition eqs 5 and a 11 were solved by a fully implicit euler method the discretization of γ c t γ is the same as that in murio 2008 we used the dirichlet boundary condition for the upstream boundary and the neumann boundary condition for the downstream boundary for both mrts and ftts the resulting tridiagonal matrix system of equations for ftts was solved by using the thomas algorithm press et al 2002 2 4 model parameter estimation the log based root mean squared error rmse was computed for each model simulation to provide a measure of goodness of fit gof as 6 rmse i 1 n log 10 c sim x t i log 10 c obs x t i 2 n where n is the number of samples in each btc as a result data with lower values in btcs receive greater weight than those in the absence of log transformation which is important for assessing anomalous transport characteristics where heavy tails occur at lower concentrations smaller rmse values indicate better agreement between simulated and observed datasets based on the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1993 muttil et al 2007 we developed a parallel version for parameter estimation sun et al 2020a 2020b which was used for all cases in this study in addition the small sample corrected akaike information metric aicc that takes both gof and number of parameters into account is an effective parameter for model comparison and evaluation for models with varying parameter numbers it has the form as akpa and unuabonah 2011 xia et al 2018 7 aicc aic 2 m m 1 n m 1 where aic is the akaike information criterion given by 8 aic n ln s n 2 m where n is the number of data points m is the number of the model parameter s is the error sum of squares which is log transformed similar to log based rmse to give the same weight to the tails of the btc smaller aicc values maybe negative suggest the model is more justified by the data 2 5 parameter sensitivity analysis global parameter sensitivity analysis is an important tool in hydrological modeling to identify influential parameters for inverse simulation and accordingly a variance based global sensitivity analysis was performed in this study a monte carlo based estimator was selected to calculate the first order sensitive indices si and the total sensitivity indices sti the mathematical expression is 9 si v x i e x ĩ y x i v y 10 sti e x ĩ v x i y x ĩ v y where v x i e x ĩ y x i represent a variance based first order effect for a generic factor x ĩ is the matrix of all factors except x i e x ĩ y x is the average value of y which takes over all possible values of x ĩ while keeping x i as fixed values the v x i is the variance that takes over all possible values of x i the quasi random sampling method developed by saltelli et al 2010 was used to simultaneously calculate si and sti technical details could be seen in homma and saltelli 1996 sun et al 2020b by assuming a uniform distribution of each parameter table 1 we sampled 50 000 random combinations of parameters for this simultaneous calculation as the output of the ftts is a time series data set from btc a total of 1500 data points that evenly distributed from the leading edge to the tail of btc were selected for parameter sensitivity analysis 2 6 site descriptions the tracer studies conducted in msr a subterranean river in a typical karst area in guilin china fig 2 were reported in huang et al 2017 totally three of their experiments were chosen as the research objects in this study the first experiment msr 1 hereafter was conducted at the daguping tracer material was injected in the daguping sinkhole and the maocun sinkhole was selected as the sampling point tracer of the second chosen experiment msr 2 hereafter was injected in modaojiang and the observation point is at shegengyan the last chosen experiment was conducted between dayanqian injection point and maocun sampling point detailed information is summarized in table 2 in addition for a better comparison between the ftts and mrts the synthetic btc data generated using a 3 d particle transport model were also used to test the models the synthetic data were generated by the transport model in the simulation of st clair river in mi usa by anderson and phanikumar 2011 to test the simulation power of the mrts two representative data set from stations t5 and t8 were selected in this study see their section 2 for more details 3 results 3 1 verification against analytical solutions of ade and fmim from eqs 5 and a11 we know that when set all β i 0 i e remove all the ts terms the ftts will reduce to the fmim model further to that when set β γ 0 and all β i 0 the ftts will reduce to the classical ade model the correctness of the numerical scheme for solving eqs 5 and a11 was assessed by comparing with corresponding analytical solutions of ade and fmim schumer et al 2003 the parameter values for ftts ade and fmim are listed in table 3 the hypothetical observation point was set 360 l downstream from the injection point the total injection mass was set as 3 28 10 3 m fig 3 are the comparisons of ftts versus ade and fmim respectively as shown in fig 3 ftts has a very similar result to that of ade the rmse between the two btcs is 0 0041 the late time portion of btc from ftts is slightly higher than that from ade very similar results are also found in the comparison between fmim and ftts and the rmse is 0 0092 given the small values of rmse the accuracy of the numerical scheme for solving ftts is acceptable 3 2 simulation for msr experimental data 3 2 1 msr 1 the morphology of btc from msr 1 is characterized by a relatively rapid increase until it reaches its main peak fig 4 a subsequently the receding limb exhibits a long and multi peaked tail the three local peaks appear at about 3 3 104 s 4 8 104 s and 9 0 104 s respectively for comparison we first used the ftts with 1 ts term ftts 1 hereafter and mrts with 3 ts terms mrts 3 hereafter to see if they performed better than fmim then we used ftts with 3 ts zones ftts 3 hereafter and mrts with 5 zones mrts 5 hereafter to describe the data fig 4 a the rmse and aicc values of the five models were compared and the optimal parameter values are listed in table 4 a comparison of the simulations exhibits that both ftts 1 and mrts 3 fig 4 a show a significant advantage in describing the multi peaked tail of the btc over the fmim however both models cannot capture all the local peaks ftts 1 simulates one of the small peaks rmse 0 0863 that appeared around 3 60 104 s and its trigger time t 1 is 4 86 104 s which matches the peak time well compared with ftts 1 mrts 3 can also reproduce that peak at around 4 80 104 s but its result is less accurate rmse 0 1075 the triggering time of the second ts term corresponds well with the local peak time in the btc however the triggering time of the first and third ts terms which are 1 14 10 3 s and 7 82 10 4 s respectively do not reproduce a local peak in the btc therefore we infer the first and third ts terms may assist the model in simulating the tailing effect of btc accurately in ftts 1 the tailing phenomenon could be mainly described by the fractional derivative term so a single ts term could well reproduce the bimodal btc the aicc values suggest that ftts 1 is the most appropriate model table 4 from fig 4 a we know that the ftts 3 and mrts 5 both could simulate the multi peaking phenomenon in msr 1 very well and showed similar accuracy but the aicc of ftts 3 is significantly smaller than that of mrts 5 which denotes that the ftts 3 is a more efficient model the triggering time of each ts term in ftts 3 2 71 10 4 4 26 10 4 and 8 13 10 4 s respectively basically corresponds to the beginning time of local peaks in btc in mrts 5 only three the second third and fourth ones with the corresponding triggering time 2 41 10 4 4 53 10 4 and 8 28 10 4 s respectively of the five ts terms correspond to the corresponding peaks 3 2 2 msr 2 given that both ftts 1 and mrts 3 cannot capture all the local peaks or irregular fluctuations in msr 1 we used ftts 3 mrts 5 and fmim for comparison to simulate the observations in this case and msr 3 in the next section the btc from the msr 2 tracer experiment is characterized by a relatively rapid increase in the leading edge fig 4 b then there are some irregular small fluctuations in the descending process beginning at about 2 6 105 s a small local peak appears at about 3 9 105 s and is followed by a heavy tail fig 4 b shows the simulations of ftts 3 mrts 5 and fmim table 5 lists the optimum parameters of the three models both mrts 5 and ftts 3 can well capture the irregular fluctuations in the btc while the results of fmim show significant departures from the observations the first ts term in mrts 5 is triggered at about 1 86 105 s which occurs at about the average time of the leading edge of the btc i e before the main peak time this ts term will detain solute in the raising stage and release at the falling limb of the btc thus this ts zone may mainly be responsible for the tailing of the btc rather than local peaks the triggering time of the rest four ts terms well correspond to the irregular features or local peaks in the btc at about 4 32 105 s the simulation of mrts 5 deviates significantly from the observed values while the ftts 3 model performs more accurately at the same time the ts zones in ftts 3 well correspond to the fluctuations of the btc this may indicate that part of the tailing phenomenon is presented by time fractional terms in ftts then the multi peak or irregular characteristics are well captured by the corresponding ts terms in mrts the ts terms are responsible for both the tailing and multi peaking phenomenon so more of them are needed when compared to ftts therefore ftts is a more effective model 3 2 3 msr 3 the observed change of solute concentration in msr 3 is steep in the rising stage accompanied by a fluctuation at about 4 80 105 s fig 4 c subsequently several small local peaks appear during the descent long tail fig 8 shows the simulation results of ftts 3 mrts 5 and fmim table 6 shows the optimal parameters of all three models both ftts 3 and mrts 5 could accurately simulate the peak value at about 8 10 105 s compared with mrts 5 ftts 3 performs better with smaller rmse and aicc values among the three models the fmim fails to capture the fluctuation at the rising stage of the btc and the mrts 5 rmse 0 1445 also overestimates the leading edge of the btc a little and is less accurate in describing the late time concentration than ftts 3 the run up time of the first ts zone in mrts 5 is 4 85 105 s and this ts zone accurately captures the fluctuation in the rising stage but shows less simulation accuracy than that in the ftts 3 it may be that the first ts zone in mrts 5 cannot fully account for both the following heavy tail and the current fluctuation in btc the triggering time of the second ts term is 6 03 105 s which does not match the local peak therefore the function of this ts zone may mainly represent the long tail of btc both ftts 3 and mrts 5 show a significant advantage in describing the multi peaked tail over the fmim but the aicc values show that the ftts 3 is the best model and the trigger time of each ts term corresponds well with the fluctuations in btc 3 3 simulation for the synthetic data detailed information for synthetic data of stations t5 and t8 could be seen in anderson and phanikumar 2011 the synthetic btcs and simulation results of ftts and mrts for t5 and t8 are shown in figs 5 a and 5 b respectively the estimated parameters and rmse and aicc values are summarized in table 7 in the case of t5 both the mrts 5 and the ftts 3 show similar accuracy but the aicc values show that the ftts 3 performs better since it uses fewer parameters in the case of t8 the synthetic btc has two obvious local peaks fig 5 b however both the mrts 3 and the ftts 1 could only reproduce the local peak at about 8 0 104 s and they show similar accuracy but the aicc values show that the ftts 1 performs better in addition the trigger time for the first and second ts terms in mrts 3 are not corresponding to the local peaks compared with the mrts 5 the ftts 3 gives a better fitting although both models could simulate the local peaks well 3 4 parameter sensitivity the values of si and sti for each parameter in ftts 3 are shown in fig 6 part of the btcs generated from random parameter combinations that were used to calculated si and sti are presented in fig 7 from fig 7 we can see that the main peaks of the btcs are mostly located in the time range of 200 400 s the leading edge of a btc mainly appears before 200 s the long tail of a btc mainly appears after 400 s results of si show that both parameters v and γ have a significant impact on btc before 400 s i e the early stage and the main peak of a btc the si for capacity coefficient fig 6 b the mass exchange rate fig 6 c and the triggering time fig 6 d for ts terms have raised significantly after being trigged but γ still has a relatively higher impact on btc than other parameters accordingly these parameters could have significant impacts on the tail of a btc moreover the sti which measures both the first order effect of a generic parameter and the interactions of this parameter with others shows significantly larger values than that of si for the capacity coefficient the mass exchange rate and the triggering time this indactes that these paramters have strong interactions with each other meanwihle the sti values of the aforementioned parameters indicates that they also have impacts on the leading edge before their trigging time of a btc which could also be attributed to their interactions with other parameters for example the capacity coefficients β 1 could have an effect on the solute distribution and transport in the main channel after the triggering time which will probably influence the mean velocity of the solute in the main channel thus the capacity coefficients β 1 could have interaction with v which represents the average flow velocity even before its trigging time 4 discussion in tracer experiments of msr all the observed btcs show irregular fluctuations or multi peaks in their heavy tails although various non fickian models have been introduced to describe the tailing phenomenon seldom of them can effectively reproduce the local peaks in a btc in a stream system the transport of solute is impacted by complex flow paths surface pools lateral dead zones and hyporheic zone payn et al 2008 and the resultant btcs often have complex morphology in a traditional non local model such as the fmim the overall retention effect to the solutes is simply the total contributions from all immobile phases or other non local features although it could well simulate the heavy tailing btcs e g fig 4 c the tail of the resultant btcs from this kind of model is not sensitive to the exact location of the immobile zone on the pathway of solute particles and the btcs are unimodal and smooth this indicates that to capture local peaks in a btc a model should consider the morphology characterizes of a river heterogeneous characteristics of rivers especially in small ones have a significant impact on solute transport if there were islands or other non moving objects exposed to the water surface in a river the flow could be divided into two or more branches which would converge again where the islands disappear fig 7 if there were obvious time differences in the transport of solute among these branches the btc could show local peaks anderson and phanikumar 2011 in addition the obvious curvature of the channel and the large storage zones connected to the channel such as lakes ponds etc could also affect the shape of the btc therefore multi peaked btc is a typical feature of complex river channels anderson and phanikumar 2011 field and leij 2012 siirila woodburn et al 2015 lizheng and jueye 1979 also pointed out that when there are multi pipelines in the karst area or there are pools or underground lakes connected to the main channel the btc can be multi peaked or step like anderson and phanikumar 2011 introduced a model that contains 5 parallel ts zones to simulate bimodal btc i e the ts zones have no trigger time see their equation 9 their results show that although this model contains multiple ts terms it cannot reproduce bimodal btc the reason is that although these ts zones are independent they are arranged in parallel that is every ts term or immobile zone is evenly spread over the whole flow field in parallel thus all ts zones play a uniform role in the whole process of solute transport in mrts and ftts a triggering time is set for each ts zone that is each ts term or immobile zone is sequentially arranged in time in the flow field we can see that both mrts and ftts can effectively simulate multi peaked btcs compared with mrts ftts is more effective in describing multi peaks and the heavy tails in btc since 1 when containing the same number of ts terms in both models ftts could simulate the results more accurately for example ftts 3 can effectively simulate all the peaks of btc in msr 1 and the synthetic case of t8 but mrts 3 can only capture one of the local peaks and its simulated results are obviously inferior to that of ftts 3 2 when resulting in similar accuracy ftts uses fewer ts terms and its aicc value is smaller than that of mrts for instance in the cases of msr 2 msr 3 and the two synthetic cases both ftts 3 and mrts 5 give very accurate simulations and the rmse values are very close but the aicc values show that the ftts 3 is a more promising model the observed btcs of tracer experiments are affected by various immobile zones such as the deep hyporheic zones and the surface immobile zones e g the pond and lake at the side of a river that have rapid mass exchange with the main channel the deep hyporheic zones are usually distributed along the streamline and can cause power law rtd but seldom generate local peaks the ts term describes an exponential rtd which is a limitation for simulating the heavy power law tail haggerty and gorelick 1998 haggerty et al 2000 when multiple ts terms are arranged in parallel and superimposed linearly the heavy power law tail can also be well reproduced such as the ts equation with 5 parallelly arranged ts terms proposed by anderson and phanikumar 2011 when simulating the observed data the ts terms in mrts 5 need to consider both the tailing and multi peaking characters in the btc in addition according to the properties of eq 3 the mrts assumes that the n 1 th ts term is shut down when the n th ts zone is triggered i e no superposition of the ts terms this would weaken the ability of mrts to represent the heavy tailing phenomenon thus more ts zones may be needed in mrts in real world water systems when the length of the pollution plume is long enough the front edge meets an immobile zone and the late time solute can still be affected by previous immobile zones in other words the function of the previous immobile zones would not cease when the solute encounters a new immobile zone so mrts may have limitations at this point in ftts only one trigger time is set for each ts zone and the previous ts terms would not be shut down in addition in ftts the time fractional derivative term could well simulate the heavy tailing phenomenon in the btc schumer et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 therefore each independent ts term in ftts could correspond to a local peak in the btc thus it will be more conducive to characterizing or locating the immobile zones in a flow field using ftts so this scheme could give more effective and promising simulations however whether the ftts is a promising and physically meaningful model or just a robust mathematic tool depends on the relationship between the estimated parameters of the ftts and the physical characteristics of a river exploring these relationships could be challenging and was not attempted in this study since detailed information such as morphological characteristics and surface storage and hyporheic zone distribution is limited the sensitive analysis shows that parameters in ftts have strong interactions and an equifinality for the combination of different parameters may exist thus the application of this model requires careful evaluation of the initial value and value range for parameters further research on the interpretation of parameters in a multi peak btc model and the relationship between solute transport and various immobile zone dynamics in a river is clearly needed 5 conclusion this study mainly introduced a fractional in time ts model in which each ts term is triggered at a specific time compared with fmim this theory is more in line with the characteristics of the actual flow field on this basis the simulation power of ftts was tested by simulating msr tracer data meanwhile the simulation results are compared with fmim and mrts models both the newly introduced ftts and the previous mrts model could well simulate the multi peaking phenomenon in the btc and both performed better than fmim however when compared to ftts mrts needs more ts terms and the corresponding more parameters to achieve similar accuracy of ftts therefore the ftts model is more efficient credit authorship

derivation of the ftts the mass transfer between the main channel and the immobile zones is of various rates which could be described by the multi rate mass transfer model mrmt a mrmt with n immobile zones could be written as a1 c m t β tot 1 n b j c im j t v c m x d 2 c m x 2 a2 c im j t j c m c im i j 1 n where c im j is the concentration of the j th immobile zone j is the first order exchange rate between the j th immobile zone and the mobile zone β tot is the total capacity coefficient b j 0 is the proportionality coefficient with b j 1 when n 1 the mrmt reduces to the single rate mass transfer model or the classical single rate ts model the solution of a2 is a3 c im j j e j t c m c im j x 0 e j t taking the derivative of a3 with respect to time we can get a4 c im j t j e j t c m t j e j t c m x 0 c im j x 0 where c im j x 0 denotes the initial concentration of j th immobile zone with the mass exchange rate and is convolution we assume that all solute begins in the mobile phase e g for all j the c im j x 0 0 and substitute eq a4 into eq a1 produces a4 c m t β tot g t c m t β tot g t c m x 0 v c m x d 2 c m x 2 where a5 g t 1 n b j j e j t is the memory function that models the resident time distribution rtd the particles stay in the immobile zone benson and meerschaert 2009 for the i th immobile zone solving a4 for c m and c m t then substituting them into a1 we can get the governing equation for solute evolution a6 c im i t β tot 1 n b j c im j t f i t β tot f i t c m x 0 v c im i x d 2 c im i x 2 j 1 n where f i t i e i t characterized the trapping effect of the i th immobile zone the concentration of the total immobile phase could be considered as the weighted average of all single immobile zones c im 1 n b j c im j accordingly the concentration evolution for the total immobile phase could be described as a7 c im t 1 n b i β tot 1 n b j c im j t f i t i n b i f i t c m x 0 v c im x d 2 c im x 2 based on the relationship in a5 we can rewrite a7 as a8 c im t β tot c im t g t g t c m x 0 v c im x d 2 c im x 2 the eqs a4 and a8 are the general form of mrmt we assume a more general rtd that combine with a power law rtd and several exponential rtds besides each exponential rtds was set with a trigger time a9 h t a t γ γ 1 γ 1 n d i s t i i e i t t i i 1 n where a is the weighting coefficient satisfying a 1 n d i 1 s t i is the step function thus h t is also a probability density function this assumes that when particles are trapped in the immobile zones part of them experience a power law rtd and part of them experience exponential rtds that begin at a specific trigger time the physical idea behind this is that the power law characterized immobile zone such as a hyporheic zone could influence the particles in the whole flow field the exponential characterized immobile zones such as a lake or side pool connected to the main channel could only influence the particles at a specific time or location since c t t γ γ 1 γ γ c t γ is a caputo fractional derivative of order γ and e t is the memory function of the classical mobile immobile or transient storage model schumer et al 2003 when substituting a9 into a4 and a8 we can get the

4406,the multi peaking phenomenon in a breakthrough curve btc is a typical character of solute transport in complex flow fields such as a karst aquifer previous understanding and modeling techniques for the single peaked btcs would no longer be adequate for the multi peaked one in a traditional non fickian model the overall non fickian effect is simply the summation of contributions from each immobile zone or heterogeneous flow path therefore a resultant btc is not sensitive to the exact location of the immobile zones on the pathway of solute and the local peaks cannot be reproduced effectively in this study we introduce a fractional in time transient storage ts model ftts in which the ts zones are arranged in series e g triggered at specific times to simulate different locations of each ts zone or immobile zone along the river channel the simulation power of the ftts was tested by simulating observations from a tracer experiment conducted in a subterranean river and data generated from two synthetic cases meanwhile the simulation results of the ftts were compared with those from the fractional mobile immobile model fmim and the multi rate transient storage model mrts results show that both ftts and mrts models could well simulate the multi peaking phenomenon in btc and perform better than fmim further to that compared to mrts the ftts is a more efficient model because 1 when containing the same number of ts zones the ftts performs significantly better and 2 when achieving similar accuracy the ftts uses fewer ts terms corresponding to a smaller number of parameters than mrts moreover all ts terms in the ftts can form a one to one correspondence with the local peaks of btc which may be helpful for better characterizing the internal morphology of a flow field keywords multi peak fractional model transient storage breakthrough curves 1 introduction breakthrough curves btcs with long tails were commonly observed in solute transports in the field and can be well described by various non fickian models such as the fractional advection dispersion equations fades kelly et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the continuous time random walks ctrw burnell et al 2017 scher et al 2010 and the multi rate mass transfer mrmt model haggerty and gorelick 1995 1998 the traditional nonlocal approaches only considered the btc with distinct rising and receding limbs i e a unique peak however btcs may not follow this pattern in a real world flow field many studies had proved that the multi peaking phenomenon that usually appears in the heavy tailing btcs is a typical feature of solute transport in complex flow fields dewaide et al 2018 field and pinsky 2000 field and leij 2012 goldscheider et al 2008 göppert and goldscheider 2007 le borgne et al 2013 perrin and luetscher 2008 siirila woodburn et al 2015 tinet et al 2019 yin et al 2020 local peaks in a btc are important when predicting contaminant transport neglecting local peaks in a predicted btc could result in an incorrect conclusion for risk analysis of a pollution incident especially when pollutants are highly toxic mainly interpreted as an effect of auxiliary conduits field and leij 2012 goldscheider et al 2008 perrin and luetscher 2008 siirila woodburn et al 2015 smart 1988 tinet et al 2019 the multi peaked btcs could also be shaped by many other factors such as immobile zones and flow field morphology by conducting a tracer experiment in a subterranean river dewaide et al 2018 proved that the existence of underground lakes could result in a double peaked btc in a laboratory experiment field and leij 2012 showed that waterfalls and turbulence in the splash zone in the flow path could temporarily detain solutes and also cause local peaks in a btc besides it has been found that the existence of islands in a river can also result in multi peaked btcs anderson and phanikumar 2011 other important factors causing multi peaked btcs are the dual domain advection or permeability in porous media yin et al 2020 the kinetic sorption in nonconservative solutes rainfall dilution göppert and goldscheider 2007 etc compared with the trailing phenomenon the local peaks in a btc were poorly studied this may due to the following reasons 1 subsampling of data may mask nonmonotonicity of the observed btcs siirila woodburn et al 2015 2 with the increase of the migration distance in a river the local peaks are less obvious due to the diffusion effect le borgne et al 2013 thus unobvious small peaks may be regarded as measurement errors and ignored 3 in most cases individual btc was reported in terms of ensemble averages thus the presence of local maxima was practically eliminated in either the advancing or receding limbs of the curve siirila woodburn et al 2015 as the exist of multi peaked btcs had been proven by more and more studies our prior cognition that characterizes the flow field by single peak btc would no longer be adequate e g tracers transport in the subterranean river in the karst area in most of the traditional non local models the generated btc which represents the overall non fickian effect is simply the summation of contributions from each immobile phase or other non local feature of a flow field therefore the morphology of a btc is not sensitive to the exact location size and capacity of a specific immobile zone in the pathway of solute which can be a major limitation for these models to reproduce the local peaks in a btc in early studies a multi peaked btc was usually fitted by the multi dispersion model mdm käss 1998 leibundgut et al 2009 the basic idea of the mdm is that each peak is separately described using a single ade that represents an independent flow path the final multi peaked btc is the weighted mean concentration from all ades the mdm theory is only an approximation since solute transport along different flow paths generally would not be independent field and leij 2012 developed a dual advection dispersion equation dade in which two conduits interact through a first order mass transfer coefficient although this model could reproduce the dual peaked btcs in a karst aquifer the application of this model requires careful evaluation of the aquifer tracer test design and tracer test implementation because it is only appropriate for cases that are confirmed to contain ramiform conduits some typical conditions e g large storage zones may also result in local peaks in a btc fig 1 and fitting the dade to such btc could lead to incorrect interpretations further to that it could hardly determine a conduit correspond to which local peak in their experiments see physical experiment 2 in field and leij 2012 recently tinet et al 2019 introduced the om made one dimensional model for multiple advection dispersion and storage in exchanging zones model in which all parallel and exchanging flow zones are divided into reaches along the direction of flow see their fig 1 and each reach is subdivided into discrete segments with equal length in practice however om made is hard to decide in advance how many reaches and zones are needed for a given case besides the values of the various parameters need to be set by a trial and error approach which becomes a tedious and difficult task with the increasing number of reaches especially considering the increased model complexity it may suffer from equifinality as the understanding of immobile zone and main channel interactions deepened non local models with more transient storage ts terms have been introduced to describe solute transport in a coastal stream network briggs et al 2009 briggs et al 2010 introduced a ts model that could separate the relative contributions of the hyporheic zone and the surface storage zone in this model each ts term simply represents the total retention effects of the corresponding type of storage zones thus the morphology of resultant btcs are not sensitive to a specific storage zone anderson and phanikumar 2011 used a multi rate ts model mrts that contains three storage zones arranged in series i e exchange triggered sequentially to successfully reproduced a bimodal btc generated by a 3 d hydrodynamic and transport model in their work the mrts used three ts terms to generate only one local peak i e the ts zones could not form a one to one correspondence with local peaks therefore if there were multiple local peaks in the btc it is difficult to determine in advance how many ts terms are needed in this model the one to one relationship between a ts zone and a local peak is helpful not only to the prediction of pollutant transport but also the depiction of the internal structure of the flow field commonly the multi peaked btcs are also characterized by the heavy tailing phenomenon field and pinsky 2000 fractional mobile immobile model fmim that assumes a power law residence time distribution rtd in the immobile zone was usually used to describe the long tail of a btc schumer et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 but the fmim usually overestimate the exponential tail of a btc in a complex flow field the transport of solute could be characterized by both exponential and power law trapping to describe this phenomenon in detail sun et al 2020a introduced a fractional in time model with a transient storage term in which the long term power law trapping effect could be described by the fractional in time term and the short term exponential trapping could be well described by the transient storage term by using a tempered fractional model lu et al 2018 proved that this model could also well captures both power law and exponential tailing of a btc although this model could fit the tailing phenomenon well it could not reproduce the local peaks in a btc more recently yin et al 2020 developed a dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm in which the distributed order fractional in time derivative engine was used to simulate the bimodal sub diffusive transport dynamics of solute in a heterogeneous media all these studies showed that the fractional derivative model is a promising tool to simulate the complex characteristics of a flow field in a stream system solute transport is characterized by various immobile zones a detailed description of the immobile zones would be greatly helpful to accurately simulate both the tailing and multi peaking phenomena in a btc based on this assumption in this work we introduce a fractional in time transient storage model ftts that contains multiple ts terms arranged in series in the ftts the multiple ts terms are supposed to simulate different immobile zones in different locations and the fractional in time term is supposed to simulate the hyporheic zone that may cover the whole flow field research questions that will be addressed in this work include 1 can this newly developed model well reproduce the local peaks in a btc 2 if so does the ftts perform better than the mrts 3 as a general rule complex models contain more parameters and tend to perform better but when considering the number of parameters is the ftts a more effective model than the fmim 4 in the ftts can the ts terms form one to one correspondence to local peaks in btc to address these questions we first extend the fmim model to a ftts then we verify our numerical scheme against analytical solutions of the ade and the fmim at last we fit it to the observed and synthetic data to compare its simulation power with the mrts the rest of this paper is arranged as follows in section 2 we introduce the ftts to verify the numerical scheme in section 3 we first compare the results of ftts to analytical solutions of ade and fmim then to assess the simulation power of the ftts we apply it to fit three tracer experiment data sets from maocun subterranean river msr in a karst area and two synthetic cases the results are discussed in section 4 we summarize our results in the conclusion section 2 method 2 1 the fmim model when the ade is generalized with fractional derivative in time the underlying stochastic particle motion process is based on power law waiting time distribution zhang et al 2009 to distinguish explicitly the mobile main channel and immobile storage zone status schumer et al 2003 developed the following fractional order mobile immobile model fmim using fractional calculus 1 c t β γ c t γ ν c x d 2 c x 2 0 γ 1 where c denotes the main channel mobile concentration γ is the derivative order and β t γ 1 is the fractional capacity coefficient the term γ t γ represents the fractional derivative v is velocity l t 1 and d l 2 t 1 is the dispersion coefficient when γ 1 the fmim reduces to the classic ade with a retardation factor 1 β an analytical solution to eq 1 with a pulse initial condition on an unbounded domain can be computed using a stable subordinator density schumer et al 2003 and was implemented in fracfit kelly et al 2017 2 2 the mrts model in the mrts model the storage zones are arranged in series and the solute concentration is described as anderson and phanikumar 2011 2 β 0 c m t i 1 n β i s t t i s t t i 1 c im i t v c m x d 2 c m x 2 3 c im i t t i c m c im i where i 1 n t 1 t 2 t i t i 1 t n t i is the trigger time for the i th immobile zone c im i is the concentration for the i th immobile zone t i is the first order mass exchange rate the parameter β t i is the capacity coefficient to account for the mass in the i th storage zone immobile region β 0 is the capacity coefficient for the river i e the cross sectional area of the stream channel s denotes the heaviside step function s t 0 1 t 0 t 0 which has the property at any given time 4 s t t i s t t i 1 0 1 0 t i t t i t t i 1 t t i 1 it can be seen from eq 4 that the summation effect from all immobile zones reduces to the contribution from a single immobile zone at any given time eqs 2 and 3 were solved using a fourth order accurate compact scheme with spectral like resolution anderson and phanikumar 2011 phanikumar et al 2007 2 3 the ftts model in a complex open channel e g a spatially heterogeneous river transportation of solute will be affected by various immobile zones the deep hyporheic zones could usually result in a btc with a power law tail which could be well described by a fractional in time ade model zhang et al 2009 on the other hand the surface immobile zones e g a side pool and a large lake could have a fast mass exchange with the main channel and could be well simulated by a ts term in the model briggs et al 2010 but this kind of immobile zones usually distributed at a specific location connect to a river this means that a surface storage zone will take effect on the transport of solutes at a specific time and accordingly give the motivation for using a trigger time in each ts term to capture the local mass exchanges 5 c m t β γ γ c m t γ i n s t i β i c im i t v c m x d 2 c m x 2 β γ t γ γ 1 γ β i s t i i e i t t i c m x 0 c im i x 0 0 where γ is the fractional derivate order γ is the gamma function and other symbols were explained above according to the property of the step equation the i th immobile zone does not work until time t i the mathematical derivation for eq 5 and the concentration evolution for the immobile phase could be seen in the appendix after being triggered the immobile zone would continuously impact the passing tracers even when the subsequent immobile zones are triggered which is different from mrts since the riemann liouville rl fractional derivative of a constant is not zero which can cause problems in the boundary conditions the fractional derivative in the ftts is solved using the caputo definition eqs 5 and a 11 were solved by a fully implicit euler method the discretization of γ c t γ is the same as that in murio 2008 we used the dirichlet boundary condition for the upstream boundary and the neumann boundary condition for the downstream boundary for both mrts and ftts the resulting tridiagonal matrix system of equations for ftts was solved by using the thomas algorithm press et al 2002 2 4 model parameter estimation the log based root mean squared error rmse was computed for each model simulation to provide a measure of goodness of fit gof as 6 rmse i 1 n log 10 c sim x t i log 10 c obs x t i 2 n where n is the number of samples in each btc as a result data with lower values in btcs receive greater weight than those in the absence of log transformation which is important for assessing anomalous transport characteristics where heavy tails occur at lower concentrations smaller rmse values indicate better agreement between simulated and observed datasets based on the shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1993 muttil et al 2007 we developed a parallel version for parameter estimation sun et al 2020a 2020b which was used for all cases in this study in addition the small sample corrected akaike information metric aicc that takes both gof and number of parameters into account is an effective parameter for model comparison and evaluation for models with varying parameter numbers it has the form as akpa and unuabonah 2011 xia et

sum of squares which is log transformed similar to log based rmse to give the same weight to the tails of the btc smaller aicc values maybe negative suggest the model is more justified by the data 2 5

based global sensitivity analysis was performed in this study a monte carlo based estimator was selected to calculate the first order sensitive indices si and the total sensitivity indices sti the mathematical expression is 9 si v x i e x ĩ y x i v y 10 sti e x ĩ v x i y x ĩ v y where v x i e x ĩ y x i represent a variance based first order effect for a generic factor x ĩ is the matrix of all factors except x i e x ĩ y x is the average value of y which takes over all possible values of x ĩ while keeping x i as fixed values the v x i is the variance that takes over all possible values of x i the quasi random sampling method developed by saltelli et al 2010 was used to simultaneously calculate si and sti technical details could be seen in homma and saltelli 1996 sun et al 2020b by assuming a uniform distribution of each parameter table 1 we sampled 50 000 random combinations of parameters for this simultaneous calculation as the output of the ftts is a time series data set from btc a total of 1500 data points that evenly distributed from the leading edge to the tail of btc were selected for parameter sensitivity analysis 2 6 site descriptions the tracer studies conducted in msr a subterranean river in a typical karst area in guilin china fig 2 were reported in huang et al 2017 totally three of their experiments were chosen as the research objects in this study the first experiment msr 1 hereafter was conducted at the daguping tracer material was injected in the daguping sinkhole and the maocun sinkhole was selected as the sampling point tracer of the second chosen experiment msr 2 hereafter was injected in modaojiang and the observation point is at shegengyan the last chosen experiment was conducted between dayanqian injection point and maocun sampling point detailed information is summarized in table 2 in addition for a better comparison between the ftts and mrts the synthetic btc data generated using a 3 d particle transport model were also used to test the models the synthetic data were generated by the transport model in the simulation of st clair river in mi usa by anderson and phanikumar 2011 to test the simulation power of the mrts two representative data set from stations t5 and t8 were selected in this study see their section 2 for more details 3 results 3 1 verification against analytical solutions of ade and fmim from eqs 5 and a11 we know that when set all β i 0 i e remove all the ts terms the ftts will reduce to the fmim model further to that when set β γ 0 and all β i 0 the ftts will reduce to the classical ade model the correctness of the numerical scheme for solving eqs 5 and a11 was assessed by comparing with corresponding analytical solutions of ade and fmim schumer et al 2003 the parameter values for ftts ade and fmim are listed in table 3 the hypothetical observation point was set 360 l downstream from the injection point the total injection mass was set as 3 28 10 3 m fig 3 are the comparisons of ftts versus ade and fmim respectively as shown in fig 3 ftts has a very similar result to that of ade the rmse between the two btcs is 0 0041 the late time portion of btc from ftts is slightly higher than that from ade very similar results are also found in the comparison between fmim and ftts and the rmse is 0 0092 given the small values of rmse the accuracy of the numerical scheme for solving ftts is acceptable 3 2 simulation for msr experimental data 3 2 1 msr 1 the morphology of btc from msr 1 is characterized by a relatively rapid increase until it reaches its main peak fig 4 a subsequently the receding limb exhibits a long and multi peaked tail the three local peaks appear at about 3 3 104 s 4 8 104 s and 9 0 104 s respectively for comparison we first used the ftts with 1 ts term ftts 1 hereafter and mrts with 3 ts terms mrts 3 hereafter to see if they performed better than fmim then we used ftts with 3 ts zones ftts 3 hereafter and mrts with 5 zones mrts 5 hereafter to describe the data fig 4 a the rmse and aicc values of the five models were compared and the optimal parameter values are listed in table 4 a comparison of the simulations exhibits that both ftts 1 and mrts 3 fig 4 a show a significant advantage in describing the multi peaked tail of the btc over the fmim however both models cannot capture all the local peaks ftts 1 simulates one of the small peaks rmse 0 0863 that appeared around 3 60 104 s and its trigger time t 1 is 4 86 104 s which matches the peak time well compared with ftts 1 mrts 3 can also reproduce that peak at around 4 80 104 s but its result is less accurate rmse 0 1075 the triggering time of the second ts term corresponds well with the local peak time in the btc however the triggering time of the first and third ts terms which are 1 14 10 3 s and 7 82 10 4 s respectively do not reproduce a local peak in the btc therefore we infer the first and third ts terms may assist the model in simulating the tailing effect of btc accurately in ftts 1 the tailing phenomenon could be mainly described by the fractional derivative term so a single ts term could well reproduce the bimodal btc the aicc values suggest that ftts 1 is the most appropriate model table 4 from fig 4 a we know that the ftts 3 and mrts 5 both could simulate the multi peaking phenomenon in msr 1 very well and showed similar accuracy but the aicc of ftts 3 is significantly smaller than that of mrts 5 which denotes that the ftts 3 is a more efficient model the triggering time of each ts term in ftts 3 2 71 10 4 4 26 10 4 and 8 13 10 4 s respectively basically corresponds to the beginning time of local peaks in btc in mrts 5 only three the second third and fourth ones with the corresponding triggering time 2 41 10 4 4 53 10 4 and 8 28 10 4 s respectively of the five ts terms correspond to the corresponding peaks 3 2 2 msr 2 given that both ftts 1 and mrts 3 cannot capture all the local peaks or irregular fluctuations in msr 1 we used ftts 3 mrts 5 and fmim for comparison to simulate the observations in this case and msr 3 in the next section the btc from the msr 2 tracer experiment is characterized by a relatively rapid increase in the leading edge fig 4 b then there are some irregular small fluctuations in the descending process beginning at about 2 6 105 s a small local peak appears at about 3 9 105 s and is followed by a heavy tail fig 4 b shows the simulations of ftts 3 mrts 5 and fmim table 5 lists the optimum parameters of the three models both mrts 5 and ftts 3 can well capture the irregular fluctuations in the btc while the results of fmim show significant departures from the observations the first ts term in mrts 5 is triggered at about 1 86 105 s which occurs at about the average time of the leading edge of the btc i e before the main peak time this ts term will detain solute in the raising stage and release at the falling limb of the btc thus this ts zone may mainly be responsible for the tailing of the btc rather than local peaks the triggering time of the rest four ts terms well correspond to the irregular features or local peaks in the btc at about 4 32 105 s the simulation of mrts 5 deviates significantly from the observed values while the ftts 3 model performs more accurately at the same time the ts zones in ftts 3 well correspond to the fluctuations of the btc this may indicate that part of the tailing phenomenon is presented by time fractional terms in ftts then the multi peak or irregular characteristics are well captured by the corresponding ts terms in mrts the ts terms are responsible for both the tailing and multi peaking phenomenon so more of them are needed when compared to ftts therefore ftts is a more effective model 3 2 3 msr 3 the observed change of solute concentration in msr 3 is steep in the rising stage accompanied by a fluctuation at about 4 80 105 s fig 4 c subsequently several small local peaks appear during the descent long tail fig 8 shows the simulation results of ftts 3 mrts 5 and fmim table 6 shows the optimal parameters of all three models both ftts 3 and mrts 5 could accurately simulate the peak value at about 8 10 105 s compared with mrts 5 ftts 3 performs better with smaller rmse and aicc values among the three models the fmim fails to capture the fluctuation at the rising stage of the btc and the mrts 5 rmse 0 1445 also overestimates the leading edge of the btc a little and is less accurate in describing the late time concentration than ftts 3 the run up time of the first ts zone in mrts 5 is 4 85 105 s and this ts zone accurately captures the fluctuation in the rising stage but shows less simulation accuracy than that in the ftts 3 it may be that the first ts zone in mrts 5 cannot fully account for both the following heavy tail and the current fluctuation in btc the triggering time of the second ts term is 6 03 105 s which does not match the local peak therefore the function of this ts zone may mainly represent the long tail of btc both ftts 3 and mrts 5 show a significant advantage in describing the multi peaked tail over the fmim but the aicc values show that the ftts 3 is the best model and the trigger time of each ts term corresponds well with the fluctuations in btc 3 3 simulation for the synthetic data detailed information for synthetic data of stations t5 and t8 could be seen in anderson and phanikumar 2011 the synthetic btcs and simulation results of ftts and mrts for t5 and t8 are shown in figs 5 a and 5 b respectively the estimated parameters and rmse and aicc values are summarized in table 7 in the case of t5 both the mrts 5 and the ftts 3 show similar accuracy but the aicc values show that the ftts 3 performs better since it uses fewer parameters in the case of t8 the synthetic btc has two obvious local peaks fig 5 b however both the mrts 3 and the ftts 1 could only reproduce the local peak at about 8 0 104 s and they show similar accuracy but the aicc values show that the ftts 1 performs better in addition the trigger time for the first and second ts terms in mrts 3 are not corresponding to the local peaks compared with the mrts 5 the ftts 3 gives a better fitting although both models could simulate the local peaks well 3 4 parameter sensitivity the values of si and sti for each parameter in ftts 3 are shown in fig 6 part of the btcs generated from random parameter combinations that were used to calculated si and sti are presented in fig 7 from fig 7 we can see that the main peaks of the btcs are mostly located in the time range of 200 400 s the leading edge of a btc mainly appears before 200 s the long tail of a btc mainly appears after 400 s results of si show that both parameters v and γ have a significant impact on btc before 400 s i e the early stage and the main peak of a btc the si for capacity coefficient fig 6 b the mass exchange rate fig 6 c and the triggering time fig 6 d for ts terms have raised significantly after being trigged but γ still has a relatively higher impact on btc than other parameters accordingly these parameters could have significant impacts on the tail of a btc moreover the sti which measures both the first order effect of a generic parameter and the interactions of this parameter with others shows significantly larger values than that of si for the capacity coefficient the mass exchange rate and the triggering time this indactes that these paramters have strong interactions with each other meanwihle the sti values of the aforementioned parameters indicates that they also have impacts on the leading edge before their trigging time of a btc which could also be attributed to their interactions with other parameters for example the capacity coefficients β 1 could have an effect on the solute distribution and transport in the main channel after the triggering time which will probably influence the mean velocity of the solute in the main channel thus the capacity coefficients β 1 could have interaction with v which represents the average flow velocity even before its trigging time 4 discussion in tracer experiments of msr all the observed btcs show irregular fluctuations or multi peaks in their heavy tails although various non fickian models have been introduced to describe the tailing phenomenon seldom of them can effectively reproduce the local peaks in a btc in a stream system the transport of solute is impacted by complex flow paths surface pools lateral dead zones and hyporheic zone payn et al 2008 and the resultant btcs often have complex morphology in a traditional non local model such as the fmim the overall retention effect to the solutes is simply the total contributions from all immobile phases or other non local features although it could well simulate the heavy tailing btcs e g fig 4 c the tail of the resultant btcs from this kind of model is not sensitive to the exact location of the immobile zone on the pathway of solute particles and the btcs are unimodal and smooth this indicates that to capture local peaks in a btc a model should consider the morphology characterizes of a river heterogeneous characteristics of rivers especially in small ones have a significant impact on solute transport if there were islands or other non moving objects exposed to the water surface in a river the flow could be divided into two or more branches which would converge again where the islands disappear fig 7 if there were obvious time differences in the transport of solute among these branches the btc could show local peaks anderson and phanikumar 2011 in addition the obvious curvature of the channel and the large storage zones connected to the channel such as lakes ponds etc could also affect the shape of the btc therefore multi peaked btc is a typical feature of complex river channels anderson and phanikumar 2011 field and leij 2012 siirila woodburn et al 2015 lizheng and jueye 1979 also pointed out that when there are multi pipelines in the karst area or there are pools or underground lakes connected to the main channel the btc can be multi peaked or step like anderson and phanikumar 2011 introduced a model that contains 5 parallel ts zones to simulate bimodal btc i e the ts zones have no trigger time see their equation 9 their results show that although this model contains multiple ts terms it cannot reproduce bimodal btc the reason is that although these ts zones are independent they are arranged in parallel that is every ts term or immobile zone is evenly spread over the whole flow field in parallel thus all ts zones play a uniform role in the whole process of solute transport in mrts and ftts a triggering time is set for each ts zone that is each ts term or immobile zone is sequentially arranged in time in the flow field we can see that both mrts and ftts can effectively simulate multi peaked btcs compared with mrts ftts is more effective in describing multi peaks and the heavy tails in btc since 1 when containing the same number of ts terms in both models ftts could simulate the results more accurately for example ftts 3 can effectively simulate all the peaks of btc in msr 1 and the synthetic case of t8 but mrts 3 can only capture one of the local peaks and its simulated results are obviously inferior to that of ftts 3 2 when resulting in similar accuracy ftts uses fewer ts terms and its aicc value is smaller than that of mrts for instance in the cases of msr 2 msr 3 and the two synthetic cases both ftts 3 and mrts 5 give very accurate simulations and the rmse values are very close but the aicc values show that the ftts 3 is a more promising model the observed btcs of tracer experiments are affected by various immobile zones such as the deep hyporheic zones and the surface immobile zones e g the pond and lake at the side of a river that have rapid mass exchange with the main channel the deep hyporheic zones are usually distributed along the streamline and can cause power law rtd but seldom generate local peaks the ts term describes an exponential rtd which is a limitation for simulating the heavy power law tail haggerty and gorelick 1998 haggerty et al 2000 when multiple ts terms are arranged in parallel and superimposed linearly the heavy power law tail can also be well reproduced such as the ts equation with 5 parallelly arranged ts terms proposed by anderson and phanikumar 2011 when simulating the observed data the ts terms in mrts 5 need to consider both the tailing and multi peaking characters in the btc in addition according to the properties of eq 3 the mrts assumes that the n 1 th ts term is shut down when the n th ts zone is triggered i e no superposition of the ts terms this would weaken the ability of mrts to represent the heavy tailing phenomenon thus more ts zones may be needed in mrts in real world water systems when the length of the pollution plume is long enough the front edge meets an immobile zone and the late time solute can still be affected by previous immobile zones in other words the function of the previous immobile zones would not cease when the solute encounters a new immobile zone so mrts may have limitations at this point in ftts only one trigger time is set for each ts zone and the previous ts terms would not be shut down in addition in ftts the time fractional derivative term could well simulate the heavy tailing phenomenon in the btc schumer et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 therefore each independent ts term in ftts could correspond to a local peak in the btc thus it will be more conducive to characterizing or locating the immobile zones in a flow field using ftts so this scheme could give more effective and promising simulations however whether the ftts is a promising and physically meaningful model or just a robust mathematic tool depends on the relationship between the estimated parameters of the ftts and the physical characteristics of a river exploring these relationships could be challenging and was not attempted in this study since detailed information such as morphological characteristics and surface storage and hyporheic zone distribution is limited the sensitive analysis shows that parameters in ftts have strong interactions and an equifinality for the combination of different parameters may exist thus the application of this model requires careful evaluation of the initial value and value range for parameters further research on the interpretation of parameters in a multi peak btc model and the relationship between solute transport and various immobile zone dynamics in a river is clearly needed 5 conclusion this study mainly introduced a fractional in time ts model in which each ts term is triggered at a specific time compared with fmim this theory is more in line with the characteristics of the actual flow field on this basis the simulation power of ftts was tested by simulating msr tracer data meanwhile the simulation results are compared with fmim and mrts models both the newly introduced ftts and the previous mrts model could well simulate the multi peaking phenomenon in the btc and both performed better than fmim however when compared to ftts mrts needs more ts terms and the corresponding more parameters to achieve similar accuracy of ftts therefore the ftts model is more efficient credit authorship

derivation of the ftts the mass transfer between the main channel and the immobile zones is of various rates which could be described by the multi rate mass transfer model mrmt a mrmt with n immobile zones could be written as a1 c m t β tot 1 n b j c im j t v c m x d 2 c m x 2 a2 c im j t j c m c im i j 1 n where c im j is the concentration of the j th immobile zone j is the first order exchange rate between the j th immobile zone and the mobile zone β tot is the total capacity coefficient b j 0 is the proportionality coefficient with b j 1 when n 1 the mrmt reduces to the single rate mass transfer model or the classical single rate ts model the solution of a2 is a3 c im j j e j t c m c im j x 0 e j t taking the derivative of a3 with respect to time we can get a4 c im j t j e j t c m t j e j t c m x 0 c im j x 0 where c im j x 0 denotes the initial concentration of j th immobile zone with the mass exchange rate and is convolution we assume that all solute begins in the mobile phase e g for all j the c im j x 0 0 and substitute eq a4 into eq a1 produces a4 c m t β tot g t c m t β tot g t c m x 0 v c m x d 2 c m x 2 where a5 g t 1 n b j j e j t is the memory function that models the resident time distribution rtd the particles stay in the immobile zone benson and meerschaert 2009 for the i th immobile zone solving a4 for c m and c m t then substituting them into a1 we can get the governing equation for solute evolution a6 c im i t β tot 1 n b j c im j t f i t β tot f i t c m x 0 v c im i x d 2 c im i x 2 j 1 n where f i t i e i t characterized the trapping effect of the i th immobile zone the concentration of the total immobile phase could be considered as the weighted average of all single immobile zones c im 1 n b j c im j accordingly the concentration evolution for the total immobile phase could be described as a7 c im t 1 n b i β tot 1 n b j c im j t f i t i n b i f i t c m x 0 v c im x d 2 c im x 2 based on the relationship in a5 we can rewrite a7 as a8 c im t β tot c im t g t g t c m x 0 v c im x d 2 c im x 2 the eqs a4 and a8 are the general form of mrmt we assume a more general rtd that combine with a power law rtd and several exponential rtds besides each exponential rtds was set with a trigger time a9 h t a t γ γ 1 γ 1 n d i s t i i e i t t i i 1 n where a is the weighting coefficient satisfying a 1 n d i 1 s t i is the step function thus h t is also a probability density function this assumes that when particles are trapped in the immobile zones part of them experience a power law rtd and part of them experience exponential rtds that begin at a specific trigger time the physical idea behind this is that the power law characterized immobile zone such as a hyporheic zone could influence the particles in the whole flow field the exponential characterized immobile zones such as a lake or side pool connected to the main channel could only influence the particles at a specific time or location since c t t γ γ 1 γ γ c t γ is a caputo fractional derivative of order γ and e t is the memory function of the classical mobile immobile or transient storage model schumer et al 2003 when substituting a9 into a4 and a8 we can get the

4407,slow release materials srms are a promising oxidant delivery technology for in situ chemical oxidation isco to remove arsenic as from groundwater on site microcapsules capable of slowly releasing ammonium persulfate aps have been developed and applied to aquifer fe coating technology aps microcapsules and dissolved fe ii can be injected into an as contaminated aquifer to boost the formation of hydrous ferric oxide or hydroxide thus immobilizing aqueous arsenic via adsorption this study reports on the use of microcapsules with extended release time to control the redox environment in the in situ remediation of as contaminated groundwater and prevent the reductive dissolution of hydrous ferric oxide or hydroxide the experimental results demonstrate that microcapsules capable of slowly releasing the aps oxidant were successfully prepared the core shell structure of the microcapsules in which aps was enclosed with poly methyl methacrylate pmma was confirmed with x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photo electron spectroscopic xps analyses and the uniform morphology of the 1 µm microcapsules was revealed by scanning electron microscopy sem the life span of the aps microcapsules was estimated to be 9 days zero order release kinetics could qualitatively explain the experimental curve and predict the release mechanism the small microcapsules had satisfactory transport performance in porous media and could represent a more efficient long term strategy for in situ remediation of high arsenic groundwater keywords arsenic groundwater in situ remediation persulfate slow release 1 introduction arsenic as is a severe health concern worldwide as contaminated groundwater can cause arseniasis and cancers particularly in countries such as india bangladesh vietnam and china among others eiche et al 2008 polizzotto et al 2005 polya et al 2008 wang et al 2009 effective purification technologies are urgently needed to remove arsenic from contaminated groundwater and meet drinking water quality standards 10 µg l who 2011 extracting groundwater and then purifying in treatment facilities to remove arsenic contamination is not preferred due to low efficiency and high operational costs in recent years in situ immobilization methods have attracted widespread attention in the search for as contaminated groundwater treatment technologies xie et al 2016 2015 the immobilization of arsenic is mainly achieved through the formation of iron oxides hydroxides that adsorb arsenic and coprecipitate in sediments one of the best known practices is the addition of oxidants to oxidize fe ii to iron oxides hydroxides brunsting and mcbean 2014 xie et al 2015 however oxidants are relatively short lived and remediation sites can suffer from back diffusion liu and ball 2002 and rebound problems connor et al 2018 de barros et al 2013 thus undermining long term effectiveness of arsenic removal seok et al 2014 siegrist 2001 one approach to overcome these challenges is slow release materials srms this concept has received much attention because of its potential to improve the long term effect of in situ groundwater remediation christenson et al 2016 slow release chemical oxidant materials match the contaminant destruction rate to the contaminant transport rate with a sustainable simple and low cost maintenance approach srms can slow down the release rate of reactive compounds yuan et al 2012 reduce the waste of oxidants yuan et al 2012 and maintain treatment effectiveness christenson et al 2016 with in situ chemical oxidation for in situ remediation srms can continuously increase contaminant removal efficiencies liang et al 2013 and maintain an oxidative environment for extended periods lee et al 2014 however most srms reported in previous studies were too large to be injected into the groundwater in situ in this regard we developed an srm with core shell structure and small size to be easily transported in aquifers peroxydisulfate s2o8 2 also known as persulfate is an advanced chemical oxidant that has been widely used with good results kambhu et al 2012 the standard redox potential of persulfate e0 2 01 v is higher than those of hydrogen peroxide e0 1 77 v and permanganate e0 1 67 v but lower than that of hydroxyl radicals e0 2 7 v or ozone e0 2 07 v house 1962 latimer 1952 in addition to accepting electrons directly persulfates can be activated to produce sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh so4 and oh have a higher redox potential than persulfate s2o8 2 eberson and ekstrom 1987 which makes them more potent towards recalcitrant pollutants consequently in this study we choose persulfate as the oxidant in the srms microencapsulation is a useful and popular approach for fabricating functional materials microcapsules can serve as tiny containers of oxidants that can be released from the core for specific applications bandeira et al 2015 benita 2005 rodrigues et al 2009 microcapsules help protect water soluble ammonium persulfate aps from dissolving and releasing from the core in situ polymerization could be an ideal method for the preparation of microcapsules that slowly release oxidants zuo et al 2014a there are

similarly prepared under the same condition column preparation and all experiments were conducted under an n2 atmosphere to maintain strict anaerobic conditions during the experiments the flow rate was controlled using multi channel pumps equipped with high strength pvc tubing feso4 solution and aps pmma suspension were injected into the column using a four step alternating injection method xie et al 2015 feso4 solution 5 0 mmol l and aps pmma suspension 2 5 g l were alternatingly injected into the column at a flow rate of 12 1 ml min for 1 min under anaerobic conditions between the injections of these two materials oxygen free deionized water was injected for 1 min to help the reactants spread more homogeneously the injected microcapsules gradually released aps to oxidize ferrous ions to iron minerals that can adsorb arsenic as a result feso4 and aps pmma uniformly diffused and formed homogeneous iron minerals these procedures were repeated under anaerobic conditions until the brown color of quartz sand in the column was relatively uniform and dark 3 results and discussion 3 1 core shell structure of aps microcapsules fig 2 depicts a comparison of the ft ir spectra of pure aps and aps pmma the characteristic peaks at 1060 and 1400 cm 1 are related to aps ring vibrations zuo et al 2014a the peaks observed at 2854 and 2921 cm 1 represent the c h vibrational modes in pmma units zuo et al 2014a the apparent spectral differences between pure aps and aps pmma are mainly attributed to physicochemical characteristics of the aps and pmma the xrd pattern of aps pmma is displayed in fig 3 a all major peaks can be assigned to the pure aps phase fig 3 b pdf 31 0069 zuo et al 2014b the sharp peaks indicate the in situ polymerized microcapsules retain the complete crystal structure of aps due to the amorphous nature of pmma the diffraction peak of pmma is not detected in the xrd pattern of the sample the xps spectra of aps pmma reveal the elemental composition and bonding on the surface of as prepared microcapsules the survey spectra of aps pmma in fig 4 a show the presence of c n o and s on the aps pmma surface this indicates the co existence of aps and pmma in the aps pmma microcapsules in addition fig 4 b shows the c 1 s peak can be deconvoluted into three peaks located at 284 7 286 26 and 288 42 ev which are assigned to c c c o and o c o respectively beamson et al 1991 all of these results indicate the aps particles were successfully coated with pmma fe sem micrographs of the aps pmma microcapsules prepared at mma concentrations of 5 wt a 10 wt b and 15 wt c g l are shown in fig 5 uniform microcapsules were gradually formed by polymerizing mma on the aps surface fig 5 a c the as synthesized microcapsules have a near spherical shape with a diameter of about 0 5 1 5 µm fig 5 c high c n o and s content is detected in the eds spectrum of the aps microcapsules at 48 31 10 40 11 35 and 29 93 wt respectively fig 5 d these results further demonstrate the successful synthesis of the aps pmma microcapsules fig 6 a displays the size distribution of aps pmma particles which ranges from 0 5 to 1 5 µm fig 6 b shows the core shell structure of aps pmma microcapsules as identified in the tem images possible formation mechanisms for the aps pmma microcapsules by in situ polymerization were further explored as schematically shown in fig 7 the mixed oil phase first forms by mixing mma aibn span 80 tween 80 and dichloromethane while the mixed water phase consists of aps cmc and h2o microdroplets of water phase are dispersed in the oil phase after the two phases are mixed with stirring fig 7 left and left center the hydrophobic mma then gradually transfers to the aps surface fig 7 left center and right center by heating and evaporating the dichloromethane at 70 c finally aps acts as an initiator that enables the polymerization of mma monomers to form the microcapsule shells fig 7 right center and right 3 2 release properties of aps microcapsules fig 8 a shows the release curve of aps from the aps pmma microcapsules at room temperature as measured by the conductivity of the suspension the aps in the microcapsules gradually diffuses into the water over time eventually increasing the conductivity to 1378 µs cm the continuous release of aps in microcapsules lasts for approximately 9 days the release kinetics of the aps pmma microcapsules were investigated by fitting the aps release data to five different kinetic models with correlation coefficients r and fitted curves displayed in fig 8 b f table 1 presents the equations of the five release models in standing water a comparison of the data with all models indicates the release kinetics of aps pmma can be best described by the zero order kinetic model which had the highest r2 value 0 9753 the korsmeyer peppas model could also be used to explain the release mechanism where the release index n changes according to the mechanism of release in this model n values 0 43 indicate aps release from the microcapsules follows fickian diffusion 0 43 n 0 85 implies diffusion controlled release and abnormal transport and n 0 85 suggests polymer relaxation during core material dissolution singhvi and singh 2011 the model of the experimental data returns a higher correlation coefficient r2 0 9519 with n 0 43 indicating the release of aps follows fickian diffusion this suggests aps release from aps pmma microcapsules is dominated by diffusion through the polymeric matrix 3 3 transport characteristics of aps microcapsules and condition for iron coating the breakthrough curves of aps pmma microcapsules with different flow velocities and porous media diameter are presented in fig 9 the results indicate higher flow rates and larger quartz sand diameters improve the migration of aps pmma microcapsules in porous media as the microcapsules migrate in quartz sand increasing in the flow rate and quartz sand size decrease the collision frequency fig 10 shows the iron coating on the quartz sand after injecting feso4 solution and aps pmma suspension the brown color of the quartz sand in the column became progressively darker with the continued injection of materials several dark spots in the upper half of the column might have been caused by the rapid migration of smaller microcapsules nevertheless the color of the column gradually became uniform over time indicating the iron coating uniformly developed in the injection process in addition we set up a controlled experiment without adding microcapsules and found a little change but the color was not obvious the morphology of fe coating quartz sand was examined by fe sem fig 11 a shows the quartz sand covered with flake or plate shaped crystals the eds spectrum fig 11 b indicates a relatively high iron content 48 46 wt in the quartz sand after being coated with iron compounds the high iron content and plate like morphology suggest the coating layer is mainly goethite α feooh cornell and schwertmann 2003 goethite the main component of rust has good arsenic adsorption performance dixit and hering 2003 in general small particles of iron oxide iron hydroxide formed in the coating have a high surface area and can improve the removal efficiency of arsenic cornell and schwertmann 2003 moreover xie et al show goethite formed in the in situ iron coating process has a high arsenic removal efficiency due to its large specific surface area xie et al 2015 ir and raman spectra of fe coating quartz sand were collected to further investigate the formation of the fe coating materials the band at 3440 cm 1 in the ir spectrum of the fe coated quartz sand fig 12 a corresponds to the h o h vibration of non stoichiometric hydroxyl groups excess water while the band at 3230 cm 1 is related to the h o h vibration of stoichiometric hydroxyl units ruan and gmkes 1995 the bands at 1617 and 1824 cm 1 are assigned to the bending vibrations of water ruan et al 2002 the raman spectrum of the fe coated quartz sand fig 12 b features both strong and weak bands at 217 277 393 474 and 598 cm 1 these findings correspond to published values where well resolved goethite bands are noted at 218 239 398 471 and 601 cm 1 ugwu et al 2019 the results above confirm the surface of the quartz sand was successfully coated in goethite previous research by our group suggests small goethite particles can achieve high arsenic removal efficiency xie et al 2015 4 conclusions slow release ammonium persulfate microcapsules were synthesized by in situ polymerization and tested at the laboratory scale the microcapsules could successfully encapsulate aps for extended release maintaining a high redox potential in the groundwater and promoting the formation of hydrous ferric hydroxide it will also prevent the reductive dissolution of hydrous ferric hydroxide because of the extended oxidation environment the release of aps from aps pmma microcapsules in water can extend over 9 days sem images indicate the use of different amounts of mma modifies the morphology of the aps pmma the release mechanism of aps pmma fits the zero order kinetic model and follows fickian diffusion the results of column experiments demonstrate aps microcapsules can be successfully transported in porous media a four step alternating circulation method can be used to uniformly cover the surface of quartz sand with scale like goethite without blocking the columns our study suggests that the as synthesized aps microcapsules can be injected into groundwater in situ and sustain oxidant release for a long time which is a cost effective and low maintenance technology therefore the aps microcapsules fe2 process appears to be an ideal solution for the remediation of high arsenic

4407,slow release materials srms are a promising oxidant delivery technology for in situ chemical oxidation isco to remove arsenic as from groundwater on site microcapsules capable of slowly releasing ammonium persulfate aps have been developed and applied to aquifer fe coating technology aps microcapsules and dissolved fe ii can be injected into an as contaminated aquifer to boost the formation of hydrous ferric oxide or hydroxide thus immobilizing aqueous arsenic via adsorption this study reports on the use of microcapsules with extended release time to control the redox environment in the in situ remediation of as contaminated groundwater and prevent the reductive dissolution of hydrous ferric oxide or hydroxide the experimental results demonstrate that microcapsules capable of slowly releasing the aps oxidant were successfully prepared the core shell structure of the microcapsules in which aps was enclosed with poly methyl methacrylate pmma was confirmed with x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photo electron spectroscopic xps analyses and the uniform morphology of the 1 µm microcapsules was revealed by scanning electron microscopy sem the life span of the aps microcapsules was estimated to be 9 days zero order release kinetics could qualitatively explain the experimental curve and predict the release mechanism the small microcapsules had satisfactory transport performance in porous media and could represent a more efficient long term strategy for in situ remediation of high arsenic groundwater keywords arsenic groundwater in situ remediation persulfate slow release 1 introduction arsenic as is a severe health concern worldwide as contaminated groundwater can cause arseniasis and cancers particularly in countries such as india bangladesh vietnam and china among others eiche et al 2008 polizzotto et al 2005 polya et al 2008 wang et al 2009 effective purification technologies are urgently needed to remove arsenic from contaminated groundwater and meet drinking water quality standards 10 µg l who 2011 extracting groundwater and then purifying in treatment facilities to remove arsenic contamination is not preferred due to low efficiency and high operational costs in recent years in situ immobilization methods have attracted widespread attention in the search for as contaminated groundwater treatment technologies xie et al 2016 2015 the immobilization of arsenic is mainly achieved through the formation of iron oxides hydroxides that adsorb arsenic and coprecipitate in sediments one of the best known practices is the addition of oxidants to oxidize fe ii to iron oxides hydroxides brunsting and mcbean 2014 xie et al 2015 however oxidants are relatively short lived and remediation sites can suffer from back diffusion liu and ball 2002 and rebound problems connor et al 2018 de barros et al 2013 thus undermining long term effectiveness of arsenic removal seok et al 2014 siegrist 2001 one approach to overcome these challenges is slow release materials srms this concept has received much attention because of its potential to improve the long term effect of in situ groundwater remediation christenson et al 2016 slow release chemical oxidant materials match the contaminant destruction rate to the contaminant transport rate with a sustainable simple and low cost maintenance approach srms can slow down the release rate of reactive compounds yuan et al 2012 reduce the waste of oxidants yuan et al 2012 and maintain treatment effectiveness christenson et al 2016 with in situ chemical oxidation for in situ remediation srms can continuously increase contaminant removal efficiencies liang et al 2013 and maintain an oxidative environment for extended periods lee et al 2014 however most srms reported in previous studies were too large to be injected into the groundwater in situ in this regard we developed an srm with core shell structure and small size to be easily transported in aquifers peroxydisulfate s2o8 2 also known as persulfate is an advanced chemical oxidant that has been widely used with good results kambhu et al 2012 the standard redox potential of persulfate e0 2 01 v is higher than those of hydrogen peroxide e0 1 77 v and permanganate e0 1 67 v but lower than that of hydroxyl radicals e0 2 7 v or ozone e0 2 07 v house 1962 latimer 1952 in addition to accepting electrons directly persulfates can be activated to produce sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh so4 and oh have a higher redox potential than persulfate s2o8 2 eberson and ekstrom 1987 which makes them more potent towards recalcitrant pollutants consequently in this study we choose persulfate as the oxidant in the srms microencapsulation is a useful and popular approach for fabricating functional materials microcapsules can serve as tiny containers of oxidants that can be released from the core for specific applications bandeira et al 2015 benita 2005 rodrigues et al 2009 microcapsules help protect water soluble ammonium persulfate aps from dissolving and releasing from the core in situ polymerization could be an ideal method for the preparation of microcapsules that slowly release oxidants zuo et al 2014a there are some literature studies about the microcapsules prepared by in situ polymerizations microcapsules encapsulating ammonium polyphosphate have been created via polymerization with glycidyl methacrylate

characterization of cdom is necessary to provide new insights into the biogeochemical processes and pathways in tropical mangrove estuaries in support of the sustainable development of mangrove forests spectroscopic techniques especially absorbance and fluorescence have successfully been applied to trace the chemical composition and identify the sources and processing of cdom they also have cost and sensitivity advantages over traditional biomarkers used in bio hydrogeochemistry coble 1996 stedmon and nelson 2015 hansen et al 2016 common optical parameters include the non normalized a254 doc normalized absorbance coefficient at a wavelength of 254 nm suva spectral slopes s275 295 s350 400 and their ratio sr all of which can indicate the aromaticity of molecules and cdom sources helms et al 2008 ni and li 2020 furthermore the combination of three dimensional excitation emission matrices eems with parallel factor analysis parafac allows the differentiation of cdom fluorophores such as terrestrial humic like microbial marine humic like and protein like stedmon et al 2003 ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2013 humics are primarily composed of aromatic and aliphatic compounds derived from the decay of organic matter while protein like materials are related to biological reactions singh et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 to date the previous studies have been basically focused on the spectral and chemical properties of cdom in the open ocean yamashita et al 2007 stedmon et al 2011 osburn et al 2012 fluorescence intensities of seven components two humic like four amino acid like and one chemical were identified by jørgensen et al 2011 in the atlantic pacific and indian oceans generally the oceanic cdom pool is typical of low absorption 0 05 8 66 m 1 and more variable s275 295 values 0 020 0 045 nm 1 catalá et al 2018 galletti et al 2019 photochemical degradation in the surface ocean is accounted for lower absorption and higher s275 295 values than in deep waters nelson et al 2010 while research on the cycling behaviors and factors controlling the dynamics of cdom and micro nutrients in the coastal mangrove estuaries remain relatively uncommon therefore present study determined the spectral absorption eems fluorescence and hydrochemical characteristics of water samples from dongzhai harbor mangrove estuary to address the following objectives 1 ascertain the composition sources and mixing behavior of cdom 2 examine correlations between cdom optical properties and key environmental factors and 3 identify cdom and micro nutrients biogeochemical processes affecting mangroves in dongzhai harbor estuary 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the study was conducted in dongzhai harbor mangrove estuary situated in the northeastern region of hainan province china e 110 30 110 37 n 19 51 20 01 fig 1 he et al 2019 the eastern side of the estuary consists of an alluvial plain and the western side is bordered by low hills the base rocks in this region are mainly basalt and olive basalt that are the origin of overlying soils li et al 2013 the estuary experiences a tropical marine monsoon with a mean annual rainfall of 1676 mm and average temperature of 24 8 the estuary is subjected to irregular semidiurnal tides with mean tidal oscillations of 1 6 1 8 m wang et al 2009 it is a semi enclosed muddy bottom estuary with an area of 5400 hm2 formed by a continental sink during the 1605 great qiongzhou earthquake huang et al 2018 to the southeast and west are four rivers i e yanzhou river sanjiang river yanfeng east river and yanfeng west river flowing into the estuary these carry large amounts of silt that are deposited within the estuary with land based nutrients to create extensive inter tidal mudflats the mudflats provide an environment for mangrove growth in this area and thus it is termed a fluvial mangrove zone a total of 58 surface water samples were collected along headwater mangrove sea transects from dongzhai harbor estuary in november 2019 for each sampling point geographical coordinates latitude longitude and elevation were recorded in situ with a gps receiver details on water sampling and general on site laboratory analysis can be found in supplementary material 2 2 cdom absorption spectroscopy uv visible absorption spectra were measured between 200 and 800 nm in 1 nm increments using a hitachi u 3900 spectrophotometer with results referenced to a blank spectrum derived from ultrapure 18 2 mω milli q water an instrument baseline correction was performed before sample analysis raw absorbance was corrected for instrument drift temperature effects scattering and refractive effects by subtracting the absorbance at 700 nm carr et al 2019 the napierian cdom absorption coefficients aλ were calculated from measured absorbance aλ a λ 2 303 a λ l spencer et al 2013 where aλ is the optical density at wavelength λ and l is the quartz cell path length 0 01 m the absorption coefficients at 254 nm a254 were calculated as follows a 254 2 303 a 254 l song et al 2019c where a254 is the napierian absorption coefficient at 254 nm and a254 is the raw absorbance at 254 nm the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva was calculated by normalizing decadic absorption to doc concentrations i e s u v a l m m g 1 a 254 d o c suva is strongly correlated with molecular weight stedmon et al 2011 and a useful proxy for the aromaticity of aquatic humic substances hansen et al 2016 the spectral slope coefficient of cdom s is a descriptor of cdom quality and used to characterize dom composition helms et al 2008 values generally range between 0 005 and 0 030 nm 1 stedmon and nelson 2015 in this study the s value was calculated using a non linear regression technique for a small uvb 275 295 nm and uva 350 400 nm wavelength range with the following equation a λ a λ 0 e s λ λ 0 where aλ is the absorption coefficient at a certain wavelength λ and aλ0 is the absorption coefficient at a reference wavelength λ0 s is the exponential slope coefficient stedmon et al 2000 linear regression was performed to fit the absorption spectra to the log transformed equation ln a λ l n a λ 0 s λ λ 0 the spectral slope ratio sr has been proposed as indicator of the molecular weight mw source and exposure to photochemical degradation of cdom in natural waters cuss and guéguen 2015 helms et al 2008 the sr value was calculated as the ratio of s275 295 to s350 400 sr values for terrestrial high mw dom with greater aromaticity normally are 1 while estuarine and extensively photodegraded low mw dom are mainly 1 spencer et al 2012 fichot and benner 2012 2 3 cdom fluorescence spectroscopy cdom fluorescence eems measurements were performed on an f 4600 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies tokyo japan with a 1 cm quartz cell at room temperature instrumental response was corrected following the procedure recommended by the instruction manual the excitation ex and emission em spectra ranged from 200 to 450 nm 5 nm intervals and 250 to 600 nm 2 nm intervals respectively with a scanning speed of 2400 nm min 1 milli q water blanks were subtracted to remove water raman peaks from each sample eem rayleigh scatter was eliminated by interpolation with the dreem toolbox decomposition routines for excitation emission matrices murphy et al 2013 ren et al 2020 the fluorescence signal at all measured wavelengths was calibrated to the integral of the raman signal at ex wavelength 350 nm to obtain intensities in raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 inner filter effects on eems measurements were eliminated for absorbance via multiplying each eems value with a correction factor mcknight et al 2001 kothawala et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 f cor f obs 10 a ex a em 2 where f cor and f obs are the post and pre calibrated fluorescence intensity and a ex and a em are absorbance values at the current ex and em wavelengths respectively the fluorescent components of calibrated eem spectra were modelled using parafac performed in matlab r2015b with the domfluor toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 parafac decomposes the eem dataset into a series of tri linear components that explain the variability in fluorescence properties of the dataset kothawala et al 2014 procedures for conducting parafac modeling include the identification of outliers minimization of sum of squares residuals identification of the adequate number of parafac components random initialization and model validation by split half analysis stedmon and bro 2008 unaccounted fluorescence with residual fluorescence 10 of measured fluorescence intensity was near baseline for all samples via visual inspection of residual eem spectra cawley et al 2012 as a result four parafac components were found to provide a robust description of dom fluorescence within the dataset table 1 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of the parafac component was defined as the component fluorescence intensity in addition to the intensity of each parafac component ci the relative fluorescence intensity was expressed as a percentage ci of the total value of all four component intensities fluorescence spectra can also be utilized to explore potential cdom sources and biochemical composition through calculation of fluorescence indices two alternative fluorescence indices have been proposed for studying the complex dom dynamics in estuarine systems the humification index hix and biological index bix zsolnay et al 1999 huguet et al 2009 hix indicative of the extent of dom humification was calculated as the peak area under the emission spectra at 435 480 nm normalized to the peak area from 300 to 345 nm at 254 nm excitation bix was the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 380 to 430 nm with an excitation wavelength of 310 nm and was used to estimate autochthonous biological activity in aquatic environments hansen et al 2016 higher bix values correspond to predominantly freshly produced autochthonous dom in water huguet et al 2009 2 4 statistical analyses spatial mapping of sampling sites was conducted using arcgis 10 5 software environmental systems research institute redlands ca eems contour and parafac modelling were established using matlab r2015b correlation analysis t tests and principal components analysis pca were performed with origin 2018 software microcal software inc northampton ma differences were considered as statistically significant when p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 general hydrochemistry hydrochemical parameters of water samples are presented in table s1 salinity increased from upstream to downstream in the estuary ranging from 4 1 psu to 31 6 psu mean 23 9 psu in november 2019 this reflects physical mixing of riverine freshwater and seawater zhou et al 2019 notably some riverine samples had higher salinity than seawater which might be caused by evapotranspiration within mangroves reading et al 2017 the distribution patterns of hydrochemical parameters ph do doc tdn tdsi tdp mn and ba are plotted against salinity in fig 2 do and ph respectively increased from 3 31 mg l and 6 80 in the riverine endmember to 9 13 mg l and 8 23 in the marine endmember representative of the do and ph ranges typically observed in dongzhai harbor estuary xu et al 2018 report that the fractions of large sized dom decrease as the ph increases from the acidic to alkaline zone which indicates cdom abundance and spectral properties could be affected by ph shifts through dispersion and aggregation during estuarine transit the concentration of do can greatly impact the number and activity of microbes which indirectly influence the fluorescence characteristics of cdom in natural water amon and benner 1996 cawley et al 2012 surface water doc concentrations ranged from 3 20 to 6 29 mg l mean 4 85 mg l generally decreased longitudinally from the upper to lower estuary and showed an inverse correlation with salinity these doc values are slightly higher than jiulong estuary mean 1 89 0 33 mg l guo et al 2011 and zhujiang estuary 3 66 1 16 mg l he et al 2010 tdn and tdsi concentrations respectively decreased from 1 64 and 4 88 mg l in the fluvial mangrove zone to 0 39 and 0 18 mg l in the marine endmember the negative relationships between doc tdn tdsi concentration and salinity fig 2c e suggest the distribution patterns are partially controlled by the mixing process between fresh and salt waters however the correlation between tdp and salinity is positive p 0 01 and the highest value of 3 26 mg l was found at the marine endmember station which demonstrates non conservative behavior for tdp along the estuarine transects this is similar to changes in the st james wetland and endicott forested estuaries near juneau southeast alaska fellman et al 2010 the highest dissolved mn and ba concentrations 0 30 and 0 15 mg l respectively were found in the riverine area and decreased along the fluvial mangrove zones toward the marine endmember these micronutrient concentrations could be regulated by various processes in the estuarine mixing zones thus displaying non conservative behavior along the salinity gradient chupakova et al 2018 fichot et al 2014 cdom optical properties could also affect trace metal chemical speciation and biogeochemical cycles by the interactions of dom with trace metal zhang et al 2019 sharpless and blough 2014 3 2 optical parameters of cdom optical properties reflect dom sources and bioavailability in aquatic environments zhou et al 2019 the significant relationships between salinity and five cdom optical parameters a254 suva s275 295 s350 400 and sr are shown in fig 3 p 0 01 a254 and suva values demonstrate a land to sea decreasing trend from the rivers to the dongzhai harbor estuary showing an obvious terrestrial influence high values of a254 15 0 26 0 m 1 and suva 3 0 4 5 l m 1 mg 1 in the headwaters indicate abundant aromatic dom in contrast with low values at the sea 0 9 14 5 m 1 and 0 2 2 9 l m 1 mg 1 respectively the s275 295 varied between 0 012 and 0 024 nm 1 mean 0 017 nm 1 and increased with salinity whereas s350 400 decreased from 0 059 to 0 008 nm 1 mean 0 019 nm 1 the steepest s275 295 value is comparable to data from u s coastal waters e g 0 024 nm 1 in the georgia bight helms et al 2008 and 0 023 nm 1 in the st lawrence estuary spencer et al 2012 mean values for s350 400 are analogous to previously reported data for coastal waters 0 018 0 019 nm 1 shank and evans 2011 the mixing of chromophores and cumulative effects of photobleaching might be largely responsible for this trend fichot and benner 2012 variations of s275 295 and s350 400 demonstrate the composition of chromophores in riverine and marine cdom is different furthermore sr can serve as a more sensitive indicator of cdom origin than a single s value and is useful for understanding photochemically induced changes in the dom pool molecular weight shank and evans 2011 sr ranges from 0 23 to 1 84 mean 1 13 for the complete dataset the mean sr value is similar to data reported for the mackenzie river 1 11 stedmon et al 2011 and the highest sr value is consistent with coastal waters 1 20 1 40 spencer et al 2012 fig 3 clearly shows a positive correlation between sr and salinity p 0 001 r2 0 41 suggesting the dominance of autochthonous dom at the mouth of dongzhai harbor shifts in s275 295 s350 400 and sr with increasing salinity agree with findings from the delaware estuary helms et al 2008 these shifts of cdom optical parameters are probably due to mixing of river water with marine water in the estuary the effect of salinity on photosynthesis in the terrestrial mangrove forest and further photodegradation and microbial degradation during downstream transit madsen østerbye et al 2018 song et al 2019b 3 3 parafac components of cdom the four resolved excitation and emission spectral loadings of the components identified by the parafac model are depicted in fig 4 these four components explain 99 of the total variation in the fluorescence eems data array and are present to some extent in all samples an open access cdom spectral database was used to determine the parafac components murphy et al 2014 which are summarized in table 1 with descriptions of each component provided in the literature with respect to the four components in the surface water sample three c1 c2 and c3 are characterized as humic like materials with ex em maxima at 345 428 365 500 and 250 320 396 nm respectively c1 and c2 are related to peak c coble 1996 abundant in fractions of humic and fulvic acids which are widespread in rivers lakes streams and wetlands dalmagro et al 2017 singh et al 2013 c1 is surmised to be a ubiquitous humic like component cory and mcknight 2005 which represents 32 3 of the total cdom moreover c1 is similar to a peak previously characterized as a humic fluorophore group exported from anthropogenic activities stedmon and markager 2005 component c2 has been found in a wide range of aquatic environments and is recognized as a terrestrial plant or soil derived fulvic acid fluorophore group with high aromaticity stedmon et al 2003 osburn et al 2016 its red shifted peak location is known to be associated with its condensed molecular structures linking c2 to terrestrial detrital dom produced by the degradation of vascular plants kim et al 2018 c2 accounts for 29 6 of the total cdom in the full dataset however c3 which is related to peaks a and m represents 27 9 and could be produced by the shift of the peak position to shorter wavelengths blue shift from peak c which exhibits longer wavelengths coble 1996 refers to this component as a marine humic like component mainly originating from microbial derived fulvic acids this component could be altered by phytoplankton degradation and photodegradation in surface waters bai et al 2019 the c3 component is also similar to component c6 defined by stedmon and markager 2005 and considered to be a humic fluorophore dominating the fluorescence of wastewater dom and possibly correlated to the spreading of animal waste the fourth component c4 is identified as protein like materials with the ex em centered at 250 300 335 346 nm and empirically categorized as a tryptophan like fluorophore peak t from autochthonous sources this component is present throughout the dongzhai harbor estuary representing 10 2 of the total cdom in the full dataset 4 discussion 4 1 composition source and behavior of cdom in dongzhai harbor estuary the distribution patterns of the relative abundances of the four parafac components c1 c4 from the head to the downstream reaches of dongzhai harbor estuary are plotted against salinity in fig 5 the estuary is surrounded by swamps marshes arable land mangrove forest wetland regions construction area and aquaculture ponds fig s1 and thus the acquired eems reflect these influences the c1 and c3 significantly decreased c1 p 0 001 r2 0 26 c3 p 0 01 r2 0 16 indicating terrestrial and anthropogenic humic like dom might be the dominant component in the headwater region of dongzhai harbor anthropogenic sources such as aquaculture wastewater agricultural runoff and domestic wastewater transported by the local rivers could contribute to the increased fluorescence intensities of the humic like components the c2 was different from c1 and c3 slightly increased until s 20 psu then gradually decreased seaward which indicated inputs of high mw aromatic fulvic like dom within the mangrove forest field observations provided evidence that large expanses of mangrove wetlands throughout the region could be important cdom origins to the upper estuary shank et al 2010 also demonstrate the production of cdom from mangrove litters the conservative or non conservative behavior of different dom fractions during mixing of freshwater and seawater can be revealed via the relationship between parafac components and salinity laane and kramer 1990 yamashita et al 2008 fellman et al 2010 guo et al 2011 stedmon and nelson 2015 high and low fluorescence abundances of c1 were usually found at low and high salinity sites respectively indicating substantial amounts of c1 would be derived from riverine inputs however the plot of c3 and salinity contains some data points that deviate toward high fluorescence abundance when s 25 psu as compared to c1 such deviation points to c3 sources that are not only from riverine inputs but also the biogeochemical processing of terrestrial organic matter during transport across dongzhai harbor estuary yamashita et al 2008 the data also show the sum of c1 and c2 is on average 3 6 times that of c3 suggesting non conservative behavior of c3 is partially due to the photo microbial degradation of c1 and or c2 shutova et al 2014 light absorption and microbial activity are expected to be higher in coastal environments than in rivers yamashita 2004 the c4 increased p 0 01 r2 0 17 with salinity contrary to trends for c1 c3 indicating the decoupling behavior and different sources for humic like and tryptophan like components in the dongzhai harbor estuary the decoupling would cause c4 enhancement of the total fluorescence intensity with increasing salinity which might affect the associated bioavailability and thereby the biogeochemical role of cdom guo et al 2011 as reported by fellman et al 2010 the biodegradability of cdom is positively correlated with the protein like component percentage this component is presumably from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources consisting of amino acids free or bound in proteins with fluorescence that resembles free tryptophan yamashita et al 2010 in this study c4 potentially received additions from in situ production within the estuary in addition to the riverine inputs hence the estuarine mixing behavior of each dom component included photochemical and biogeochemical processes beyond physical mixing of freshwater and seawater humification and biological indices are plotted in fig 5 the humification index hix is an indicator of humic substances and extent of dom humification ohno 2002 as humification of dom proceeds the h c ratio decreases shifting the emission spectra of the fluorophores toward longer wavelengths with higher values indicating highly humified dom from terrestrial sources hansen et al 2016 fleck et al 2014 higher degree humified organic matter should remain longer than lower degree humified substances in natural environments singh et al 2010 the biological index bix serves as a measure of autochthonous biological activity in water samples and generally ranges from 0 6 to 1 0 huguet et al 2009 high values 1 0 of bix correspond to more freshly released dom into water from primarily autochthonous sources kida et al 2019 for the entire dataset hix and bix values respectively range from 0 79 to 2 90 mean 1 47 and 0 58 to 1 42 mean 0 71 in dongzhai harbor estuary the relationship between hix and salinity is negative and with bix is positive in general humification decreased along the transect as terrestrially derived organic matter decreased from the upper to lower estuary hix values remain relatively high 1 5 up to s 20 psu which seemingly indicates the presence of strongly humified components in this region of the estuary these results are consistent with c2 variation implying some highly aromatic fulvic like dom inputs in the upper estuary for salinity higher than 25 psu hix clearly decreases for most seawater samples which indicates the presence of organic material of biological origin with a low degree of humification in the lower estuary bix values are relatively constant between 0 6 and 1 0 for s 25 and some data points increase to 1 0 in the middle to lower estuary these results support conclusions from the calculation of hix i e the upper estuary has lower biological productivity compared to the marine environment where the primary production is higher huguet et al 2009 therefore this results in clear spectral changes in the mangrove estuary and a removal of terrestrial substances perhaps by photo oxidative degradation mixing and to a lesser extent flocculation sorption and microbial degradation of dom helms et al 2008 similar studies also report chromophoric dom removal behavior in the high salinity area of large estuaries stolpe et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 gao et al 2019 the hix and bix indices are useful proxies for determining dom composition and source in coastal environments in a simple and fast manner 4 2 spatial patterns in cdom optical properties and key environmental factors fluvial mangrove zones are mainly located near four rivers i e sanjiang river sjr yanzhou river yzr yanfeng east river yfer and yanfeng west river yfwr among them the yzr and sjr are situated in the upper reaches yfer in the middle estuary and yfwr in the lower estuary the mean salinity of the four rivers is from lowest to highest yzr 12 0 psu sjr 12 4 psu yfer 18 3 psu and yfwr 28 4 psu the abundance of parafac components c1 c4 suva sr hix and bix for each river is summarized as boxplots fig 6 mean c1 and c3 values are lowest for the yfwr 36 8 and 32 6 respectively the other three rivers are similar at 40 and 34 respectively mean c2 is highest for the yfer 23 3 and lowest for the yzr 21 6 mean c4 for the yfwr is 8 2 while for the other rivers averages between 2 3 and 4 7 mean suva values range from 2 1 l m 1 mg 1 for the yfwr to 4 1 l m 1 mg 1 for the yzh the sjr has suva values between 3 0 and 4 1 l m 1 mg 1 and the yfer has values between 2 4 and 3 5 l m 1 mg 1 the yfwr also has the highest sr value among the rivers studied with a mean of 1 39 whereas the yzr has the lowest mean 0 34 mean values for the sjr and yfer are 0 96 and 1 13 respectively mean hix values show a decreasing trend from the sjr 2 20 to yzr 2 00 yfer 1 97 and yfwr 1 83 similar to salinity the yzr also has the lowest mean value of bix 0 69 with values for the remaining three rivers averaging 0 75 these results clearly show that the yzr sjr and yfer from the upper and middle estuary primarily contribute humic like dom that is affected by terrestrial inputs however the yfwr in the lower estuary has a relatively lower humification degree indicating it is potentially dominated by tryptophan like dom with autochthonous sources principal component analysis pca as a variable reduction method was applied to results for the dongzhai harbor estuary samples physico chemical variables include hydrochemical parameters i e salinity ph do eh and ec nutrients i e tdn tdsi tdp mn and ba doc and cdom optical parameters a254 suva s275 295 s35 400 sr hix bix and the four parafac components c1 c4 in the fluvial mangrove zones the first two axes pc1 and pc2 account for 49 49 and 14 76 respectively of the variability in cdom related parameters fig 7 a salinity ec do ph c3 bix sr and s275 295 exhibit positive pc1 loadings while tdn tdsi mn suva a254 doc c1 s350 400 and hix demonstrate negative pc1 loadings as sr and s275 295 are both negatively related to the relative molecular size of cdom zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 this implies pc1 is negatively related to the concentration and relative molecular size of cdom ba tdp s275 295 and terrestrial humic like c2 show high pc2 loadings indicating pc2 may be positively linked with terrestrial cdom input nutrients tdn tdsi mn are clearly associated with terrestrial anthropogenic humic like parafac component c1 while ba and tdp are related to terrestrial plant soil derived fluvic like c2 salinity ec ph and do are associated with microbial photo labile humic like c3 eh and tryptophan like c4 are present along the negative side of the pc2 axis and are inversely related to ba concentration moreover the four fluvial mangrove zones obviously present varying environmental factors and cdom properties fig 7a s2 the yzr sjr and yfwr clusters are separated by pc1 while pc2 separates the yfer cluster from the other three fig 7a the yzr and sjr sample clusters are related to tdn tdsi mn suva a254 doc s350 400 c1 and hix which indicates allochthonous anthropogenic dom and some terrestrial mangrove forests input notably the highest tdn tdsi mn suva a254 doc s350 400 and c1 are all observed in the yzr and the highest hix in the sjr the yzr and sjr are bordered by the towns of yanzhou and sanjiang with large populations and dense aquaculture ponds high population density and anthropogenic activity from the circumjacent towns could increase the levels of nutrients and aromatic compounds in cdom bai et al 2019 the yfer cluster is associated with ba c2 tdp s275 295 sr and hix because the yfer flows through dongzhai harbor mangrove national nature reserve soil derived fulvic like dom might predominantly enter the estuary from the terrestrial mangrove forests samples from the yfwr cluster are linked with salinity ec do ph c3 and bix suggesting fresh microbial photo labile humic like dom might influence this mangrove zone the yfwr is closet to qiongzhou strait which is greatly affected by natural tidal action however the boxplot results indicate the yfwr is also dominated by autochthonous tryptophan like dom combined with the pca biplots of the yfwr fig s2 this suggests high mw terrestrial humic like dom is primarily found in the upper and middle regions while low mw microbial humic like dom and tryptophan like dom mainly control the lower region within the dongzhai harbor channel pc1 and pc2 account for 60 45 and 21 52 of the variability respectively fig 7b the loadings plot shows four parafac components are distributed along pc1 such that the tryptophan like dom c4 is most negative and the humic like components c1 c2 and c3 are positive the humic and non humic parafac components have diverse distributions along pc1 suggesting a dom source controlled pc1 humic like components c1 and c2 as well as hix exhibit high pc2 loadings which implies pc2 is possibly related to terrestrial cdom origin in accord with the fluvial mangrove zones samples from the upper estuary are associated with tdn suva a254 c3 and c1 and samples from the middle estuary are related to doc bix and c2 in the lower estuary samples have a close relationship with ph do salinity ec and c4 the pca loadings of seawater demonstrate that the fluorescent cdom varies with different hydrogeochemical conditions the allochthonous dom c1 c2 and c3 predominates in the upper and middle estuary while more autochthonous dom c4 is produced in the lower estuary these results indicate the relative humic like components are more abundant in the upper estuary consistent with decreasing degree of cdom humification along the salinity gradient the channel of dongzhai harbor is characterized by long water retention times and strong water evaporation as a result organic matter progressively accumulates from the upper to lower estuary which might contribute to the greater concentration of cdom measured in seawater catalán et al 2016 song et al 2019b nonetheless long periods of exposure to sunlight likely degrade high mw humic substances into smaller products such as low mw acids carbonyl compounds and volatile hydrocarbons bertilsson and tranvik 2000 helms et al 2014 the sunlight photobleaching processes significantly increases with salinity which is regarded as an important cdom removal mechanism in surface waters of the coastal ocean nieto cid et al 2006 osburn et al 2009 our results confirm that the variation of fluorescent cdom components in dongzhai harbor estuary can be complicated due to the effect of diverse hydrogeochemical and climatic factors including salinity wastewater discharge and anthropogenic activities 4 3 implications for biogeochemical processes in mangrove estuaries from land to sea in dongzhai harbor mangrove estuary cdom and nutrients can be added removed or modified due to various complex biogeochemical transformations and processes as well as human activities fig 8 in the fluvial mangrove zones high values of suva a254 and hix and low values of sr and bix are observed which indicate terrestrial anthropogenic humic like dom is enriched in this region moreover increasing aquaculture and residential regions could subsequently cause nutrients and other pollutants to be transported into mangrove wetlands further driving eutrophic conditions and oxygen consumption as implied by low do saturation levels cawley et al 2012 anoxic mangrove porewaters are an important source of tdn such as nh4 and dissolved organic nitrogen don to surface waters mori et al 2019 reading et al 2017 dom can be biodegraded by microbial activity under anaerobic conditions after oxygen is depleted releasing high amounts of nh4 that retard the normal growth of mangrove roots and seedlings yamashita et al 2007 cao et al 2017 tdsi is mainly derived from natural sources such as chemical weathering dissolution of mangrove forest litter and soil phytoliths which play an important role in fluvial transport to the marine endmember derry et al 2005 kopprio et al 2017 as shown in fig 2 concentrations of tdn and tdsi rapidly decrease towards the marine endmember while tdp shows the opposite trend similar to the cross river estuary in west africa dan et al 2019 these concentrations may have been modified by biogeochemical processes within the estuary system in mangrove wetlands tdp can be adsorbed onto fe mn al oxyhydroxides or bound to humic like dom carbonates and other colloidal fractions barcellos et al 2019 resulting in low concentrations of tdp for micronutrients porewater discharge and solute particle interactions are pivotal sources of dissolved mn and ba in addition to the local fluvial supply as reported in other mangrove estuaries holloway et al 2016 mori et al 2019 in organic rich environments humic substances as the major metal binding components in cdom can also complex with mn and ba owing to their carboxylic and phenolic functional groups blazevic et al 2016 in this study humic like components c1 and c2 show a close relationship with mn and ba fig 7a s2 suggesting cdom mn ba coupling is a potential driving force for micronutrient enrichment in mangrove wetlands however organo metallic complexation processes promote the movement and availability of mn and ba which might stress the growth and respiration of mangrove roots liu et al 2009 dang et al 2015 in the marine endmember the optical parameters of cdom revealed low values of suva a254 and hix and high values of sr and bix indicating the dominance of tryptophan like dom low concentrations of nutrients were observed which demonstrates nutrients are mostly constrained in the lower estuary physical mixing photo chemical degradation microbial utilization tidal reversal and or exchange flow within the estuary system can modify the cdom and nutrient characteristics statham 2012 removal of tdn and tdsi in surface waters is largely attributed to saltwater dilution according to the linear relationships between tdn and tdsi with salinity in the great kwa river estuary and calabar river estuary depletion of tdn and tdsi is partly ascribed to plankton utilization and microbial activity dan et al 2019 high inputs of dissolved mn and ba along the mangrove estuary were observed whereas most of the derived solutes were removed before reaching the marine endmember fig 2g h at higher ph 8 and dissolved oxygen in the lower region fig 2a b mn could be rapidly oxidized and form mn hydr oxides further resulting in the co precipitation of ba sadat noori et al 2017 ba cycling in estuaries is mainly driven by ion exchange processes on particles in response to changes in ionic strength and ba has a strong affinity for mn forming ba hydr oxides sanders et al 2012 joung and shiller 2014 mori et al 2019 the formation of mn ba hydr oxides can potentially lead to the adsorption of mn ba onto suspended particulates or cdom causing precipitation flocculation and cycling at the solute particle interface thereby lowering mn and ba concentrations gonneea et al 2013 holloway et al 2016 5 conclusion along the estuarine gradient cdom and micro nutrient evolution gradually changed from the fluvial mangrove zones to the marine endmember three fluorescent components comprising three humic like components c1 c2 and c3 and a tryptophan like component c4 were identified using eem parafac modeling our results revealed that cdom absorption at 254 nm a254 suva hix and the abundance of humic like substances decreased with increasing salinity indicating the dominance of terrestrial anthropogenic derived aromatic cdom in the upper estuary significant positive correlations were observed between sr bix tryptophan like materials and salinity which indicates low mw autochthonous cdom prevails in the lower estuary notably the estuarine mixing behaviors of each dom component were complicated involving photo biogeochemical processes beyond the simple physical mixing of freshwater and seawater doc tdn tdsi mn ba and humic like cdom were enriched in the yzr sjr and yfer fluvial mangrove zones located in the upper and middle estuary which were primarily affected by terrestrial inputs riverine runoff and mangrove porewater exchange in contrast the yfwr close to the marine endmember had relatively higher ph do ec salinity tdp and tryptophan like cdom suggesting saltwater dilution tidal mixing photo oxidation and microbial degradation processes might cause the phenomena overall this study provides insights into the environmental implications of biogeochemical processes induced by cdom composition

4408,chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is a major optically active component of dom in estuaries that plays a significant part in maintaining the ecosystem sustainability of mangrove forests via affecting nutrient and micronutrient micro nutrient biogeochemical processes and pathways this study was conducted in hainan dongzhai harbor to better understand the sources composition and behaviors of cdom in a tropical mangrove estuary water samples were collected from the upper fluvial mangrove zones to the lower marine endmember along the estuarine salinity gradient and analyzed by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis parafac doc tdn tdsi mn ba and optical characteristics i e a254 suva hix and the abundance of humic like cdom are negatively correlated with salinity terrestrial anthropogenic inputs riverine runoff and mangrove porewater exchange are sources of micro nutrients and aromatic cdom into the estuary in contrast ph do tdp sr bix and tryptophan like cdom are positively correlated with salinity this indicates saltwater dilution tidal mixing photo oxidation and microbial degradation processes promote the enrichment of low mw autochthonous cdom and tdp together with the removal of humic like substances and other micro nutrients in the lower estuary overall these findings have important implications for

the past three decades coastal mangrove areas have drastically declined owing to aquaculture agriculture tourism and urban developments xin et al 2014 hence understanding the sources and compositional characterization of cdom is necessary to provide new insights into the biogeochemical processes and pathways in tropical mangrove estuaries in support of the sustainable development of mangrove forests spectroscopic techniques especially absorbance and fluorescence have successfully been applied to trace the chemical composition and identify the sources and processing of cdom they also have cost and sensitivity advantages over traditional biomarkers used in bio hydrogeochemistry coble 1996 stedmon and nelson 2015 hansen et al 2016 common optical parameters include the non normalized a254 doc normalized absorbance coefficient at a wavelength of 254 nm suva spectral slopes s275 295 s350 400 and their ratio sr all of which can indicate the aromaticity of molecules and cdom sources helms et al 2008 ni and li 2020 furthermore the combination of three dimensional excitation emission matrices eems with parallel factor analysis parafac allows the differentiation of cdom fluorophores such as terrestrial humic like microbial marine humic like and protein like stedmon et al 2003 ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2013 humics are primarily composed of aromatic and aliphatic compounds derived from the decay of organic matter while protein like materials are related to biological reactions singh et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 to date the previous studies have been basically focused on the spectral and chemical properties of cdom in the open ocean yamashita et al 2007 stedmon et al 2011 osburn et al 2012 fluorescence intensities of seven components two humic like four amino acid

s275 295 values 0 020 0 045 nm 1 catalá et al 2018 galletti et al 2019 photochemical degradation in the surface ocean is accounted for lower absorption and higher s275 295 values than in deep waters nelson et al 2010 while research on the cycling behaviors and factors controlling the dynamics of cdom and micro nutrients in the coastal mangrove estuaries remain relatively uncommon therefore present study determined the spectral absorption eems fluorescence and hydrochemical characteristics of water samples from dongzhai harbor mangrove estuary to address the following objectives 1 ascertain the composition sources and mixing behavior of cdom 2 examine correlations between cdom optical properties and key environmental factors and 3 identify cdom and micro nutrients biogeochemical processes affecting mangroves in dongzhai harbor estuary 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the study was conducted in dongzhai harbor mangrove estuary situated in the northeastern region of hainan province china e 110 30 110 37 n 19 51 20 01 fig 1 he et al 2019 the eastern side of the estuary consists of an alluvial plain and the western side is bordered by low hills the base rocks in this region are mainly basalt and olive basalt that are the origin of overlying soils li et al 2013 the estuary experiences a tropical marine monsoon with a mean annual rainfall of 1676 mm and average temperature of 24 8 the estuary is subjected to irregular semidiurnal tides with mean tidal oscillations of 1 6 1 8 m wang et al 2009 it is a semi enclosed muddy bottom estuary with an area of 5400 hm2 formed by a continental sink during the 1605 great qiongzhou earthquake huang et al 2018 to the southeast and west are four rivers i e yanzhou river sanjiang river yanfeng east river and yanfeng west river flowing into the estuary these carry large amounts of silt that are deposited within the estuary with land based nutrients to create extensive inter tidal mudflats the mudflats provide an environment for mangrove growth in this area and thus it is termed a fluvial mangrove zone a total of 58 surface water samples were collected along headwater mangrove sea transects from dongzhai harbor estuary in november 2019 for each sampling point geographical coordinates latitude longitude and elevation were recorded in situ with a gps receiver details on water sampling and general on site laboratory analysis can be found in supplementary material 2 2 cdom absorption spectroscopy uv visible absorption spectra were measured between 200 and 800 nm in 1 nm increments using a hitachi u 3900 spectrophotometer with results referenced to a blank spectrum derived from ultrapure 18 2 mω milli q water an instrument baseline correction was performed before sample analysis raw absorbance was corrected for instrument drift temperature effects scattering and refractive effects by subtracting the absorbance at 700 nm carr et al 2019 the napierian cdom absorption coefficients aλ were calculated from measured absorbance aλ a λ 2 303 a λ l spencer et al 2013 where aλ is the optical density at wavelength λ and l is the quartz cell path length 0 01 m the absorption coefficients at 254 nm a254 were calculated as follows a 254 2 303 a 254 l song et al 2019c where a254 is the napierian absorption coefficient at 254 nm and a254 is the raw absorbance at 254 nm the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva was calculated by normalizing decadic absorption to doc concentrations i e s u v a l m m g 1 a 254 d o c suva is strongly correlated with molecular weight stedmon et al 2011 and a useful proxy for the aromaticity of aquatic humic substances hansen et al 2016 the spectral slope coefficient of cdom s is a descriptor of cdom quality and used to characterize dom composition helms et al 2008 values generally range between 0 005 and 0 030 nm 1 stedmon and nelson 2015 in this study the s value was calculated using a non linear regression technique for a small uvb 275 295 nm and uva 350 400 nm wavelength range with the following equation a λ a λ 0 e s λ λ 0 where aλ is the absorption coefficient at a certain wavelength λ and aλ0 is the absorption coefficient at a reference wavelength λ0 s is the exponential slope coefficient stedmon et al 2000 linear regression was performed to fit the absorption spectra to the log transformed equation ln a λ l n a λ 0 s λ λ 0 the spectral slope ratio sr has been proposed as indicator of the molecular weight mw source and exposure to photochemical degradation of cdom in natural waters cuss and guéguen 2015 helms et al 2008 the sr value was calculated as the ratio of s275 295 to s350 400 sr values for terrestrial high mw dom with greater aromaticity normally are 1 while estuarine and extensively photodegraded low mw dom are mainly 1 spencer et al 2012 fichot and benner 2012 2 3 cdom fluorescence spectroscopy cdom fluorescence eems measurements were performed on an f 4600 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies tokyo japan with a 1 cm quartz cell at room temperature instrumental response was corrected following the procedure recommended by the instruction manual the excitation ex and emission em spectra ranged from 200 to 450 nm 5 nm intervals and 250 to 600 nm 2 nm intervals respectively with a scanning speed of 2400 nm min 1 milli q water blanks were subtracted to remove water raman peaks from each sample eem rayleigh scatter was eliminated by interpolation with the dreem toolbox decomposition routines for excitation emission matrices murphy et al 2013 ren et al 2020 the fluorescence signal at all measured wavelengths was calibrated to the integral of the raman signal at ex wavelength 350 nm to obtain intensities in raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 inner filter effects on eems measurements were eliminated for absorbance via multiplying each eems value with a correction factor mcknight et al 2001 kothawala et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 f cor f obs 10 a ex a em 2 where f cor and f obs are the post and pre calibrated fluorescence intensity and a ex and a em are absorbance values at the current ex and em wavelengths respectively the fluorescent components of calibrated eem spectra were modelled using parafac performed in matlab r2015b with the domfluor toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 parafac decomposes the eem dataset into a series of tri linear components that explain the variability in fluorescence properties of the dataset kothawala et al 2014 procedures for conducting parafac modeling include the identification of outliers minimization of sum of squares residuals identification of the adequate number of parafac components random initialization and model validation by split half analysis stedmon and bro 2008 unaccounted fluorescence with residual fluorescence 10 of measured fluorescence intensity was near baseline for all samples via visual inspection of residual eem spectra cawley et al 2012 as a result four parafac components were found to provide a robust description of dom fluorescence within the dataset table 1 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of the parafac component was defined as the component fluorescence intensity in addition to the intensity of each parafac component ci the relative fluorescence intensity was expressed as a percentage ci of the total value of all four component intensities fluorescence spectra can also be utilized to explore potential cdom sources and biochemical composition through calculation of fluorescence indices two alternative fluorescence indices have been proposed for studying the complex dom dynamics in estuarine systems the humification index hix and biological index bix zsolnay et al 1999 huguet et al 2009 hix indicative of the extent of dom humification was calculated as the peak area under the emission spectra at 435 480 nm normalized to the peak area from 300 to 345 nm at 254 nm excitation bix was the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 380 to 430 nm with an excitation wavelength of 310 nm and was used to estimate autochthonous biological activity in aquatic environments hansen et al 2016 higher bix values correspond to predominantly freshly produced autochthonous dom in water huguet et al 2009 2 4 statistical analyses spatial mapping of sampling sites was conducted using arcgis 10 5 software environmental systems research institute redlands ca eems contour and parafac modelling were established using matlab r2015b correlation analysis t tests and principal components analysis pca were performed with origin 2018 software microcal software inc northampton ma differences were considered as statistically significant when p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 general hydrochemistry hydrochemical parameters of water samples are presented in table s1 salinity increased from upstream to downstream in the estuary ranging from 4 1 psu to 31 6 psu mean 23 9 psu in november 2019 this reflects physical mixing of riverine freshwater and seawater zhou et al 2019 notably some riverine samples had higher salinity than seawater which might be caused by evapotranspiration within mangroves reading et al 2017 the distribution patterns of hydrochemical parameters ph do doc tdn tdsi tdp mn and ba are plotted against salinity in fig 2 do and ph respectively increased from 3 31 mg l and 6 80 in the riverine endmember to 9 13 mg l and 8 23 in the marine endmember representative of the do and ph ranges typically observed in dongzhai harbor estuary xu et al 2018 report that the fractions of large sized dom decrease as the ph increases from the acidic to alkaline zone which indicates cdom abundance and spectral properties could be affected by ph shifts through dispersion and aggregation during estuarine transit the concentration of do can greatly impact the number and activity of microbes which indirectly influence the fluorescence characteristics of cdom in natural water amon and benner 1996 cawley et al 2012 surface water doc concentrations ranged from 3 20 to 6 29 mg l mean 4 85 mg l generally decreased longitudinally from the upper to lower estuary and showed an inverse correlation with salinity these doc values are slightly higher than jiulong estuary mean 1 89 0 33 mg l guo et al 2011 and zhujiang estuary 3 66 1 16 mg l he et al 2010 tdn and tdsi concentrations respectively decreased from 1 64 and 4 88 mg l in the fluvial mangrove zone to 0 39 and 0 18 mg l in the marine endmember the negative relationships between doc tdn tdsi concentration and salinity fig 2c e suggest the distribution patterns are partially controlled by the mixing process between fresh and salt waters however the correlation between tdp and salinity is positive p 0 01 and the highest value of 3 26 mg l was found at the marine endmember station which demonstrates non conservative behavior for tdp along the estuarine transects this is similar to changes in the st james wetland and endicott forested estuaries near juneau southeast alaska fellman et al 2010 the highest dissolved mn and ba concentrations 0 30 and 0 15 mg l respectively were found in the riverine area and decreased along the fluvial mangrove zones toward the marine endmember these micronutrient concentrations could be regulated by various processes in the estuarine mixing zones thus displaying non conservative behavior along the salinity gradient chupakova et al 2018 fichot et al 2014 cdom optical properties could also affect trace metal chemical speciation and biogeochemical cycles by the interactions of dom with trace metal zhang et al 2019 sharpless and blough 2014 3 2 optical parameters of cdom optical properties reflect dom sources and bioavailability in aquatic environments zhou et al 2019 the significant relationships between salinity and five cdom optical parameters a254 suva s275 295 s350 400 and sr are shown in fig 3 p 0 01 a254 and suva values demonstrate a land to sea decreasing trend from the rivers to the dongzhai harbor estuary showing an obvious terrestrial influence high values of a254 15 0 26 0 m 1 and suva 3 0 4 5 l m 1 mg 1 in the headwaters indicate abundant aromatic dom in contrast with low values at the sea 0 9 14 5 m 1 and 0 2 2 9 l m 1 mg 1 respectively the s275 295 varied between 0 012 and 0 024 nm 1 mean 0 017 nm 1 and increased with salinity whereas s350 400 decreased from 0 059 to 0 008 nm 1 mean 0 019 nm 1 the steepest s275 295 value is comparable to data from u s coastal waters e g 0 024 nm 1 in the georgia bight helms et al 2008 and 0 023 nm 1 in the st lawrence estuary spencer et al 2012 mean values for s350 400 are analogous to previously reported data for coastal waters 0 018 0 019 nm 1 shank and evans 2011 the mixing of chromophores and cumulative effects of photobleaching might be largely responsible for this trend fichot and benner 2012 variations of s275 295 and s350 400 demonstrate the composition of chromophores in riverine and marine cdom is different furthermore sr can serve as a more sensitive indicator of cdom origin than a single s value and is useful for understanding photochemically induced changes in the dom pool molecular weight shank and evans 2011 sr ranges from 0 23 to 1 84 mean 1 13 for the complete dataset the mean sr value is similar to data reported for the mackenzie river 1 11 stedmon et al 2011 and the highest sr value is consistent with coastal waters 1 20 1 40 spencer et al 2012 fig 3 clearly shows a positive correlation between sr and salinity p 0 001 r2 0 41 suggesting the dominance of autochthonous dom at the mouth of dongzhai harbor shifts in s275 295 s350 400 and sr with increasing salinity agree with findings from the delaware estuary helms et al 2008 these shifts of cdom optical parameters are probably due to mixing of river water with marine water in the estuary the effect of salinity on photosynthesis in the terrestrial mangrove forest and further photodegradation and microbial degradation during downstream transit madsen østerbye et al 2018 song et al 2019b 3 3 parafac components of cdom the four resolved excitation and emission spectral loadings of the components identified by the parafac model are depicted in fig 4 these four components explain 99 of the total variation in the fluorescence eems data array and are present to some extent in all samples an open access cdom spectral database was used to determine the parafac components murphy et al 2014 which are summarized in table 1 with descriptions of each component provided in the literature with respect to the four components in the surface water sample three c1 c2 and c3 are characterized as humic like materials with ex em maxima at 345 428 365 500 and 250 320 396 nm respectively c1 and c2 are related to peak c coble 1996 abundant in fractions of humic and fulvic acids which are widespread in rivers lakes streams and wetlands dalmagro et al 2017 singh et al 2013 c1 is surmised to be a ubiquitous humic like component cory and mcknight 2005 which represents 32 3 of the total cdom moreover c1 is similar to a peak previously characterized as a humic fluorophore group exported from anthropogenic activities stedmon and markager 2005 component c2 has been found in a wide range of aquatic environments and is recognized as a terrestrial plant or soil derived fulvic acid fluorophore group with high aromaticity stedmon et al 2003 osburn et al 2016 its red shifted peak location is known to be associated with its condensed molecular structures linking c2 to terrestrial detrital dom produced by the degradation of vascular plants kim et al 2018 c2 accounts for 29 6 of the total cdom in the full dataset however c3 which is related to peaks a and m represents 27 9 and could be produced by the shift of the peak position to shorter wavelengths blue shift from peak c which exhibits longer wavelengths coble 1996 refers to this component as a marine humic like component mainly originating from microbial derived fulvic acids this component could be altered by phytoplankton degradation and photodegradation in surface waters bai et al 2019 the c3 component is also similar to component c6 defined by stedmon and markager 2005 and considered to be a humic fluorophore dominating the fluorescence of wastewater dom and possibly correlated to the spreading of animal waste the fourth component c4 is identified as protein like materials with the ex em centered at 250 300 335 346 nm and empirically categorized as a tryptophan like fluorophore peak t from autochthonous sources this component is present throughout the dongzhai harbor estuary representing 10 2 of the total cdom in the full dataset 4 discussion 4 1 composition source and behavior of cdom in dongzhai harbor estuary the distribution patterns of the relative abundances of the four parafac components c1 c4 from the head to the downstream reaches of dongzhai harbor estuary are plotted against salinity in fig 5 the estuary is surrounded by swamps marshes arable land mangrove forest wetland regions construction area and aquaculture ponds fig s1 and thus the acquired eems reflect these influences the c1 and c3 significantly decreased c1 p 0 001 r2 0 26 c3 p 0 01 r2 0 16 indicating terrestrial and anthropogenic humic like dom might be the dominant component in the headwater region of dongzhai harbor anthropogenic sources such as aquaculture wastewater agricultural runoff and domestic wastewater transported by the local rivers could contribute to the increased fluorescence intensities of the humic like components the c2 was different from c1 and c3 slightly increased until s 20 psu then gradually decreased seaward which indicated inputs of high mw aromatic fulvic like dom within the mangrove forest field observations provided evidence that large expanses of mangrove wetlands throughout the region could be important cdom origins to the upper estuary shank et al 2010 also demonstrate the production of cdom from mangrove litters the conservative or non conservative behavior of different dom fractions during mixing of freshwater and seawater can be revealed via the relationship between parafac components and salinity laane and kramer 1990 yamashita et al 2008 fellman et al 2010 guo et al 2011 stedmon and nelson 2015 high and low fluorescence abundances of c1 were usually found at low and high salinity sites respectively indicating substantial amounts of c1 would be derived from riverine inputs however the plot of c3 and salinity contains some data points that deviate toward high fluorescence abundance when s 25 psu as compared to c1 such deviation points to c3 sources that are not only from riverine inputs but also the biogeochemical processing of terrestrial organic matter during transport across dongzhai harbor estuary yamashita et al 2008 the data also show the sum of c1 and c2 is on average 3 6 times that of c3 suggesting non conservative behavior of c3 is partially due to the photo microbial degradation of c1 and or c2 shutova et al 2014 light absorption and microbial activity are expected to be higher in coastal environments than in rivers yamashita 2004 the c4 increased p 0 01 r2 0 17 with salinity contrary to trends for c1 c3 indicating the decoupling behavior and different sources for humic like and tryptophan like components in the dongzhai harbor estuary the decoupling would cause c4 enhancement of the total fluorescence intensity with increasing salinity which might affect the associated bioavailability and thereby the biogeochemical role of cdom guo et al 2011 as reported by fellman et al 2010 the biodegradability of cdom is positively correlated with the protein like component percentage this component is presumably from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources consisting of amino acids free or bound in proteins with fluorescence that resembles free tryptophan yamashita et al 2010 in this study c4 potentially received additions from in situ production within the estuary in addition to the riverine inputs hence the estuarine mixing behavior of each dom component included photochemical and biogeochemical processes beyond physical mixing of freshwater and seawater humification and biological indices are plotted in fig 5 the humification index hix is an indicator of humic substances and extent of dom humification ohno 2002 as humification of dom proceeds the h c ratio decreases shifting the emission spectra of the fluorophores toward longer wavelengths with higher values indicating highly humified dom from terrestrial sources hansen et al 2016 fleck et al 2014 higher degree humified organic matter should remain longer than lower degree humified substances in natural environments singh et al 2010 the biological index bix serves as a measure of autochthonous biological activity in water samples and generally ranges from 0 6 to 1 0 huguet et al 2009 high values 1 0 of bix correspond to more freshly released dom into water from primarily autochthonous sources kida et al 2019 for the entire dataset hix and bix values respectively range from 0 79 to 2 90 mean 1 47 and 0 58 to 1 42 mean 0 71 in dongzhai harbor estuary the relationship between hix and salinity is negative and with bix is positive in general humification decreased along the transect as terrestrially derived organic matter decreased from the upper to lower estuary hix values remain relatively high 1 5 up to s 20 psu which seemingly indicates the presence of strongly humified components in this region of the estuary these results are consistent with c2 variation implying some highly aromatic fulvic like dom inputs in the upper estuary for salinity higher than 25 psu hix clearly decreases for most seawater samples which indicates the presence of organic material of biological origin with a low degree of humification in the lower estuary bix values are relatively constant between 0 6 and 1 0 for s 25 and some data points increase to 1 0 in the middle to lower estuary these results support conclusions from the calculation of hix i e the upper estuary has lower biological productivity compared to the marine environment where the primary production is higher huguet et al 2009 therefore this results in clear spectral changes in the mangrove estuary and a removal of terrestrial substances perhaps by photo oxidative degradation mixing and to a lesser extent flocculation sorption and microbial degradation of dom helms et al 2008 similar studies also report chromophoric dom removal behavior in the high salinity area of large estuaries stolpe et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 gao et al 2019 the hix and bix indices are useful proxies for determining dom composition and source in coastal environments in a simple and fast manner 4 2 spatial patterns in cdom optical properties and key environmental factors fluvial mangrove zones are mainly located near four rivers i e sanjiang river sjr yanzhou river yzr yanfeng east river yfer and yanfeng west river yfwr among them the yzr and sjr are situated in the upper reaches yfer in the middle estuary and yfwr in the lower estuary the mean salinity of the four rivers is from lowest to highest yzr 12 0 psu sjr 12 4 psu yfer 18 3 psu and yfwr 28 4 psu the abundance of parafac components c1 c4 suva sr hix and bix for each river is summarized as boxplots fig 6 mean c1 and c3 values are lowest for the yfwr 36 8 and 32 6 respectively the other three rivers are similar at 40 and 34 respectively mean c2 is highest for the yfer 23 3 and lowest for the yzr 21 6 mean c4 for the yfwr is 8 2 while for the other rivers averages between 2 3 and 4 7 mean suva values range from 2 1 l m 1 mg 1 for the yfwr to 4 1 l m 1 mg 1 for the yzh the sjr has suva values between 3 0 and 4 1 l m 1 mg 1 and the yfer has values between 2 4 and 3 5 l m 1 mg 1 the yfwr also has the highest sr value among the rivers studied with a mean of 1 39 whereas the yzr has the lowest mean 0 34 mean values for the sjr and yfer are 0 96 and 1 13 respectively mean hix values show a decreasing trend from the sjr 2 20 to yzr 2 00 yfer 1 97 and yfwr 1 83 similar to salinity the yzr also has the lowest mean value of bix 0 69 with values for the remaining three rivers averaging 0 75 these results clearly show that the yzr sjr and yfer from the upper and middle estuary primarily contribute humic like dom that is affected by terrestrial inputs however the yfwr in the lower estuary has a relatively lower humification degree indicating it is potentially dominated by tryptophan like dom with autochthonous sources principal component analysis pca as a variable reduction method was applied to results for the dongzhai harbor estuary samples physico chemical variables include hydrochemical parameters i e salinity ph do eh and ec nutrients i e tdn tdsi tdp mn and ba doc and cdom optical parameters a254 suva s275 295 s35 400 sr hix bix and the four parafac components c1 c4 in the fluvial mangrove zones the first two axes pc1 and pc2 account for 49 49 and 14 76 respectively of the variability in cdom related parameters fig 7 a salinity ec do ph c3 bix sr and s275 295 exhibit positive pc1 loadings while tdn tdsi mn suva a254 doc c1 s350 400 and hix demonstrate negative pc1 loadings as sr and s275 295 are both negatively related to the relative molecular size of cdom zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 this implies pc1 is negatively related to the concentration and relative molecular size of cdom ba tdp s275 295 and terrestrial humic like c2 show high pc2 loadings indicating pc2 may be positively linked with terrestrial cdom input nutrients tdn tdsi mn are clearly associated with terrestrial anthropogenic humic like parafac component c1 while ba and tdp are related to terrestrial plant soil derived fluvic like c2 salinity ec ph and do are associated with microbial photo labile humic like c3 eh and tryptophan like c4 are present along the negative side of the pc2 axis and are inversely related to ba concentration moreover the four fluvial mangrove zones obviously present varying environmental factors and cdom properties fig 7a s2 the yzr sjr and yfwr clusters are separated by pc1 while pc2 separates the yfer cluster from the other three fig 7a the yzr and sjr sample clusters are related to tdn tdsi mn suva a254 doc s350 400 c1 and hix which indicates allochthonous anthropogenic dom and some terrestrial mangrove forests input notably the highest tdn tdsi mn suva a254 doc s350 400 and c1 are all observed in the yzr and the highest hix in the sjr the yzr and sjr are bordered by the towns of yanzhou and sanjiang with large populations and dense aquaculture ponds high population density and anthropogenic activity from the circumjacent towns could increase the levels of nutrients and aromatic compounds in cdom bai et al 2019 the yfer cluster is associated with ba c2 tdp s275 295 sr and hix because the yfer flows through dongzhai harbor mangrove national nature reserve soil derived fulvic like dom might predominantly enter the estuary from the terrestrial mangrove forests samples from the yfwr cluster are linked with salinity ec do ph c3 and bix suggesting fresh microbial photo labile humic like dom might influence this mangrove zone the yfwr is closet to qiongzhou strait which is greatly affected by natural tidal action however the boxplot results indicate the yfwr is also dominated by autochthonous tryptophan like dom combined with the pca biplots of the yfwr fig s2 this suggests high mw terrestrial humic like dom is primarily found in the upper and middle regions while low mw microbial humic like dom and tryptophan like dom mainly control the lower region within the dongzhai harbor channel pc1 and pc2 account for 60 45 and 21 52 of the variability respectively fig 7b the loadings plot shows four parafac components are distributed along pc1 such that the tryptophan like dom c4 is most negative and the humic like components c1 c2 and c3 are positive the humic and non humic parafac components have diverse distributions along pc1 suggesting a dom source controlled pc1 humic like components c1 and c2 as well as hix exhibit high pc2 loadings which implies pc2 is possibly related to terrestrial cdom origin in accord with the fluvial mangrove zones samples from the upper estuary are associated with tdn suva a254 c3 and c1 and samples from the middle estuary are related to doc bix and c2 in the lower estuary samples have a close relationship with ph do salinity ec and c4 the pca loadings of seawater demonstrate that the fluorescent cdom varies with different hydrogeochemical conditions the allochthonous dom c1 c2 and c3 predominates in the upper and middle estuary while more autochthonous dom c4 is produced in the lower estuary these results indicate the relative humic like components are more abundant in the upper estuary consistent with decreasing degree of cdom humification along the salinity gradient the channel of dongzhai harbor is characterized by long water retention times and strong water evaporation as a result organic matter progressively accumulates from the upper to lower estuary which might contribute to the greater concentration of cdom measured in seawater catalán et al 2016 song et al 2019b nonetheless long periods of exposure to sunlight likely degrade high mw humic substances into smaller products such as low mw acids carbonyl compounds and volatile hydrocarbons bertilsson and tranvik 2000 helms et al 2014 the sunlight photobleaching processes significantly increases with salinity which is regarded as an important cdom removal mechanism in surface waters of the coastal ocean nieto cid et al 2006 osburn et al 2009 our results confirm that the variation of fluorescent cdom components in dongzhai harbor estuary can be complicated due to the effect of diverse hydrogeochemical and climatic factors including salinity wastewater discharge and anthropogenic activities 4 3 implications for biogeochemical processes in mangrove estuaries from land to sea in dongzhai harbor mangrove estuary cdom and nutrients can be added removed or modified due to various complex biogeochemical transformations and processes as well as human activities fig 8 in the fluvial mangrove zones high values of suva a254 and hix and low values of sr and bix are observed which indicate terrestrial anthropogenic humic like dom is enriched in this region moreover increasing aquaculture and residential regions could subsequently cause nutrients and other pollutants to be transported into mangrove wetlands further driving eutrophic conditions and oxygen consumption as implied by low do saturation levels cawley et al 2012 anoxic mangrove porewaters are an important source of tdn such as nh4 and dissolved organic nitrogen don to surface waters mori et al 2019 reading et al 2017 dom can be biodegraded by microbial activity under anaerobic conditions after oxygen is depleted releasing high amounts of nh4 that retard the normal growth of mangrove roots and seedlings yamashita et al 2007 cao et al 2017 tdsi is mainly derived from natural sources such as chemical weathering dissolution of mangrove forest litter and soil phytoliths which play an important role in fluvial transport to the marine endmember derry et al 2005 kopprio et al 2017 as shown in fig 2 concentrations of tdn and tdsi rapidly decrease towards the marine endmember while tdp shows the opposite trend similar to the cross river estuary in west africa dan et al 2019 these concentrations may have been modified by biogeochemical processes within the estuary system in mangrove wetlands tdp can be adsorbed onto fe mn al oxyhydroxides or bound to humic like dom carbonates and other colloidal fractions barcellos et al 2019 resulting in low concentrations of tdp for micronutrients porewater discharge and solute particle interactions are pivotal sources of dissolved mn and ba in addition to the local fluvial supply as reported in other mangrove estuaries holloway et al 2016 mori et al 2019 in organic rich environments humic substances as the major metal binding components in cdom can also complex with mn and ba owing to their carboxylic and phenolic functional groups blazevic et al 2016 in this study humic like components c1 and c2 show a close relationship with mn and ba fig 7a s2 suggesting cdom mn ba coupling is a potential driving force for micronutrient enrichment in mangrove wetlands however organo metallic complexation processes promote the movement and availability of mn and ba which might stress the growth and respiration of mangrove roots liu et al 2009 dang et al 2015 in the marine endmember the optical parameters of cdom revealed low values of suva a254 and hix and high values of sr and bix indicating the dominance of tryptophan like dom low concentrations of nutrients were observed which demonstrates nutrients are mostly constrained in the lower estuary physical mixing photo chemical degradation microbial utilization tidal reversal and or exchange flow within the estuary system can modify the cdom and nutrient characteristics statham 2012 removal of tdn and tdsi in surface waters is largely attributed to saltwater dilution according to the linear relationships between tdn and tdsi with salinity in the great kwa river estuary and calabar river estuary depletion of tdn and tdsi is partly ascribed to plankton utilization and microbial activity dan et al 2019 high inputs of dissolved mn and ba along the mangrove estuary were observed whereas most of the derived solutes were removed before reaching the marine endmember fig 2g h at higher ph 8 and dissolved oxygen in the lower region fig 2a b mn could be rapidly oxidized and form mn hydr oxides further resulting in the co precipitation of ba sadat noori et al 2017 ba cycling in estuaries is mainly driven by ion exchange processes on particles in response to changes in ionic strength and ba has a strong affinity for mn forming ba hydr oxides sanders et al 2012 joung and shiller 2014 mori et al 2019 the formation of mn ba hydr oxides can potentially lead to the adsorption of mn ba onto suspended particulates or cdom causing precipitation flocculation and cycling at the solute particle interface thereby lowering mn and ba concentrations gonneea et al 2013 holloway et al 2016 5 conclusion along the estuarine gradient cdom and micro nutrient evolution gradually changed from the fluvial mangrove zones to the marine endmember three fluorescent components comprising three humic like components c1 c2 and c3 and a tryptophan like component c4 were identified using eem parafac modeling our results revealed that cdom absorption at 254 nm a254 suva hix and the abundance of humic like substances decreased with increasing salinity indicating the dominance of terrestrial anthropogenic derived aromatic cdom in the upper estuary significant positive correlations were observed between sr bix tryptophan like materials and salinity which indicates low mw autochthonous cdom prevails in the lower estuary notably the estuarine mixing behaviors of each dom component were complicated involving photo biogeochemical processes beyond the simple physical mixing of freshwater and seawater doc tdn tdsi mn ba and humic like cdom were enriched in the yzr sjr and yfer fluvial mangrove zones located in the upper and middle estuary which were primarily affected by terrestrial inputs riverine runoff and mangrove porewater exchange in contrast the yfwr close to the marine endmember had relatively higher ph do ec salinity tdp and tryptophan like cdom suggesting saltwater dilution tidal mixing photo oxidation and microbial degradation processes might cause the phenomena overall this study provides insights into the environmental implications of biogeochemical processes induced by cdom composition

4409,the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary from upstream highly influence the estuarine ecosystem the lack of method to evaluate the impact of daily water and sediment fluxes on ecosystem has limited the ecological management of estuary therefore it is important to find a quantitative method for analysing the response of estuarine ecosystem to daily water and sediment fluxes into the estuary based on long time sequenced data we aim to determine the dynamic response of fish communities to the interannual and seasonal variations of water and sediment fluxes providing a novel method for the regulation of water and sediment process in dammed rivers we establish a functional regression model and improve functional linear regression that is interpretable flirti method to quantify the dynamic response relationship between the annual catch per unit effort cpue and the daily water and sediment fluxes into the yellow river estuary from 1980 to 2011 the results showed that the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary explained 56 of the variability in the cpue low fluxes during the spawning period april may and high fluxes during the dam discharge period june july were not conducive to estuarine fisheries by increasing freshwater inflow in spring to 3 1 or 4 3 billion m3 the cumulative effect on estuarine fish communities can be increased by 20 and 44 respectively we propose a functional regression method to quantify the response of estuarine fish communities to water and sediment fluxes into the estuary we suggest that advancing the discharge time of dam to spring a suitable spawning environment for fish can be provided thus effectively increasing fish production in the estuary this study overcomes the limitation of number of species as well as the disunity of hydrological and ecological data on time scale providing new idea for estuarine ecology research keywords dammed river estuary ecosystem functional regression model water and sediment flux 1 introduction the effect of water and sediment inflow on estuarine ecology has always been an important research issue in ecohydrology liu et al 2020 raimonet and cloern 2017 changes in water and sediment fluxes over time have been recorded in many estuaries globally li et al 2020 such changes are often linked to climate change and human activities particularly the damming on rivers that changes the fluxes of water and sediment released dyer 2021 gupta et al 2012 fishes in estuaries depend on the low salinity environment created by freshwater inputs and the nutrients associated with sediment especially during the spawning period jenkins et al 2010 kindong et al 2021 nicholson et al 2008 therefore fish reproduction in the estuary and the recruitment of fishery resources are affected by the variations in the water and sediment fluxes hicks et al 2010 whitfield 2021 then how to quantify the response of estuarine fish communities to the fluxes of water and sediment hydrological methods are frequently used to study how upstream flows affect downstream fish communities acreman and dunbar 2004 based on the historical flow record the hydrological methods simplify the dynamics and variability of hydrology and the output is a single value without considering biological requirements tennant 1976 matthews and bao 1991 in the 1970s ecological flows were obtained from hydraulic methods that were based on the relationship between habitat and flow using different hydraulic variables measured in a single river reach such as the wetted perimeter and r2 cross methods dunbar et al 1998 gippel and stewardson 1998 loar et al 1986 these methods targeted a particular river reach and the requirements of the organisms were not considered in the 1980s researchers started to simulate the ideal habitats of the indicator species from the hydraulic conditions rhoads et al 2003 yi et al 2010a 2010b these methods were still inadequate as they considered the specific life stages of a single target species rather than considering the whole life stages neither did they consider the interactions between the species arthington et al 2006 however the requirements of the whole community are of greater concern to fisheries production and ecosystem restoration therefore researches focusing on relationship between fish communities and water and sediment fluxes are necessary which can provide more comprehensive and scientific evaluating on the response of ecosystem to hydrology process functional regression analysis method can establish a regression coefficient curve from long term hydrological and biological data that changes smoothly over time and characterizes how water or sediment fluxes affect organisms in different time periods ramsay and silverman 2006 previous studies have established functional regression models to quantify the associations between the flow and the fish species within the reaches and have used data from multiple basins to explore whether the relationship between species and hydrological conditions can be transferred across time and space chen and olden 2017 2018 however functional regression models have not been applied to quantify the relationship between water and sediment processes into the sea and the estuarine ecosystems this study improves the flirti functional linear regression that is interpretable method with significant advantages in interpreting actual phenomena which can not only establish the relationship between the annual biological data and the daily hydrological data identify the significant time periods but also quantitatively evaluate the impact of different periods and the study object is not limited to single species james et al 2009 the yellow river is famous for its high sediment concentration wang et al 2016b the abundant nutrients in the runoff make the yellow river estuary an important spawning hatching and feeding ground for fishery chen et al 2000 the xiaolangdi reservoir in the main stream changes the deposition of downstream riverbed by creating flood pulse which changes the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary song et al 2020 at the same time it also seriously affects the environmental ecology of the estuarine area wang et al 2017 therefore the flow characteristics of the yellow river with high sediment concentration and the artificial water and sediment process provide a good case for verifying the effectiveness of the method at present most of the studies on the impact of artificial water sediment regulation on the downstream ecosystem in this region focus on a single species or a certain year chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 in order to make the water sediment regulation in xiaolangdi reservoir more reasonable it is imperative to further quantify the impact of the process of water and sediment fluxes into sea on the estuarine fish communities based on the scientific hypothesis that annual cpue catch per unit effort is influenced by water and sediment fluxes at certain times of the year and these times may be concentrated in important life history stages of the fish we use the long time series data the annual cpue of the yellow river estuary and the daily water and sediment fluxes of the yellow river into the sea from 1981 to 2011 to carry out the research on the following aspects 1 how to realize the quantitative evaluation of the influence on estuarine fish communities by water and sediment fluxes process 2 are there key periods or processes of water and sediment that affect estuarine fish communities 3 proposing a water sediment flux process that is suitable for the growth and reproduction of estuarine fish communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river is the second largest river in china with a total length of more than 5400 km and a drainage area of over 745 000 km2 liu et al 2020 the yellow river estuary and adjacent sea areas are species rich and the species and quantity of juvenile fish will affect the recruitment of fish resources in the yellow sea and bohai sea shan et al 2013 song et al 2019 the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary are measured at the most downstream lijin hydrological station on the main stream of yellow river 2 2 data sources the daily water and sediment fluxes from 1981 to 2011 were obtained from www yrcc gov cn the annual catch in the estuary was obtained from the fishery statistical yearbook table a1 the range of the main fishing ground is consistent with the sea area affected by the yellow river s runoff fig 1 the annual catch is divided by the horsepower of the working vessel as the catch per unit effort the water and sediment regime of the yellow river which exhibits high sediment concentrations and high variability reflects the unique natural environment and human activities in the basin the water and sediment fluxes into the yellow river estuary have varied significantly between 1981 and 2011 because of climate change and the construction of upstream reservoirs wang et al 2010 the flow record was examined using a mutation test to provide the basis for dividing the longer time period into shorter periods with unique water and sediment conditions and associated effects on cpue fig a1 table a2 gao et al 2009 the results of this test indicated that the flow regimes varied considerably across the period of interest with shifts in 1991 and 2002 through the 1990s as a result of changes in climatic conditions and the enhanced intervention of human activities in the basin the water and sediment fluxes in the lower reaches of the yellow river were low and annual cutoff occurred from 1991 to 1999 the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation in october 1999 since 2000 the cutoff of the yellow river has disappeared therefore the hydrological data were divided into three periods a 1981 1991 b 1992 1999 and c 2000 2011 fig 2 figs a2 a3 we regarded the period from 1981 to 1991 when water and sediment were relatively abundant as a control period before the climatic conditions changed and human activities intensified the period from 1992 to 1999 was characterized by numerous breaks in the flow which was regarded as cut off period the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation at the end of the 1990s and the water and sediment regulation scheme was implemented so the period from 2000 to 2011 was named the water sediment regulation period 2 3 model establishment in this study we used a discrete form of functional regression to model the effects of the daily flow or sediment transport on the cpue 1 y i β 0 t 1 365 β t x i t ε i 1 i n where yi is the cpue in the year i xi t is the flow rate or sediment transport rate on the day t of the year i and β t is the regression coefficient corresponding to the day t and εi is the predicted residual of the year i to mitigate the effects of skewed data distribution logarithmic transformation and centralization of flow or sediment transport rate data were performed and the cpue data were standardized 2 x ij ln x ij 1 ln x ij 1 x j 3 y i y i y i σ xij is a matrix with rows in years and columns in days eq 1 no longer has a constant term i e 4 y i t 1 365 β t x i t ε i 1 i n the flirti method was used to calculate the interpretable functional regression coefficients to satisfy the sparsity requirement of the 0th order differential and the dth order differential we selected the 3rd order for β t the problem was transformed into a problem to optimize the penalty function described below β β 1 β 2 β 365 t defining the loss function 5 q β 1 2 n t 1 n y i β 0 t 1 365 β t x i t 2 λ β 1 ω d 3 β 1 where d3 is the third order difference operator i e 6 d 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

the optimization problem was solved with the sub gradient descent method 8 β k β k 1 t k g k 1 k 1 2 3 where g k 1 q β k 1 is the sub gradient of q β at the point β k 1 and t k is the step size q β 1

to calculate the interval estimate dixon 2006 xt1 xt2 xt3 xt365 yi was viewed as a set of samples that is each year s data corresponded to a set of samples and there were n sets of samples each sample was sampled n times from the n sets of samples with 1 n as the probability of each sample being sampled and the sample set collected by n samples was taken as one resampled sample for each sample obtained by resampling the flirti method was used to obtain an estimate of β t and this was repeated m times to obtain m estimates of β t that were different from each other the 90 and 10 quantiles were estimated for these m estimates of β t which was the 80 confidence interval 2 4 calculation of cumulative effect on cpue estimates of cpue may reflect fish reproduction over a number of years we therefore calculated the cumulative effect from the water and sediment of the previous year on the cpue to take account of the effects of the time lag as juveniles were recruited to the fishery moraes et al 2012 pasquaud et al 2013 the daily effects of water and sediment delivery in the previous year on the cpue in the estuary were determined using the flirti method the model fit was evaluated using cross validation the standardized mean square error and the coefficient of determination to avoid overfitting and a set of parameters with the lowest median cross validation error were used for the calculations the regression coefficients β t that corresponded to the cpue at different times were obtained from these models and used to predict the cumulative effect of flow on the cpue for different ecological regulation schemes 10 m t 1 365 β t log q t the response of the cpue to the different ecological regulation schemes is represented by m q t is the daily flow process that corresponds to the different ecological regulation schemes we used two ecological regulation schemes based on the ecological requirements of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems tables a3 a4 namely a minimum flow process and b suitable flow process fig 5 tian et al 2018 we compared the cumulative effect of the two schemes and the flow process from 2005 to 2011 which represents the period since the water and sediment regulation scheme was implemented in the xiaolangdi reservoir scheme a was defined by average daily flow rates of 230 m3 s in march and 340 m3 s in april and may with flow pulses of at least 1 500 m3 s that lasted more than 7 days at the beginning of april and a total discharge of 3 1 billion m3 from march to may scheme b comprised average daily flow rates of 270 m3 s in march and 480 m3 s in april and may with flow pulses of at least 2 200 m3 s that lasted more than 7 days at the beginning of april and a total discharge of 4 3 billion m3 from march to may 3 results 3 1 quantitative relationship between water and sediment fluxes and cpue in the estuary the results show that on average 56 of the changes in the cpue can be explained by the water and sediment delivery in different periods fig 4 during the control period the changes in flow rate mainly affected the cpue in may and july the spring and summer and the time period which was sensitive to the changes in sediment transport rate was slightly delayed and concentrated in june and july the increase in the flow from may to june had a positive effect on the cpue which shows that fishes had a high demand for flow in these months the water and sediment fluxes increased rapidly in july and august and the fish communities will be negatively affected if the water and sediment fluxes continue to increase there were periods of severe cutoff in the yellow river from 1991 to 1999 with no flow on a total of 902 days over a 9 year period the flows were not sufficient to meet the requirements of fish communities in march and april when the fishes would generally benefit from high flow similarly the cpue would have been supported by the high flows and sediment inputs in july in the water sediment regulation period from 2000 to 2011 the fishes were negatively affected by the high flows and high sediment loads from the end of june to the beginning of july this suggests that the cpue may decrease if the flow and sediment continue to increase fig 3 3 2 model evaluation the statistical significance of the relationship between flow sediment transport rate data and cpue was tested using the permutation test in fig 4 the red line indicates the r2 obtained by the flirti method and the dependent variable was permuted 500 times a new r2 was obtained for each permutation and 99 6 of r2 were below 0 56 which indicated there was a true relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable we also used a five fold cross validation of 10 iterations to evaluate the model fit table 1 and a set of parameters with the lowest median cross validation error was used to calculate the cumulative effect of different ecological regulation schemes on cpue to avoid overfitting the data 3 3 scheme comparison we compared the cumulative effects of the two ecological regulation schemes on the cpue with the natural flow regime from 2005 to 2011 fig 6 the cumulative effect of scheme a and scheme b increased by 20 and 44 respectively comparing with the average cumulative effect of natural flow regime comparing scheme b with scheme a we increased the amount of freshwater entering the sea in spring from march to may from 3 1 to 4 3 billion m3 while the total water volume throughout the year remained the same fig 5 and the increase of cumulative effect was more than twice of that for scheme a the results from a survey of fish eggs and larvae in the same year were used to verify the effects of an increase in the water volume in spring rather than the cpue in 2014 and 2015 the amount of freshwater discharged from the xiaolangdi reservoir in the spring increased the discharges at lijin station in spring of 2014 and 2015 were 3 194 and 4 585 billion m3 respectively fig 7 the discharge decreased significantly in 2016 but then increased again in 2017 and 2018 the fish eggs and larvae in the yellow river estuary were surveyed in may and june from 2014 to 2018 gu et al 2019 we compared and verified the findings of our study with the results of the survey fig 8 and found that the survey results were consistent with our conclusions the density of the fish eggs is directly related to the freshwater discharge from the yellow river to the sea in spring the increased freshwater entering the sea is conducive to the expansion of fish spawning grounds and hatching of larvae the water and sediment of yellow river entering the sea in spring effectively influences the fishery resources in the sea near the estuary 4 discussion 4 1 applicability of functional regression model in estuarine ecology previously researches on the impacts of water and sediment delivery of river on the ecological status of estuary have been hampered by the fact that it is difficult to study the effects on a number of species at the same time bunn and arthington 2002 pastor et al 2014 information about the responses of single species or ecosystem agents can not represent the needs of the overall communities at the system level and so cannot be used to guide strategies such as water and sediment regulation acreman et al 2014 chang et al 2011 in this study we used a functional regression model to examine the dynamic response relationship between water and sediment fluxes and fish communities in an estuary we analyzed the time series data and identified the periods throughout the year when the water and sediment delivery were important to the fish communities and also quantified how unit changes in the flow or sediment transport rate affected the cpue the curve of β t generated by most adaption methods cannot achieve being zero in the irrelevant area and presenting a concise structure in the other area on the axis at the same time and the results are hard to interpret because of unnatural fluctuations of the curve in contrast the improved flirti method uses the idea of variable selection and can be applied to different orders of magnitude of β t the calculated estimates can be interpreted flexible and accurate at the same time james et al 2009 the functional regression method has been used frequently in environmental science chen and olden 2017 stewart koster et al 2014 but this is the first time it has been used to examine the relationship between water and sediment fluxes and estuarine ecology in different periods the diluent water accumulation area of the yellow river constitutes the most important spawning and feeding field for the fishery resources of bohai sea despite its importance the impact of the water and sediment input into the sea in terms of range and extent on the marine ecology remains unclear kong et al 2015 the area covered by this study corresponds to the area covered by the fish egg and larvae survey conducted by the first institute of oceanography of the state oceanic administration gu et al 2019 our results for the cumulative effects of the different ecological regulation schemes were consistent with that survey the model simulations showed that the change in the independent variables explained 56 of the changes in the cpue in addition to verifying the results with actual survey data the model was also permutation tested and cross validated mathematically to ensure the derived relationship was reliable 4 2 relationship between cpue and water sediment fluxes process into the yellow river estuary most fishery species in the yellow river estuary tend to spawn in the low salinity nearshore estuary in the warm spring and summer seasons table 2 lu et al 2015 when the yellow river discharges high loads of sediment and nutrients to the sea in march and april it forms the so called spring flood and creates a low salinity nutrient rich freshwater environment in the estuary that is suitable for the spawning and growth of juvenile fishes and about 39 fish species spawn in the yellow river estuary chen et al 2000 deng and jin 2000 during the control period from 1981 to 1991 the amounts of water and sediment were relatively moderate the period during which the water and sediment delivery influenced cpue was distributed from may to july coinciding with the spawning season of marine organisms the beginning of may is the spawning season for most fish at this time fishes have a greater demand for flushing water into the sea increasing the amount of water entering the sea during this time range creates a freshwater environment suitable for spawning which has a positive effect on fish biomass because of various manual interventions such as dams and diversions for irrigation in the middle and lower reaches the amount of water discharged to the sea from the yellow river during spring decreased by 65 from the 1980s to the 1990s and the spring flood in march and april disappeared resulting in a gradual change in the low salinity freshwater environment in the estuary and the adjacent waters wang et al 2016a for example the yellow river knifefish which relied on freshwater became almost extinct in the 1990s and production of the chinese shrimp in laizhou bay also decreased significantly sun et al 2013 the cpue will respond positively to increases in the amount of water discharged to the sea during dry years when the flow is either low or discontinuous in dry years the supplies of freshwater and sediment associated nutrients to the estuary are also limited and do not meet the needs of the estuary fish communities as the freshwater discharge decreases the salinity increases and affects the fish spawning the phytoplankton biomass also decreases and the marine primary productivity declines with indirect effects on fish production domingues and galvao 2007 sun et al 2019 after the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation in 1999 the unified regulation of the yellow river s water volume enabled the river to maintain its functional flow which means the runoff can meet the minimum requirement of the basic function of the river therefore fish did not show additional demand for freshwater into the sea during the period 2000 2011 however the high discharges of water and sediment released during the water sediment regulation at the end of june and beginning of july had a strong negative effect on cpue the flow of high sediment content is discharged in a short period of time which not only increases the amount of fish movement thus increases respiratory rate and oxygen demand but also blocks the fish gill to affect the oxygen uptake function of the fish crosa et al 2010 swinkels et al 2014 in addition the levitation of toxic substances caused by sediment discharge in the reservoir also consumes dissolved oxygen in the water body affecting fish survival bruce et al 2014 the higher the sediment concentration and the longer it lasts the greater the impact on aquatic organisms such as fish feyrer et al 2019 kemp et al 2011 4 3 influence of timing of water sediment regulation on fishery resources in the yellow river estuary the water sediment regulation in yellow river represents the first large scale water and sediment experiment in its history there is concern about the ecology in the estuary area because of the changes in the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary fan and huang 2008 the freshwater discharged to the sea has increased significantly since the regulation was implemented but the problem that the requirements of ecosystem for freshwater remains unresolved in addition aquatic organisms in the river are threatened by the high flow rates and sediment concentrations and the low levels of dissolved oxygen liu et al 2010 the discharge to the estuary varies throughout the year with water shortages in some periods by increasing the freshwater discharge in spring when marine organisms are spawning and breeding estuarine fishery resources would recover more quickly the water sediment regulation at present does not deliver enough freshwater to the estuary to meet the demand for marine organisms in the spring and also conflicts with the summer flood season li and sheng 2011 if the water and sediment regulation was shifted to the spring or if some of the water was transferred from the summer to the spring the flow and the sediment concentrations in the summer would decrease and the the freshwater area of low salinity on which fish spawning depends could increase and the goal of restoring estuarine habitats and fishery resources could be achieved we then verified two schemes of minimum flow process and suitable flow process using the measured data in the yellow river estuary from 2014 to 2018 gu et al 2019 compared with the two background datasets of 2007 and 2009 the increase in freshwater entering the sea in 2014 improved the density of fish eggs and larvae in the yellow river estuary by 2 8 times the increase of freshwater entering the sea in 2015 improved the density of fish eggs in the yellow river estuary by 3 10 times in the spring of 2016 the amount of freshwater entering the sea dropped to 1 4 of that in 2015 and the density of fish eggs and larvae also decreased and was lower than that in 2009 in the spring of 2017 the amount of water entering the sea increased to twice that in 2016 and the density of fish eggs and larvae also increased by more than double in the spring of 2018 the amount of water entering the sea continued to increase to five times that in 2016 and the density of fish eggs increased with water volume the survey shows that the freshwater discharge in spring is closely related to the densities of fish eggs and larvae in the yellow river estuary an increase in freshwater going into the sea increases the density of fish eggs and larvae and vice versa a reduction in freshwater leads to a decrease in fish eggs and larvae and the amount of water in yellow river entering the sea in spring directly affects the ecological status of the estuary song et al 2010 numerous researchers worldwide have examined the relationship between flow and ecology davies et al 2014 döll et al 2009 fabris et al 2018 yoshikawa et al 2014 but the studies inevitably have some limitations the water and sediment delivery from the yellow river to the sea mainly affect the spawning and reproduction of fish in the same year in this study we described the ecological status of fish communities by cpue and we have included the possible effects of time lags between hydrological processes and ecological impacts in the analysis of different time periods the nonlinear relationship between water and sediment fluxes and cpue and the instability of hydrological and ecological processes will be crucial research frontier in the future cloern et al 2016 deng et al 2019 rosenfeld 2017 because of its importance for river management the water sediment regulation needs to be discussed in detail to determine how it should be coordinated controlled and optimized here we have described a new method and by further developing the functional data analysis and flirti methods have provided results that have exciting implications for river management 5 conclusion aiming at the problem that the response of estuarine fish communities to the water and sediment flux process into the sea is unclear we established a functional regression model and improved the calculation method to quantify the dynamic response relationship between the daily water sediment flux process and the annual cpue of yellow river estuary the results showed that the modified flirti method can better explain the influence of water sediment flux into sea on estuarine fish communities the variations of water and sediment fluxes in different periods resulted in 56 of the changes in the cpue the fishery resource was limited by the low fluxes during april and may when the main species spawned and the high fluxes during june and july when the dam discharged if freshwater inflow in spring were increased to 3 1 billion and 4 3 billion m3 the cumulative effect on fish can be increased by 20 and 44 respectively the existing water and sediment regulation scheme does not match the requirements of estuarine fish by moving the discharge time of the dam forward to spring the problem of excessive water and sediment volume in summer can be solved and the suitable spawning environment for fish can be provided thus effectively increasing the yield of fish in estuaries this study overcomes the limitation of traditional methods on the number of species and the disunity of the time scale of hydrological and ecological data and provides a new method and idea for the study of estuarine ecology 6 data availability the water and sediment data can be download from www yrcc gov cn the fishery data are in the appendix credit authorship contribution statement yujun yi

4409,the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary from upstream highly influence the estuarine ecosystem the lack of method to evaluate the impact of daily water and sediment fluxes on ecosystem has limited the ecological management of estuary therefore it is important to find a quantitative method for analysing the response of estuarine ecosystem to daily water and sediment fluxes into the estuary based on long time sequenced data we aim to determine the dynamic response of fish communities to the interannual and seasonal variations of water and sediment fluxes providing a novel method for the regulation of water and sediment process in dammed rivers we establish a functional regression model and improve functional linear regression that is interpretable flirti method to quantify the dynamic response relationship between the annual catch per unit effort cpue and the daily water and sediment fluxes into the yellow river estuary from 1980 to 2011 the results showed that the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary explained 56 of the variability in the cpue low fluxes during the spawning period april may and high fluxes during the dam discharge period june july were not conducive to estuarine fisheries by increasing freshwater inflow in spring to 3 1 or 4 3 billion m3 the cumulative effect on estuarine fish communities can be increased by 20 and 44 respectively we propose a functional regression method to quantify the response of estuarine fish communities to water and sediment fluxes into the estuary we suggest that advancing the discharge time of dam to spring a suitable spawning environment for fish can be provided thus effectively increasing fish production in the estuary this study overcomes the limitation of number of species as well as the disunity of hydrological and ecological data on time scale providing new idea for estuarine ecology research keywords dammed river estuary ecosystem functional regression model water and sediment flux 1 introduction the effect of water and sediment inflow on estuarine ecology has always been an important research issue in ecohydrology liu et al 2020 raimonet and cloern 2017 changes in water and sediment fluxes over time have been recorded in many estuaries globally li et al 2020 such changes are often linked to climate change and human activities particularly the damming on rivers that changes the fluxes of water and sediment released dyer 2021 gupta et al 2012 fishes in estuaries depend on the low salinity environment created by freshwater inputs and the nutrients associated with sediment especially during the spawning period jenkins et al 2010 kindong et al 2021 nicholson et al 2008 therefore fish reproduction in the estuary and the recruitment of fishery resources are affected by the variations in the water and sediment fluxes hicks et al 2010 whitfield 2021 then how to quantify the response of estuarine fish communities to the fluxes of water and sediment hydrological methods are frequently used to study how upstream flows affect downstream fish communities acreman and dunbar 2004 based on the historical flow record the hydrological methods simplify the dynamics and variability of hydrology and the output is a single value without considering biological requirements tennant 1976 matthews and bao 1991 in the 1970s ecological flows were obtained from hydraulic methods that were based on the relationship between habitat and flow using different hydraulic variables measured in a single river reach such as the wetted perimeter and r2 cross methods dunbar et al 1998 gippel and stewardson 1998 loar et al 1986 these methods targeted a particular river reach and the requirements of the organisms were not considered in the 1980s researchers started to simulate the ideal habitats of the indicator species from the hydraulic conditions rhoads et al 2003 yi et al 2010a 2010b these methods were still inadequate as they considered the specific life stages of a single target species rather than considering the whole life stages neither did they consider the interactions between the species arthington et al 2006 however the requirements of the whole community are of greater concern to fisheries production and ecosystem restoration therefore researches focusing on relationship between fish communities and water and sediment fluxes are necessary which can provide more comprehensive and scientific evaluating on the response of ecosystem to hydrology process functional regression analysis method can establish a regression coefficient curve from long term hydrological and biological data that changes smoothly over time and characterizes how water or sediment fluxes affect organisms in different time periods ramsay and silverman 2006 previous studies have established functional regression models to quantify the associations between the flow and the fish species within the reaches and have used data from multiple basins to explore whether the relationship between species and hydrological conditions can be transferred across time and space chen and olden 2017 2018 however functional regression models have not been applied to quantify the relationship between water and sediment processes into the sea and the estuarine ecosystems this study improves the flirti functional linear regression that is interpretable method with significant advantages in interpreting actual phenomena which can not only establish the relationship between the annual biological data and the daily hydrological data identify the significant time periods but also quantitatively evaluate the impact of different periods and the study object is not limited to single species james et al 2009 the yellow river is famous for its high sediment concentration wang et al 2016b the abundant nutrients in the runoff make the yellow river estuary an important spawning hatching and feeding ground for fishery chen et al 2000 the xiaolangdi reservoir in the main stream changes the deposition of downstream riverbed by creating flood pulse which changes the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary song et al 2020 at the same time it also seriously affects the environmental ecology of the estuarine area wang et al 2017 therefore the flow characteristics of the yellow river with high sediment concentration and the artificial water and sediment process provide a good case for verifying the effectiveness of the method at present most of the studies on the impact of artificial water sediment regulation on the downstream ecosystem in this region focus on a single species or a certain year chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 in order to make the water sediment regulation in xiaolangdi reservoir more reasonable it is imperative to further quantify the impact of the process of water and sediment fluxes into sea on the estuarine fish communities based on the scientific hypothesis that annual cpue catch per unit effort is influenced by water and sediment fluxes at certain times of the year and these times may be concentrated in important life history stages of the fish we use the long time series data the annual cpue of the yellow river estuary and the daily water and sediment fluxes of the yellow river into the sea from 1981 to 2011 to carry out the research on the following aspects 1 how to realize the quantitative evaluation of the influence on estuarine fish communities by water and sediment fluxes process 2 are there key periods or processes of water and sediment that affect estuarine fish communities 3 proposing a water sediment flux process that is suitable for the growth and reproduction of estuarine fish communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river is the second largest river in china with a total length of more than 5400 km and a drainage area of over 745 000 km2 liu et al 2020 the yellow river estuary and adjacent sea areas are species rich and the species and quantity of juvenile fish will affect the recruitment of fish resources in the yellow sea and bohai sea shan et al 2013 song et al 2019 the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary are measured at the most downstream lijin hydrological station on the main stream of yellow river 2 2 data sources the daily water and sediment fluxes from 1981 to 2011 were obtained from www yrcc gov cn the annual catch in the estuary was obtained from the fishery statistical yearbook table a1 the range of the main fishing ground is consistent with the sea area affected by the yellow river s runoff fig 1 the annual catch is divided by the horsepower of the working vessel as the catch per unit effort the water and sediment regime of the yellow river which exhibits high sediment concentrations and high variability reflects the unique natural environment and human activities in the basin the water and sediment fluxes into the yellow river estuary have varied significantly between 1981 and 2011 because of climate change and the construction of upstream reservoirs wang et al 2010 the flow record was examined using a mutation test to provide the basis for dividing the longer time period into shorter periods with unique water and sediment conditions and associated effects on cpue fig a1 table a2 gao et al 2009 the results of this test indicated that the flow regimes varied considerably across the period of interest with shifts in 1991 and 2002 through the 1990s as a result of changes in climatic conditions and the enhanced intervention of human activities in the basin the water and sediment fluxes in the lower reaches of the yellow river were low and annual cutoff occurred from 1991 to 1999 the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation in october 1999 since 2000 the cutoff of the yellow river has disappeared therefore the hydrological data were divided into three periods a 1981 1991 b 1992 1999 and c 2000 2011 fig 2 figs a2 a3 we regarded the period from 1981 to 1991 when water and sediment were relatively abundant as a control period before the climatic conditions changed and human activities intensified the period from 1992 to 1999 was characterized by numerous breaks in the flow which was regarded as cut off period the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation at the end of the 1990s and the water and sediment regulation scheme was implemented so the period from 2000 to 2011 was named the water sediment regulation period 2 3 model establishment in this study we used a discrete form of functional regression to model the effects of the daily flow or sediment transport on the cpue 1 y i β 0 t 1 365 β t x i t ε i 1 i n where yi is the cpue in the year i xi t is the flow rate or sediment transport rate on the day t of the year i and β t is the regression coefficient corresponding to the day t and εi is the predicted residual of the year i to mitigate the effects of skewed data distribution logarithmic transformation and centralization of flow or sediment transport rate data were performed and the cpue data were standardized 2 x ij ln x ij 1 ln x ij 1 x j 3 y i y i y i σ xij is a matrix with rows in years and columns in days eq 1 no longer has a constant term i e 4 y i t 1 365 β t x i t ε i 1 i n the flirti method was used to calculate the interpretable functional regression coefficients to satisfy the sparsity requirement of the 0th order differential and the dth order differential we selected the 3rd order for β t the problem was transformed into a problem to optimize the penalty function described below β β 1 β 2 β 365 t defining the loss function 5 q β 1 2 n t 1 n y i β 0 t 1 365 β t x i t 2 λ β 1 ω d 3 β 1 where d3 is the third order difference operator i e 6 d 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 3 3 1 3 1 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

the optimization problem was solved with the sub gradient descent method 8 β k β k 1 t k g k 1 k 1 2 3 where g k 1 q β k 1 is the sub gradient of q β at the point β k 1 and t k is the step size q β 1

to calculate the interval estimate dixon 2006 xt1 xt2 xt3 xt365 yi was viewed as a set of samples that is each year s data corresponded to a set of samples and there were n sets of samples each sample was sampled n times from the n sets of samples with 1 n as the probability of each sample being sampled and the sample set collected by n samples was taken as one resampled sample for each sample obtained by resampling the flirti method was used to obtain an estimate of β t and this was repeated m times to obtain m estimates of β t that were different from each other the 90 and 10 quantiles were estimated for these m estimates of β t which was the 80 confidence interval 2 4 calculation of cumulative effect on cpue estimates of cpue may reflect fish reproduction over a number of years we therefore calculated the cumulative effect from the water and sediment of the previous year on the cpue to take account of the effects of the time lag as juveniles were recruited to the fishery moraes et al 2012 pasquaud et al 2013 the daily effects of water and sediment delivery in the previous year on the cpue in the estuary were determined using the flirti method the model fit was evaluated using cross validation the standardized mean square error and the coefficient of determination to avoid overfitting and a set of parameters with the lowest median cross validation error were used for the calculations the regression coefficients β t that corresponded to the cpue at different times were obtained from these models and used to predict the cumulative effect of flow on the cpue for different ecological regulation schemes 10 m t 1 365 β t log q t the response of the cpue to the different ecological regulation schemes is represented by m q t is the daily flow process that corresponds to the different ecological regulation schemes we used two ecological regulation schemes based on the ecological requirements of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems tables a3 a4 namely a minimum flow process and b suitable flow process fig 5 tian et al 2018 we compared the cumulative effect of the two schemes and the flow process from 2005 to 2011 which represents the period since the water and sediment regulation scheme was implemented in the xiaolangdi reservoir scheme a was defined by average daily flow rates of 230 m3 s in march and 340 m3 s in april and may with flow pulses of at least 1 500 m3 s that lasted more than 7 days at the beginning of april and a total discharge of 3 1 billion m3 from march to may scheme b comprised average daily flow rates of 270 m3 s in march and 480 m3 s in april and may with flow pulses of at least 2 200 m3 s that lasted more than 7 days at the beginning of april and a total discharge of 4 3 billion m3 from march to may 3 results 3 1 quantitative relationship between water and sediment fluxes and cpue in the estuary the results show that on average 56 of the changes in the cpue can be explained by the water and sediment delivery in different periods fig 4 during the control period the changes in flow rate mainly affected the cpue in may and july the spring and summer and the time period which was sensitive to the changes in sediment transport rate was slightly delayed and concentrated in june and july the increase in the flow from may to june had a positive effect on the cpue which shows that fishes had a high demand for flow in these months the water and sediment fluxes increased rapidly in july and august and the fish communities will be negatively affected if the water and sediment fluxes continue to increase there were periods of severe cutoff in the yellow river from 1991 to 1999 with no flow on a total of 902 days over a 9 year period the flows were not sufficient to meet the requirements of fish communities in march and april when the fishes would generally benefit from high flow similarly the cpue would have been supported by the high flows and sediment inputs in july in the water sediment regulation period from 2000 to 2011 the fishes were negatively affected by the high flows and high sediment loads from the end of june to the beginning of july this suggests that the cpue may decrease if the flow and sediment continue to increase fig 3 3 2 model evaluation the statistical significance of the relationship between flow sediment transport rate data and cpue was tested using the permutation test in fig 4 the red line indicates the r2 obtained by the flirti method and the dependent variable was permuted 500 times a new r2 was obtained for each permutation and 99 6 of r2 were below 0 56 which indicated there was a true relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable we also used a five fold cross validation of 10 iterations to evaluate the model fit table 1 and a set of parameters with the lowest median cross validation error was used to calculate the cumulative effect of different ecological regulation schemes on cpue to avoid overfitting the data 3 3 scheme comparison we compared the cumulative effects of the two ecological regulation schemes on the cpue with the natural flow regime from 2005 to 2011 fig 6 the cumulative effect of scheme a and scheme b increased by 20 and 44 respectively comparing with the average cumulative effect of natural flow regime comparing scheme b with scheme a we increased the amount of freshwater entering the sea in spring from march to may from 3 1 to 4 3 billion m3 while the total water volume throughout the year remained the same fig 5 and the increase of cumulative effect was more than twice of that for scheme a the results from a survey of fish eggs and larvae in the same year were used to verify the effects of an increase in the water volume in spring rather than the cpue in 2014 and 2015 the amount of freshwater discharged from the xiaolangdi reservoir in the spring increased the discharges at lijin station in spring of 2014 and 2015 were 3 194 and 4 585 billion m3 respectively fig 7 the discharge decreased significantly in 2016 but then increased again in 2017 and 2018 the fish eggs and larvae in the yellow river estuary were surveyed in may and june from 2014 to 2018 gu et al 2019 we compared and verified the findings of our study with the results of the survey fig 8 and found that the survey results were consistent with our conclusions the density of the fish eggs is directly related to the freshwater discharge from the yellow river to the sea in spring the increased freshwater entering the sea is conducive to the expansion of fish spawning grounds and hatching of larvae the water and sediment of yellow river entering the sea in spring effectively influences the fishery resources in the sea near the estuary 4 discussion 4 1 applicability of functional regression model in estuarine ecology previously researches on the impacts of water and sediment delivery of river on the ecological status of estuary have been hampered by the fact that it is difficult to study the effects on a number of species at the same time bunn and arthington 2002 pastor et al 2014 information about the responses of single species or ecosystem agents can not represent the needs of the overall communities at the system level and so cannot be used to guide strategies such as water and sediment regulation acreman et al 2014 chang et al 2011 in this study we used a functional regression model to examine the dynamic response relationship between water and sediment fluxes and fish communities in an estuary we analyzed the time series data and identified the periods throughout the year when the water and sediment delivery were important to the fish communities and also quantified how unit changes in the flow or sediment transport rate affected the cpue the curve of β t generated by most adaption methods cannot achieve being zero in the irrelevant area and presenting a concise structure in the other area on the axis at the same time and the results are hard to interpret because of unnatural fluctuations of the curve in contrast the improved flirti method uses the idea of variable selection and can be applied to different orders of magnitude of β t the calculated estimates can be interpreted flexible and accurate at the same time james et al 2009 the functional regression method has been used frequently in environmental science chen and olden 2017 stewart koster et al 2014 but this is the first time it has been used to examine the relationship between water and sediment fluxes and estuarine ecology in different periods the diluent water accumulation area of the yellow river constitutes the most important spawning and feeding field for the fishery resources of bohai sea despite its importance the impact of the water and sediment input into the sea in terms of range and extent on the marine ecology remains unclear kong et al 2015 the area covered by this study corresponds to the area covered by the fish egg and larvae survey conducted by the first institute of oceanography of the state oceanic administration gu et al 2019 our results for the cumulative effects of the different ecological regulation schemes were consistent with that survey the model simulations showed that the change in the independent variables explained 56 of the changes in the cpue in addition to verifying the results with actual survey data the model was also permutation tested and cross validated mathematically to ensure the derived relationship was reliable 4 2 relationship between cpue and water sediment fluxes process into the yellow river estuary most fishery species in the yellow river estuary tend to spawn in the low salinity nearshore estuary in the warm spring and summer seasons table 2 lu et al 2015 when the yellow river discharges high loads of sediment and nutrients to the sea in march and april it forms the so called spring flood and creates a low salinity nutrient rich freshwater environment in the estuary that is suitable for the spawning and growth of juvenile fishes and about 39 fish species spawn in the yellow river estuary chen et al 2000 deng and jin 2000 during the control period from 1981 to 1991 the amounts of water and sediment were relatively moderate the period during which the water and sediment delivery influenced cpue was distributed from may to july coinciding with the spawning season of marine organisms the beginning of may is the spawning season for most fish at this time fishes have a greater demand for flushing water into the sea increasing the amount of water entering the sea during this time range creates a freshwater environment suitable for spawning which has a positive effect on fish biomass because of various manual interventions such as dams and diversions for irrigation in the middle and lower reaches the amount of water discharged to the sea from the yellow river during spring decreased by 65 from the 1980s to the 1990s and the spring flood in march and april disappeared resulting in a gradual change in the low salinity freshwater environment in the estuary and the adjacent waters wang et al 2016a for example the yellow river knifefish which relied on freshwater became almost extinct in the 1990s and production of the chinese shrimp in laizhou bay also decreased significantly sun et al 2013 the cpue will respond positively to increases in the amount of water discharged to the sea during dry years when the flow is either low or discontinuous in dry years the supplies of freshwater and sediment associated nutrients to the estuary are also limited and do not meet the needs of the estuary fish communities as the freshwater discharge decreases the salinity increases and affects the fish spawning the phytoplankton biomass also decreases and the marine primary productivity declines with indirect effects on fish production domingues and galvao 2007 sun et al 2019 after the xiaolangdi reservoir was put into operation in 1999 the unified regulation of the yellow river s water volume enabled the river to maintain its functional flow which means the runoff can meet the minimum requirement of the basic function of the river therefore fish did not show additional demand for freshwater into the sea during the period 2000 2011 however the high discharges of water and sediment released during the water sediment regulation at the end of june and beginning of july had a strong negative effect on cpue the flow of high sediment content is discharged in a short period of time which not only increases the amount of fish movement thus increases respiratory rate and oxygen demand but also blocks the fish gill to affect the oxygen uptake function of the fish crosa et al 2010 swinkels et al 2014 in addition the levitation of toxic substances caused by sediment discharge in the reservoir also consumes dissolved oxygen in the water body affecting fish survival bruce et al 2014 the higher the sediment concentration and the longer it lasts the greater the impact on aquatic organisms such as fish feyrer et al 2019 kemp et al 2011 4 3 influence of timing of water sediment regulation on fishery resources in the yellow river estuary the water sediment regulation in yellow river represents the first large scale water and sediment experiment in its history there is concern about the ecology in the estuary area because of the changes in the water and sediment fluxes into the estuary fan and huang 2008 the freshwater discharged to the sea has increased significantly since the regulation was implemented but the problem that the requirements of ecosystem for freshwater remains unresolved in addition aquatic organisms in the river are threatened by the high flow rates and sediment concentrations and the low levels of dissolved oxygen liu et al 2010 the discharge to the estuary varies throughout the year with water shortages in some periods by increasing the freshwater discharge in spring when marine organisms are spawning and breeding estuarine fishery resources would recover more quickly the water sediment regulation at present does not deliver enough freshwater to the estuary to meet the demand for marine organisms in the spring and also conflicts with the summer flood season li and sheng 2011 if the water and sediment regulation was shifted to the spring or if some of the water was transferred from the summer to the spring the flow and the sediment concentrations in the summer would decrease and the the freshwater area of low salinity on which fish spawning depends could increase and the goal of restoring estuarine habitats and fishery resources could be achieved we then verified two schemes of minimum flow process and suitable flow process using the measured data in the yellow river estuary from 2014 to 2018 gu et al 2019 compared with the two background datasets of 2007 and 2009 the increase in freshwater entering the sea in 2014 improved the density of fish eggs and larvae in the yellow river estuary by 2 8 times the increase of freshwater entering the sea in 2015 improved the density of fish eggs in the yellow river estuary by 3 10 times in the spring of 2016 the amount of freshwater entering the sea dropped to 1 4 of that in 2015 and the density of fish eggs and larvae also decreased and was lower than that in 2009 in the spring of 2017 the amount of water entering the sea increased to twice that in 2016 and the density of fish eggs and larvae also increased by more than double in the spring of 2018 the amount of water entering the sea continued to increase to five times that in 2016 and the density of fish eggs increased with water volume the survey shows that the freshwater discharge in spring is closely related to the densities of fish eggs and larvae in the yellow river estuary an increase in freshwater going into the sea increases the density of fish eggs and larvae and vice versa a reduction in freshwater leads to a decrease in fish eggs and larvae and the amount of water in yellow river entering the sea in spring directly affects the ecological status of the estuary song et al 2010 numerous researchers worldwide have examined the relationship between flow and ecology davies et al 2014 döll et al 2009 fabris et al 2018 yoshikawa et al 2014 but the studies inevitably have some limitations the water and sediment delivery from the yellow river to the sea mainly affect the spawning and reproduction of fish in the same year in this study we described the ecological status of fish communities by cpue and we have included the possible effects of time lags between hydrological processes and ecological impacts in the analysis of different time periods the nonlinear relationship between water and sediment fluxes and cpue and the instability of hydrological and ecological processes will be crucial research frontier in the future cloern et al 2016 deng et al 2019 rosenfeld 2017 because of its importance for river management the water sediment regulation needs to be discussed in detail to determine how it should be coordinated controlled and optimized here we have described a new method and by further developing the functional data analysis and flirti methods have provided results that have exciting implications for river management 5 conclusion aiming at the problem that the response of estuarine fish communities to the water and sediment flux process into the sea is unclear we established a functional regression model and improved the calculation method to quantify the dynamic response relationship between the daily water sediment flux process and the annual cpue of yellow river estuary the results showed that the modified flirti method can better explain the influence of water sediment flux into sea on estuarine fish communities the variations of water and sediment fluxes in different periods resulted in 56 of the changes in the cpue the fishery resource was limited by the low fluxes during april and may when the main species spawned and the high fluxes during june and july when the dam discharged if freshwater inflow in spring were increased to 3 1 billion and 4 3 billion m3 the cumulative effect on fish can be increased by 20 and 44 respectively the existing water and sediment regulation scheme does not match the requirements of estuarine fish by moving the discharge time of the dam forward to spring the problem of excessive water and sediment volume in summer can be solved and the suitable spawning environment for fish can be provided thus effectively increasing the yield of fish in estuaries this study overcomes the limitation of traditional methods on the number of species and the disunity of the time scale of hydrological and ecological data and provides a new method and idea for the study of estuarine ecology 6 data availability the water and sediment data can be download from www yrcc gov cn the fishery data are in the appendix credit authorship contribution statement yujun yi
