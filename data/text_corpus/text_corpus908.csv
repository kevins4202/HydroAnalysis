4540,agriculture is the major user of the available fresh water resources at the global scale however water resources are negatively affected by climate change therefore agricultural water management is globally considered as a key solution to address the current and future water resources challenges in this study a large number of recommended and probable scenarios of different deficit irrigations climatic conditions and rainfall patterns and sowing dates were defined and modeled under rotational and on demand irrigation scheduling is for this purpose the aquacrop model that was calibrated and validated based on the observed data of 15 growing seasons was applied on winter wheat in a warm and semi arid environment in the south west of iran the aquacrop model simulated grain yield accurately with normalized root mean square error nrmse of 5 and 6 for calibration and validation respectively analyses showed that the yield response factor in the different scenarios was higher than 1 in all climatic conditions that indicates high wheat sensitivity to water stress in the study area besides analyzing the optimal irrigation plans for all possible climatic conditions and deficit irrigation levels showed that irrigation at the stem elongation stage was the most critical irrigation event further analysis also showed that november 8th 22nd is the optimal window for achieving the highest grain yield in all climate conditions modeling showed that the rotational is is more adaptable to deficit irrigation practices due to maintaining higher grain yield and water productivity compared with the on demand is indeed it is possible to maintain grain yield and increase water productivity by applying deficit irrigation up to 40 of full irrigation under rotational is in conclusion the results of this scenario based modeling study showed that achieving the highest grain yield and water productivity in a large irrigation area depends on a combination of deficit irrigation scenarios and the water delivery systems in response to climatic variations however changing the water delivery systems from rotational to on demand requires expensive infrastructure investment and irrigation scenarios analysis before any decision keywords aquacrop water productivity rotational and on demand irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation climatic conditions sowing date 1 introduction globally about 70 90 of the fresh water resources are used in agriculture in parallel climate change is expected to deteriorate the situation of food production by significantly reducing supplies of freshwater resources and increasing the frequency intensity and duration of drought events ipcc 2014 probably the most common strategy for addressing current and future water related challenges and adapting proper agricultural practices is to focus primarily on improving agricultural water productivity by implementing irrigation water saving approaches molden et al 2010 more specifically these challenges can be resolved through effective agronomic management including proper irrigation scheduling with considering deficit irrigation climatic conditions and appropriate sowing dates which would allow either greater agricultural production with the same amount of water or the same amount of agricultural production with less water sandhu and irmak 2019 in cases that the required irrigation water could not be supplied irrigation scheduling may justify water stress on plants through deficit irrigation planning deficit irrigation as a practical strategy for applying less irrigation in different growth stages has been globally applied on different field crops pardo et al 2020 yu et al 2020 tsakmakis et al 2019 ali et al 2019 therefore appropriate irrigation scheduling minimizes the effects of water stress on agronomic parameters such as yield and water productivity lima et al 2019 liu and song 2020 investigation of how irrigation scheduling affects grain yield and water productivity and determining optimal irrigation scheduling has been a priority for agricultural researchers at farm level studies li et al 2019 goosheh et al 2018 peng et al 2018 gonz√°lez perea et al 2016 in this regard modifying crop sowing date is one of the important field management approaches to adapt to local environment that could potentially reduce irrigation water application through proper irrigation scheduling saddique et al 2020 hence depending on local conditions both early and late sowing dates have been suggested by several researchers ding et al 2020 mourtzinis et al 2019 hunt et al 2019 however the way that the optimal sowing date affects crop development and yield production is still poorly understood especially in the southern agroecosystem of iran with large areas of wheat production the question of whether the delayed sowing date is appropriate with the different rainfall patterns of this region is still open to answer however there has been a long debate about assessing the above strategies by researchers engineers and farmers in south west of iran where wheat production is the main cropping system nasab et al 2009 furthermore there is still a broader scope for increasing water productivity in this region foley et al 2019 as there is a yield gap between the current wheat production of 3350 k g h a 1 average of 2000 2016 and its potential level which is estimated as 6000 k g h a 1 seyed jalali 2016 however field assessment of yield responses to different irrigation strategies is laborious costly and may not be affordable considering such limitations dynamic crop growth modeling is a convenient tool for studying and developing irrigation strategies ahmadi et al 2015 andarzian et al 2011 pereira et al 2009 to meet this demand the aquacrop model which is developed by the food and agriculture organization fao was chosen to be utilized it is user friendly practitioner oriented and requires a relatively small number of explicit and mostly intuitive parameters and input variables requiring a simple method for their determination bird et al 2016 the aquacrop model has been extensively tested in different regions of the world on different crops ahmadi et al 2015 so far the aquacrop model has not been used for crop growth modeling under rotational and on demand water delivery systems that convey a kind of irrigation scheduling is such that time and amount of water delivery could be determined savari et al 2016 indeed the rotational and on demand is have not been modeled at large scales in the previous studies therefore the effect of different deficit irrigation levels irrigation planning and rotational and on demand is were assessed on grain yield and water productivity of winter wheat the current study is a concise modeling activity that combines different aspects of water availability water delivery rainfall amount and distribution and sowing dates this study is done for wheat modeling at a plain scale to assess the aquacrop potential in irrigation management and yield prediction for practical goals instead of focusing on plot or small field scale recent studies have emphasized crop modeling by considering the combined effect of irrigation management sowing date and climate change scenarios saddique et al 2020 araya et al 2021 therefore the objectives of this study were to calibrate and validate the aquacrop model using the long term observed winter wheat grain yield in the south west of iran and then apply the validated model for simulating a combination of generated decision making scenarios on irrigation plans climatic conditions and field management including 1 rotational and on demand irrigation scheduling 2 normal wet dry and extremely dry climatic years in terms of rainfall amount and distribution 3 deficit irrigation levels 0 70 reduction of full irrigation for assessing water scarcity conditions and 4 different sowing dates these scenarios were considered and analyzed for finding the optimal water saving irrigation planning and sowing dates which can serve as a guide for the agricultural decision and policy makers 2 materials and methods in this section the details of the winter wheat growth modeling under different management scenarios are explained fig 1 illustrates a framework of the key modeling steps and activities done in this study towards improved irrigation planning and water productivity 2 1 study area and description the study area was the shushtar plain which is located in the south west of iran khuzestan province with an area of about 2433 km 2 extended between 31 6 and 32 15 northern latitudes and 48 55 and 49 22 eastern longitudes it is surrounded bythe hillsides of the zagros mountains and the dez river fig 2 the average elevation of the shushtar plain is 150 m above mean sea level the climate of this area is warm and semi arid based on the de martoone method and the mean annual rainfall is 342 mm saabet ghadam haghighi and sharifi 2012 the annual average area of winter wheat in the study area is 38 273 ha of with an average annual production of 136 766 t o n n e s between 2000 and 2016 ministry of jihad of agriculture 2020 the shushtar plain plays a prominent role in wheat production and food security in the south west of iran almost 75 of this plain is under surface irrigation supplied from the karun river abbasi et al 2017 albaji and hemadi 2011 irrigation water distribution networks is the rotational system that has low flexibility and managed by the public organization savari et al 2016 border and basin irrigation methods are the main traditional irrigation practices with low application efficiency of 45 abbasi et al 2017 the total water use during the growing season is usually 3500 4500 m 3 ha 1 including rainfall goosheh et al 2018 the growing season is about 150 days with the sowing date of november 22 n d besides depending on the amount and distribution of rainfall the wheat crop is normally irrigated three to six times using 50 100 mm each time lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 climatic data including rainfall maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed for the period of 2000 2016 were obtained from the meteorological organization of khuzestan province fig 3 the reference evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated by the cropwat 8 0 software it uses the penman monteith method to calculate et 0 following the approach of allen et al 1998 fig 3a clay loam is the dominant soil texture in the study area the soil thickness and saturation hydraulic conductivity is considered 1 5 m and 70 mm d a y the volumetric permanent wilting point field capacity and soil water content at saturation are 22 35 and 50 respectively albaji et al 2014 seyed jalali 2016 2 2 aquacrop model description calibration and validation the water driven aquacrop model is originally evolved from the doorenbos and kassam 1979 concept to determine yield response to water eq 1 which led to concept of normalized water productivity mirsafi et al 2016 steduto et al 2009 aquacrop consists of two types of parameters 1 the conservative parameters that are crop specific and generally do not change with time management and location and it is expected that the default values in the aquacrop manual could be used globally montoya et al 2016 hsiao et al 2009 however sometimes it is required to calibrate the conservative parameters for better match of the simulations and the observations table 1 and 2 the non conservative parameters that are locally and management specific that change with time management and location table 2 the non conservative parameters depend on the local conditions and crop phenology these parameters are not calibrated but are generally obtained from local information paredes et al 2015 1 y m y a y m k y e t m e t a e t m where y m and y a are maximum and actual grain yield kg ha 1 et m and et a are maximum and actual evapotranspiration mm and ky is the yield response factor calibration and validation of aquacrop are the basic required steps to increase the accuracy and validity of simulations of the aquacrop for calibration and validation the average wheat grain yield of 10 growing seasons from 2000 to 2001 to 2009 2010 and five growing season from 2010 to 2011 to 2015 2016 were extracted respectively from the database of the jihad agricultural organization of khuzestan province ministry of jihad of agriculture 2020 the calibration and validation procedure was based on trial and error to match the observed and simulated grain yields by calibrating the crop growth parameters tables 1 and 2 the irrigation data and information were obtained from the recommended irrigation planning for winter wheat in the study area lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 table 3 taking into account the effect of rainfall for each year the calibrated model was then used for validation by changing the meteorological information and modifying the irrigation file by considering rainfall distribution and its application to irrigation requirements for five growing seasons from 2010 to 2011 to 2015 2016 except for 2011 2012 due to lack of data the grain simulations of the calibration and validation are given in table 4 2 2 1 statistical analyses during the calibration and validation the statistical analysis and goodness of fit between observed and simulated grain yields were assessed using the normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ef the coefficient of determination r2

years for the calibration and validation step respectively the interpretation of the indices are explained in table 5 2 3 management scenarios in wheat modeling after calibration and validation the aquacrop was employed to evaluate the effect of diverse management scenarios on wheat grain yield and water productivity 2 3 1 deficit irrigation scenarios deficit irrigation is a practical strategy for applying less irrigation in different growth stages compared to the full irrigation allen et al 1998 in order to generate deficit irrigation scenarios it was necessary to consider a wide range and combination of irrigation events times and amounts thus the deficit irrigation scenarios were considered as reducing 10 20 25 30 40 50 60 and 70 of the full irrigation and were combined with different number of irrigation events during the growing season 1 2 3 4 5 6 times in scenario setting the amount of irrigation amount in each irrigation event could vary between 20 mm as the lower limit and 100 mm as the upper limit which makes the scenarios more real and practical for decision makers and beneficiaries due to the limitations of irrigation water distribution networks lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 it is also notable that in setting the scenarios deficit irrigation was considered in the main wheat growth stages based on days after sowing das except in the first irrigation that is essential for full germination and crop establishment table 3 2 3 2 irrigation scheduling scenarios on demand and rotational water delivery systems are indeed two principal types of irrigation scheduling is methods anwar and haq 2016 savari et al 2016 on demand is implies delivering water to farmers based on their request time flow rate and duration of water delivery in the rotational is the flow rate irrigation frequency and duration of water delivery are all fixed for the entire growing season thus in this study all the deficit irrigation scenarios were generated and modeled under both rotational and on demand is for simulating the current irrigation network operation fixed delivery time and a constant amount of water in each growth stage and the possible future conditions with some flexibilities on irrigation amount between different stages based on upgrading the current irrigation water delivery networks for both rotational and on demand is the irrigation requirement is considered based on the recommended irrigation plan for the region that is 450 mm for winter wheat lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 however the irrigation time and amount were different so that the recommended irrigation planning of lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 was used for the on demand is and the irrigation planning suggested by andarzian et al 2011 was used for the rotational is the effect of rainfall amount and distribution climatic scenarios on irrigation requirement was considered for both rotational and on demand is table 3 this approach not only may improve the rotational and on demand is but may also help decision makers to decide if irrigation water distribution networks need to be upgraded from rotational to on demand systems 2 3 3 climatology crop modeling and scenario setting without considering different climatic conditions would reduce the reliability of the simulations therefore irrigation scenarios are combined with climatic conditions for this aim long term annual rainfall data from 1980 to 2016 of the study area were obtained from the khuzestan meteorological organization then the probability of exceedance for dry 80 normal 50 and wet 20 annual rainfall was simulated by the rainbow software v 2 2 raes et al 2006 results of the software showed that the rainfall amount for dry normal and wet years were 154 mm between 154 mm and 291 mm average 222 mm and 291 mm respectively these annual rainfall amounts were converted to the monthly amounts according to the long term rainfall distribution from 1980 to 2016 fig 3a the extremely dry year with null rainfall 0 mm is also considered as a probable future extreme climate only for the on demand is due to its flexibility in providing requested irrigation water in different conditions and growing stages that is almost impossible in the rotational systems 2 3 4 sowing date scenarios changing the growing period and finding optimal sowing dates is a practical field management strategy for improving grain yield and water productivity under the current and future climatic conditions therefore for obtaining the optimal sowing window in the study area the current sowing date that is november 22nd lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 has been tested against early and late sowing date alternatives however an initial trial and error showed that the current sowing date is at the end tail of a possible sowing window which means sowing later than the current suggested date has a negative impact on grain yield biomass and water productivity data not shown furthermore the beginning of this window was about two weeks earlier than the current date meaning that sowing earlier than november 8th also has a negative impact on crop production considering this issue late sowing alternative has not been considered in the scenario setting therefore the optimal scenarios of each deficit irrigation management under different climatic years were evaluated on daily time scales compared with the current condition for the sowing window of november 8th and 22nd 2 4 evaluation of management scenarios in total 3000 generated scenarios were defined and simulated by aquacrop in addition to grain yield other indices such as water productivity water use efficiency wue and transpiration efficiency were considered and calculated to assess the generated scenarios water productivity wp is often used to define the relationship between the crop produced and the amount of water involved in crop production as eq 6 6 w p g y i p where gy is the wheat grain yield kg i is the applied irrigation water m 3 and p is rainfall during the growing season m 3 in a crop production system wue is used to define the relationship between crop production and the amount of water used in crop production in terms of evapotranspiration in this study wue refers to the ratio between the grain yield gy k g and cumulative actual crop evapotranspiration during the growing season eta m 3 eq 7 7 w u e g y et a the concept of transpiration efficiency te is similar to wue except that the eta is replaced by transpiration t m 3 as eq 8 the te includes the beneficial part of the water used in crop production while excludes the non beneficial part that does not contribute to grain yield production 8 t e g y t 2 5 water stress assessment 2 5 1 sensitivity coefficient Œª jensen 1968 described a yield production function that relates imposed water stress to yield as follows 9 y a y m i 1 n e t a e t m i Œª i where y a is the actual observed crop yield y m is the maximum crop yield when soil water is not limiting e t a is the actual crop evapotranspiration e t m is the maximum crop evapotranspiration when soil water is not limiting y m and e t m are considered based on the best full irrigation plan with highest yield production i is the considered crop growing stage Œª i is the sensitivity coefficient of crop to water stress during the growth stage i unitless n is the number of growth stages a greater Œª represents more sensitivity to water stress the equation accounts for the sensitivity of the crop to different growing stages the values of Œªi were was estimated through generalized reduced gradient grg nonlinear regression method using the microsoft excel solver for different optimal irrigation plans to reveal the sensitivity of each growth stage for applying deficit irrigation table 3 in this approach the optimal irrigation plans that resulted in the highest grain yield and water productivity as the optimum criteria were identified table 6 the best fitted Œª i values were obtained by minimizing the summation of the square of the deviation eq 10 mohan 1997 10 ssd y a y m observed y a y m fitted 2 it is noteworthy that for estimating Œª i it is required to happen remarkable differences between the generated scenarios in each growing stage which is just probable in the on demand is due to its flexibility and variability between growth stages in terms of different applied irrigation water table 3 however for the scenarios that were generated under the rotational is there was a low flexibility and variability between growth stages in terms of different applied irrigation water table 3 to derive the Œª i to handle this issue the yield response factor was also used stewart et al 1977 2 5 2 yield response factor ky doorenbos and kassam 1979 analyzed the results of several studies on the et yield relationship and introduced the yield response factor k y and suggested a linear yield production function as eq 11 stewart et al 1977 11 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m where 1 y a y m is the crop yield decline and 1 e t a e t m is the evapotranspiration deficit higher k y implies more sensitivity to water deficit if ky 1 it means that the yield decline is proportionally less with the decrease in water deficit if ky 1 it shows that the yield decline is proportionally greater with the decrease in water deficit 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of aquacrop the simulated wheat grain yields showed a very good agreement with observed wheat grain yields in the calibration stage table 4 following the suggested interpretation of evaluation criteria by raes et al 2015 table 5 the simulated wheat grain yield varied from nearly 3300 k g h a 1 to 4400 k g h a 1 while the observed grain yield varied from nearly 3100 k g h a 1 to 4600 k g h a 1 during the growing seasons of 2000 2001 and 2009 2010 the low nrmse of 5 shows that calibration has been very good and model has been calibrated well table 5 in the validation stage the simulated wheat grain yield varied from 2900 k g h a 1 to 4400 kg h a 1 while the observed grain yield varied from 2600 kg h a 1 to 4800 kg h a 1 for the 2010 2011 to 2015 2016 growing seasons the nrmse in the validation stage was 6 which is good therefore the aquacrop model could predict grain yield of winter wheat accurately at large scale and the evaluation criteria were also in the reported range of the previous studies zhang et al 2013 jin et al 2014 iqbal et al 2014 the relatively big differences in the observed wheat grain yield during the 2000 2001 until 2015 2016 growing seasons are partly justified by the variability of climate but much of the discrepancies are due to the instability of irrigation and farm management conditions which are considered constant in calibration and validation stage therefore calibration and validation could be significantly improved by employing wheat cultivation managements in the study area which is partly achievable by implementing the results of this study 3 2 water delivery systems and irrigation scheduling 3 2 1 rotational irrigation scheduling table 6 presents the best optimal irrigation plans for the grain yield and water productivity under different climatic years and deficit irrigation levels under the rotational and on demand is according to table 6 grain yield and water productivity varied from 910 k g h a 1 to 3650 k g h a 1 and 0 37 k g m 3 to 0 9 k g m 3 in dry year for the best irrigation plans under different deficit irrigation levels and the rotational is in addition the grain yield and water productivity varied from 1700 k g h a 1 to 3690 k g h a 1 and 0 59 k g m 3 to 0 82 k g m 3 in normal year and varied from 2300 k g h a 1 to 3680 k g h a 1 and 0 68 k g m 3 to 0 85 k g m 3 in wet year respectively fig 4 illustrates the box plots of the grain yield and water productivity under different deficit irrigation plans and climatic years for the rotational is each box contains all possible irrigation managements by changing the number and time of irrigation events comparing the best irrigation plans solid circles under the deficit irrigation levels show that grain yield is nearly maintained until reaching the mild deficit irrigation level in the dry normal and wet years similar behavior is also observed for the average irrigation plans circle dotted among the different deficit irrigation levels however grain yield loss by increasing the deficit irrigation level is higher in the dry year than the normal year and subsequently in the normal year was higher than the wet year this is probably due to the lower rainfall amount in addition comparing the worst irrigation plans empty circles the grain yield in wet year is higher than normal year and it is higher in normal year than dry year however the variations in grain yield among the deficit irrigation levels show a threshold at the 40 deficit irrigation above which grain yield decreased sharply fig 4 likewise the overall changes in water productivity are also similar to changes in grain yield except that for all irrigation plans water productivity is almost constant up to 40 deficit irrigation and then decreased sharply which could be due to a sharp decline in grain yield production so fig 4 reveals that dry year is more sensitive to deficit irrigation compared to the normal year therefore it is required to implement more efficient irrigation planning in dry year 3 2 2 on demand irrigation scheduling table 6 shows the best optimal irrigation plans for grain yield and water productivity for the on demand is method under the on demand is grain yield and water productivity varied from 440 k g h a 1 to 4220 k g h a 1 and 0 1 kg m 3 to 0 63 k g m 3 in extremely dry year from 680 k g h a 1 to 4150 k g h a 1 and 0 43 kg m 3 to 0 8 k g m 3 in dry year and from 1450 k g h a 1 to 3960 k g h a 1 and 0 43 kg m 3 to 0 8 k g m 3 in normal year and from 1880 kg ha 1 to 3870 k g h a 1 and 0 68 kg m 3 to 0 85 k g m 3 in wet year respectively fig 5 illustrates that under all climatic years the gy and wp linearly decreased with increasing the deficit irrigation levels this is obvious for the best solid circle average circle dotted and worst empty circle irrigation plans under the best irrigation plans the gy and wp declined sharply under the different deficit irrigation levels as climate conditions change from wet to extremely dry year this reveals a higher sensitivity of gy and wp to deficit irrigation in the dryer years however for the worst irrigation plans under the different climatic years the rate of gy and wp declined milder than compared to the best irrigation plans this clearly highlights the necessity of determining the best irrigation plans in dry and extremely dry years compared to normal and wet years overall the deficit irrigation scenarios not only could not remarkably maintain grain yield in any of the rotational and on demand is but also has a negative impact on water productivity and grain yield in on demand is this is an unexpected result and in contrast with the findings of the previous studies yu et al 2020 ali et al 2019 goosheh et al 2018 tari 2016 therefore deficit irrigation does not seem to be a reliable water saving strategy in the study area for winter wheat due to the high sensitivity of grain yield to water stress particularly in the on demand is under the rotational is however it is possible to apply up to 40 deficit irrigation under any of the climatic conditions of wet normal and dry years this is important to know that under drought conditions the rotational is is more efficient and reliable than on demand is for applying deficit irrigation 3 3 optimal sowing window 3 3 1 under rotational irrigation scheduling fig 6 shows the grain yield and biomass percentage changes computed based on the current sowing date november 22nd and the optimal sowing window november 8th 22nd under different deficit irrigation levels and climatic years each box is constructed of 14 data points which indicates the percentage of change of grain yield or biomass production under the optimal irrigation plan table 6 the average percentage change value of grain yield in dry normal and wet years was 8 4 5 7 and 6 3 while the average percentage change of biomass was 1 6 3 6 and 2 8 respectively typically under different climatic years and low deficit irrigation levels changing the sowing date from the current condition to the optimal period has a positive impact on grain yield and biomass however under severe deficit irrigation levels this effect disappears and may even become negative thus for full irrigation and low deficit irrigation levels it is more rational to sow in the optimal period but for severe deficit irrigation levels there is not any considerable difference between the current and optimal sowing window so it is recommended to sow wheat earlier than the current date and up to two weeks in advance 3 3 2 under on demand irrigation scheduling fig 7 is similar to fig 6 except that the results were obtained under the optimal on demand is the average percentage change value of grain yield in extremely dry dry normal and wet years was 8 5 10 26 4 22 and 7 88 while for biomass they were 1 2 4 7 2 3 and 3 5 respectively except in the normal year the impact of changing the sowing date on grain yield is significantly positive under severe deficit irrigation levels the biomass percentage change showed very large variations in extremely dry and dry years under different deficit irrigation levels while the variations become smaller under the normal and wet years this means that the negative impact of changing the sowing date on biomass under severe deficit irrigation levels in the dry and extremely dry years changed to a completely positive impact in normal and wet years fig 7 andarzian et al 2015 determined the optimal sowing window for winter wheat in different wheat production regions of khuzestan province they showed that the optimal sowing window for two regions of ahvaz and izeh was between 5th november to 5th december and 1st november to 15th december respectively these dates were between 5th november to 15th december for behbahan and dezful regions therefore the recommended sowing window in the current study area is likely similar to the other regions of khuzestan province such as ahvaz and izeh 3 4 sensitivity coefficient as explained earlier the coefficients of the sensitivity coefficients of the jensen production function were calculated only for the on demand is table 7 the best and worst irrigation plans with different irrigation frequencies number of irrigation events among all the deficit irrigation levels are considered as the benchmark irrigation plans for estimating the Œª i the Œª i could not be mathematically calculated for the one and two irrigation events scenarios the Œª i values were estimated based on et and t table 7 the Œª i were calculated precisely except in some of the worst irrigation plans due to the similarities of transpiration and evapotranspiration ratios in different deficit irrigation levels overall lower Œª 1 of the first irrigation compared to the subsequent irrigation events could be due to the fact that the amount of applied irrigation amount in the first irrigation has been fixed for the different deficit irrigation levels therefore it was not possible to estimate the sensitivity of the crop to irrigation water under this condition however the Œª i values revealed that irrigation at stem elongation 90 das was the most prominent irrigation event in most climatic conditions and irrigation frequencies which implies that irrigation at stem elongation is critical for grain yield mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 3 5 yield response factor figs 8 and 9 illustrate the fitted stewart equation for grain yield and biomass under different climatic years based on et and t respectively the slopes of the fitted regression lines indicate the k y the et based k y values for grain yield in dry normal and wet years were 1 87 1 80 and 1 56 and for biomass were 1 26 1 16 and 1 04 respectively fig 8 this means that the sensitivity of grain yield and biomass are different under diverse climatic years such that dry year shows higher sensitivity to water stress the difference between the k y values between normal and wet years are higher than the difference between normal and dry year however higher k y values for the grain yield imply that grain production is much affected by the water stress than biomass therefore irrigation managements and scenarios must emphasize on the proper irrigation planning for sustainable grain production in addition the t based k y values for grain yield in dry normal and wet years were 1 19 1 1 and 1 03 and for biomass were 0 81 0 79 and 0 7 respectively fig 9 these values imply two main points the first point is that the k y values of the biomass are 1 that indicate biomass production has lower sensitivity to the t based water stress than grain yield with k y values higher than 1 the second point is that the t based k y values for grain yield and biomass are much lower than the corresponding values of the et based values this is strongly related to the soil evaporation component that has contributed highly under irrigated conditions in the arid and semi arid up to 30 40 ahmadi et al 2019 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 so this implies that proper irrigation managements and scenarios should focus on the beneficiary use of irrigation water transpiration by reducing the non beneficiary component evaporation low frequency irrigations and implementing subsurface drip irrigation would be highly effective in reducing soil evaporation in the study area 3 6 water productivity and water use efficiency figs 10 and 11 illustrate the relation of wp with wue and te for all of the generated irrigation scenarios under rotational is and on demand is respectively irrigation scenarios in wet year have higher wp and wue than normal and dry years in both on demand is and rotational is although the relation between wp and wue is linear the wp has a quadratic relation with te this shows that wue increases proportionally with wp but the highest te could be achieved at certain wp values thus transpiration efficiency seems to be a more reliable parameter for determining an optimum amount of water productivity since transpiration efficiency reaches a maximum point and decreases with further increase in water productivity while this maximum point could not be calculated for water use efficiency as a result the highest te under dry normal and wet conditions would occur at wp values of 0 92 k g m 3 0 98 k g m 3 and 1 07 k g m 3 in the rotational is these values were 0 67 k g m 3 0 69 k g m 3 and 0 85 k g m 3 for the dry normal and wet years under on demand is therefore wp values beyond these optimum values may not sustainably increase transpiration efficiency it indicates that increasing wp beyond the optimum values may contribute to higher evaporation rates that do not increase transpiration necessarily furthermore comparing the optimum wp values in the rotational is and on demand is indicates that on demand is may lead to higher achievable te at lower optimum wp values this might be an indication of higher flexibility of on demand irrigation delivery method to attain higher te indeed lower optimum wp in the on demand is compared to rotational is shows that water could be utilized more efficiently in the rotational is by wheat crops through improved transpiration and reduced evaporation this finding has been also recently approved and argued by liu and song 2020 and xu et al 2018 who reported that on demand is is a necessary irrigation scheduling to reduce water loss and improve crop water consumption it is also noteworthy that the calculated water productivity and water use efficiency values of the best irrigation scenarios table 6 under both rotational is figs 4 and 10 and on demand is figs 5 and 11 are comparable with the previous studies conducted on winter wheat in khuzestan province and iran respectively which are estimated between 0 8 and 1 1 k g m 3 nakhjavani moghadam et al 2016 in a recent study in the khuzestan province goosheh et al 2018 water productivity values for the optimal irrigation scenarios were estimated between 0 85 k g m 3 and 1 3 k g m 3 water use efficiency of winter wheat in ahvaz khuzestan was also estimated between 1 4 k g m 3 and 1 7 k g m 3 by andarzian et al 2011 lower wp and wue in our study are likely due to the larger spatial scale of the study which resulted in uncertainties of grain yield at the calibration and validation stage that could subsequently affect the amount of wp and wue of the generated scenarios in comparison to site scale studies of andarzian et al 2011 in addition the large differences in the observed grain yield at the current sowing date table 4 are also contributed to this grain yield underestimation therefore it seems that revising the suggested wheat water requirement lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 that is widely used in other researches is necessary for achieving higher and potential winter wheat grain yield wp and wue in the study area 3 7 evapotranspiration and transpiration fraction fig 12 shows the relationship between the cumulative et of growing season and the ratio of t e t for the different climatic years under rotational is and on demand is fig 12 is illustrated for the optimal irrigation plan of each deficit irrigation in rotational is the range of variation of et in the dry year is greater than normal year which is also followed by wet year obviously at any certain et values the t et is highest in the dry year followed by normal and wet years this shows that crop transpiration has the highest values in dry years furthermore fig 12 shows that under rotational is in dry year the t constitutes ca 52 and 75 of the total et at the highest and lowest levels of deficit irrigation respectively however it is apparent that t has lower fractions of the total et in the normal and wet years compared to the dry year fig 12 this implies that irrigation water has been utilized more beneficially in the dry years moreover rotational is resulted in the lowest soil evaporation in the extremely dry and dry years for each optimal irrigation plan of each deficit irrigation on demand is however showed different fractions of t under the climatic years compared to the rotational is although the fraction of t i e t et in the normal and wet year varied almost in a range similar to what occurred in the rotational is this fraction varied considerably in the dry year and t varied ca 35 to 80 at the highest and lowest levels of deficit irrigation respectively moreover the range of et and t et variations are is greater in dry and extremely dry years in other words severe deficit irrigation levels would induce higher soil evaporation lower transpiration under on demand is compared to the rotational is but this pattern changes and on demand is would be the recommended water delivery system in dry year subject to low deficit irrigation levels due to a higher fraction of t compared to the rotational is fig 12 this shows that on demand is is not recommended under dry conditions if high water stress levels are probable therefore on demand is seems to be a more suitable water delivery method for applying low deficit irrigation levels while rotational is is better suited for severe deficit irrigation levels under different climatic years 3 8 soil water deficit fig 13 shows the relationship between cumulative soil water deficit during the growing season and relative grain yield for different climatic years under rotational is and on demand is the optimal irrigation plan for each deficit irrigation level was chosen high amounts of soil water deficit are due to the fact that simulated root depth at the end of the growing season 0 70 m is considered for calculations of root zone soil water balance this approach guarantees comparing different deficit irrigation scenarios more logical and accurate because the dynamic of root growth during growing season varies in different irrigation scenarios induced by soil water content results showed that the range of soil water deficit and relative grain yield variation in the on demand is is higher than rotational is this highlighted that at low deficit irrigation levels i e relative grain yield close to 1 both rotational is and on demand is are almost similar but in severe deficit irrigation levels rotational is is likely better than on demand due to higher soil water deficit in the on demand is for both rotational is and on demand is it does not seem to exist a straightforward approach to find a unique relation between different climate years however due to a sharp decline in relative grain yields it could be concluded that on demand is seems to be more sensitive to soil water deficit in wet year while the rotational is is more sensitive to soil water deficit in dry year 4 limitations of the study and future improvements in this study aquacrop model was calibrated and validated based on grain yield while the biomass and soil water content were not available for the individual farms of the study region in addition soil characteristics were assumed to be constant in this case study due to lack of data however it is noteworthy that this study clearly reveals that it is possible to upscale the application of aquacrop from plot scale to large scales for irrigation management and crop yield prediction aquacrop model is basically oriented towards farm scale modeling ahmadi et al 2015 but is a highly versatile tool that has the great potential to be coupled with hydrodynamic models such as icss manz and schaalje 1992 and sobek afrasiabikia et al 2017 which are able to simulate and assess irrigation networks such coupling of models integrates irrigation networks and farms which gives more credibility to the results of modeling irrigation scheduling particularly for modeling scenarios that are influenced by irrigation network managing such as rotational is and on demand is although on demand is is more flexible for engineers practitioners and farmers it may imply a significant expenditure in energy and other infrastructures d√≠az et al 2009 moreno et al 2010 in addition on demand irrigation water delivery networks cannot result in efficient water use if farmers do not perform adequate plans especially when they need the help of the irrigation advisory services ortega et al 2005 theoretically based on previous studies sarwar et al 2001 sarwar and perry 2002 on demand is gave the highest yields per hectare lowest water demand to meet full crop demand and lowest deep percolation therefore the modernization of irrigation networks toward making them more flexible with high accessibility to demanded water for consumers even without considering the extra expenditures does not seem to be a reliable solution to increase grain yield and water productivity more reliable assessment of these two irrigation scheduling methods could be achievable by integrated modeling of irrigation water delivery networks and farm simultaneously the water saving scenarios in this study could be evaluated in future climatic conditions for improved adaptation to local conditions and likely climate change performance assessment indicators of the irrigation scheduling were relatively simple in future studies irrigation scheduling could be assessed and optimized by utilizing an economic indicator 5 conclusion in this study aquacrop was calibrated and validated at a large scale based on the observed grain yield of winter wheat in a warm and semi arid area in the south west of iran the model was run under rotational and on demand irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation scenarios from no water stress up to 70 reduction in applied water compared to the full irrigation and different climatic years including dry normal and wet conditions the model was also run to determine the best sowing window considering the best irrigation plans and crop sensitivity to water stress stem elongation irrigation 90 days after sowing was the most important irrigation event in almost all circumstances in determining optimal sowing date it was concluded that late sowing dates had a negative effect on grain yield and water productivity for both rotational is and on demand is however sowing up to two weeks earlier than the current sowing date would considerably improve grain yield and water productivity this positive effect can be hopeful for future studies to optimize and adapt the sowing date with climate change considering and comparing grain yield water productivity and water use efficiency between rotational is and on demand is it is concluded that in most scenarios rotational is is the recommended water delivery system and irrigation scheduling in the study area therefore this study showed that maintaining wheat grain yield highly depends on sufficient irrigation but it is possible to manage applied irrigation water through appropriate irrigation planning and deficit irrigation levels in the region under diverse climatic conditions and rainfall distribution in rotational is since on demand irrigation scheduling may impose expenditure in energy and other infrastructures and was not remarkably better than rotational is in applying different deficit irrigation levels its cost justification regarding higher grain yield needs further investigation 6 credit author statement seyed hamid ahmadi conceptualized the research idea objectives and

4540,agriculture is the major user of the available fresh water resources at the global scale however water resources are negatively affected by climate change therefore agricultural water management is globally considered as a key solution to address the current and future water resources challenges in this study a large number of recommended and probable scenarios of different deficit irrigations climatic conditions and rainfall patterns and sowing dates were defined and modeled under rotational and on demand irrigation scheduling is for this purpose the aquacrop model that was calibrated and validated based on the observed data of 15 growing seasons was applied on winter wheat in a warm and semi arid environment in the south west of iran the aquacrop model simulated grain yield accurately with normalized root mean square error nrmse of 5 and 6 for calibration and validation respectively analyses showed that the yield response factor in the different scenarios was higher than 1 in all climatic conditions that indicates high wheat sensitivity to water stress in the study area besides analyzing the optimal irrigation plans for all possible climatic conditions and deficit irrigation levels showed that irrigation at the stem elongation stage was the most critical irrigation event further analysis also showed that november 8th 22nd is the optimal window for achieving the highest grain yield in all climate conditions modeling showed that the rotational is is more adaptable to deficit irrigation practices due to maintaining higher grain yield and water productivity compared with the on demand is indeed it is possible to maintain grain yield and increase water productivity by applying deficit irrigation up to 40 of full irrigation under rotational is in conclusion the results of this scenario based modeling study showed that achieving the highest grain yield and water productivity in a large irrigation area depends on a combination of deficit irrigation scenarios and the water delivery systems in response to climatic variations however changing the water delivery systems from rotational to on demand requires expensive infrastructure investment and irrigation scenarios analysis before any decision keywords aquacrop water productivity rotational and on demand irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation climatic conditions sowing date 1 introduction globally about 70 90 of the fresh water resources are used in agriculture in parallel climate change is expected to deteriorate the situation of food production by significantly reducing supplies of freshwater resources and increasing the frequency intensity and duration of drought events ipcc 2014 probably the most common strategy for addressing current and future water related challenges and adapting proper agricultural practices is to focus primarily on improving agricultural water productivity by implementing irrigation water saving approaches molden et al 2010 more specifically these challenges can be resolved through effective agronomic management including proper irrigation scheduling with considering deficit irrigation climatic conditions and appropriate sowing dates which would allow either greater agricultural production with the same amount of water or the same amount of agricultural production with less water sandhu and irmak 2019 in cases that the required irrigation water could not be supplied irrigation scheduling may justify water stress on plants through deficit irrigation planning deficit irrigation as a practical strategy for applying less irrigation in different growth stages has been globally applied on different field crops pardo et al 2020 yu et al 2020 tsakmakis et al 2019 ali et al 2019 therefore appropriate irrigation scheduling minimizes the effects of water stress on agronomic parameters such as yield and water productivity lima et al 2019 liu and song 2020 investigation of how irrigation scheduling affects grain yield and water productivity and determining optimal irrigation scheduling has been a priority for agricultural researchers at farm level studies li et al 2019 goosheh et al 2018 peng et al 2018 gonz√°lez perea et al 2016 in this regard modifying crop sowing date is one of the important field management approaches to adapt to local environment that could potentially reduce irrigation water application through proper irrigation scheduling saddique et al 2020 hence depending on local conditions both early and late sowing dates have been suggested by several researchers ding et al 2020 mourtzinis et al 2019 hunt et al 2019 however the way that the optimal sowing date affects crop development and yield production is still poorly understood especially in the southern agroecosystem of iran with large areas of wheat production the question of whether the delayed sowing date is appropriate with the different rainfall patterns of this region is still open to answer however there has been a long debate about assessing the above strategies by researchers engineers and farmers in south west of iran where wheat production is the main cropping system nasab et al 2009 furthermore there is still a broader scope for increasing water productivity in this region foley et al 2019 as there is a yield gap between the current wheat production of 3350 k g h a 1 average of 2000 2016 and its potential level which is estimated as 6000 k g h a 1 seyed jalali 2016 however field assessment of yield responses to different irrigation strategies is laborious costly and may not be affordable considering such limitations dynamic crop growth modeling is a convenient tool for studying and developing irrigation strategies ahmadi et al 2015 andarzian et al 2011 pereira et al 2009 to meet this demand the aquacrop model which is developed by the food and agriculture organization fao was chosen to be utilized it is user friendly practitioner oriented and requires a relatively small number of explicit and mostly intuitive parameters and input variables requiring a simple method for their determination bird et al 2016 the aquacrop model has been extensively tested in different regions of the world on different crops ahmadi et al 2015 so far the aquacrop model has not been used for crop growth modeling under rotational and on demand water delivery systems that convey a kind of irrigation scheduling is such that time and amount of water delivery could be determined savari et al 2016 indeed the rotational and on demand is have not been modeled at large scales in the previous studies therefore the effect of different deficit irrigation levels irrigation planning and rotational and on demand is were assessed on grain yield and water productivity of winter wheat the current study is a concise modeling activity that combines different aspects of water availability water delivery rainfall amount and distribution and sowing dates this study is done for wheat modeling at a plain scale to assess the aquacrop potential in irrigation management and yield prediction for practical goals instead of focusing on plot or small field scale recent studies have emphasized crop modeling by considering the combined effect of irrigation management sowing date and climate change scenarios saddique et al 2020 araya et al 2021 therefore the objectives of this study were to calibrate and validate the aquacrop model using the long term observed winter wheat grain yield in the south west of iran and then apply the validated model for simulating a combination of generated decision making scenarios on irrigation plans climatic conditions and field management including 1 rotational and on demand irrigation scheduling 2 normal wet dry and extremely dry climatic years in terms of rainfall amount and distribution 3 deficit irrigation levels 0 70 reduction of full irrigation for assessing water scarcity conditions and 4 different sowing dates these scenarios were considered and analyzed for finding the optimal water saving irrigation planning and sowing dates which can serve as a guide for the agricultural decision and policy makers 2 materials and methods in this section the details of the winter wheat growth modeling under different management scenarios are explained fig 1 illustrates a framework of the key modeling steps and activities done in this study towards improved irrigation planning and water productivity 2 1 study area and description the study area was the shushtar plain which is located in the south west of iran khuzestan province with an area of about 2433 km 2 extended between 31 6 and 32 15 northern latitudes and 48 55 and 49 22 eastern longitudes it is surrounded bythe hillsides of the zagros mountains and the dez river fig 2 the average elevation of the shushtar plain is 150 m above mean sea level the climate of this area is warm and semi arid based on the de martoone method and the mean annual rainfall is 342 mm saabet ghadam haghighi and sharifi 2012 the annual average area of winter wheat in the study area is 38 273 ha of with an average annual production of 136 766 t o n n e s between 2000 and 2016 ministry of jihad of agriculture 2020 the shushtar plain plays a prominent role in wheat production and food security in the south west of iran almost 75 of this plain is under surface irrigation supplied from the karun river abbasi et al 2017 albaji and hemadi 2011 irrigation water distribution networks is the rotational system that has low flexibility and managed by the public organization savari et al 2016 border and basin irrigation methods are the main traditional irrigation practices with low application efficiency of 45 abbasi et al 2017 the total water use during the growing season is usually 3500 4500 m 3 ha 1 including rainfall goosheh et al 2018 the growing season is about 150 days with the sowing date of november 22 n d besides depending on the amount and distribution of rainfall the wheat crop is normally irrigated three to six times using 50 100 mm each time lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 climatic data including rainfall maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed for the period of 2000 2016 were obtained from the meteorological organization of khuzestan province fig 3 the reference evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated by the cropwat 8 0 software it uses the penman monteith method to calculate et 0 following the approach of allen et al 1998 fig 3a clay loam is the dominant soil texture in the study area the soil thickness and saturation hydraulic conductivity is considered 1 5 m and 70 mm d a y the volumetric permanent wilting point field capacity and soil water content at saturation are 22 35 and 50 respectively albaji et al 2014 seyed jalali 2016 2 2 aquacrop model description calibration and validation the water driven aquacrop model is originally evolved from the doorenbos and kassam 1979 concept to determine yield response to water eq 1 which led to concept of normalized water productivity mirsafi et al 2016 steduto et al 2009 aquacrop consists of two types of parameters 1 the conservative parameters that are crop specific and generally do not change with time management and location and it is expected that the default values in the aquacrop manual could be used globally montoya et al 2016 hsiao et al 2009 however sometimes it is required to calibrate the conservative parameters for better match of the simulations and the observations table 1 and 2 the non conservative parameters that are locally and management specific that change with time management and location table 2 the non conservative parameters depend on the local conditions and crop phenology these parameters are not calibrated but are generally obtained from local information paredes et al 2015 1 y m y a y m k y e t m e t a e t m where y m and y a are maximum and actual grain yield kg ha 1 et m and et a are maximum and actual evapotranspiration mm and ky is the yield response factor calibration and validation of aquacrop are the basic required steps to increase the accuracy and validity of simulations of the aquacrop for calibration and validation the average wheat grain yield of 10 growing seasons from 2000 to 2001 to 2009 2010 and five growing season from 2010 to 2011 to 2015 2016 were extracted respectively from the database of the jihad agricultural organization of khuzestan province ministry of jihad of agriculture 2020 the calibration and validation procedure was based on trial and error to match the observed and simulated grain yields by calibrating the crop growth parameters tables 1 and 2 the irrigation data and information were obtained from the recommended irrigation planning for winter wheat in the study area lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 table 3 taking into account the effect of rainfall for each year the calibrated model was then used for validation by changing the meteorological information and modifying the irrigation file by considering rainfall distribution and its application to irrigation requirements for five growing seasons from 2010 to 2011 to 2015 2016 except for 2011 2012 due to lack of data the grain simulations of the calibration and validation are given in table 4 2 2 1 statistical analyses during the calibration and validation the statistical analysis and goodness of fit between observed and simulated grain yields were assessed using the normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ef the coefficient of determination r2

years for the calibration and validation step respectively the interpretation of the indices are explained in table 5 2 3 management scenarios in wheat modeling after calibration and validation the aquacrop was employed to evaluate the effect of diverse management scenarios on wheat grain yield and water productivity 2 3 1 deficit irrigation scenarios deficit irrigation is a practical strategy for applying less irrigation in different growth stages compared to the full irrigation allen et al 1998 in order to generate deficit irrigation scenarios it was necessary to consider a wide range and combination of irrigation events times and amounts thus the deficit irrigation scenarios were considered as reducing 10 20 25 30 40 50 60 and 70 of the full irrigation and were combined with different number of irrigation events during the growing season 1 2 3 4 5 6 times in scenario setting the amount of irrigation amount in each irrigation event could vary between 20 mm as the lower limit and 100 mm as the upper limit which makes the scenarios more real and practical for decision makers and beneficiaries due to the limitations of irrigation water distribution networks lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 it is also notable that in setting the scenarios deficit irrigation was considered in the main wheat growth stages based on days after sowing das except in the first irrigation that is essential for full germination and crop establishment table 3 2 3 2 irrigation scheduling scenarios on demand and rotational water delivery systems are indeed two principal types of irrigation scheduling is methods anwar and haq 2016 savari et al 2016 on demand is implies delivering water to farmers based on their request time flow rate and duration of water delivery in the rotational is the flow rate irrigation frequency and duration of water delivery are all fixed for the entire growing season thus in this study all the deficit irrigation scenarios were generated and modeled under both rotational and on demand is for simulating the current irrigation network operation fixed delivery time and a constant amount of water in each growth stage and the possible future conditions with some flexibilities on irrigation amount between different stages based on upgrading the current irrigation water delivery networks for both rotational and on demand is the irrigation requirement is considered based on the recommended irrigation plan for the region that is 450 mm for winter wheat lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 however the irrigation time and amount were different so that the recommended irrigation planning of lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 was used for the on demand is and the irrigation planning suggested by andarzian et al 2011 was used for the rotational is the effect of rainfall amount and distribution climatic scenarios on irrigation requirement was considered for both rotational and on demand is table 3 this approach not only may improve the rotational and on demand is but may also help decision makers to decide if irrigation water distribution networks need to be upgraded from rotational to on demand systems 2 3 3 climatology crop modeling and scenario setting without considering different climatic conditions would reduce the reliability of the simulations therefore irrigation scenarios are combined with climatic conditions for this aim long term annual rainfall data from 1980 to 2016 of the study area were obtained from the khuzestan meteorological organization then the probability of exceedance for dry 80 normal 50 and wet 20 annual rainfall was simulated by the rainbow software v 2 2 raes et al 2006 results of the software showed that the rainfall amount for dry normal and wet years were 154 mm between 154 mm and 291 mm average 222 mm and 291 mm respectively these annual rainfall amounts were converted to the monthly amounts according to the long term rainfall distribution from 1980 to 2016 fig 3a the extremely dry year with null rainfall 0 mm is also considered as a probable future extreme climate only for the on demand is due to its flexibility in providing requested irrigation water in different conditions and growing stages that is almost impossible in the rotational systems 2 3 4 sowing date scenarios changing the growing period and finding optimal sowing dates is a practical field management strategy for improving grain yield and water productivity under the current and future climatic conditions therefore for obtaining the optimal sowing window in the study area the current sowing date that is november 22nd lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 has been tested against early and late sowing date alternatives however an initial trial and error showed that the current sowing date is at the end tail of a possible sowing window which means sowing later than the current suggested date has a negative impact on grain yield biomass and water productivity data not shown furthermore the beginning of this window was about two weeks earlier than the current date meaning that sowing earlier than november 8th also has a negative impact on crop production considering this issue late sowing alternative has not been considered in the scenario setting therefore the optimal scenarios of each deficit irrigation management under different climatic years were evaluated on daily time scales compared with the current condition for the sowing window of november 8th and 22nd 2 4 evaluation of management scenarios in total 3000 generated scenarios were defined and simulated by aquacrop in addition to grain yield other indices such as water productivity water use efficiency wue and transpiration efficiency were considered and calculated to assess the generated scenarios water productivity wp is often used to define the relationship between the crop produced and the amount of water involved in crop production as eq 6 6 w p g y i p where gy is the wheat grain yield kg i is the applied irrigation water m 3 and p is rainfall during the growing season m 3 in a crop production system wue is used to define the relationship between crop production and the amount of water used in crop production in terms of evapotranspiration in this study wue refers to the ratio between the grain yield gy k g and cumulative actual crop evapotranspiration during the growing season eta m 3 eq 7 7 w u e g y et a the concept of transpiration efficiency te is similar to wue except that the eta is replaced by transpiration t m 3 as eq 8 the te includes the beneficial part of the water used in crop production while excludes the non beneficial part that does not contribute to grain yield production 8 t e g y t 2 5 water stress assessment 2 5 1 sensitivity coefficient Œª jensen 1968 described a yield production function that relates imposed water stress to yield as follows 9 y a y m i 1 n e t a e t m i Œª i where y a is the actual observed crop yield y m is the maximum crop yield when soil water is not limiting e t a is the actual crop evapotranspiration e t m is the maximum crop evapotranspiration when soil water is not limiting y m and e t m are considered based on the best full irrigation plan with highest yield production i is the considered crop growing stage Œª i is the sensitivity coefficient of crop to water stress during the growth stage i unitless n is the number of growth stages a greater Œª represents more sensitivity to water stress the equation accounts for the sensitivity of the crop to different growing stages the values of Œªi were was estimated through generalized reduced gradient grg nonlinear regression method using the microsoft excel solver for different optimal irrigation plans to reveal the sensitivity of each growth stage for applying deficit irrigation table 3 in this approach the optimal irrigation plans that resulted in the highest grain yield and water productivity as the optimum criteria were identified table 6 the best fitted Œª i values were obtained by minimizing the summation of the square of the deviation eq 10 mohan 1997 10 ssd y a y m observed y a y m fitted 2 it is noteworthy that for estimating Œª i it is required to happen remarkable differences between the generated scenarios in each growing stage which is just probable in the on demand is due to its flexibility and variability between growth stages in terms of different applied irrigation water table 3 however for the scenarios that were generated under the rotational is there was a low flexibility and variability between growth stages in terms of different applied irrigation water table 3 to derive the Œª i to handle this issue the yield response factor was also used stewart et al 1977 2 5 2 yield response factor ky doorenbos and kassam 1979 analyzed the results of several studies on the et yield relationship and introduced the yield response factor k y and suggested a linear yield production function as eq 11 stewart et al 1977 11 1 y a y m k y 1 e t a e t m where 1 y a y m is the crop yield decline and 1 e t a e t m is the evapotranspiration deficit higher k y implies more sensitivity to water deficit if ky 1 it means that the yield decline is proportionally less with the decrease in water deficit if ky 1 it shows that the yield decline is proportionally greater with the decrease in water deficit 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of aquacrop the simulated wheat grain yields showed a very good agreement with observed wheat grain yields in the calibration stage table 4 following the suggested interpretation of evaluation criteria by raes et al 2015 table 5 the simulated wheat grain yield varied from nearly 3300 k g h a 1 to 4400 k g h a 1 while the observed grain yield varied from nearly 3100 k g h a 1 to 4600 k g h a 1 during the growing seasons of 2000 2001 and 2009 2010 the low nrmse of 5 shows that calibration has been very good and model has been calibrated well table 5 in the validation stage the simulated wheat grain yield varied from 2900 k g h a 1 to 4400 kg h a 1 while the observed grain yield varied from 2600 kg h a 1 to 4800 kg h a 1 for the 2010 2011 to 2015 2016 growing seasons the nrmse in the validation stage was 6 which is good therefore the aquacrop model could predict grain yield of winter wheat accurately at large scale and the evaluation criteria were also in the reported range of the previous studies zhang et al 2013 jin et al 2014 iqbal et al 2014 the relatively big differences in the observed wheat grain yield during the 2000 2001 until 2015 2016 growing seasons are partly justified by the variability of climate but much of the discrepancies are due to the instability of irrigation and farm management conditions which are considered constant in calibration and validation stage therefore calibration and validation could be significantly improved by employing wheat cultivation managements in the study area which is partly achievable by implementing the results of this study 3 2 water delivery systems and irrigation scheduling 3 2 1 rotational irrigation scheduling table 6 presents the best optimal irrigation plans for the grain yield and water productivity under different climatic years and deficit irrigation levels under the rotational and on demand is according to table 6 grain yield and water productivity varied from 910 k g h a 1 to 3650 k g h a 1 and 0 37 k g m 3 to 0 9 k g m 3 in dry year for the best irrigation plans under different deficit irrigation levels and the rotational is in addition the grain yield and water productivity varied from 1700 k g h a 1 to 3690 k g h a 1 and 0 59 k g m 3 to 0 82 k g m 3 in normal year and varied from 2300 k g h a 1 to 3680 k g h a 1 and 0 68 k g m 3 to 0 85 k g m 3 in wet year respectively fig 4 illustrates the box plots of the grain yield and water productivity under different deficit irrigation plans and climatic years for the rotational is each box contains all possible irrigation managements by changing the number and time of irrigation events comparing the best irrigation plans solid circles under the deficit irrigation levels show that grain yield is nearly maintained until reaching the mild deficit irrigation level in the dry normal and wet years similar behavior is also observed for the average irrigation plans circle dotted among the different deficit irrigation levels however grain yield loss by increasing the deficit irrigation level is higher in the dry year than the normal year and subsequently in the normal year was higher than the wet year this is probably due to the lower rainfall amount in addition comparing the worst irrigation plans empty circles the grain yield in wet year is higher than normal year and it is higher in normal year than dry year however the variations in grain yield among the deficit irrigation levels show a threshold at the 40 deficit irrigation above which grain yield decreased sharply fig 4 likewise the overall changes in water productivity are also similar to changes in grain yield except that for all irrigation plans water productivity is almost constant up to 40 deficit irrigation and then decreased sharply which could be due to a sharp decline in grain yield production so fig 4 reveals that dry year is more sensitive to deficit irrigation compared to the normal year therefore it is required to implement more efficient irrigation planning in dry year 3 2 2 on demand irrigation scheduling table 6 shows the best optimal irrigation plans for grain yield and water productivity for the on demand is method under the on demand is grain yield and water productivity varied from 440 k g h a 1 to 4220 k g h a 1 and 0 1 kg m 3 to 0 63 k g m 3 in extremely dry year from 680 k g h a 1 to 4150 k g h a 1 and 0 43 kg m 3 to 0 8 k g m 3 in dry year and from 1450 k g h a 1 to 3960 k g h a 1 and 0 43 kg m 3 to 0 8 k g m 3 in normal year and from 1880 kg ha 1 to 3870 k g h a 1 and 0 68 kg m 3 to 0 85 k g m 3 in wet year respectively fig 5 illustrates that under all climatic years the gy and wp linearly decreased with increasing the deficit irrigation levels this is obvious for the best solid circle average circle dotted and worst empty circle irrigation plans under the best irrigation plans the gy and wp declined sharply under the different deficit irrigation levels as climate conditions change from wet to extremely dry year this reveals a higher sensitivity of gy and wp to deficit irrigation in the dryer years however for the worst irrigation plans under the different climatic years the rate of gy and wp declined milder than compared to the best irrigation plans this clearly highlights the necessity of determining the best irrigation plans in dry and extremely dry years compared to normal and wet years overall the deficit irrigation scenarios not only could not remarkably maintain grain yield in any of the rotational and on demand is but also has a negative impact on water productivity and grain yield in on demand is this is an unexpected result and in contrast with the findings of the previous studies yu et al 2020 ali et al 2019 goosheh et al 2018 tari 2016 therefore deficit irrigation does not seem to be a reliable water saving strategy in the study area for winter wheat due to the high sensitivity of grain yield to water stress particularly in the on demand is under the rotational is however it is possible to apply up to 40 deficit irrigation under any of the climatic conditions of wet normal and dry years this is important to know that under drought conditions the rotational is is more efficient and reliable than on demand is for applying deficit irrigation 3 3 optimal sowing window 3 3 1 under rotational irrigation scheduling fig 6 shows the grain yield and biomass percentage changes computed based on the current sowing date november 22nd and the optimal sowing window november 8th 22nd under different deficit irrigation levels and climatic years each box is constructed of 14 data points which indicates the percentage of change of grain yield or biomass production under the optimal irrigation plan table 6 the average percentage change value of grain yield in dry normal and wet years was 8 4 5 7 and 6 3 while the average percentage change of biomass was 1 6 3 6 and 2 8 respectively typically under different climatic years and low deficit irrigation levels changing the sowing date from the current condition to the optimal period has a positive impact on grain yield and biomass however under severe deficit irrigation levels this effect disappears and may even become negative thus for full irrigation and low deficit irrigation levels it is more rational to sow in the optimal period but for severe deficit irrigation levels there is not any considerable difference between the current and optimal sowing window so it is recommended to sow wheat earlier than the current date and up to two weeks in advance 3 3 2 under on demand irrigation scheduling fig 7 is similar to fig 6 except that the results were obtained under the optimal on demand is the average percentage change value of grain yield in extremely dry dry normal and wet years was 8 5 10 26 4 22 and 7 88 while for biomass they were 1 2 4 7 2 3 and 3 5 respectively except in the normal year the impact of changing the sowing date on grain yield is significantly positive under severe deficit irrigation levels the biomass percentage change showed very large variations in extremely dry and dry years under different deficit irrigation levels while the variations become smaller under the normal and wet years this means that the negative impact of changing the sowing date on biomass under severe deficit irrigation levels in the dry and extremely dry years changed to a completely positive impact in normal and wet years fig 7 andarzian et al 2015 determined the optimal sowing window for winter wheat in different wheat production regions of khuzestan province they showed that the optimal sowing window for two regions of ahvaz and izeh was between 5th november to 5th december and 1st november to 15th december respectively these dates were between 5th november to 15th december for behbahan and dezful regions therefore the recommended sowing window in the current study area is likely similar to the other regions of khuzestan province such as ahvaz and izeh 3 4 sensitivity coefficient as explained earlier the coefficients of the sensitivity coefficients of the jensen production function were calculated only for the on demand is table 7 the best and worst irrigation plans with different irrigation frequencies number of irrigation events among all the deficit irrigation levels are considered as the benchmark irrigation plans for estimating the Œª i the Œª i could not be mathematically calculated for the one and two irrigation events scenarios the Œª i values were estimated based on et and t table 7 the Œª i were calculated precisely except in some of the worst irrigation plans due to the similarities of transpiration and evapotranspiration ratios in different deficit irrigation levels overall lower Œª 1 of the first irrigation compared to the subsequent irrigation events could be due to the fact that the amount of applied irrigation amount in the first irrigation has been fixed for the different deficit irrigation levels therefore it was not possible to estimate the sensitivity of the crop to irrigation water under this condition however the Œª i values revealed that irrigation at stem elongation 90 das was the most prominent irrigation event in most climatic conditions and irrigation frequencies which implies that irrigation at stem elongation is critical for grain yield mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 3 5 yield response factor figs 8 and 9 illustrate the fitted stewart equation for grain yield and biomass under different climatic years based on et and t respectively the slopes of the fitted regression lines indicate the k y the et based k y values for grain yield in dry normal and wet years were 1 87 1 80 and 1 56 and for biomass were 1 26 1 16 and 1 04 respectively fig 8 this means that the sensitivity of grain yield and biomass are different under diverse climatic years such that dry year shows higher sensitivity to water stress the difference between the k y values between normal and wet years are higher than the difference between normal and dry year however higher k y values for the grain yield imply that grain production is much affected by the water stress than biomass therefore irrigation managements and scenarios must emphasize on the proper irrigation planning for sustainable grain production in addition the t based k y values for grain yield in dry normal and wet years were 1 19 1 1 and 1 03 and for biomass were 0 81 0 79 and 0 7 respectively fig 9 these values imply two main points the first point is that the k y values of the biomass are 1 that indicate biomass production has lower sensitivity to the t based water stress than grain yield with k y values higher than 1 the second point is that the t based k y values for grain yield and biomass are much lower than the corresponding values of the et based values this is strongly related to the soil evaporation component that has contributed highly under irrigated conditions in the arid and semi arid up to 30 40 ahmadi et al 2019 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 so this implies that proper irrigation managements and scenarios should focus on the beneficiary use of irrigation water transpiration by reducing the non beneficiary component evaporation low frequency irrigations and implementing subsurface drip irrigation would be highly effective in reducing soil evaporation in the study area 3 6 water productivity and water use efficiency figs 10 and 11 illustrate the relation of wp with wue and te for all of the generated irrigation scenarios under rotational is and on demand is respectively irrigation scenarios in wet year have higher wp and wue than normal and dry years in both on demand is and rotational is although the relation between wp and wue is linear the wp has a quadratic relation with te this shows that wue increases proportionally with wp but the highest te could be achieved at certain wp values thus transpiration efficiency seems to be a more reliable parameter for determining an optimum amount of water productivity since transpiration efficiency reaches a maximum point and decreases with further increase in water productivity while this maximum point could not be calculated for water use efficiency as a result the highest te under dry normal and wet conditions would occur at wp values of 0 92 k g m 3 0 98 k g m 3 and 1 07 k g m 3 in the rotational is these values were 0 67 k g m 3 0 69 k g m 3 and 0 85 k g m 3 for the dry normal and wet years under on demand is therefore wp values beyond these optimum values may not sustainably increase transpiration efficiency it indicates that increasing wp beyond the optimum values may contribute to higher evaporation rates that do not increase transpiration necessarily furthermore comparing the optimum wp values in the rotational is and on demand is indicates that on demand is may lead to higher achievable te at lower optimum wp values this might be an indication of higher flexibility of on demand irrigation delivery method to attain higher te indeed lower optimum wp in the on demand is compared to rotational is shows that water could be utilized more efficiently in the rotational is by wheat crops through improved transpiration and reduced evaporation this finding has been also recently approved and argued by liu and song 2020 and xu et al 2018 who reported that on demand is is a necessary irrigation scheduling to reduce water loss and improve crop water consumption it is also noteworthy that the calculated water productivity and water use efficiency values of the best irrigation scenarios table 6 under both rotational is figs 4 and 10 and on demand is figs 5 and 11 are comparable with the previous studies conducted on winter wheat in khuzestan province and iran respectively which are estimated between 0 8 and 1 1 k g m 3 nakhjavani moghadam et al 2016 in a recent study in the khuzestan province goosheh et al 2018 water productivity values for the optimal irrigation scenarios were estimated between 0 85 k g m 3 and 1 3 k g m 3 water use efficiency of winter wheat in ahvaz khuzestan was also estimated between 1 4 k g m 3 and 1 7 k g m 3 by andarzian et al 2011 lower wp and wue in our study are likely due to the larger spatial scale of the study which resulted in uncertainties of grain yield at the calibration and validation stage that could subsequently affect the amount of wp and wue of the generated scenarios in comparison to site scale studies of andarzian et al 2011 in addition the large differences in the observed grain yield at the current sowing date table 4 are also contributed to this grain yield underestimation therefore it seems that revising the suggested wheat water requirement lotfali ayeneh et al 2007 that is widely used in other researches is necessary for achieving higher and potential winter wheat grain yield wp and wue in the study area 3 7 evapotranspiration and transpiration fraction fig 12 shows the relationship between the cumulative et of growing season and the ratio of t e t for the different climatic years under rotational is and on demand is fig 12 is illustrated for the optimal irrigation plan of each deficit irrigation in rotational is the range of variation of et in the dry year is greater than normal year which is also followed by wet year obviously at any certain et values the t et is highest in the dry year followed by normal and wet years this shows that crop transpiration has the highest values in dry years furthermore fig 12 shows that under rotational is in dry year the t constitutes ca 52 and 75 of the total et at the highest and lowest levels of deficit irrigation respectively however it is apparent that t has lower fractions of the total et in the normal and wet years compared to the dry year fig 12 this implies that irrigation water has been utilized more beneficially in the dry years moreover rotational is resulted in the lowest soil evaporation in the extremely dry and dry years for each optimal irrigation plan of each deficit irrigation on demand is however showed different fractions of t under the climatic years compared to the rotational is although the fraction of t i e t et in the normal and wet year varied almost in a range similar to what occurred in the rotational is this fraction varied considerably in the dry year and t varied ca 35 to 80 at the highest and lowest levels of deficit irrigation respectively moreover the range of et and t et variations are is greater in dry and extremely dry years in other words severe deficit irrigation levels would induce higher soil evaporation lower transpiration under on demand is compared to the rotational is but this pattern changes and on demand is would be the recommended water delivery system in dry year subject to low deficit irrigation levels due to a higher fraction of t compared to the rotational is fig 12 this shows that on demand is is not recommended under dry conditions if high water stress levels are probable therefore on demand is seems to be a more suitable water delivery method for applying low deficit irrigation levels while rotational is is better suited for severe deficit irrigation levels under different climatic years 3 8 soil water deficit fig 13 shows the relationship between cumulative soil water deficit during the growing season and relative grain yield for different climatic years under rotational is and on demand is the optimal irrigation plan for each deficit irrigation level was chosen high amounts of soil water deficit are due to the fact that simulated root depth at the end of the growing season 0 70 m is considered for calculations of root zone soil water balance this approach guarantees comparing different deficit irrigation scenarios more logical and accurate because the dynamic of root growth during growing season varies in different irrigation scenarios induced by soil water content results showed that the range of soil water deficit and relative grain yield variation in the on demand is is higher than rotational is this highlighted that at low deficit irrigation levels i e relative grain yield close to 1 both rotational is and on demand is are almost similar but in severe deficit irrigation levels rotational is is likely better than on demand due to higher soil water deficit in the on demand is for both rotational is and on demand is it does not seem to exist a straightforward approach to find a unique relation between different climate years however due to a sharp decline in relative grain yields it could be concluded that on demand is seems to be more sensitive to soil water deficit in wet year while the rotational is is more sensitive to soil water deficit in dry year 4 limitations of the study and future improvements in this study aquacrop model was calibrated and validated based on grain yield while the biomass and soil water content were not available for the individual farms of the study region in addition soil characteristics were assumed to be constant in this case study due to lack of data however it is noteworthy that this study clearly reveals that it is possible to upscale the application of aquacrop from plot scale to large scales for irrigation management and crop yield prediction aquacrop model is basically oriented towards farm scale modeling ahmadi et al 2015 but is a highly versatile tool that has the great potential to be coupled with hydrodynamic models such as icss manz and schaalje 1992 and sobek afrasiabikia et al 2017 which are able to simulate and assess irrigation networks such coupling of models integrates irrigation networks and farms which gives more credibility to the results of modeling irrigation scheduling particularly for modeling scenarios that are influenced by irrigation network managing such as rotational is and on demand is although on demand is is more flexible for engineers practitioners and farmers it may imply a significant expenditure in energy and other infrastructures d√≠az et al 2009 moreno et al 2010 in addition on demand irrigation water delivery networks cannot result in efficient water use if farmers do not perform adequate plans especially when they need the help of the irrigation advisory services ortega et al 2005 theoretically based on previous studies sarwar et al 2001 sarwar and perry 2002 on demand is gave the highest yields per hectare lowest water demand to meet full crop demand and lowest deep percolation therefore the modernization of irrigation networks toward making them more flexible with high accessibility to demanded water for consumers even without considering the extra expenditures does not seem to be a reliable solution to increase grain yield and water productivity more reliable assessment of these two irrigation scheduling methods could be achievable by integrated modeling of irrigation water delivery networks and farm simultaneously the water saving scenarios in this study could be evaluated in future climatic conditions for improved adaptation to local conditions and likely climate change performance assessment indicators of the irrigation scheduling were relatively simple in future studies irrigation scheduling could be assessed and optimized by utilizing an economic indicator 5 conclusion in this study aquacrop was calibrated and validated at a large scale based on the observed grain yield of winter wheat in a warm and semi arid area in the south west of iran the model was run under rotational and on demand irrigation scheduling deficit irrigation scenarios from no water stress up to 70 reduction in applied water compared to the full irrigation and different climatic years including dry normal and wet conditions the model was also run to determine the best sowing window considering the best irrigation plans and crop sensitivity to water stress stem elongation irrigation 90 days after sowing was the most important irrigation event in almost all circumstances in determining optimal sowing date it was concluded that late sowing dates had a negative effect on grain yield and water productivity for both rotational is and on demand is however sowing up to two weeks earlier than the current sowing date would considerably improve grain yield and water productivity this positive effect can be hopeful for future studies to optimize and adapt the sowing date with climate change considering and comparing grain yield water productivity and water use efficiency between rotational is and on demand is it is concluded that in most scenarios rotational is is the recommended water delivery system and irrigation scheduling in the study area therefore this study showed that maintaining wheat grain yield highly depends on sufficient irrigation but it is possible to manage applied irrigation water through appropriate irrigation planning and deficit irrigation levels in the region under diverse climatic conditions and rainfall distribution in rotational is since on demand irrigation scheduling may impose expenditure in energy and other infrastructures and was not remarkably better than rotational is in applying different deficit irrigation levels its cost justification regarding higher grain yield needs further investigation 6 credit author statement seyed hamid ahmadi conceptualized the research idea objectives and

4541,submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been shown to potentially be a more important source of solutes to the global ocean than river flow as a result the accuracy of predictions of the magnitude and seasonal variability of sgd to the sea is critical for the management of coastal marine ecosystems for a model site kinvarra bay ireland dominated by point source sgd inputs we show that the difference between estimates provided by different marine tracer based methods can be large depending on the way water residence time within the system and water exchange across its boundaries are described for example results from tidal prism and freshwater fraction models the most widely used approaches to quantify freshwater fluxes into marine areas of restricted exchange vary by one order of magnitude depending on the way the water exchange across the outer system boundaries is considered and whether lagrangian or eulerian data is used we show that sgd estimates based on single point time series eulerian outside of a retention area can lead to consistently lower estimates than when using transect data langrangian moreover the outcome of radon 222rn based sgd estimates is dependent on the way the effect of water age variability on radon decay and degassing is accounted for we provide a solution to this conceptual problem by developing a correction to 222rn budgetary approaches to estimate sgd based on the spatial variation of water ages estimated from radium isotopes 223ra 224ra in solution we use new data to compare the different sets of approaches while examining the validity of their underlying assumptions to verify internal consistency and use the substantial range of published data on kinvarra bay to assess the quality of results produced with the new method keywords submarine groundwater discharge karst radon radium modelling salinity ireland 1 introduction increasing evidence shows that submarine groundwater discharge sgd defined as the flow of water from the seabed to the coastal ocean regardless of fluid composition or driving force burnett et al 2003 is a larger source of dissolved chemicals to the ocean than river water kwon et al 2014 moore et al 2008 rodellas et al 2015 hence accurate sgd rates are necessary to validate marine biogeochemical budgets of ecosystem sensitive elements such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus taniguchi et al 2019 reviews the array of methods to quantify sgd in use to date seepage meters lee 1977 measure total sgd fluxes over small areas typically 0 25 1 m2 e g leote et al 2008 salt or catchment based water budgets help estimate fresh groundwater flows over larger coastline lengths radioactive tracers of sgd such as radium kwon et al 2014 moore et al 2008 rodellas et al 2015 or radon burnett and dulaiova 2003 have been increasingly employed to estimate total sgd fresh groundwater plus recirculated seawater at regional scales burnett et al 2008 2001 dulaiova et al 2010 rocha et al 2016 sadat noori et al 2015 finally hydrogeological models can be used to predict fresh and occasionally saline sgd rates but require calibration making direct or tracer based quantification of sgd essential for validation yet quantifying sgd remains challenging because of its spatial and temporal variability tracer budgets while time consuming integrate a measure of temporal variability producing snapshots of discharge for entire coastal systems but to measure annual or multiannual sgd its temporal variability intra and inter annual has to be evaluated however flow rates derived from tracer budget methods are sensitive to the sampling strategy how whole system tracer inventories are obtained and to the mathematical simplifications that allow closure of mass balances combined these sensitivities lead to large disparities in sgd magnitude estimates even when the same tracer data are used for example water exchange between coastal systems and the open ocean can be quantified in multiple ways with different results e g dyer and taylor 1973 gordon et al 1996 ketchum 1951 luketina 1998 sanford et al 1992 hydrodynamics driven by winds tides and watershed inputs makes mixing within coastal systems spatially variable so rather than a homogeneous volume they comprise a distribution of water masses with distinct biogeochemical histories the water age defined as the time since a water parcel was separated from a solute source and its distribution is therefore essential to develop accurate non conservative elemental budgets in areas of restricted exchange monsen et al 2002 the most sensitive tracers of sgd in seawater 222rn 223ra and 224ra are non conservative elements by definition and consequently their use in sgd budgets requires knowledge of the spatial variability in water ages in the studied system and this is most often lacking we show how these factors affect sgd estimates and develop potential ways to overcome bias using kinvarra bay a groundwater dependant coastal system as a testbed groundwater surface water interactions in kinvarra have been intensively studied since the 90 s cave and henry 2011 drew 2003 2008 drew and daly 1993 einsiedl 2012 gregory et al 2020 mccormack et al 2016 2014 morrissey et al 2020 petrunic et al 2012 rocha et al 2016 schubert et al 2015 smith and cave 2012 seepage meters are impractical there because of its karstic shoreline which hosts multiple points of focused discharge thus sgd studies to date estimated groundwater inputs using tidal prism and freshwater fraction models or whole system salt budgets e g inter alia cave and henry 2011 mccormack et al 2014 occasionally combined with radiotracer methods rocha et al 2015 however very few studies rocha et al 2015 schubert et al 2015 combined radiotracer budgets with independent approaches to evaluate internal consistency of sgd quantification and the majority of tracer data available for the system was collected during low flow periods spring summer catchment based approaches including karst flow models mccormack et al 2014 morrissey et al 2020 have been developed beside tracer based studies on the seaward side but their accuracy is dependent on discharge measurements for calibration while estimates of sgd into kinvarra have been available since 1993 drew and daly 1993 they differ sometimes considerably with assessments varying from 104 m3 d 1 during summer rocha et al 2015 to 106 107 m3 d 1 for annual projections cave and henry 2011 most studies were carried out independently but all provide figures that cover only short periods of time and sgd is subject to tidal seasonal and interannual variability nevertheless hydrogeological models which aim to integrate discharge estimates over timescales beyond short term snapshot assessments require reliable quantification of sgd flow rates at matching timescales to ensure calibration and confidently offer predictive capability understanding the cause of discrepancy of sgd fluxes between different studies will ensure derivation of reliable annual water carbon or nutrient balances for the system here we revisit past estimates of sgd for kinvarra bay conduct new radiotracer rn ra surveys close mass balances under a range of different assumptions and compare the results with those provided by hydrogeological models mccormack et al 2016 our study aims to explain the difference between sgd estimates across different hydrological seasons and years to this end we first review the methods used to determine sgd into coastal areas from karst aquifers we test the assumptions underpinning these methods using data collected in successive surveys of salinity 222rn 224ra and 223ra and ancillary environmental monitoring data available for different groundwater level conditions we then compare the results of disparate sgd flow estimates resulting from different tidal prism and hydrogeological models radon and water mass balances using the groundwater head in the nearby karst aquifer as an indicator of the hydraulic gradient driving the flow 1 1 site description kinvarra bay in the west coast of ireland is fed by a major karst network fig 1 the bay hosts significant mussel

influx of pollution that was transferred into the bay as sewage up to may 2017 when a wastewater treatment plant entered service groundwater inputs 5 30 m3 s 1 as per drew 2008 originate mainly from two springs located in the upper part of the bay kinvarra east arch and kinvarra west castle these drain a catchment of 483 km2 in which the lower basin is well developed limestone karst that is partly fed by river water draining an upper sandstone basin clare and mcnamara 2009 fig 1 the kinvarra east spring is not perennial and is thought to drain shallower karst conduits in contrast kinvarra west is perennial and thus thought to drain a deeper karst network cave and henry 2011 despite the distinct flow paths these two springs are connected drew 2003 karst connections fig 1 during

range of different methods cave and henry 2011 drew 2008 mccormack et al 2014 rocha et al 2015 schubert et al 2015 were reviewed groundwater flow into kinvarra was then determined from the results of four bespoke sampling surveys that evaluated the reproducibility of sgd rates estimated with different approaches in order to compare these with prior sgd estimates all individual rates were referenced to the regional groundwater level at killiny borehole epa 2020 this choice was supported by 1 tracer experiments drew 2003 and cave exploration boycott et al 2003 show the killiny borehole is 1 km away from a network of conduits connected to kinvarra springs fig 1 and 2 sgd estimated using salinity cave and henry 2011 rocha et al 2015 radon rocha et al 2015 and hydrogeological modelling of the karst network mccormack et al 2014 were correlated with groundwater level at killiny e g figs 2 and 3 to compare our results with the output of the model of mccormack et al 2014 we sought an empirical relationship between their results fig 2b and the groundwater level at the time of their study fig 2a we evaluated two alternative scenarios a linear dependence on groundwater head derived from darcy s law q 1 6h fig 2b and an adaptation of the torricelli formula a derivation of bernoulli law q 1 1 2 g h t 1 in fig 2b to derive flow rates from the net groundwater level h t discharge depends linearly on hydraulic head only if the groundwater flow is laminar bear 1979 and the karst is constrained within a relatively homogenous layer of limestone of constant cross sectional area the modified torricelli relationship was shown to give good results for karst aquifers by maramathas and boudouvis 2010 the equation describes the karst system as a reservoir filled with porous material with fractal properties and does not require prior assumptions on the reynolds number the introduction of a correction factor to account for head losses by friction within the aquifer 1 improved the fit the two relationships produced a relatively narrow range of annual variability for the daily averaged flow fig 2b so we use the first as a benchmark for comparison with other estimates of daily averaged groundwater flow to obtain the total flow through kinvarra springs west and east we note that 2 m3 s 1 the flow value cited in mccormack et al 2014 for kinvarra east needs to be added to kinvarra west flow values 2 2 fieldwork strategy variability of flow at kinvarra springs is driven by groundwater level dynamics fig 2 thus four surveys were planned to a cover the local range of groundwater level oscillation 2 m 12 14 july 2018 4 m 20 23 october 2018 7 2 m 25 28 january 2019 9 4 m 06 08 april 2019 and b collect tracer data within the bay during spring tides to ensure maximal tidal mixing each survey sampled water along the longitudinal axis of the bay by boat except october 2018 when samples were taken from land for the determination of salinity 222rn 224ra and 223ra and included the acquisition of 24 h time series of salinity and radon activity at selected locations every 3 h at least our objective was to characterize both spatial and temporal variability of bay water composition for each sampling period while limiting any possible bias due to non homogenous flushing of the system by tidal mixing water samples were collected with a niskin bottle from 0 5 to 1 m depth and stored in sealed 250 ml glass bottles for radon analysis rn in water was determined with a rad7 monitor durridge 2015 using the wat250 protocol with corrections for the time elapsed between sampling and measurement salinity was measured with an aquaread aquaprobe calibrated according to standard manufacturer protocol aquaread 2013 results were independently verified with a carl stuart limited cond197 i wtw electrical conductivity probe water column activities of 224ra and 223ra were determined after pre concentration of natural radium levels moore 1976 achieved by pumping a large water volume 60 100 l at a low flow rate 1 l min 1 through mno2 coated fibre cartridges moore and arnold 1996 after rinsing with ra free water and drying to a water mn fibre ratio of 0 4 1 1 by weight sun and torgersen 1998 224ra and 223ra activities were measured by radium decay coincidence counter radecc moore and arnold 1996 at least three separate measurements were taken from each sample immediately after collection 7 10 days after the first measurement to improve the 223ra estimate and after 25 days to correct for 228th supported 224ra levels moore 2007 the 227ac supported activity for 223ra determined after 80 days for selected samples fell within the uncertainty of 223ra quantitation depth was measured at each sampling location using a handheld sonar hawkeye digital when water was sampled from land the representative depth was estimated from the mean depth of the local bathymetric cross section derived from the 30 m infomar dtm infomar gsi 2019 considering the tidal height at the moment of collection 2 3 determination of water ages monsen et al 2002 highlight the fact that in reality bays and estuaries are not flushed homogeneously and are rarely fully mixed horizontally as a result a water sample taken at any time within such a system includes freshwater with different travel times to the sampling location this has important consequences for the closure of biogeochemical budgets of non conservative elements such as radon or short lived radium isotopes following zimmerman 1988 monsen et al 2002 use water age defined as the time a water parcel has spent since entering the estuary through one of the boundaries to describe this travel time we determined water ages in kinvarra using the solute 224ra 223ra activity ratios corrected for supported activity following moore 2000 1 a l n 224 r a 223 r a i l n 224 r a 223 r a obs Œª 224 Œª 223 where a is the mean age of water in days at any location in the bay relative to a reference point or mixing end member 224 r a 223 r a obs is the observed 224ra 223ra activity ratio ar at the sampling location 224 r a 223 r a i is the 224ra 223ra activity quotient at the radium source here kinvarra springs and Œª223 and Œª224 are the decay constants of 223ra 0 0608 day 1 and 224ra 0 189 day 1 respectively this approach assumes that the radium activity ratios of the freshwater end member are constant during the survey period and no significant inputs of new radium to the system occur within the water age profile moore 2000 2 4 calculating tracer inventories from transect data estimating sgd or fresh water inputs into a basin of restricted exchange usually involves calculating the inventory of a tracer element within the system luketina 1998 taniguchi et al 2019 the method chosen to determine the inventory is crucial because it strongly affects the result of mass balances based on measurements of the tracer for example the average of tracer concentrations at different sampling locations is the simplest path to estimate the tracer inventory in a bay or estuary but this approach is only valid if water depth within the system follows a normal distribution in natural systems the depth distribution of the submerged area does not usually comply with normality e g fig 3 as a result point concentrations or depth distributions of elements in shallow narrow areas will strongly affect averages while only representing a small fraction of the whole volume the concentration mean may thus lead to a non representative inventory methods involving 2d or 3d integration with depth are always preferable we used salinity the most common indicator of fresh and saltwater mixing to assess the effect of the most common approaches to calculate solute inventories when closing coastal mass budgets six ways to calculate the salt inventory were compared using data from our four surveys 1 the average all the sampling point data 2 the median of all sampling point data 3 one dimensional integration over distance 4 two dimensional integration over distance and depth 5 three dimensional integration using interpolated salinity and bathymetric maps of the system and finally 6 quasi three dimensional integration by sample grouping into four areas of known volume box modelling methods 1 and 2 involved salinity measurements obtained for four successive transects for method 3 salinity was plotted as a function of distance from kinvarra spring and the curve functions then integrated over the transect length to yield a depth averaged inventory for method 4 the local inventory was determined by multiplying each salinity value by depth inventories plotted as a function of distance then integrated over the transect length and normalized by the bay s longitudinal cross sectional area to determine the salt content of the system for method 5 the salinity distributions were first interpolated using arcgis to create a raster of 30 m 30 m cells the salinity for each cell then multiplied by the average cell depth at mean tide derived from a 30 m resolution bathymetry raster the results were added then divided by the bay volume to complete a 3d integration of salinity over the volume of the bay finally in method 6 the bay was divided into four different areas boxes and averages of salinity calculated for each each mean was then multiplied by box volume resultant box inventories were added and the total divided by the volume of the bay the results of each distinct tracer inventory estimate were compared with reference to the change in salinity observed during a 24 h period 2 5 salinity based estimates of freshwater inputs salt inventories in coastal systems yield multiple ways to estimate watershed freshwater contributions to the sea because of their relative simplicity the most commonly used are the tidal prism mixing models developed from the seminal paper of ketchum 1951 we tested four different tidal prism models to investigate how the way salinity data is used might affect the resulting estimate of freshwater input the model used in kinvarra bay by cave and henry 2011 derived from the segmented tidal mixing models of dyer and taylor 1973 was compared with three models a b c tidal prism mixing models reviewed in luketina 1998 all of these are only applicable to vertically well mixed systems whether or not they are may be tested according to schultz and simmons 1957 if r qr t p 0 1 where qr is the flow coming to the system the maximum expected for kinvarra is 30 m s 1 following drew 2008 t is the tidal period and p the tidal prism from 1 5 107 m3 for an average tidal cycle to 2 5 107 m3 for highest spring tide then the system can be taken as vertically well mixed for kinvarra r 0 08 for the mean tidal amplitude and r 0 05 for the highest spring tide under high discharge conditions so we accept that the water column is well mixed even for high flow and tidal prism approximations are reasonable to use 2 5 1 tidal prism model a as per luketina 1998 the classic tidal prism model assumes that the volume of seawater vp entering an estuary during flood tide is entirely of ocean salinity so and that it is completely mixed with a corresponding volume of freshwater vr flowing into the system measured over a tidal cycle it further assumes that this quantity of mixed water is completely removed from the estuary upon ebb officer 1976 as a result the dilution of a steady source of freshwater by seawater in a coastal basin depends only on the tidal period and the tidal prism luketina 1998 effects of varying discharge on internal mixing of the system are thus ignored by rearranging eq 3 in luketina 1998 and using qr vr t where vr is the volume of freshwater flowing to the system over one tidal period m3 tidal period 1 qr the fresh water flow rate in m3 d 1 and t the tidal period in days the flow rate of freshwater into an embayment described by this model is given by 2 qr p 1 s s o t with p the tidal prism volume m3 s the salinity of the estuary at high tide kg m 3 assuming a well mixed estuary here either taken from our 24 hour salinity time series or derived from the various inventory calculations explained in 2 2 so the salinity of the ocean kg m 3 taken here at 35 or equal to the marine end member 2 5 2 tidal prism model b as per luketina 1998 model b considers ebb and flood separately to derive a flow rate it assumes that flow between the ocean and the estuary occurs in either direction for equal duration luketina 1998 this will not be true if discharge has a significant effect on water exchange between the embayment and the ocean because the residence time of water in the system is seven days during summer rocha et al 2015 and our surveys showed that it was at least 3 days during other times of the year we accept this as a reasonable first order approximation at the scale of 24 h to illustrate the difference with other estimates by rearranging eq 11 in luketina 1998 we find 3 qr 2 p 1 s so t 1 s so 2 5 3 tidal prism model c as per luketina 1998 model c extends b by considering changes to the duration of ebb and flood flows and variation in the level of flushing through the estuary mouth it accepts changing discharge affects flushing to do so the model includes a return flow factor b to represent the fraction of water that had previously left the bay during ebb returning during flood tide by rearranging eq 26 in luketina 1998 with qrt œÄp 1 we have 4 qr 2 p 1 s so t 1 s so 1 b 1 b the return flow factor can be estimated using eq 4 in sanford et al 1992 5 b 1 vmtt tf p where vmt is the volume of water within the bay at mean sea level t is the tidal period tf the freshwater flushing period and p the mean tidal prism tf can be calculated according to the fraction of freshwater method dyer and taylor 1973 as recommended by alber and sheldon 1999 and used previously by rocha et al 2015 we highlight the effect on discharge estimates arising from inclusion or exclusion of the return flow factor on discharge estimates at kinvarra using b 0 and b 0 86 as the mean determined for summer low discharge conditions by rocha et al 2015 2 5 4 tidal prism model as in cave and henry 2011 cave and henry 2011 used two different equations derived from the tidal prism concept dyer and taylor 1973 ketchum 1951 to determine freshwater discharge to kinvarra bay this adaptation was made originally to assess the variability of freshwater inputs from time series of salinity data collected in the bay it implicitly assumes that high and low water concentrations are represented by the range found within 24 h at a single site and that the entire bay constitutes one well mixed volume if no ebb water returns during flood tide this model yields one order of magnitude higher freshwater inputs than all the other approaches considered here allowing for some return flow yields freshwater input rates in closer agreement with our other estimates we therefore employ eq 2 from cave and henry 2011 to estimate fresh water flows to kinvarra here 6 q s hw s lw max s a l i n i t y o f f l o o d t i d e h hw h lw a b where q is the net volume of fresh water flowing into the system m3 d 1 shw and slw the salinity at high and low tide respectively kg m 3 derived from 24 h data hhw and hlw the tidal height m derived here from galway bay data and ab the mean horizontal surface area of the bay m2 2 6 radon mass balance we estimate sgd from radon measurements in kinvarra in two different ways the first uses the raw uncorrected for water ages radon in water activities to close a rn mass balance for the system considering all the potential sources and sinks these include degassing to the atmosphere radioactive decay water exchange with outer water bodies diffusive sediment water fluxes and total sgd into the system burnett and dulaiova 2003 however water ages in kinvarra bay are spatially variable between 0 at the water source and 8 days at the system boundary with galway bay rocha et al 2015 this is not surprising water ages in estuaries are spatially variable and tend to increase with distance from the main freshwater source monsen et al 2002 as a result a volume of water located further away from the radon source here kinvarra springs will have lost more rn to decay and degassing than water found closer to the springs the system is therefore not well mixed spatially and consequently the effect of degassing fluxes on a given part of the bay will depend both on the age of water and on the wind conditions prevalent during a number of days x prior to the survey where x is the age of water in that portion of the bay with water ages varying between 0 close to the springs and 8 days further out in the bay a putative water sample composed of 100 percent sgd collected at the outer rim of the system even with no loss to the atmosphere during transport by successive tides to its current location will include only a quarter of the radon it originally carried half life of radon is 3 days in reality the additional effect of degassing occurring during that period will result in much lower radon activities at the outlet to galway bay calculating radon inventories for the system without correcting for water ageing is likely to result in a large underestimate of the rn inventory and consequently of the total sgd fluxes into the system here we test an amendment of the often employed classical steady state whole system radon mass balance approach to solve this conceptual problem in this new approach we correct individual radon activities for the degassing and decay occurring from the moment it left contact with the bedrock source before closing radon mass balances for the system 2 6 1 radon mass balance 1 no spatial variability of water ages for the first approach if all inputs and outputs of radon are balanced over the flushing time of the system i e steady state we have all terms in bq m 2 d 1 7 rn dif rn dg rn dy rn net rn adv 0 where rndif the diffusive radon flux across the sediment water interface taken from rocha et al 2015 rndg the radon degassing flux i e atmospheric evasion estimated from wind speed

exchange fluxes across the mouth of the bay estimated from the slope of the radon vs salinity curve as described by eq 3 in officer 1979 and rnadv the advective radon flux associated with groundwater discharge unknown here we use the equation of officer 1979 conservatively because rnnet estimates extracted from 24 h tidal cycles are overly dependent on each individual tidal cycle and could lead to high uncertainty over periods scaled to the residence time of water in the system taken as the oldest age measured within with this in mind and following from eq 7 qsgd the total sgd flux into the bay

accounting for ageing of water we improve on the previous mass balance by correcting radon activity data for the effect of degassing and decay as water ages toward the sea to correct rn in water

macintyre et al 1995 and turner et al 1996 for the period corresponding to the age of the water parcel preceding the measurement 3 results 3 1 review of methods to estimate sgd in a karst environment most of the methods tested here yield flow rates that covary with groundwater level on land fig 4 however exceptions exist e g j m in fig 4 and all methods yield different sgd flow rate magnitudes this is the case even when different methods employ the same salinity full triangles fig 4h i j f or radon dataset full squares fig 4m n we classify water balances and sgd estimates based on hydrogeological models as catchment based approaches table 1 the resulting sgd rates are inter comparable for this system because surface runoff is a minor component of the water balance in kinvarra the only exception is when groundwater level is at its highest at which time surface drainage may represent a larger fraction of the freshwater input into the bay coxon and drew 2000 during summer rocha et al 2015 found the ratio between total freshwater fluxes and sgd varied between 1 3 0 4 and 0 65 0 19 the catchment based approaches reviewed here yield a relatively similar range of groundwater flows fig 4b k this consistency suggests that the range of sgd rates derived from these methods is reproduceable if the catchment limits are accurate and spatial resolution of net rainfall estimates are sufficient to represent the actual rainfall distribution in the models tidal prism models fig 4c to j assume that the bay is well mixed vertically assumption 6 table 1 in addition radon fig 4m n and radium mass balances require accurate identification of their main source into the system both in location and magnitude assumption 12 table 1 since all methods using the same tracer of freshwater inflow here salinity or radon require these assumptions to be met the differences observed between sgd estimates obtained using these tracers cannot be caused by a difference in underlying methodological assumptions so these are not analysed further here other pre requisites to estimate sgd flow rates are three fold 1 inventories of the tracer of choice are calculated in a manner that is physically representative of the system assumption 5 in table 1 2 exchange of water across the outer boundary of the system is calculated in a realistic fashion assumption 7 11 table 1 and 3 mass balances based on radioactive tracers which are non conservative within the time scale of water retention within the system e g 222rn 223ra 224ra have to account for the effect of ageing water assumptions 13 15 in table 1 we show next how choices made within this assumption framework explain the differences shown in fig 4 3 2 how tracer inventories are calculated affects sgd estimates tracer based methods to determine freshwater or sgd flow into a coastal system depend on mass inventories assumption 5 in table 1 however in systems that are not fully mixed the spatial variability of any given solute is often much larger than the measurement uncertainty the way point measurements throughout these systems are used to estimate the total inventory of a given solute at any given time is a key aspect of biogeochemical budgets table 2 illustrates the results of the comparison between six methods of estimating whole system inventories within kinvarra bay using the same salinity dataset methods are ordered by increasing complexity the last column lists the average inventory resulting from each approach and associated standard deviation with salinity observed at high tide for reference a series of insights arise from the results firstly with the exception of summer when freshwater inflow is lower the salinity inventory derived from the mean or median of available data are consistently lower than those resulting from spatial integration of the same data for example the average and median of cross system salinity for the winter 2019 survey are respectively 26 and 15 percent lower than the inventory calculated by 3d integration table 2 an average by definition assumes normal distribution of depths in the system so the true depth distribution is ignored when data are not normally distributed the median is used instead of the mean to describe the central tendency of the dataset the difference between the median salinity and the inventory resulting from 3d integration is less than for that between the latter and the mean table 2 but the median still overestimates the effect of springwater inputs during high discharge surveys by comparison to more sophisticated approaches as shown in fig 1 shallow areas predominate in kinvarra like in many coastal bays contributing to an asymmetric distribution of depths in the system an elemental inventory using measures of central tendency is likely to be disproportionally affected by any solute source located in the shallow portions of the basin compared to methods that either fully or partially consider the actual spatial distribution of depths e g 2d integration or 3d integration we observe this for surveys conducted for all other than low discharge periods secondly even when the uncertainty associated with a given inventory estimate is as low as 0 5 e g inventories of salinity derived from 1d integration table 2 the choice of one method over another by itself leads to much larger uncertainties cf s d all table 2 this likely results from the way the geometry of the bay is considered in the different calculations of inventories while averaging ignores the effect of variance in distance and depth between sampling points on the resulting tracer inventory the 1d integration considers the effect of distance but ignores depth distribution the 2d integration considers the effect of depth and unequal distribution of sampling points along the length of the sampling path and the 3d integration considers the actual changes of distance and depth within the system finally regardless of the method used the high tide salt inventories derived from transect data are consistently lower than the values drawn from 24 h measurement time series table 2 as a result using transect data a lagrangian approach to support sgd quantification is likely to yield consistently larger sgd rates than when a eulerian approach is employed i e using the same budgeting method on data resulting from 24 h time lapse sampling at point locations the observations in fig 4 confirm this for tidal prism model c assuming a return flow factor of b 0 86 the sgd magnitude drawn from a measure of the salinity inventory taken from transect data fig 4g is three to four times higher than that produced by processing a 24 h time series all else being equal fig 4h 3 3 basin mixing is spatially and temporally heterogeneous the salinity and water age profile at high tide fig 5 show that the volume of fresh sgd stored within the bay is highly heterogeneous in space this is accentuated by the low salinity mostly low water age plume in the inner bay in july 2018 when groundwater level was the lowest the plume of water with salinity 10 was constrained to the immediate vicinity of kinvarra springs but in january 2019 when groundwater level was high it covered most of the inner half of the bay fig 5 our first three surveys carried out when groundwater level ranged between 2 m and 7 m showed this low salinity plume extended further out into the bay with increasing groundwater level however when groundwater level was highest 9 7 m this correlation stopped at this point the water ages within the bay were much higher than observed during the other surveys and were more heterogeneous in the outer bay this suggests that the circulation patterns driving water exchange between kinvarra and galway bay are also temporally and spatially variable this will also affect sgd quantification by radon radium or salt mass balances if the internal circulation pattern is assumed equal for all attempts irrespective of season or freshwater discharge how we accept the water moves across outer system boundaries assumptions 7 11 table 1 is particularly important for tidal prism models eqs 2 6 this is not considered in the methods reviewed here tidal prism a and b fig 4i and h or described either by an empiric modification of the tidal prism model fig 4d cave and henry 2011 nor by the introduction of a return flow factor b model c in fig 4g h j it is however possible to reconcile all different estimates of discharge within one order of magnitude difference by considering the mathematical descriptor of the water exchange through the outer system boundary we show this using our 24 h timeseries fig 4f h i j models that seem to perform best toward internal consistency i e results match at least one other method using another tracer consider the return flow into the bay in some manner fig 4f h j when the groundwater level rises above 4 m applying model c with no return flow factor model c with b 0 fig 4h leads to sgd estimates that are consistent with catchment water balances fig 4k modelling fig 4b and rates based on the tidal prism derivation of cave and henry cave and henry 2011 fig 4d e f on the other hand using the same dataset with a return flow factor of b 0 86 leads to lower sgd estimates these are consistent with radon mass balances uncorrected for ageing water model c with b 0 86 fig 4j and close to previous estimates derived from radon and salinity under low groundwater level low flow conditions fig 4l when longitudinal transects are used to determine inventories lagrangian approach and include data collected from the inner part of the bay in the calculations the effects of the inclusion or not of return flow are different in this case b 0 86 in model c leads to high flow estimates model c with b 0 86 transects fig 4g now consistent with the annual catchment water balance fig 4k modelling based on rainfall or groundwater level fig 4b and estimates based on cave derivation of the tidal prism approach fig 4d e f methods to estimate the sgd flow rate based on 24 hour time series eulerian approaches can thus underestimate the effect of retention areas on return flow and thus lead to lower full system return flow factors than those suggested by lagrangian approaches the effect of retention areas on water age distribution throughout the system is visible in fig 5 with most of the bay showing ages older than 3 days if this lack of uniformity in water age is ignored by using 24 h data from a single site similar sgd flow results as those arising from the use of transects for inventories fig 4g might be obtained but with different insights regarding the return flow factor b 0 for model c using 24 h data in fig 4h sgd flow values derived from eulerian surveys thus only account for freshwater in sections of the bay close to the sampling point that are fully mixed and do not necessarily include sgd retained elsewhere for longer periods transect lagrangian data are in that sense less sensitive to this problem fig 4g 3 4 water age profile and budgets of non conservative solutes sgd flow estimates obtained from radon mass balances are strongly affected by the way the heterogeneity of water ages is accounted for eq 8 vs eqs 8 10 fig 4m and n closing radon mass balances without correcting for the ageing of water within the system yields lower sgd rates fig 4m with lower sensitivity to groundwater level fig 4 estimate m accounting for the spatial distribution of water age leads to more realistic results during higher groundwater level periods up by a factor of 4 to 8 on the alternative rn sgd corrected for age variability fig 4n these approximate the fresh sgd estimates obtained by catchment based methods annual water balance model kw fig 4k and b this closure of the gap breaks down however when groundwater head raises above 8 m radon driven sgd estimates corrected for ageing water fig 4m fall to about half of sgd calculated by catchment based approaches fig 4k and b the tidal prism model c with b 0 fig 4h and the cave and henry tidal prism approach fig 4d f 4 discussion our observations illustrate the importance of inspecting the assumptions that support mass balance models used to estimate sgd in coastal systems they also underscore the value of intercomparisons between hydrogeological and oceanographic sgd assessments as highlighted by burnett et al 2001 a cross disciplinary approach allows better understanding of the temporal variability of flushing and the dynamism of elemental inventories in coastal systems due to changes in freshwater discharge in turn this allows the validity of priors to the application of catchment and tracer based approaches to be tested and consequent development of improvements to account for system characteristics our intercomparison identifies a series of critical points that require attention when estimates of sgd rates are sought from tracer mass balances in a surface water basin these are summarized in fig 6 and discussed in detail below 4 1 sampling strategy sgd estimates based on lagrangian sampling transects of a tracer may be consistently higher than when eulerian time series of the same tracer are used in kinvarra bay a choice between lagrangian or eulerian datasets could also yield different values of the return flow factor during spring tide section 3 3 water from kinvarra springs is preferentially retained in upper kinvarra bay for several tidal cycles at least part of the year rocha et al 2015 during these periods it is less likely to be sampled by 24 h tidal cycle measurements in a single location in the outer part of the bay and when this happens sgd is likely underestimated the effect is observed here during spring tide so is likely to be larger during neap tide this is supported by gregory et al 2020 who show that the flushing of the inner bay is minimal during these periods significant spatial variability of water ages is also observed both along and across the length of the bay which may be explained by the fact that exchange with galway bay is not homogenous and rather occurs through an internal gyre as previously observed rocha et al 2015 this gyre when present would accelerate exchange with galway bay and result in the significant addition of older more saline and phytoplankton rich waters to the system this is also consistent with independent findings fig 3 in gregory et al 2020 inclusion of a measure of both spatial and temporal variability of the tracer of choice seems thus necessary to limit the potential bias introduced in mass balance approaches by spatial heterogeneity of residence times long term estimates of sgd based on continuous tracer measurements in a coastal system should thus involve the synchronous determination of tracer concentrations over the area covered by the system to account for differences in water residence time a more frequent application of remote sensing mccaul et al 2016 wilson and rocha 2014 or further development of small low cost sensors to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of any tracer in combination with the methods tested here may be advisable to avoid bias of sgd quantification or other mass balance based approaches such a multi pronged approach would facilitate the determination of system characteristics and limit the mismatch between conceptual assumptions underpinning tracer inventories and the reality on the ground 4 2 development of sgd tracer inventories we show that the choice of method employed to calculate the inventory of a tracer could have a significant effect on the results and hence on the final sgd figure our comparisons highlight the importance of considering the basin geometry and the spatial variations of water age when calculating inventories from transect data in real world aquatic systems since solute inventories are so crucial to coastal oceanography an biogeochemical studies it also seems important to test the effect of ignoring depth frequency distribution before using measures of central tendency or other simplified methods to estimate solute amounts in a water basin a balance has to be found between ease of calculation and representativeness testing different calculation methods as explained here seems to offer a potential way to test for consistency where a sufficient number of data points are available estimating the uncertainty of a given interpolation by kriging may also be promising e g murphy et al 2010 4 3 sgd estimates and spatial variability of water ages spatial variability of water ages has a strong effect on sgd estimates based on non conservative tracer solutes such as radon or short lived radium isotopes indeed as a water parcel is transferred from its source in the watershed to the open ocean time elapses and the effect of internal reactions and mixing within the system on water composition accumulates ignoring the biogeochemical history of the water when estimating sgd based on ra or rn mass balances can lead to large underestimation of degassing and decay losses in systems where large water age inhomogeneities are observed this will result in a large underestimate of sgd fluxes we suggest a method based on ra ages to account for the spatial variability of residence time applicable in systems where the assumptions of the ra age model are valid moore 2000 where they are not an alternative path although at greater cost and time requirements is to develop hydrodynamic models or more simply employ drifters e g pawlowicz et al 2019 to assess the extent of the spatial variability of water ages or residence times in order to produce more accurate mass balances of non conservative elements 4 4 temporal variability of sgd composition and flow rate sgd rate estimates for kinvarra bay correlated with groundwater level with few exceptions this implies that groundwater level is a useful indicator of the potential variability of sgd rate above 8 m of hydraulic head large differences were found between sgd estimates derived from radon mass balances fig 4m and all other methods of assessing sgd i e catchment based fig 4k and b and tidal prism models fig 4d f h this suggests that a larger fraction of groundwater flow into the sea may occur via the surface pathway or in greater contact with the atmosphere as groundwater recharge increases and hydraulic head overcomes the 8 m mark enhancing radon degassing this is consistent with coxon and drew 2000 who found a greater level of groundwater surface water interactions occurred in the area during periods of higher recharge with groundwater fed lakes turloughs expanding in volume and area and localized flooding becoming a problem this view is also supported by our estimates of sgd based on salinity of the bay fig 4c d e f g h these were higher than mc cormack s 2014 model predictions when hydraulic head increased above 4 6 m fig 4b and the difference between model and tracer based sgd rates increased as groundwater level increased the trend implies that surface pathways become more important for freshwater discharge into the bay as groundwater levels increase in the catchment notably this shift can be detected by salt balance approaches but not by radon budgeting since rn degassing will be stimulated by groundwater surface water interaction and water contact with the surface of rn emanating rock will be reduced by increased volumetric storage and augmented groundwater flow rates driving lower residence times within the aquifer matrix maps of potential overland flow during flooding caused by high recharge of the karstic network have been published recently morrissey et al 2020 further supporting our thesis we strongly advocate for caution when conducting radon mass balances during periods of high flow to determine sgd from karst networks into surface water bodies higher flow rates are driven by higher hydraulic heads and imply a larger volume of the karstic network is taken by the groundwater body a larger storage and higher flow rates yield less surface contact between the flowing groundwater and the rn bearing aquifer matrix since the volume surface area ratio increases but also mean that the residence time of water within the aquifer decreases which also diminishes the rn accumulation potential of the groundwater on the other hand because of the nature of karst high flow periods also offer greater opportunity for enhanced groundwater surface water interactions prior to discharge into the sea which increase degassing of rn prior to the dilution of groundwater by seawater 5 conclusion we test the most common methods employed to estimate sgd to coastal areas under different discharge conditions in a real world system evaluating different mathematical assumptions for the calculation of partial flux terms in mass balance expressions our observations show that everything else being equal the choice of method to assess sgd and the sampling strategy employed to collect relevant tracer data has a large impact on the magnitude of ensuing sgd estimates these artifacts created by method choice are in order of importance caused by a how exchange of water between the system and the outer ocean reservoir is described to estimate tidal exchange in mass balances b whether the spatial variability of water ages along the net water flow direction is taken into account when mass balances are closed if non conservative elements are used as tracers of sgd and finally c how representative is the estimated inventory of the tracer solute within the domain of interest making both the sampling strategy and the method employed to arrive at this figure determine how realistic the outcome is given the high spatial heterogeneity of water ages in real world systems including the existence of retention areas that delay flushing of coastal waters toward the ocean we show that the option for either langragian or eulerian tracer data collection significantly impacts ensuing sgd estimates continuous measurements of the concentration of a tracer at a fixed location if the choice of location is away from an area of higher water retention will underestimate sgd to the system and overestimate its flushing rate this is particularly relevant for non conservative tracers and during periods of high discharge when the system tends to be less well mixed spatial awareness of the distribution of the tracer obtained through a langragian sampling approach i e sampling transects for the tracer of choice along the net flow axis is necessary to characterize de spatial variance of tracer concentrations and most importantly the water age profile of the system along its net flow axis the water age profile can be determined using ra isotopes once this is available the effect of physical processes that determine the concentration of a tracer along the main water flow path in the case of rn degassing and decay can be corrected for this approach yields sgd magnitudes that are highly consistent with those obtained by other approaches at any given time including hydrogeological models and conservative tracer budgets as well as with those terrestrial drivers of discharge that induce seasonal variability of sgd rates represented here by groundwater head on land these findings are useful to improve the biogeochemical budgets of non conservative elements in coastal areas of restricted exchange more generally and sgd quantification in

4541,submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been shown to potentially be a more important source of solutes to the global ocean than river flow as a result the accuracy of predictions of the magnitude and seasonal variability of sgd to the sea is critical for the management of coastal marine ecosystems for a model site kinvarra bay ireland dominated by point source sgd inputs we show that the difference between estimates provided by different marine tracer based methods can be large depending on the way water residence time within the system and water exchange across its boundaries are described for example results from tidal prism and freshwater fraction models the most widely used approaches to quantify freshwater fluxes into marine areas of restricted exchange vary by one order of magnitude depending on the way the water exchange across the outer system boundaries is considered and whether lagrangian or eulerian data is used we show that sgd estimates based on single point time series eulerian outside of a retention area can lead to consistently lower estimates than when using transect data langrangian moreover the outcome of radon 222rn based sgd estimates is dependent on the way the effect of water age variability on radon decay and degassing is accounted for we provide a solution to this conceptual problem by developing a correction to 222rn budgetary approaches to estimate sgd based on the spatial variation of water ages estimated from radium isotopes 223ra 224ra in solution we use new data to compare the different sets of approaches while examining the validity of their underlying assumptions to verify internal consistency and use the substantial range of published data on kinvarra bay to assess the quality of results produced with the new method keywords submarine groundwater discharge karst radon radium modelling salinity ireland 1 introduction increasing evidence shows that submarine groundwater discharge sgd defined as the flow of water from the seabed to the coastal ocean regardless of fluid composition or driving force burnett et al 2003 is a larger source of dissolved chemicals to the ocean than river water kwon et al 2014 moore et al 2008 rodellas et al 2015 hence accurate sgd rates are necessary to validate marine biogeochemical budgets of ecosystem sensitive elements such as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus taniguchi et al 2019 reviews the array of methods to quantify sgd in use to date seepage meters lee 1977 measure total sgd fluxes over small areas typically 0 25 1 m2 e g leote et al 2008 salt or catchment based water budgets help estimate fresh groundwater flows over larger coastline lengths radioactive tracers of sgd such as radium kwon et al 2014 moore et al 2008 rodellas et al 2015 or radon burnett and dulaiova 2003 have been increasingly employed to estimate total sgd fresh groundwater plus recirculated seawater at regional scales burnett et al 2008 2001 dulaiova et al 2010 rocha et al 2016 sadat noori et al 2015 finally hydrogeological models can be used to predict fresh and occasionally saline sgd rates but require calibration making direct or tracer based quantification of sgd essential for validation yet quantifying sgd remains challenging because of its spatial and temporal variability tracer budgets while time consuming integrate a measure of temporal variability producing snapshots of discharge for entire coastal systems but to measure annual or multiannual sgd its temporal variability intra and inter annual has to be evaluated however flow rates derived from tracer budget methods are sensitive to the sampling strategy how whole system tracer inventories are obtained and to the mathematical simplifications that allow closure of mass balances combined these sensitivities lead to large disparities in sgd magnitude estimates even when the same tracer data are used for example water exchange between coastal systems and the open ocean can be quantified in multiple ways with different results e g dyer and taylor 1973 gordon et al 1996 ketchum 1951 luketina 1998 sanford et al 1992 hydrodynamics driven by winds tides and watershed inputs makes mixing within coastal systems spatially variable so rather than a homogeneous volume they comprise a distribution of water masses with distinct biogeochemical histories the water age defined as the time since a water parcel was separated from a solute source and its distribution is therefore essential to develop accurate non conservative elemental budgets in areas of restricted exchange monsen et al 2002 the most sensitive tracers of sgd in seawater 222rn 223ra and 224ra are non conservative elements by definition and consequently their use in sgd budgets requires knowledge of the spatial variability in water ages in the studied system and this is most often lacking we show how these factors affect sgd estimates and develop potential ways to overcome bias using kinvarra bay a groundwater dependant coastal system as a testbed groundwater surface water interactions in kinvarra have been intensively studied since the 90 s cave and henry 2011 drew 2003 2008 drew and daly 1993 einsiedl 2012 gregory et al 2020 mccormack et al 2016 2014 morrissey et al 2020 petrunic et al 2012 rocha et al 2016 schubert et al 2015 smith and cave 2012 seepage meters are impractical there because of its karstic shoreline which hosts multiple points of focused discharge thus sgd studies to date estimated groundwater inputs using tidal prism and freshwater fraction models or whole system salt budgets e g inter alia cave and henry 2011 mccormack et al 2014 occasionally combined with radiotracer methods rocha et al 2015 however very few studies rocha et al 2015 schubert et al 2015 combined radiotracer budgets with independent approaches to evaluate internal consistency of sgd quantification and the majority of tracer data available for the system was collected during low flow periods spring summer catchment based approaches including karst flow models mccormack et al 2014 morrissey et al 2020 have been developed beside tracer based studies on the seaward side but their accuracy is dependent on discharge measurements for calibration while estimates of sgd into kinvarra have been available since 1993 drew and daly 1993 they differ sometimes considerably with assessments varying from 104 m3 d 1 during summer rocha et al 2015 to 106 107 m3 d 1 for annual projections cave and henry 2011 most studies were carried out independently but all provide figures that cover only short periods of time and sgd is subject to tidal seasonal and interannual variability nevertheless hydrogeological models which aim to integrate discharge estimates over timescales beyond short term snapshot assessments require reliable quantification of sgd flow rates at matching timescales to ensure calibration and confidently offer predictive capability understanding the cause of discrepancy of sgd fluxes between different studies will ensure derivation of reliable annual water carbon or nutrient balances for the system here we revisit past estimates of sgd for kinvarra bay conduct new radiotracer rn ra surveys close mass balances under a range of different assumptions and compare the results with those provided by hydrogeological models mccormack et al 2016 our study aims to explain the difference between sgd estimates across different hydrological seasons and years to this end we first review the methods used to determine sgd into coastal areas from karst aquifers we test the assumptions underpinning these methods using data collected in successive surveys of salinity 222rn 224ra and 223ra and ancillary environmental monitoring data available for different groundwater level conditions we then compare the results of disparate sgd flow estimates resulting from different tidal prism and hydrogeological models radon and water mass balances using the groundwater head in the nearby karst aquifer as an indicator of the hydraulic gradient driving the flow 1 1 site description kinvarra bay in the west coast of ireland is fed by a major karst network fig 1 the bay hosts significant mussel mytilus edulis and oyster crassostrea gigas aquaculture tully and clarke 2012 tourism is the main tertiary industry in the region and the largest employer bringing a seasonal higher during summer peak influx of pollution that was transferred into the bay as sewage up to may 2017 when a wastewater treatment plant entered service groundwater inputs 5 30 m3 s 1 as per drew 2008 originate mainly from two springs located in the upper part of the bay kinvarra east arch and kinvarra west castle these drain a catchment of 483 km2 in which the lower basin is well developed limestone karst that is partly fed by river water draining an upper sandstone basin clare and mcnamara 2009 fig 1 the kinvarra east spring is not perennial and is thought to drain shallower karst conduits in contrast kinvarra west is perennial and thus thought to drain a deeper karst network cave and henry 2011 despite the distinct flow paths these two springs are connected drew 2003 karst connections fig 1 during summer outflowing water is undistinguishable by radon or stable isotope signature schubert et al 2015 the irish environmental protection agency monitors groundwater head at the killiny borehole kl fig

range of different methods cave and henry 2011 drew 2008 mccormack et al 2014 rocha et al 2015 schubert et al 2015 were reviewed groundwater flow into kinvarra was then determined from the results of four bespoke sampling surveys that evaluated the reproducibility of sgd rates estimated with different approaches in order to compare these with prior sgd estimates all individual rates were referenced to the regional groundwater level at killiny borehole epa 2020 this choice was supported by 1 tracer experiments drew 2003 and cave exploration boycott et al 2003 show the killiny borehole is 1 km away from a network of conduits connected to kinvarra springs fig 1 and 2 sgd estimated using salinity cave and henry 2011 rocha et al 2015 radon rocha et al 2015 and hydrogeological modelling of the karst network mccormack et al 2014 were correlated with groundwater level at killiny e g figs 2 and 3 to compare our results with the output of the model of mccormack et al 2014 we sought an empirical relationship between their results fig 2b and the groundwater level at the time of their study fig 2a we evaluated two alternative scenarios a linear dependence on groundwater head derived from darcy s law q 1 6h fig 2b and an adaptation of the torricelli formula a derivation of bernoulli law q 1 1 2 g h t 1 in fig 2b to derive flow rates from the net groundwater level h t discharge depends linearly on hydraulic head only if the groundwater flow is laminar bear 1979 and the karst is constrained within a relatively homogenous layer of limestone of constant cross sectional area the modified torricelli relationship was shown to give good results for karst aquifers by maramathas and boudouvis 2010 the equation describes the karst system as a reservoir filled with porous material with fractal properties and does not require prior assumptions on the reynolds number the introduction of a correction factor to account for head losses by friction within the aquifer 1 improved the fit the two relationships produced a relatively narrow range of annual variability for the daily averaged flow fig 2b so we use the first as a benchmark for comparison with other estimates of daily averaged groundwater flow to obtain the total flow through kinvarra springs west and east we note that 2 m3 s 1 the flow value cited in mccormack et al 2014 for kinvarra east needs to be added to kinvarra west flow values 2 2 fieldwork strategy variability of flow at kinvarra springs is driven by groundwater level dynamics fig 2 thus four surveys were planned to a cover the local range of groundwater level oscillation 2 m 12 14 july 2018 4 m 20 23 october 2018 7 2 m 25 28 january 2019 9 4 m 06 08 april 2019 and b collect tracer data within the bay during spring tides to ensure maximal tidal mixing each survey sampled water along the longitudinal axis of the bay by boat except october 2018 when samples were taken from land for the determination of salinity 222rn 224ra and 223ra and included the acquisition of 24 h time series of salinity and radon activity at selected locations every 3 h at least our objective was to characterize both spatial and temporal variability of bay water composition for each sampling period while limiting any possible bias due to non homogenous flushing of the system by tidal mixing water samples were collected with a niskin bottle from 0 5 to 1 m depth and stored in sealed 250 ml glass bottles for radon analysis rn in water was determined with a rad7 monitor durridge 2015 using the wat250 protocol with corrections for the time elapsed between sampling and measurement salinity was measured with an aquaread aquaprobe calibrated according to standard manufacturer protocol aquaread 2013 results were independently verified with a carl stuart limited cond197 i wtw electrical conductivity probe water column activities of 224ra and 223ra were determined after pre concentration of natural radium levels moore 1976 achieved by pumping a large water volume 60 100 l at a low flow rate 1 l min 1 through mno2 coated fibre cartridges moore and arnold 1996 after rinsing with ra free water and drying to a water mn fibre ratio of 0 4 1 1 by weight sun and torgersen 1998 224ra and 223ra activities were measured by radium decay coincidence counter radecc moore and arnold 1996 at least three separate measurements were taken from each sample immediately after collection 7 10 days after the first measurement to improve the 223ra estimate and after 25 days to correct for 228th supported 224ra levels moore 2007 the 227ac supported activity for 223ra determined after 80 days for selected samples fell within the uncertainty of 223ra quantitation depth was measured at each sampling location using a handheld sonar hawkeye digital when water was sampled from land the representative depth was estimated from the mean depth of the local bathymetric cross section derived from the 30 m infomar dtm infomar gsi 2019 considering the tidal height at the moment of collection 2 3 determination of water ages monsen et al 2002 highlight the fact that in reality bays and estuaries are not flushed homogeneously and are rarely fully mixed horizontally as a result a water sample taken at any time within such a system includes freshwater with different travel times to the sampling location this has important consequences for the closure of biogeochemical budgets of non conservative elements such as radon or short lived radium isotopes following zimmerman 1988 monsen et al 2002 use water age defined as the time a water parcel has spent since entering the estuary through one of the boundaries to describe this travel time we determined water ages in kinvarra using the solute 224ra 223ra activity ratios corrected for supported activity following moore 2000 1 a l n 224 r a 223 r a i l n 224 r a 223 r a obs Œª 224 Œª 223 where a is the mean age of water in days at any location in the bay relative to a reference point or mixing end member 224 r a 223 r a obs is the observed 224ra 223ra activity ratio ar at the sampling location 224 r a 223 r a i is the 224ra 223ra activity quotient at the radium source here kinvarra springs and Œª223 and Œª224 are the decay constants of 223ra 0 0608 day 1 and 224ra 0 189 day 1 respectively this approach assumes that the radium activity ratios of the freshwater end member are constant during the survey period and no significant inputs of new radium to the system occur within the water age profile moore 2000 2 4 calculating tracer inventories from transect data estimating sgd or fresh water inputs into a basin of restricted exchange usually involves calculating the inventory of a tracer element within the system luketina 1998 taniguchi et al 2019 the method chosen to determine the inventory is crucial because it strongly affects the result of mass balances based on measurements of the tracer for example the average of tracer concentrations at different sampling locations is the simplest path to estimate the tracer inventory in a bay or estuary but this approach is only valid if water depth within the system follows a normal distribution in natural systems the depth distribution of the submerged area does not usually comply with normality e g fig 3 as a result point concentrations or depth distributions of elements in shallow narrow areas will strongly affect averages while only representing a small fraction of the whole volume the concentration mean may thus lead to a non representative inventory methods involving 2d or 3d integration with depth are always preferable we used salinity the most common indicator of fresh and saltwater mixing to assess the effect of the most common approaches to calculate solute inventories when closing coastal mass budgets six ways to calculate the salt inventory were compared using data from our four surveys 1 the average all the sampling point data 2 the median of all sampling point data 3 one dimensional integration over distance 4 two dimensional integration over distance and depth 5 three dimensional integration using interpolated salinity and bathymetric maps of the system and finally 6 quasi three dimensional integration by sample grouping into four areas of known volume box modelling methods 1 and 2 involved salinity measurements obtained for four successive transects for method 3 salinity was plotted as a function of distance from kinvarra spring and the curve functions then integrated over the transect length to yield a depth averaged inventory for method 4 the local inventory was determined by multiplying each salinity value by depth inventories plotted as a function of distance then integrated over the transect length and normalized by the bay s longitudinal cross sectional area to determine the salt content of the system for method 5 the salinity distributions were first interpolated using arcgis to create a raster of 30 m 30 m cells the salinity for each cell then multiplied by the average cell depth at mean tide derived from a 30 m resolution bathymetry raster the results were added then divided by the bay volume to complete a 3d integration of salinity over the volume of the bay finally in method 6 the bay was divided into four different areas boxes and averages of salinity calculated for each each mean was then multiplied by box volume resultant box inventories were added and the total divided by the volume of the bay the results of each distinct tracer inventory estimate were compared with reference to the change in salinity observed during a 24 h period 2 5 salinity based estimates of freshwater inputs salt inventories in coastal systems yield multiple ways to estimate watershed freshwater contributions to the sea because of their relative simplicity the most commonly used are the tidal prism mixing models developed from the seminal paper of ketchum 1951 we tested four different tidal prism models to investigate how the way salinity data is used might affect the resulting estimate of freshwater input the model used in kinvarra bay by cave and henry 2011 derived from the segmented tidal mixing models of dyer and taylor 1973 was compared with three models a b c tidal prism mixing models reviewed in luketina 1998 all of these are only applicable to vertically well mixed systems whether or not they are may be tested according to schultz and simmons 1957 if r qr t p 0 1 where qr is the flow coming to the system the maximum expected for kinvarra is 30 m s 1 following drew 2008 t is the tidal period and p the tidal prism from 1 5 107 m3 for an average tidal cycle to 2 5 107 m3 for highest spring tide then the system can be taken as vertically well mixed for kinvarra r 0 08 for the mean tidal amplitude and r 0 05 for the highest spring tide under high discharge conditions so we accept that the water column is well mixed even for high flow and tidal prism approximations are reasonable to use 2 5 1 tidal prism model a as per luketina 1998 the classic tidal prism model assumes that the volume of seawater vp entering an estuary during flood tide is entirely of ocean salinity so and that it is completely mixed with a corresponding volume of freshwater vr flowing into the system measured over a tidal cycle it further assumes that this quantity of mixed water is completely removed from the estuary upon ebb officer 1976 as a result the dilution of a steady source of freshwater by seawater in a coastal basin depends only on the tidal period and the tidal prism luketina 1998 effects of varying discharge on internal mixing of the system are thus ignored by rearranging eq 3 in luketina 1998 and using qr vr t where vr is the volume of freshwater flowing to the system over one tidal period m3 tidal period 1 qr the fresh water flow rate in m3 d 1 and t the tidal period in days the flow rate of freshwater into an embayment described by this model is given by 2 qr p 1 s s o t with p the tidal prism volume m3 s the salinity of the estuary at high tide kg m 3 assuming a well mixed estuary here either taken from our 24 hour salinity time series or derived from the various inventory calculations explained in 2 2 so the salinity of the ocean kg m 3 taken here at 35 or equal to the marine end member 2 5 2 tidal prism model b as per luketina 1998 model b considers ebb and flood separately to derive a flow rate it assumes that flow between the ocean and the estuary occurs in either direction for equal duration luketina 1998 this will not be true if discharge has a significant effect on water exchange between the embayment and the ocean because the residence time of water in the system is seven days during summer rocha et al 2015 and our surveys showed that it was at least 3 days during other times of the year we accept this as a reasonable first order approximation at the scale of 24 h to illustrate the difference with other estimates by rearranging eq 11 in luketina 1998 we find 3 qr 2 p 1 s so t 1 s so 2 5 3 tidal prism model c as per luketina 1998 model c extends b by considering changes to the duration of ebb and flood flows and variation in the level of flushing through the estuary mouth it accepts changing discharge affects flushing to do so the model includes a return flow factor b to represent the fraction of water that had previously left the bay during ebb returning during flood tide by rearranging eq 26 in luketina 1998 with qrt œÄp 1 we have 4 qr 2 p 1 s so t 1 s so 1 b 1 b the return flow factor can be estimated using eq 4 in sanford et al 1992 5 b 1 vmtt tf p where vmt is the volume of water within the bay at mean sea level t is the tidal period tf the freshwater flushing period and p the mean tidal prism tf can be calculated according to the fraction of freshwater method dyer and taylor 1973 as recommended by alber and sheldon 1999 and used previously by rocha et al 2015 we highlight the effect on discharge estimates arising from inclusion or exclusion of the return flow factor on discharge estimates at kinvarra using b 0 and b 0 86 as the mean determined for summer low discharge conditions by rocha et al 2015 2 5 4 tidal prism model as in cave and henry 2011 cave and henry 2011 used two different equations derived from the tidal prism concept dyer and taylor 1973 ketchum 1951 to determine freshwater discharge to kinvarra bay this adaptation was made originally to assess the variability of freshwater inputs from time series of salinity data collected in the bay it implicitly assumes that high and low water concentrations are represented by the range found within 24 h at a single site and that the entire bay constitutes one well mixed volume if no ebb water returns during flood tide this model yields one order of magnitude higher freshwater inputs than all the other approaches considered here allowing for some return flow yields freshwater input rates in closer agreement with our other estimates we therefore employ eq 2 from cave and henry 2011 to estimate fresh water flows to kinvarra here 6 q s hw s lw max s a l i n i t y o f f l o o d t i d e h hw h lw a b where q is the net volume of fresh water flowing into the system m3 d 1 shw and slw the salinity at high and low tide respectively kg m 3 derived from 24 h data hhw and hlw the tidal height m derived here from galway bay data and ab the mean horizontal surface area of the bay m2 2 6 radon mass balance we estimate sgd from radon measurements in kinvarra in two different ways the first uses the raw uncorrected for water ages radon in water activities to close a rn mass balance for the system considering all the potential sources and sinks these include degassing to the atmosphere radioactive decay water exchange with outer water bodies diffusive sediment water fluxes and total sgd into the system burnett and dulaiova 2003 however water ages in kinvarra bay are spatially variable between 0 at the water source and 8 days at the system boundary with galway bay rocha et al 2015 this is not surprising water ages in estuaries are spatially variable and tend to increase with distance from the main freshwater source monsen et al 2002 as a result a volume of water located further away from the radon source here kinvarra springs will have lost more rn to decay and degassing than water found closer to the springs the system is therefore not well mixed spatially and consequently the effect of degassing fluxes on a given part of the bay will depend both on the age of water and on the wind conditions prevalent during a number of days x prior to the survey where x is the age of water in that portion of the bay with water ages varying between 0 close to the springs and 8 days further out in the bay a putative water sample composed of 100 percent sgd collected at the outer rim of the system even with no loss to the atmosphere during transport by successive tides to its current location will include only a quarter of the radon it originally carried half life of radon is 3 days in reality the additional effect of degassing occurring during that period will result in much lower radon activities at the outlet to galway bay calculating radon inventories for the system without correcting for water ageing is likely to result in a large underestimate of the rn inventory and consequently of the total sgd fluxes into the system here we test an amendment of the often employed classical steady state whole system radon mass balance approach to solve this conceptual problem in this new approach we correct individual radon activities for the degassing and decay occurring from the moment it left contact with the bedrock source before closing radon mass balances for the system 2 6 1 radon mass balance 1 no spatial variability of water ages for the first approach if all inputs and outputs of radon are balanced over the flushing time of the system i e steady state we have all terms in bq m 2 d 1 7 rn dif rn dg rn dy rn net rn adv 0 where rndif the diffusive radon flux across the sediment water interface taken from rocha et al 2015 rndg the radon degassing flux i e atmospheric evasion estimated from wind speed

exchange fluxes across the mouth of the bay estimated from the slope of the radon vs salinity curve as described by eq 3 in officer 1979 and rnadv the advective radon flux associated with groundwater discharge unknown here we use the equation of officer 1979 conservatively because rnnet estimates extracted from 24 h tidal cycles are overly dependent on each individual tidal cycle and could lead to high uncertainty over periods scaled to the residence time of water in the system taken as the oldest age measured within with this in mind and following from eq 7 qsgd the total sgd flux into the bay m3 d 1 is 8 q sgd r n dg r n dy r n dif a b cr n spring cr n mouth s mouth dcrn ds a where crnspring is the activity of the main radon source to the bay here kinvarra spring bq m 3 crnmouth and

accounting for ageing of water we improve on the previous mass balance by correcting radon activity data for the effect of degassing and decay as water ages toward the sea to correct rn in water activities for radioactive decay as water ages within the system we use the standard decay law 9 222 r n c o r r e c t e d f o r d e c a y 222 r n m e a s u r e d e a Œª rn where a is the time elapsed since the sampled parcel of water left contact with the radon source d estimated from the ra relative water ages eq 1 and Œªrn the decay constant of 222radon d 1 similarly for degassing we use the

macintyre et al 1995 and turner et al 1996 for the period corresponding to the age of the water parcel preceding the measurement 3 results 3 1 review of methods to estimate sgd in a karst environment most of the methods tested here yield flow rates that covary with groundwater level on land fig 4 however exceptions exist e g j m in fig 4 and all methods yield different sgd flow rate magnitudes this is the case even when different methods employ the same salinity full triangles fig 4h i j f or radon dataset full squares fig 4m n we classify water balances and sgd estimates based on hydrogeological models as catchment based approaches table 1 the resulting sgd rates are inter comparable for this system because surface runoff is a minor component of the water balance in kinvarra the only exception is when groundwater level is at its highest at which time surface drainage may represent a larger fraction of the freshwater input into the bay coxon and drew 2000 during summer rocha et al 2015 found the ratio between total freshwater fluxes and sgd varied between 1 3 0 4 and 0 65 0 19 the catchment based approaches reviewed here yield a relatively similar range of groundwater flows fig 4b k this consistency suggests that the range of sgd rates derived from these methods is reproduceable if the catchment limits are accurate and spatial resolution of net rainfall estimates are sufficient to represent the actual rainfall distribution in the models tidal prism models fig 4c to j assume that the bay is well mixed vertically assumption 6 table 1 in addition radon fig 4m n and radium mass balances require accurate identification of their main source into the system both in location and magnitude assumption 12 table 1 since all methods using the same tracer of freshwater inflow here salinity or radon require these assumptions to be met the differences observed between sgd estimates obtained using these tracers cannot be caused by a difference in underlying methodological assumptions so these are not analysed further here other pre requisites to estimate sgd flow rates are three fold 1 inventories of the tracer of choice are calculated in a manner that is physically representative of the system assumption 5 in table 1 2 exchange of water across the outer boundary of the system is calculated in a realistic fashion assumption 7 11 table 1 and 3 mass balances based on radioactive tracers which are non conservative within the time scale of water retention within the system e g 222rn 223ra 224ra have to account for the effect of ageing water assumptions 13 15 in table 1 we show next how choices made within this assumption framework explain the differences shown in fig 4 3 2 how tracer inventories are calculated affects sgd estimates tracer based methods to determine freshwater or sgd flow into a coastal system depend on mass inventories assumption 5 in table 1 however in systems that are not fully mixed the spatial variability of any given solute is often much larger than the measurement uncertainty the way point measurements throughout these systems are used to estimate the total inventory of a given solute at any given time is a key aspect of biogeochemical budgets table 2 illustrates the results of the comparison between six methods of estimating whole system inventories within kinvarra bay using the same salinity dataset methods are ordered by increasing complexity the last column lists the average inventory resulting from each approach and associated standard deviation with salinity observed at high tide for reference a series of insights arise from the results firstly with the exception of summer when freshwater inflow is lower the salinity inventory derived from the mean or median of available data are consistently lower than those resulting from spatial integration of the same data for example the average and median of cross system salinity for the winter 2019 survey are respectively 26 and 15 percent lower than the inventory calculated by 3d integration table 2 an average by definition assumes normal distribution of depths in the system so the true depth distribution is ignored when data are not normally distributed the median is used instead of the mean to describe the central tendency of the dataset the difference between the median salinity and the inventory resulting from 3d integration is less than for that between the latter and the mean table 2 but the median still overestimates the effect of springwater inputs during high discharge surveys by comparison to more sophisticated approaches as shown in fig 1 shallow areas predominate in kinvarra like in many coastal bays contributing to an asymmetric distribution of depths in the system an elemental inventory using measures of central tendency is likely to be disproportionally affected by any solute source located in the shallow portions of the basin compared to methods that either fully or partially consider the actual spatial distribution of depths e g 2d integration or 3d integration we observe this for surveys conducted for all other than low discharge periods secondly even when the uncertainty associated with a given inventory estimate is as low as 0 5 e g inventories of salinity derived from 1d integration table 2 the choice of one method over another by itself leads to much larger uncertainties cf s d all table 2 this likely results from the way the geometry of the bay is considered in the different calculations of inventories while averaging ignores the effect of variance in distance and depth between sampling points on the resulting tracer inventory the 1d integration considers the effect of distance but ignores depth distribution the 2d integration considers the effect of depth and unequal distribution of sampling points along the length of the sampling path and the 3d integration considers the actual changes of distance and depth within the system finally regardless of the method used the high tide salt inventories derived from transect data are consistently lower than the values drawn from 24 h measurement time series table 2 as a result using transect data a lagrangian approach to support sgd quantification is likely to yield consistently larger sgd rates than when a eulerian approach is employed i e using the same budgeting method on data resulting from 24 h time lapse sampling at point locations the observations in fig 4 confirm this for tidal prism model c assuming a return flow factor of b 0 86 the sgd magnitude drawn from a measure of the salinity inventory taken from transect data fig 4g is three to four times higher than that produced by processing a 24 h time series all else being equal fig 4h 3 3 basin mixing is spatially and temporally heterogeneous the salinity and water age profile at high tide fig 5 show that the volume of fresh sgd stored within the bay is highly heterogeneous in space this is accentuated by the low salinity mostly low water age plume in the inner bay in july 2018 when groundwater level was the lowest the plume of water with salinity 10 was constrained to the immediate vicinity of kinvarra springs but in january 2019 when groundwater level was high it covered most of the inner half of the bay fig 5 our first three surveys carried out when groundwater level ranged between 2 m and 7 m showed this low salinity plume extended further out into the bay with increasing groundwater level however when groundwater level was highest 9 7 m this correlation stopped at this point the water ages within the bay were much higher than observed during the other surveys and were more heterogeneous in the outer bay this suggests that the circulation patterns driving water exchange between kinvarra and galway bay are also temporally and spatially variable this will also affect sgd quantification by radon radium or salt mass balances if the internal circulation pattern is assumed equal for all attempts irrespective of season or freshwater discharge how we accept the water moves across outer system boundaries assumptions 7 11 table 1 is particularly important for tidal prism models eqs 2 6 this is not considered in the methods reviewed here tidal prism a and b fig 4i and h or described either by an empiric modification of the tidal prism model fig 4d cave and henry 2011 nor by the introduction of a return flow factor b model c in fig 4g h j it is however possible to reconcile all different estimates of discharge within one order of magnitude difference by considering the mathematical descriptor of the water exchange through the outer system boundary we show this using our 24 h timeseries fig 4f h i j models that seem to perform best toward internal consistency i e results match at least one other method using another tracer consider the return flow into the bay in some manner fig 4f h j when the groundwater level rises above 4 m applying model c with no return flow factor model c with b 0 fig 4h leads to sgd estimates that are consistent with catchment water balances fig 4k modelling fig 4b and rates based on the tidal prism derivation of cave and henry cave and henry 2011 fig 4d e f on the other hand using the same dataset with a return flow factor of b 0 86 leads to lower sgd estimates these are consistent with radon mass balances uncorrected for ageing water model c with b 0 86 fig 4j and close to previous estimates derived from radon and salinity under low groundwater level low flow conditions fig 4l when longitudinal transects are used to determine inventories lagrangian approach and include data collected from the inner part of the bay in the calculations the effects of the inclusion or not of return flow are different in this case b 0 86 in model c leads to high flow estimates model c with b 0 86 transects fig 4g now consistent with the annual catchment water balance fig 4k modelling based on rainfall or groundwater level fig 4b and estimates based on cave derivation of the tidal prism approach fig 4d e f methods to estimate the sgd flow rate based on 24 hour time series eulerian approaches can thus underestimate the effect of retention areas on return flow and thus lead to lower full system return flow factors than those suggested by lagrangian approaches the effect of retention areas on water age distribution throughout the system is visible in fig 5 with most of the bay showing ages older than 3 days if this lack of uniformity in water age is ignored by using 24 h data from a single site similar sgd flow results as those arising from the use of transects for inventories fig 4g might be obtained but with different insights regarding the return flow factor b 0 for model c using 24 h data in fig 4h sgd flow values derived from eulerian surveys thus only account for freshwater in sections of the bay close to the sampling point that are fully mixed and do not necessarily include sgd retained elsewhere for longer periods transect lagrangian data are in that sense less sensitive to this problem fig 4g 3 4 water age profile and budgets of non conservative solutes sgd flow estimates obtained from radon mass balances are strongly affected by the way the heterogeneity of water ages is accounted for eq 8 vs eqs 8 10 fig 4m and n closing radon mass balances without correcting for the ageing of water within the system yields lower sgd rates fig 4m with lower sensitivity to groundwater level fig 4 estimate m accounting for the spatial distribution of water age leads to more realistic results during higher groundwater level periods up by a factor of 4 to 8 on the alternative rn sgd corrected for age variability fig 4n these approximate the fresh sgd estimates obtained by catchment based methods annual water balance model kw fig 4k and b this closure of the gap breaks down however when groundwater head raises above 8 m radon driven sgd estimates corrected for ageing water fig 4m fall to about half of sgd calculated by catchment based approaches fig 4k and b the tidal prism model c with b 0 fig 4h and the cave and henry tidal prism approach fig 4d f 4 discussion our observations illustrate the importance of inspecting the assumptions that support mass balance models used to estimate sgd in coastal systems they also underscore the value of intercomparisons between hydrogeological and oceanographic sgd assessments as highlighted by burnett et al 2001 a cross disciplinary approach allows better understanding of the temporal variability of flushing and the dynamism of elemental inventories in coastal systems due to changes in freshwater discharge in turn this allows the validity of priors to the application of catchment and tracer based approaches to be tested and consequent development of improvements to account for system characteristics our intercomparison identifies a series of critical points that require attention when estimates of sgd rates are sought from tracer mass balances in a surface water basin these are summarized in fig 6 and discussed in detail below 4 1 sampling strategy sgd estimates based on lagrangian sampling transects of a tracer may be consistently higher than when eulerian time series of the same tracer are used in kinvarra bay a choice between lagrangian or eulerian datasets could also yield different values of the return flow factor during spring tide section 3 3 water from kinvarra springs is preferentially retained in upper kinvarra bay for several tidal cycles at least part of the year rocha et al 2015 during these periods it is less likely to be sampled by 24 h tidal cycle measurements in a single location in the outer part of the bay and when this happens sgd is likely underestimated the effect is observed here during spring tide so is likely to be larger during neap tide this is supported by gregory et al 2020 who show that the flushing of the inner bay is minimal during these periods significant spatial variability of water ages is also observed both along and across the length of the bay which may be explained by the fact that exchange with galway bay is not homogenous and rather occurs through an internal gyre as previously observed rocha et al 2015 this gyre when present would accelerate exchange with galway bay and result in the significant addition of older more saline and phytoplankton rich waters to the system this is also consistent with independent findings fig 3 in gregory et al 2020 inclusion of a measure of both spatial and temporal variability of the tracer of choice seems thus necessary to limit the potential bias introduced in mass balance approaches by spatial heterogeneity of residence times long term estimates of sgd based on continuous tracer measurements in a coastal system should thus involve the synchronous determination of tracer concentrations over the area covered by the system to account for differences in water residence time a more frequent application of remote sensing mccaul et al 2016 wilson and rocha 2014 or further development of small low cost sensors to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of any tracer in combination with the methods tested here may be advisable to avoid bias of sgd quantification or other mass balance based approaches such a multi pronged approach would facilitate the determination of system characteristics and limit the mismatch between conceptual assumptions underpinning tracer inventories and the reality on the ground 4 2 development of sgd tracer inventories we show that the choice of method employed to calculate the inventory of a tracer could have a significant effect on the results and hence on the final sgd figure our comparisons highlight the importance of considering the basin geometry and the spatial variations of water age when calculating inventories from transect data in real world aquatic systems since solute inventories are so crucial to coastal oceanography an biogeochemical studies it also seems important to test the effect of ignoring depth frequency distribution before using measures of central tendency or other simplified methods to estimate solute amounts in a water basin a balance has to be found between ease of calculation and representativeness testing different calculation methods as explained here seems to offer a potential way to test for consistency where a sufficient number of data points are available estimating the uncertainty of a given interpolation by kriging may also be promising e g murphy et al 2010 4 3 sgd estimates and spatial variability of water ages spatial variability of water ages has a strong effect on sgd estimates based on non conservative tracer solutes such as radon or short lived radium isotopes indeed as a water parcel is transferred from its source in the watershed to the open ocean time elapses and the effect of internal reactions and mixing within the system on water composition accumulates ignoring the biogeochemical history of the water when estimating sgd based on ra or rn mass balances can lead to large underestimation of degassing and decay losses in systems where large water age inhomogeneities are observed this will result in a large underestimate of sgd fluxes we suggest a method based on ra ages to account for the spatial variability of residence time applicable in systems where the assumptions of the ra age model are valid moore 2000 where they are not an alternative path although at greater cost and time requirements is to develop hydrodynamic models or more simply employ drifters e g pawlowicz et al 2019 to assess the extent of the spatial variability of water ages or residence times in order to produce more accurate mass balances of non conservative elements 4 4 temporal variability of sgd composition and flow rate sgd rate estimates for kinvarra bay correlated with groundwater level with few exceptions this implies that groundwater level is a useful indicator of the potential variability of sgd rate above 8 m of hydraulic head large differences were found between sgd estimates derived from radon mass balances fig 4m and all other methods of assessing sgd i e catchment based fig 4k and b and tidal prism models fig 4d f h this suggests that a larger fraction of groundwater flow into the sea may occur via the surface pathway or in greater contact with the atmosphere as groundwater recharge increases and hydraulic head overcomes the 8 m mark enhancing radon degassing this is consistent with coxon and drew 2000 who found a greater level of groundwater surface water interactions occurred in the area during periods of higher recharge with groundwater fed lakes turloughs expanding in volume and area and localized flooding becoming a problem this view is also supported by our estimates of sgd based on salinity of the bay fig 4c d e f g h these were higher than mc cormack s 2014 model predictions when hydraulic head increased above 4 6 m fig 4b and the difference between model and tracer based sgd rates increased as groundwater level increased the trend implies that surface pathways become more important for freshwater discharge into the bay as groundwater levels increase in the catchment notably this shift can be detected by salt balance approaches but not by radon budgeting since rn degassing will be stimulated by groundwater surface water interaction and water contact with the surface of rn emanating rock will be reduced by increased volumetric storage and augmented groundwater flow rates driving lower residence times within the aquifer matrix maps of potential overland flow during flooding caused by high recharge of the karstic network have been published recently morrissey et al 2020 further supporting our thesis we strongly advocate for caution when conducting radon mass balances during periods of high flow to determine sgd from karst networks into surface water bodies higher flow rates are driven by higher hydraulic heads and imply a larger volume of the karstic network is taken by the groundwater body a larger storage and higher flow rates yield less surface contact between the flowing groundwater and the rn bearing aquifer matrix since the volume surface area ratio increases but also mean that the residence time of water within the aquifer decreases which also diminishes the rn accumulation potential of the groundwater on the other hand because of the nature of karst high flow periods also offer greater opportunity for enhanced groundwater surface water interactions prior to discharge into the sea which increase degassing of rn prior to the dilution of groundwater by seawater 5 conclusion we test the most common methods employed to estimate sgd to coastal areas under different discharge conditions in a real world system evaluating different mathematical assumptions for the calculation of partial flux terms in mass balance expressions our observations show that everything else being equal the choice of method to assess sgd and the sampling strategy employed to collect relevant tracer data has a large impact on the magnitude of ensuing sgd estimates these artifacts created by method choice are in order of importance caused by a how exchange of water between the system and the outer ocean reservoir is described to estimate tidal exchange in mass balances b whether the spatial variability of water ages along the net water flow direction is taken into account when mass balances are closed if non conservative elements are used as tracers of sgd and finally c how representative is the estimated inventory of the tracer solute within the domain of interest making both the sampling strategy and the method employed to arrive at this figure determine how realistic the outcome is given the high spatial heterogeneity of water ages in real world systems including the existence of retention areas that delay flushing of coastal waters toward the ocean we show that the option for either langragian or eulerian tracer data collection significantly impacts ensuing sgd estimates continuous measurements of the concentration of a tracer at a fixed location if the choice of location is away from an area of higher water retention will underestimate sgd to the system and overestimate its flushing rate this is particularly relevant for non conservative tracers and during periods of high discharge when the system tends to be less well mixed spatial awareness of the distribution of the tracer obtained through a langragian sampling approach i e sampling transects for the tracer of choice along the net flow axis is necessary to characterize de spatial variance of tracer concentrations and most importantly the water age profile of the system along its net flow axis the water age profile can be determined using ra isotopes once this is available the effect of physical processes that determine the concentration of a tracer along the main water flow path in the case of rn degassing and decay can be corrected for this approach yields sgd magnitudes that are highly consistent with those obtained by other approaches at any given time including hydrogeological models and conservative tracer budgets as well as with those terrestrial drivers of discharge that induce seasonal variability of sgd rates represented here by groundwater head on land these findings are useful to improve the biogeochemical budgets of non conservative elements in coastal areas of restricted exchange more generally and sgd quantification in

4542,input error in hydrologic models mainly arising from observed precipitation can impair model calibration precise and reliable identification of input error is important for improved model parameter estimation however limited information about the nature of the error and the memory of the hydrologic system make it challenging to disentangle input error from the total residual error based on a sequential monte carlo sampling algorithm bayesian error analysis with reordering bear method is developed to quantify the unknown input error series by sampling errors from an assumed error distribution and reordering them with inferred error ranks via the secant method rather than estimating their values directly the results of a synthetic case and a real case using the hydrologic models gr4j and hymod show several benefits of this new approach 1 the reordering strategy via the secant method can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of input error quantification and consequently promote the parameter estimation 2 an autoregressive model can address the persistence of hydrologic residual errors in calibration 3 the lag time between the forcing data and the corresponding response can be explicitly acknowledged when the system exhibits a delayed response this developed bear algorithm can be extended to other environmental modeling studies with correlated or and delayed responses although its ability is limited by the impacts of model structural error and the output observational error 1 introduction input error is one of the major sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling it mainly arises from uncertain precipitation data due to imprecise measurement at the point scale and imperfect representativeness at the areal scale mcmillan et al 2012 point measurement uncertainty consists of systematic error and random error systematic error can be assessed via a comparison with data from control gauges neff 1977 and its error sources effects and related corrections typically depend on the gauge types sevruk 1982 1996 in contrast random error cannot be corrected in theory but its statistical characteristics e g coefficient of variation cv and standard deviation sd can be estimated via a comparison with data from co located rain gauges goodrich et al 1995 krajewski et al 2003 hutchinson 1969 representational error is introduced when estimating mean areal precipitation from point measurements due to the spatial variability of precipitation its magnitude can be evaluated as the standard error in a single gauge measurement vs a gauge network wood et al 2000 which generally increases with catchment size mcmillan et al 2012 as an alternative quantitative precipitation estimation qpe from radar data can directly measure areal precipitation avoiding representational error however this approach will bring another type of uncertainty arising from the reflectivity rain rate z r relationship chumchean et al 2003 villarini and krajewski 2010 the error model for this surrogate process can be estimated by analyzing the difference between radar estimates and gauge network data kirstetter et al 2010 seo and krajewski 2010 wood et al 2000 in general despite improvements in data collection and remote sensing technologies precipitation data error is inevitable however the above studies describing their statistical characterization can provide prior knowledge about input error in hydrological modeling the presence of input errors might significantly impair model calibration leading to biased parameter estimates b√°rdossy and das 2008 huard and mailhot 2006 improving model performance necessitates sound quantification of input uncertainty and several approaches have been developed to isolate input uncertainty from the total uncertainty in model calibration the bayesian total error analysis batea method provides a framework for quantifying the input error series in a bayesian calibration scheme kavetski et al 2006 event varying input errors the same value for one storm event are defined as multipliers on the input time series and inferred with the model parameters which leads to a high dimensional computation challenge to overcome this batea explored a two stage markov chain monte carlo mcmc strategy to reduce the cpu time to 5 41 hours for applications having 418 inferred variables renard et al 2010 however the application in identifying daily varying errors one error value for one input data can introduce an excessive number of inferred variables and the increased dimensionality will make it impractical to estimate due to the increased computation cost haario et al 2005 therefore if input errors and model parameters are calibrated as a whole the high dimensionality challenge cannot be avoided and will limit the algorithm applications renard et al 2009 another typical approach the integrated bayesian uncertainty estimator ibune ajami et al 2007 is based on the same hierarchical conceptualization of input uncertainty as batea using rainfall multipliers to represent the rainfall error and assuming these multipliers follow a gaussian distribution in this approach the multipliers are not jointly inferred with model parameters but randomly sampled from the assumed distribution and filtered by maximizing the likelihood function although this approach reduces the calculation dimension significantly and can be applied to estimate daily varying multipliers the inherent randomness will lead to an underestimation of multiplier variance and misidentification of the uncertainty sources renard et al 2009 from the above this study will follow the approach of ibune which avoids the high dimensionality problem but explore a new strategy to improve the accuracy of multiplier inference and model parameter estimation if the statistical features of precipitation error can be characterized in advance this prior knowledge can be taken advantage of to build an error model for the input data in hydrological modeling then a bayesian hierarchical framework such as ibune ajami et al 2007 can be implemented to identify the data based input errors in the calibration process unlike directly estimating the error values in current methods a new strategy is developed in this study to estimate the error ranks for a sample of the error values because the error model has been pre specified the error values only depend on their ranks in a certain cumulative distribution function cdf if input error dominates over other sources of error each error rank can be updated according to the changes of its corresponding model residuals under the assumption that the optimal error rank leads to the least residual error this new method consists of two procedures sampling the errors from the estimated error model and reordering them according to the inferred ranks unlike updating all the error multipliers as a whole in the batea framework this strategy attempts to optimize each of them separately by identifying the residual parts they affect this is referred to as the bayesian error analysis with reordering bear method the bear method has been successfully applied in the quantification of observational errors of system outputs and inputs in a water quality context where the model responses can be regarded to be independent wu et al 2020 this suggests the method may hold some promise for use in other types of environmental systems however input error identification in hydrologic models requires special care due to the propagation of model inputs over multiple time steps i e the persistence of the hydrologic system furthermore the response caused by an input is frequently not instantaneous but delayed in time and the lag time of a single forcing data is not easy to estimate from a specific hydrograph for all the inputs these two problems should be addressed to extend the application of the bear method in more fields such as hydrological modeling the derivation and details of the bear algorithm in quantifying input errors in a hydrologic model are described in section 2 this study selects the hydrologic models gr4j and hymod to illustrate the approach section 3 introduces these two models and presents the results for a synthetic case and a real case in this way the new algorithm is tested in a controlled situation where the true values of each source of errors are known and a realistic situation with the interference of multiple unknown error sources section 4 evaluates the new algorithm and its implementation finally section 5 outlines the main conclusions and recommendations for this work 2 methodology 2 1 bayesian error analysis with reordering bear method based on an approximate bayesian computation sequential monte carlo abc smc calibration algorithm jeremiah et al 2011 sisson et al 2007 the bayesian error analysis with reordering bear methodology employs latent variables to counteract the impact of errors from an individual source in model calibration these unknown time varying errors are quantified via a sampling and reordering strategy to realize the same rank between the latent variable and the true error in a pre estimated error distribution the derivation of the bear algorithm is described as following here and in the following contents a capital bold letter e g x y represents a vector and a lower case e g x y represents a variable frequently precipitation error can be represented as a multiplier ajami et al 2007 kavetski et al 2006 thus the precipitation observation can be described via eq 1 1 x o x exp Œµ x Œµ x n Œº œÉ 2 where the asterisk implies the true value without error the observed precipitation x o is defined as the true precipitation x multiplied by the exponential error exp Œµ x where Œµ x refers to the precipitation error assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean Œº and sd œÉ in this study the bear algorithm is developed starting from a simple situation where the model only suffers from input errors precipitation errors and parameter errors in such a condition the model residual error Œµ in a traditional calibration can be represented via eq 2 2 Œµ y s y o m x o Œ∏ m c y m x exp Œµ x Œ∏ m c y where y s is the output simulated from the model m corresponding to the observed input x o and model parameter Œ∏ m c and the observed output y o is assumed without observational errors in the derivation thus can be denoted as y in the calibration via the bear method the proposed error Œµ x p is introduced to counteract the impact of true input errors then the proposed model residual Œµ p will be calculated via eq 3 3 Œµ p y p y o m x p Œ∏ m c y m x exp Œµ x exp Œµ x p Œ∏ m c y m x o exp Œµ x p Œ∏ m c y where the observed input x o and simulated output y s in eq 2 are modified as x p and y p via dividing exp Œµ x p from the observation x o to eliminate impacts of input errors the proposed errors Œµ x p are sampled from the pre estimated error distribution n Œº œÉ 2 and therefore approximate the distribution of the true input errors Œµ x when the distributions of two error sets Œµ x p and Œµ x are the same and the error number is large enough the individual error samples corresponding to the equivalent ranks will be similar when the data length is small or the error variance is large sampling bias will be introduced whereby error samples with the same ranks will correspond to quite different values in a calibration scheme incorporating data based input errors the error number is sufficiently large e g greater than 1000 time steps for the case studies presented here to alleviate the impacts of sampling bias this statement is supported by the precise error quantification in the later synthetic case if the model parameters Œ∏ m c converge to the true parameters Œ∏ m the optimal error ranks will reduce the residual to zero in eq 3 because the equivalent ranks ensure the elimination of input errors Œµ x by dividing the estimated error Œµ x p therefore the estimation of input error can be converted to optimizing the input error rank denoted as k through minimizing the model residual under the assumption that the input error is dominant in the residual error 2 2 the application of the secant method the first challenge in the bear method is to develop the relationship between the input error rank and the corresponding model residual it is trivial to calculate the model residual corresponding to the input error rank however the backward calculation is usually not tractable because the inverse model transformation cannot be derived analytically from the model equations especially for non linear models mostly common in the environmental modeling field under the assumption that the model residual error mainly comes from the input uncertainty the accurate identification of the time varying input errors will reduce the residuals to zero this approach of modifying the input error rank can be regarded as a root finding problem where the root is the optimal error rank and the function is model residual equal to zero an iterative approximation the secant method ralston and jennrich 1978 can be applied to realize it but needs some adaptions the main steps are 1 n is equal to the number of estimated input errors i represents the time step of error i 1 2 n q represents the sequence number of error rank iteration in the secant method q 1 sample one set of errors Œµ x i 1 p i 1 2 n from the assumed error distribution n Œº œÉ 2 and sort them respectively to obtain the initial error rank k i 1 i 1 2 n corresponding to these sampled errors calculate the modified input x i 1 p i 1 2 n the modified output y i 1 p i 1 2 n and the modified model residuals Œµ i 1 p i 1 2 n q 2 repeat the above calculation to get a new set of Œµ x i 2 p k i 2 x i 2 p y i 2 p and Œµ i 2 p i 1 2 n an example to illustrate this step has been demonstrated in the 1st iteration and 2nd iteration in table 1 2 q q 1 calculate the pre rank k i q respectively for each error i 1 2 n via the secant method 4 k i q k i q 1 Œµ i q 1 p k i q 1 k i q 2 Œµ i q 1 p Œµ i q 2 p where k i q represents the updated rank of input error at time step i and iteration q Œµ i q 1 p is the model residual corresponding to k i q 1 k i 3 i 1 2 n in table 1 is calculated by eq 4 3 sort all the pre ranks k i q i 1 2 n to obtain the post ranks k i q i 1 2 n 5 k i q k k i q after calculating eq 4 the pre rank k i q may be out of the rank range for example less than 1 or more than n or not an integer like k i 3 in table 1 ranking the pre rank k i q i 1 n can address this problem by scaling the pre ranks to integers from 1 to n therefore a post rank set k i q i 1 2 n is obtained k i 3 is shown in table 1 4 reorder the errors sampled in the 2nd iteration according to the post rank k i q to form the inferred error series Œµ x i q p i 1 2 n for example the post rank at the 2nd time step in the 3rd iteration is 10 and its corresponding value in the 2nd iteration is 0 79 therefore 0 79 is the updated input error at the 2nd time step in the 3rd iteration demonstrated by the bold numbers in table 1 5 according to the new input error Œµ x i q p calculate the new input x i q p i 1 2 n the new output y i q p i 1 2 n and the new model residuals Œµ i q p i 1 2 n this step is demonstrated in the 3rd iteration in table 1 6 calculate the objective function if its result is smaller than the tolerance of total error the estimated input errors are accepted otherwise return to step 2 and start a new updating via the secant method 2 3 considering the lag time between forcing data and response the approach summarized above has been successfully applied in the context of the build up wash off model bwmod in catchments with quick response times at the time scale of interest such as an urban area with hourly to daily time steps wu et al 2020 in that case the response sediment dynamics caused by the forcing data river flow is generally instantaneous however in hydrological systems the response at the outlet to an input rainfall event is frequently not instantaneous a lag time is often observed representing the travel time of rainfall to the catchment outlet and this can only be derived by analysis of the observed hydrograph or the modeled hydrograph in instances where the effective lag time of the model is being approximated it should be noted that the lag time in the bear method is different from the lag time we usually define in hydrologic applications the common definition of lag time is event based shown in fig 1 a referred to as the time difference between the centroid of the effective rainfall hyetograph and the peak of runoff hydrograph watt and chow 1985 while the lag time in the bear method is data based shown in fig 1 c referred to as the time elapsed between each rainfall data and the occurrence of its caused runoff the focus changing from the event based lag time to the data based lag time aims to ensure the effective optimization of each input error respectively to estimate the data based lag time it is necessary to derive the separate hydrograph caused by each input from the whole hydrograph this study developed an approach to address it demonstrated as the process from panel a to c in fig 1 the decomposed hydrograph only caused by input p1 the first hydrograph in fig 1 c can be calculated by the original whole hydrograph fig 1 a subtracting the new hydrograph caused by the input series where p1 is set as zero first hydrograph in fig 1 b according to the decomposed hydrograph in fig 1 c the data based lag time for input p1 is 1 here it should be noted that the hydrograph of p1 cannot be directly calculated by simulating the hydrograph with the input p1 alone because it suffers from the impacts of initial conditions or baseflow the lag time referred to as the time difference between the input and its first positive response will be always assessed as zero when the lag time has been calculated for each input the corresponding residual Œµ i q 1 p and Œµ i q 2 p in eq 4 should be changed to Œµ i l a g i q 1 p and Œµ i l a g i q 2 p in the applications of the models with delayed responses 2 4 considering the persistence of hydrologic model response with low persistence in time the input and response in bwmod can be assumed to approximate a one to one corresponding relation in other words each input error impacts the model residual of one time step however in hydrologic systems the response arising from one forcing data will persist for multiple time steps depending on the time scale of the model and the catchment functioning sorooshian and dracup 1980 this model storage representation and the inherent correlations in streamflow observations will lead to a memory effect in the model residual error kuczera 1983 the persistence in the model residual will challenge the effectiveness of the reordering strategy thus it should be addressed to ensure the correspondence between the input error and the part of residual error the persistence in the model residual is frequently represented via an autoregressive ar model schaefli et al 2007 its order p and coefficients œï 1 œï p can be derived from the analysis of the model residual order p should be set as the lag value after which the partial autocorrelation function pacf plot crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time box et al 2015 but in the calibration it is difficult to decide the order p for each model residual automatically by the code the order p should be fixed properly in advance the discussion about it will be carried out in section 4 3 coefficients of the ar p model can be calculated via the parcorr function in matlab if the order of the ar model is set as 2 and the calculated coefficients are œï 1 and œï 2 the processed model residual at time step i and iteration q can be described via eq 6 6 œâ i q p Œµ i q p œï 1 Œµ i 1 q p œï 2 Œµ i 2 q p the processed model residual œâ i q p removes the impacts arising from the residuals at the previous time steps and their impacts are represented via an ar model therefore in a hydrologic model considering the correlated and delayed responses eq 4 should be modified as 7 k i q k i q 1 œâ i l a g i q 1 p k i q 1 k i q 2 œâ i l a g i q 1 p œâ i l a g i q 2 p 2 5 algorithm and example the bear method is thus adapted to consider both the persistence of the hydrologic system and the potential lag time between the model input and output a summary of the resulting algorithm is demonstrated in fig 2 and an illustrative example is presented in table 1 if the observed input is represented in the form of eq 1 zero precipitation will always stay zero regardless of the observational error under this assumption the algorithm first selects the positive precipitation inputs and sets their number n as the number of sampled errors it should be noted that if the input observational error is assumed to be additive the error associated with zero precipitation observations should also be considered in the example of table 1 the number of positive inputs is 10 therefore the number of sampled errors is 10 the bear method is developed based on the abc smc calibration scheme in this scheme s is the number of the sequential populations which increases until the objective function of the sth population is less than the final tolerance œÑ the final tolerance œÑ stopping criteria is difficult to set before calibration due to the unknown range of objective function results but it can be estimated after calibrating several populations according to the target accuracy and the actual calculation range of the objective functions in this study the calibration stops when 1000 proposed parameter sets are rejected in a row the first tolerance œÑ 1 is set based on the actual calculation of the first population to ensure sufficient variability in the initial population of parameters the intermediate tolerance œÑ s is set as the 30 quantile of the objective function results of population s 1 which can reduce automatically with a new population calculation in each population model parameters Œ∏ m are generated from the prior distribution or the posterior distribution of the previous population but in the example of table 1 Œ∏ m is set as the reference values in table 2 i e Œ∏1 350 Œ∏ 2 0 Œ∏3 90 Œ∏4 2 5 letting the results focus on the impacts of the reordering strategy when the parameter errors are removed in the actual algorithm when one parameter set is generated the corresponding data based lag time can be assessed from the simulated hydrograph via the method described in section 2 3 in the example in table 1 the analyzed lag times for all the positive inputs are 1 i e lag i 1 i 1 2 10 corresponding to the parameter set Œ∏ m Œ∏1 350 Œ∏ 2 0 Œ∏3 90 Œ∏4 2 5 therefore in the calculation of the error rank k i 3 via the secant method eq 7 in the 3rd iteration the applied œâ i 1 1 p and œâ i 1 2 p are not at the same time step of the input but at a 1 time step delay demonstrated by the bold numbers in table 1 when one parameter set is generated the input error ranks are updated for q iterations following the steps described in section 2 2 q increases until the objective function is less than the tolerance set for each population œÑ s but the tolerance is not enough to stop the iterations in the bear method the model parameters and input error ranks are optimized together if the model parameters are far away from the true values no amount of modifications of the input error ranks will reduce the objective function smaller than the tolerance in order to improve computational efficiency the maximum number of iterations q should be set properly if q exceeds q the algorithm returns to the step of resampling the model parameters seen in fig 2 the discussion about setting q will be taken in section 4 1 in the 1st and 2nd iteration the input errors are sampled from the assumed error distribution f Œ∑ Œµ and randomly distributed at different time steps demonstrated as Œµ x i 1 p in the 1st iteration and Œµ x i 2 p in the 2nd iteration in table 1 corresponding to the sampled errors we can calculate the input error ranks k i q k Œµ x i q p modified inputs x i q p x i o exp Œµ x i q p new simulated outputs y i q p m x q p Œ∏ m i and model residuals Œµ i q p y i q p y i o in this study the order of the ar model for the model residual is assumed as 2 the reason is explained in section 4 3 the coefficients of the ar model are calculated via the parcorr function in matlab but in the example of table 1 the data length is too short to show the autocorrelation in residuals its coefficients are set as 0 6 and 0 2 respectively to continue the approach demonstration then the autocorrelation in residuals is processed via eq 6 and the processed residual œâ i q p is used in the updating via the secant method two sets of samples are prerequisites for the calculation via the secant method thus from the 3rd iteration the input error ranks are updated via eq 7 and 5 according to the new rank k i q the corresponding input value is searched in the 2nd iteration after the same reordering strategy the re ranked input errors will lead to a new set of modified inputs model outputs and residuals a new iteration via eq 7 and 5 will be carried out until the resulting objective function is less than the tolerance œÑ s or the number of iterations q exceeds the maximum number q table 1 illustrates that in the 3rd iteration the mse of the modified input x 3 p vs the true input x and the simulated output y 3 p vs the true output y both reduces which supports the hypothesis of the bear method that reordering the input errors via the secant method can effectively push the estimated errors to approach the actual input errors with the aim of minimizing the objective function of the residuals 2 6 comparison with other methods to make a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of the bear method in parameter estimation and input error quantification this study compares four alternative calibration methods denoted as methods t d r r ar method t is the traditional method directly using the observed input in calibration without considering the impacts of input error this method can be considered what is traditionally done in the hydrologic model implementation where the observed input is assumed to be error free the other three methods explicitly incorporate the uncertainty in the model inputs introducing a latent variable dividing the observed input like eq 8 to counteract the impacts of multiplicative input error method d refers to the assumed distribution of the input error which is additional apriori information that is included in the model calibration from this assumed error distribution the input error sets are randomly sampled and filtered by the minimization of the objective function this approach is similar to the means of dealing with input error in ibune framework ajami et al 2007 the remaining methods are variants of the bear algorithm method r ar is the algorithm developed in the preceding sections where r represents the reordering strategy via the secant method and ar denotes the autoregressive model to address the memory effects of the model residual method r applies the reordering strategy alone without considering the persistence of the response 8 x i p x i o exp Œµ i p Œµ p n 0 œÉ 2 3 case studies 3 1 hydrologic model gr4j and hymod first the ability of the bear method is tested in a synthetic case where the true values of each source of errors are known in order to introduce the model structural error two conceptual rainfall runoff models gr4j and hymod are selected to build the synthetic data the gr4j perrin et al 2003 is a lumped daily conceptual model with four free parameters details in table 2 requires daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data as inputs and divides flow into two stores the production store and the routing store the production store whose capacity is represented as Œ∏ 1 gains water from effective rainfall and loses water through evaporation and percolation percolated water joins that which has bypassed the production store and is routed with a fixed split in which 90 is propagated through slow routing with a unit hydrograph uh1 with the time lag Œ∏ 4 while the other 10 is propagated through fast routing with another single unit hydrograph uh2 with the time lag 2 Œ∏ 4 additionally a groundwater exchange that acts on both flow components is calculated with the groundwater exchange coefficient Œ∏ 2 and capacity of the routing store Œ∏ 3 the hydrological model hymod is a watershed scale conceptual rainfall runoff model based on the probability distributed theory introduced by moore 1985 and originally developed by boyle et al 2003 this model describes runoff generation using a rainfall excess model which is based on a nonlinear water storage capacity distribution function whose maximum storage capacity is represented as cmax and spatial variability degree of the soil moisture capacity is represented as bexp the routing system is reflected by two sets of linear tanks the ratio Œ± of flow goes to the quick release reservoirs which is a sequence of three quick flow tanks with the residence time kq describing the surface flow the ratio 1 Œ± of flow goes to a slow flow tank with the residence time ks describing the groundwater the details of the hymod parameters are described in table 2 3 2 case study 1 synthetic data in building the synthetic data the true precipitation x is set as the daily average precipitation of 10 rain gauges in the catchment in the real case covering 2001 11 04 to 2007 04 27 2000 days the details of rain gauges are described in table 4 the potential evapotranspiration is set as zero in the synthetic case to remove its impact in calculating the effective rainfall and to make the forcing data error only a function of precipitation the true output y is the simulated streamflow via the gr4j model corresponding to the true input x and model parameters set as the reference values in table 2 i e y y g r 4 j s m g r 4 j x Œ∏ g r 4 j the observed precipitation x o is built by multiplying the exponential noise to the true precipitation and the noise is sampled from an assumed error distribution as eq 9 9 x i o x i exp Œµ x i x i o 0 Œµ x n 0 2 0 5 2 to introduce the model structural error Œµ m the synthetic case calibrates the hymod parameters to fit the true gr4j simulation y therefore the synthetic case considers three scenarios the details are shown in table 3 scenario 1 only suffers from the input error and parameter error in model calibration scenario 2 and scenario 3 additionally suffer from the model structural error in some real life applications the error parameters œÉ and Œº in this study are challenging to estimate precisely before calibration the following case studies will attempt to calibrate these error parameters along with model parameters to explore the ability of the bear method in wider applications therefore all scenarios are based on the assumption of the true error distribution family like x o x exp Œµ x Œµ x n Œº œÉ 2 and infer the error parameters Œº and œÉ in the calibration scenario 3 has accurate prior information about Œº while scenario 1 and scenario 2 estimate Œº from a uniform distribution ranging from 5 to 5 this study sets the objective function as the mean squared error mse of the model residuals and discards a warmup period of 365 days from the objective function calculation to reduce the impacts of unknown initial conditions fig 3 compares the results of the four calibration methods via the posterior distribution of the error parameters and the taylor diagram taylor diagram taylor 2001 is used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the estimated and true behavior in terms of three statistics the pearson correlation coefficient the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation estimated patterns that agree well with the true behavior will lie nearest to the point marked observed on the x axis in each population of the abc smc calibration scheme 50 sets of model parameters are updated therefore there are 50 plots to show the results for each method marked in different colors in fig 3 in scenario 1 where the modeling only suffers from the input error and parameter error the plots show consistent hierarchy in the methods where r ar r d for the well performance of estimating the input error fig 3 1a modifying the input data fig 3 1b and model simulation fig 3 1c method r ar even improves the correlations of both input and output to 0 98 it illustrates that this new algorithm can identify the input error series effectively in the model calibration even when these input errors have a systematic bias Œº 0 2 but scenario 1 does not suffer from model structural error in scenario 2 and 3 where the model structural error is added in the hymod calibration the method performance depends on the prior information on the error parameters if Œº is constrained to the true value 0 2 in scenario 3 method r ar still outperforms other methods the pink plots are closest to the observed point in all the figures fig 3 3a 3b and 3c although the advantage is not distinct as in scenario 1 if Œº and œÉ are inferred in the calibration in scenario 2 the estimated errors via the method r and r ar have a higher correlation fig 3 2c and a more accurate sd estimation fig 3 2d than method d but for the modification of the input fig 3 2b and output fig 3 2c the plots of all the methods almost overlap these unimproved results via method r ar and method r are probably caused by more uncertain estimations of Œº fig 3 2d which is often impaired by the model structural error the impacts of model structural error will be discussed further in section 4 4 3 3 case study 2 real data in order to explore the ability of the bear algorithm in a real situation this study undertakes an application in the macintyre river catchment at inverell middle creek in new south wales nsw australia this study catchment is a part of the macintyre river basin located in the northern tablelands of nsw with the area of 726 km2 macintyre river is a perennial river that forms part of the border rivers group in this catchment we collected daily observations of streamflow potential evaporation and precipitation at the outlet station station id 416016 and the daily precipitation data of other nine rainfall gauges in this catchment covering the period from 2001 11 04 to 2007 04 27 2000 days these data can be accessed at https realtimedata waternsw com au more details of these stations can be seen in table 4 and their location is given in fig 4 considering the presence of multiple rain gauges the model calibration using each gauge separately will indicate the range of potential input uncertainty due to representational error and a weighted average of the gauges will approach an approximation of the true rainfall data this study calculates the mean of rainfall from ten available rainfall gauges as the areal rainfall referring to average in the following figures and compare its estimated results with other results using data from each rainfall gauge separately according to the related studies ajami et al 2007 kavetski et al 2006 the relationship between the precipitation observation and its error in this real case is also assumed to follow eq 1 if the rainfall data of r1 station is regarded as the true value the data error for all the rain gauges can be approximated as the difference between the rainfall data of r1 station and the rest 10 sets of rainfall data after analyzing these data errors the mean Œº and sd œÉ of the normal distribution in eq 1 is assessed as 0 and 0 46 respectively to test the ability of the bear method in more common situations with imprecise prior information on the input error in the calibration of this real case Œº is fixed as 0 but œÉ is inferred assuming a prior range of 0 5 0 46 can be regarded as the reference value of input error œÉ green line in fig 5 b the three methods incorporating the input errors are compared in terms of rmse of the model residuals and the œÉ estimation shown in fig 5 regardless of the rainfall data sources method r and method r ar applying the reordering strategy always bring a much lower rmse on the model output than method d between the method r and method r ar there is no significant difference for the fit of model outputs fig 6 selects two sets of input data from station r1 and average to demonstrate the dynamic of their estimations via different methods fig 6 shows between two data sets the uncertainty bands of simulation via the method d and method t change a lot while the uncertainty bands of simulation via the method r and method r ar are consistent from the above the estimations via method t and method d depend more on the input data accuracy while method r and method r ar are more impacted by the output observations in situations where the output observation is more accurate than the input observation the reordering strategy outperforms the traditional methods compared with the reference value of œÉ in the real case green line in fig 5 b except for the result of r2 other œÉ estimations via method d are generally lower than it which is the same as the results in the synthetic case shown in fig 3 d and the conclusion explored in the study of renard et al 2009 compared with method d the reordering strategy applied in method r and method r ar brings more stable estimates among the different rainfall data sources in one catchment the statistical features of input errors among different gauges should be quite similar due to the close locations and similar impacts of weather conditions besides the majority of the estimates via method r and method r ar are closer to the reference values than method d given the above claims method r ar and r lead to a better quantification of input errors than method d 4 discussion 4 1 the ability of the rank estimation in quantifying input errors according to the above comparisons the results of the synthetic data study fig 3 and the real data study fig 5 both support that the reordering strategy applied in method r and r ar can reduce the impacts of input errors in calibration and give a better fit to the output observations method r r ar and d have the same basic underlying motivation in that they counteract the impact of input error by removing the estimated error which is also the general concept in other existing methods ajami et al 2007 kavetski et al 2006 renard et al 2009 for each of these approaches it is necessary to set an assumption about the error distribution like eq 1 and sample the error from this distribution if the sampled errors are coincidentally similar to the true input errors the impact of the input errors will be eliminated and the simulation will be improved but the probability of this is negligible and it is likely that imprecise errors will be sampled therefore the variability of random errors will reduce to minimize the adverse impacts of the wrong estimations that s why method d always underestimates the sd of input errors demonstrated in fig 3 d and fig 5 b like the comments from renard et al 2009 on the approach in ibune ajami et al 2007 the randomness in the objective function will lead to an underestimation of the error variance if the input error distribution can be estimated in advance the value equivalence can be transformed into a rank equivalence a continuous sequence of data has an infinite potential error value while the error rank has a limited number of possible values equal to the data length reducing the number of possible optimizations dramatically will improve the efficiency of updating input errors significantly besides the adjustment of error rank relative magnitude is an improvement based on the ibune approach which avoids the high computing dimensions existed in batea in the reordering strategy via the secant method the optimal error rank is not random but determined by the residual error varying with the generated model parameters so this strategy is not subject to the randomness deficiency in ibune posterior distribution and provides more promising results supported by the comparison of method d and method r in fig 3 and fig 5 the application of the secant method can effectively optimize the input error to minimize the model residual error if the input error is dominant in the total uncertainty minimizing the model residual has a similar effect of minimizing the input error from the above the rank estimation via the secant method can improve the efficiency and accuracy of input error identification in model calibration but its ability is limited by the assumption that the input error should be dominant in the total error it should be noted that the secant method is an iterative approximation which needs multiple iterations according to the discussion in section 2 5 the maximum number of iterations q should be set to reduce the calculation loss arising from the large parameter error fig a1 demonstrates that when q is smaller than 10 the ability of method r ar improves slightly with the increasing q when q is larger than 10 the statistics are almost the same q 10 is a suitable set for this synthetic case compared with different strategies applied in method d and method r ar the selection of q plays a much less important role in the quantification ability therefore q 10 can be applied in other cases given the value of q doesn t have much effect on the outcomes 4 2 the setting of lag time between forcing data and response in hydrologic systems the response caused by an input is generally not instantaneous the travel time of rainfall to the catchment outlet should be considered to make sure the correspondence between forcing data and response the travel time considered in the bear method is not event based but data based seen in fig 1 section 2 3 introduces a new method to calculate the data based lag time by decomposing the simulated hydrograph for each positive precipitation input in the application of the gr4j model the data based lag times for all the positive inputs are the same and they are related to the gr4j parameter Œ∏ 4 therefore the synthetic data with different true lag times can be generated regarding different Œ∏ 4 settings three sets of synthetic data with different true lag times are generated and calibrated in the same process as scenario 1 in table 3 considering the different approaches to address the lag time including calculating the lag time via the method in section 2 2 denoted cal in fig 7 and fixing the lag time as 0 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 7 demonstrates that for all the synthetic data with different true lag times the accuracy of the lag time setting is significant for the quantification of input errors and cal algorithm can identify the lag time precisely and bring the same performance as the true lag time setting it is the nature of gr4j that estimated lag times are approximately the same for all inputs and depend on the parameter Œ∏ 4 in this case the algorithm for method r ar can be simplified for computational efficiency after the model parameters are generated there is no need to calculate the lag times for all input data the average lag time for a select data sub set for example 10 forcing data observations can be assumed to approximate the lag time for the entire time series referred to herein as lag the lag time lag i in eq 7 then does not change with the time step i but is fixed at a single value this algorithm simplification can only be applied for model structures such as gr4j where the data based lag times are the same for all the inputs as examples the hydrologic model hymod boyle et al 2003 has the same nature but the australian water balance model awbm boughton 2004 does not when the awbm parameters are fixed the data based lag times will be time varying it should be noted that this lag time is analyzed from the simulated hydrograph while the observed hydrograph is commonly used in analyzing the event based lag time given the error is propagated in the model the calculation from the modeled hydrograph is more suitable for quantifying errors this approach is also flexible for other types of inputs for a catchment where snowmelt processes interact with rainfall the algorithm can be adapted to consider the sum of snowmelt and rainfall in the same way as rainfall data alone because this lag time is calculated from the modeled hydrograph which is fixed when the model parameter has been sampled 4 3 the usefulness of incorporating an autoregressive ar error model a significant advancement of the bear methodology applied here is in the use of an autoregressive model to explicitly represent the persistence of residual errors fig 3 demonstrates that in scenario 1 without the model structural error method r ar outperforms method r apparently while in scenario 2 where the model structural error is added the advantage of method r ar is not distinct but in scenario 3 where the mean of input error is accurate as the prior information the method r ar can have a better performance than method r again it suggests that the introduction of the model structural error impairs estimation of the systematic bias of the input data if this deficiency can be solved by accurate prior information on the mean of input error the ability of the ar model can be taken advantage of even in the real case shown in fig 5 where more error sources interfere the œÉ estimations via method r ar are generally nearer to the reference value than method r under an assumption of zero mean it suggests that addressing the autocorrelation in the model residuals via employing the ar model can improve the correspondence between the residual error and input error and then promote the precision of the input error quantification in the bear method the ar model is built by analyzing the model residuals via pacf so it changes with the varied model residuals its coefficients are easy to estimate but its order is hard to select automatically in the calibration the order of the ar model should be fixed in the whole approach in fig a2 the results corresponding to its order from 1 to 5 are compared the result with the order as 2 shows the best performance but the difference is not appreciable among different ar models and all results via method r ar show better fits to the true input and output data than method r not using an ar model therefore 2 is a suitable set for the order of the ar model and this value can be extended to other cases not making much difference to the outcome 4 4 the impacts of different sources of error if the model only suffers from input error and parameter error like scenario 1 in fig 3 the performance hierarchy of the different methods is r ar r d for method r ar the correlation with the true input and true output can even be up to 0 98 this means the application of the ar model and the reordering strategy can improve the identification of the input error and parameter error significantly in other words the impacts of parameter error can be effectively isolated by the bear algorithm under this error condition in the abc smc calibration schemes the tolerance of the total error sequentially reduces which will constrain the parameter error effectively a more accurate estimation of the model parameter will improve the quantification of input errors considering the interactions between input errors and model parameter errors when other sources of error are included the method r and method r ar implemented using a reordering strategy still improve the result compared to method d according to the above discussion of the synthetic case fig 3 and real case fig 5 this suggests that the reordering strategy is sufficiently robust to approximate the true input errors even in the real case with the interference from potential streamflow observational errors and model structural errors but the introduction of model structural error does undermine its advantages mainly impairing the estimation of input error mean demonstrated by the comparison of scenario 2 and scenario 1 in fig 3 we can reason that this result is similar to the potential impacts of output streamflow observational error when the model structural error and output observational error become more dominant the input error estimation is less effective considering the effectiveness of the ar model the presence of other sources of error will reduce the capacity of the reordering strategy to identify input errors in the real case method r ar does not show a distinct advantage over method r this suggests that the calculated ar model cannot represent the model structural error properly and conflicts with the independence of the output observational errors if the streamflow observational errors and model structural error can be considered alongside the input errors as in the batea framework renard et al 2010 and ibune approach ajami et al 2007 the identification of input errors via the bear method might be improved by alleviating the impacts of other sources of error it should be noted that the above discussion focuses on uncertainty quantification in model calibration schemes analyzing the impacts of other sources of uncertainty on the model parameter estimates this is similar to the hydrologic uncertainty identified in the bayesian forecasting system bfs krzysztofowicz 1999 in the bfs framework more accurate knowledge of the input uncertainty and parameter estimation will support an improved hydrological forecast krzysztofowicz 1999 however applying this information to improve the hydrological forecast is not the aim of this study 5 conclusion input error as a major source of modeling uncertainty should be quantified carefully in hydrologic model calibration to improve parameter estimation updating input errors according to model residuals is challenging because a backward model transformation of inputs generally cannot be derived analytically and is inefficient numerically furthermore in a hydrologic system the delay in response and the system persistence complicates attempts to find the corresponding and independent parts of the response to each input to deal with these problems a new algorithm bayesian error analysis with reordering bear method r ar in the above discussion has been developed in the following ways 1 applying the secant method to calculate the direction and magnitude of input error rank changes and improve updating efficiency 2 considering the data based lag time between the model input and output to identify the corresponding response for an input 3 applying an ar model in evaluating errors in the response to explicitly include the system persistence in the model calibration through the analysis of synthetic data and real data these actions in the bear method have been proven robust to improve the modification of input data and simulation in a hydrologic model however the results highlight several further considerations to address first prior knowledge about the input errors offers a significant advantage especially knowledge of the error mean this study only considers one type of assumption about input errors that they follow a lognormal distribution and are multiplicative as per eq 1 in fact other probability distributions and formulations could also be considered in this method and their implementation is flexible and easy further work will be aimed at developing appropriate model selection techniques that will robustly compare alternative input error assumptions besides this study promotes the identification of input errors by modifying the residual error model to address the persistency and delay problem when incorporating other properties e g heteroscedasticity and zero inflation mcinerney et al 2017 wu et al 2019 smith et al 2015 their influence in the uncertainty decomposition needs more comprehensive understanding last but not least the bear method is effective under the assumption that the input error is dominant and the capacity of the reordering strategy and ar model is limited by the impacts of model structural error and the output observational error if these sources of error can be comprehensively identified along with the input error the error decomposition will be improved fundamentally but developing the rank estimation in quantifying multiple sources of error needs more careful examinations from the above based on the current bear algorithm more extensions can be explored in more complex applications or other environmental systems with a persistent response credit authorship contribution statement xia wu

4542,input error in hydrologic models mainly arising from observed precipitation can impair model calibration precise and reliable identification of input error is important for improved model parameter estimation however limited information about the nature of the error and the memory of the hydrologic system make it challenging to disentangle input error from the total residual error based on a sequential monte carlo sampling algorithm bayesian error analysis with reordering bear method is developed to quantify the unknown input error series by sampling errors from an assumed error distribution and reordering them with inferred error ranks via the secant method rather than estimating their values directly the results of a synthetic case and a real case using the hydrologic models gr4j and hymod show several benefits of this new approach 1 the reordering strategy via the secant method can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of input error quantification and consequently promote the parameter estimation 2 an autoregressive model can address the persistence of hydrologic residual errors in calibration 3 the lag time between the forcing data and the corresponding response can be explicitly acknowledged when the system exhibits a delayed response this developed bear algorithm can be extended to other environmental modeling studies with correlated or and delayed responses although its ability is limited by the impacts of model structural error and the output observational error 1 introduction input error is one of the major sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling it mainly arises from uncertain precipitation data due to imprecise measurement at the point scale and imperfect representativeness at the areal scale mcmillan et al 2012 point measurement uncertainty consists of systematic error and random error systematic error can be assessed via a comparison with data from control gauges neff 1977 and its error sources effects and related corrections typically depend on the gauge types sevruk 1982 1996 in contrast random error cannot be corrected in theory but its statistical characteristics e g coefficient of variation cv and standard deviation sd can be estimated via a comparison with data from co located rain gauges goodrich et al 1995 krajewski et al 2003 hutchinson 1969 representational error is introduced when estimating mean areal precipitation from point measurements due to the spatial variability of precipitation its magnitude can be evaluated as the standard error in a single gauge measurement vs a gauge network wood et al 2000 which generally increases with catchment size mcmillan et al 2012 as an alternative quantitative precipitation estimation qpe from radar data can directly measure areal precipitation avoiding representational error however this approach will bring another type of uncertainty arising from the reflectivity rain rate z r relationship chumchean et al 2003 villarini and krajewski 2010 the error model for this surrogate process can be estimated by analyzing the difference between radar estimates and gauge network data kirstetter et al 2010 seo and krajewski 2010 wood et al 2000 in general despite improvements in data collection and remote sensing technologies precipitation data error is inevitable however the above studies describing their statistical characterization can provide prior knowledge about input error in hydrological modeling the presence of input errors might significantly impair model calibration leading to biased parameter estimates b√°rdossy and das 2008 huard and mailhot 2006 improving model performance necessitates sound quantification of input uncertainty and several approaches have been developed to isolate input uncertainty from the total uncertainty in model calibration the bayesian total error analysis batea method provides a framework for quantifying the input error series in a bayesian calibration scheme kavetski et al 2006 event varying input errors the same value for one storm event are defined as multipliers on the input time series and inferred with the model parameters which leads to a high dimensional computation challenge to overcome this batea explored a two stage markov chain monte carlo mcmc strategy to reduce the cpu time to 5 41 hours for applications having 418 inferred variables renard et al 2010 however the application in identifying daily varying errors one error value for one input data can introduce an excessive number of inferred variables and the increased dimensionality will make it impractical to estimate due to the increased computation cost haario et al 2005 therefore if input errors and model parameters are calibrated as a whole the high dimensionality challenge cannot be avoided and will limit the algorithm applications renard et al 2009 another typical approach the integrated bayesian uncertainty estimator ibune ajami et al 2007 is based on the same hierarchical conceptualization of input uncertainty as batea using rainfall multipliers to represent the rainfall error and assuming these multipliers follow a gaussian distribution in this approach the multipliers are not jointly inferred with model parameters but randomly sampled from the assumed distribution and filtered by maximizing the likelihood function although this approach reduces the calculation dimension significantly and can be applied to estimate daily varying multipliers the inherent randomness will lead to an underestimation of multiplier variance and misidentification of the uncertainty sources renard et al 2009 from the above this study will follow the approach of ibune which avoids the high dimensionality problem but explore a new strategy to improve the accuracy of multiplier inference and model parameter estimation if the statistical features of precipitation error can be characterized in advance this prior knowledge can be taken advantage of to build an error model for the input data in hydrological modeling then a bayesian hierarchical framework such as ibune ajami et al 2007 can be implemented to identify the data based input errors in the calibration process unlike directly estimating the error values in current methods a new strategy is developed in this study to estimate the error ranks for a sample of the error values because the error model has been pre specified the error values only depend on their ranks in a certain cumulative distribution function cdf if input error dominates over other sources of error each error rank can be updated according to the changes of its corresponding model residuals under the assumption that the optimal error rank leads to the least residual error this new method consists of two procedures sampling the errors from the estimated error model and reordering them according to the inferred ranks unlike updating all the error multipliers as a whole in the batea framework this strategy attempts to optimize each of them separately by identifying the residual parts they affect this is referred to as the bayesian error analysis with reordering bear method the bear method has been successfully applied in the quantification of observational errors of system outputs and inputs in a water quality context where the model responses can be regarded to be independent wu et al 2020 this suggests the method may hold some promise for use in other types of environmental systems however input error identification in hydrologic models requires special care due to the propagation of model inputs over multiple time steps i e the persistence of the hydrologic system furthermore the response caused by an input is frequently not instantaneous but delayed in time and the lag time of a single forcing data is not easy to estimate from a specific hydrograph for all the inputs these two problems should be addressed to extend the application of the bear method in more fields such as hydrological modeling the derivation and details of the bear algorithm in quantifying input errors in a hydrologic model are described in section 2 this study selects the hydrologic models gr4j and hymod to illustrate the approach section 3 introduces these two models and presents the results for a synthetic case and a real case in this way the new algorithm is tested in a controlled situation where the true values of each source of errors are known and a realistic situation with the interference of multiple unknown error sources section 4 evaluates the new algorithm and its implementation finally section 5 outlines the main conclusions and recommendations for this work 2 methodology 2 1 bayesian error analysis with reordering bear method based on an approximate bayesian computation sequential monte carlo abc smc calibration algorithm jeremiah et al 2011 sisson et al 2007 the bayesian error analysis with reordering bear methodology employs latent variables to counteract the impact of errors from an individual source in model calibration these unknown time varying errors are quantified via a sampling and reordering strategy to realize the same rank between the latent variable and the true error in a pre estimated error distribution the derivation of the bear algorithm is described as following here and in the following contents a capital bold letter e g x y represents a vector and a lower case e g x y represents a variable frequently precipitation error can be represented as a multiplier ajami et al 2007 kavetski et al 2006 thus the precipitation observation can be described via eq 1 1 x o x exp Œµ x Œµ x n Œº œÉ 2 where the asterisk implies the true value without error the observed precipitation x o is defined as the true precipitation x multiplied by the exponential error exp Œµ x where Œµ x refers to the precipitation error assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean Œº and sd œÉ in this study the bear algorithm is developed starting from a simple situation where the model only suffers from input errors precipitation errors and parameter errors in such a condition the model residual error Œµ in a traditional calibration can be represented via eq 2 2 Œµ y s y o m x o Œ∏ m c y m x exp Œµ x Œ∏ m c y where y s is the output simulated from the model m corresponding to the observed input x o and model parameter Œ∏ m c and the observed output y o is assumed without observational errors in the derivation thus can be denoted as y in the calibration via the bear method the proposed error Œµ x p is introduced to counteract the impact of true input errors then the proposed model residual Œµ p will be calculated via eq 3 3 Œµ p y p y o m x p Œ∏ m c y m x exp Œµ x exp Œµ x p Œ∏ m c y m x o exp Œµ x p Œ∏ m c y where the observed input x o and simulated output y s in eq 2 are modified as x p and y p via dividing exp Œµ x p from the observation x o to eliminate impacts of input errors the proposed errors Œµ x p are sampled from the pre estimated error distribution n Œº œÉ 2 and therefore approximate the distribution of the true input errors Œµ x when the distributions of two error sets Œµ x p and Œµ x are the same and the error number is large enough the individual error samples corresponding to the equivalent ranks will be similar when the data length is small or the error variance is large sampling bias will be introduced whereby error samples with the same ranks will correspond to quite different values in a calibration scheme incorporating data based input errors the error number is sufficiently large e g greater than 1000 time steps for the case studies presented here to alleviate the impacts of sampling bias this statement is supported by the precise error quantification in the later synthetic case if the model parameters Œ∏ m c converge to the true parameters Œ∏ m the optimal error ranks will reduce the residual to zero in eq 3 because the equivalent ranks ensure the elimination of input errors Œµ x by dividing the estimated error Œµ x p therefore the estimation of input error can be converted to optimizing the input error rank denoted as k through minimizing the model residual under the assumption that the input error is dominant in the residual error 2 2 the application of the secant method the first challenge in the bear method is to develop the relationship between the input error rank and the corresponding model residual it is trivial to calculate the model residual corresponding to the input error rank however the backward calculation is usually not tractable because the inverse model transformation cannot be derived analytically from the model equations especially for non linear models mostly common in the environmental modeling field under the assumption that the model residual error mainly comes from the input uncertainty the accurate identification of the time varying input errors will reduce the residuals to zero this approach of modifying the input error rank can be regarded as a root finding problem where the root is the optimal error rank and the function is model residual equal to zero an iterative approximation the secant method ralston and jennrich 1978 can be applied to realize it but needs some adaptions the main steps are 1 n is equal to the number of estimated input errors i represents the time step of error i 1 2 n q represents the sequence number of error rank iteration in the secant method q 1 sample one set of errors Œµ x i 1 p i 1 2 n from the assumed error distribution n Œº œÉ 2 and sort them respectively to obtain the initial error rank k i 1 i 1 2 n corresponding to these sampled errors calculate the modified input x i 1 p i 1 2 n the modified output y i 1 p i 1 2 n and the modified model residuals Œµ i 1 p i 1 2 n q 2 repeat the above calculation to get a new set of Œµ x i 2 p k i 2 x i 2 p y i 2 p and Œµ i 2 p i 1 2 n an example to illustrate this step has been demonstrated in the 1st iteration and 2nd iteration in table 1 2 q q 1 calculate the pre rank k i q respectively for each error i 1 2 n via the secant method 4 k i q k i q 1 Œµ i q 1 p k i q 1 k i q 2 Œµ i q 1 p Œµ i q 2 p where k i q represents the updated rank of input error at time step i and iteration q Œµ i q 1 p is the model residual corresponding to k i q 1 k i 3 i 1 2 n in table 1 is calculated by eq 4 3 sort all the pre ranks k i q i 1 2 n to obtain the post ranks k i q i 1 2 n 5 k i q k k i q after calculating eq 4 the pre rank k i q may be out of the rank range for example less than 1 or more than n or not an integer like k i 3 in table 1 ranking the pre rank k i q i 1 n can address this problem by scaling the pre ranks to integers from 1 to n therefore a post rank set k i q i 1 2 n is obtained k i 3 is shown in table 1 4 reorder the errors sampled in the 2nd iteration according to the post rank k i q to form the inferred error series Œµ x i q p i 1 2 n for example the post rank at the 2nd time step in the 3rd iteration is 10 and its corresponding value in the 2nd iteration is 0 79 therefore 0 79 is the updated input error at the 2nd time step in the 3rd iteration demonstrated by the bold numbers in table 1 5 according to the new input error Œµ x i q p calculate the new input x i q p i 1 2 n the new output y i q p i 1 2 n and the new model residuals Œµ i q p i 1 2 n this step is demonstrated in the 3rd iteration in table 1 6 calculate the objective function if its result is smaller than the tolerance of total error the estimated input errors are accepted otherwise return to step 2 and start a new updating via the secant method 2 3 considering the lag time between forcing data and response the approach summarized above has been successfully applied in the context of the build up wash off model bwmod in catchments with quick response times at the time scale of interest such as an urban area with hourly to daily time steps wu et al 2020 in that case the response sediment dynamics caused by the forcing data river flow is generally instantaneous however in hydrological systems the response at the outlet to an input rainfall event is frequently not instantaneous a lag time is often observed representing the travel time of rainfall to the catchment outlet and this can only be derived by analysis of the observed hydrograph or the modeled hydrograph in instances where the effective lag time of the model is being approximated it should be noted that the lag time in the bear method is different from the lag time we usually define in hydrologic applications the common definition of lag time is event based shown in fig 1 a referred to as the time difference between the centroid of the effective rainfall hyetograph and the peak of runoff hydrograph watt and chow 1985 while the lag time in the bear method is data based shown in fig 1 c referred to as the time elapsed between each rainfall data and the occurrence of its caused runoff the focus changing from the event based lag time to the data based lag time aims to ensure the effective optimization of each input error respectively to estimate the data based lag time it is necessary to derive the separate hydrograph caused by each input from the whole hydrograph this study developed an approach to address it demonstrated as the process from panel a to c in fig 1 the decomposed hydrograph only caused by input p1 the first hydrograph in fig 1 c can be calculated by the original whole hydrograph fig 1 a subtracting the new hydrograph caused by the input series where p1 is set as zero first hydrograph in fig 1 b according to the decomposed hydrograph in fig 1 c the data based lag time for input p1 is 1 here it should be noted that the hydrograph of p1 cannot be directly calculated by simulating the hydrograph with the input p1 alone because it suffers from the impacts of initial conditions or baseflow the lag time referred to as the time difference between the input and its first positive response will be always assessed as zero when the lag time has been calculated for each input the corresponding residual Œµ i q 1 p and Œµ i q 2 p in eq 4 should be changed to Œµ i l a g i q 1 p and Œµ i l a g i q 2 p in the applications of the models with delayed responses 2 4 considering the persistence of hydrologic model response with low persistence in time the input and response in bwmod can be assumed to approximate a one to one corresponding relation in other words each input error impacts the model residual of one time step however in hydrologic systems the response arising from one forcing data will persist for multiple time steps depending on the time scale of the model and the catchment functioning sorooshian and dracup 1980 this model storage representation and the inherent correlations in streamflow observations will lead to a memory effect in the model residual error kuczera 1983 the persistence in the model residual will challenge the effectiveness of the reordering strategy thus it should be addressed to ensure the correspondence between the input error and the part of residual error the persistence in the model residual is frequently represented via an autoregressive ar model schaefli et al 2007 its order p and coefficients œï 1 œï p can be derived from the analysis of the model residual order p should be set as the lag value after which the partial autocorrelation function pacf plot crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time box et al 2015 but in the calibration it is difficult to decide the order p for each model residual automatically by the code the order p should be fixed properly in advance the discussion about it will be carried out in section 4 3 coefficients of the ar p model can be calculated via the parcorr function in matlab if the order of the ar model is set as 2 and the calculated coefficients are œï 1 and œï 2 the processed model residual at time step i and iteration q can be described via eq 6 6 œâ i q p Œµ i q p œï 1 Œµ i 1 q p œï 2 Œµ i 2 q p the processed model residual œâ i q p removes the impacts arising from the residuals at the previous time steps and their impacts are represented via an ar model therefore in a hydrologic model considering the correlated and delayed responses eq 4 should be modified as 7 k i q k i q 1 œâ i l a g i q 1 p k i q 1 k i q 2 œâ i l a g i q 1 p œâ i l a g i q 2 p 2 5 algorithm and example the bear method is thus adapted to consider both the persistence of the hydrologic system and the potential lag time between the model input and output a summary of the resulting algorithm is demonstrated in fig 2 and an illustrative example is presented in table 1 if the observed input is represented in the form of eq 1 zero precipitation will always stay zero regardless of the observational error under this assumption the algorithm first selects the positive precipitation inputs and sets their number n as the number of sampled errors it should be noted that if the input observational error is assumed to be additive the error associated with zero precipitation observations should also be considered in the example of table 1 the number of positive inputs is 10 therefore the number of sampled errors is 10 the bear method is developed based on the abc smc calibration scheme in this scheme s is the number of the sequential populations which increases until the objective function of the sth population is less than the final tolerance œÑ the final tolerance œÑ stopping criteria is difficult to set before calibration due to the unknown range of objective function results but it can be estimated after calibrating several populations according to the target accuracy and the actual calculation range of the objective functions in this study the calibration stops when 1000 proposed parameter sets are rejected in a row the first tolerance œÑ 1 is set based on the actual calculation of the first population to ensure sufficient variability in the initial population of parameters the intermediate tolerance œÑ s is set as the 30 quantile of the objective function results of population s 1 which can reduce automatically with a new population calculation in each population model parameters Œ∏ m are generated from the prior distribution or the posterior distribution of the previous population but in the example of table 1 Œ∏ m is set as the reference values in table 2 i e Œ∏1 350 Œ∏ 2 0 Œ∏3 90 Œ∏4 2 5 letting the results focus on the impacts of the reordering strategy when the parameter errors are removed in the actual algorithm when one parameter set is generated the corresponding data based lag time can be assessed from the simulated hydrograph via the method described in section 2 3 in the example in table 1 the analyzed lag times for all the positive inputs are 1 i e lag i 1 i 1 2 10 corresponding to the parameter set Œ∏ m Œ∏1 350 Œ∏ 2 0 Œ∏3 90 Œ∏4 2 5 therefore in the calculation of the error rank k i 3 via the secant method eq 7 in the 3rd iteration the applied œâ i 1 1 p and œâ i 1 2 p are not at the same time step of the input but at a 1 time step delay demonstrated by the bold numbers in table 1 when one parameter set is generated the input error ranks are updated for q iterations following the steps described in section 2 2 q increases until the objective function is less than the tolerance set for each population œÑ s but the tolerance is not enough to stop the iterations in the bear method the model parameters and input error ranks are optimized together if the model parameters are far away from the true values no amount of modifications of the input error ranks will reduce the objective function smaller than the tolerance in order to improve computational efficiency the maximum number of iterations q should be set properly if q exceeds q the algorithm returns to the step of resampling the model parameters seen in fig 2 the discussion about setting q will be taken in section 4 1 in the 1st and 2nd iteration the input errors are sampled from the assumed error distribution f Œ∑ Œµ and randomly distributed at different time steps demonstrated as Œµ x i 1 p in the 1st iteration and Œµ x i 2 p in the 2nd iteration in table 1 corresponding to the sampled errors we can calculate the input error ranks k i q k Œµ x i q p modified inputs x i q p x i o exp Œµ x i q p new simulated outputs y i q p m x q p Œ∏ m i and model residuals Œµ i q p y i q p y i o in this study the order of the ar model for the model residual is assumed as 2 the reason is explained in section 4 3 the coefficients of the ar model are calculated via the parcorr function in matlab but in the example of table 1 the data length is too short to show the autocorrelation in residuals its coefficients are set as 0 6 and 0 2 respectively to continue the approach demonstration then the autocorrelation in residuals is processed via eq 6 and the processed residual œâ i q p is used in the updating via the secant method two sets of samples are prerequisites for the calculation via the secant method thus from the 3rd iteration the input error ranks are updated via eq 7 and 5 according to the new rank k i q the corresponding input value is searched in the 2nd iteration after the same reordering strategy the re ranked input errors will lead to a new set of modified inputs model outputs and residuals a new iteration via eq 7 and 5 will be carried out until the resulting objective function is less than the tolerance œÑ s or the number of iterations q exceeds the maximum number q table 1 illustrates that in the 3rd iteration the mse of the modified input x 3 p vs the true input x and the simulated output y 3 p vs the true output y both reduces which supports the hypothesis of the bear method that reordering the input errors via the secant method can effectively push the estimated errors to approach the actual input errors with the aim of minimizing the objective function of the residuals 2 6 comparison with other methods to make a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of the bear method in parameter estimation and input error quantification this study compares four alternative calibration methods denoted as methods t d r r ar method t is the traditional method directly using the observed input in calibration without considering the impacts of input error this method can be considered what is traditionally done in the hydrologic model implementation where the observed input is assumed to be error free the other three methods explicitly incorporate the uncertainty in the model inputs introducing a latent variable dividing the observed input like eq 8 to counteract the impacts of multiplicative input error method d refers to the assumed distribution of the input error which is additional apriori information that is included in the model calibration from this assumed error distribution the input error sets are randomly sampled and filtered by the minimization of the objective function this approach is similar to the means of dealing with input error in ibune framework ajami et al 2007 the remaining methods are variants of the bear algorithm method r ar is the algorithm developed in the preceding sections where r represents the reordering strategy via the secant method and ar denotes the autoregressive model to address the memory effects of the model residual method r applies the reordering strategy alone without considering the persistence of the response 8 x i p x i o exp Œµ i p Œµ p n 0 œÉ 2 3 case studies 3 1 hydrologic model gr4j and hymod first the ability of the bear method is tested in a synthetic case where the true values of each source of errors are known in order to introduce the model structural error two conceptual rainfall runoff models gr4j and hymod are selected to build the synthetic data the gr4j perrin et al 2003 is a lumped daily conceptual model with four free parameters details in table 2 requires daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data as inputs and divides flow into two stores the production store and the routing store the production store whose capacity is represented as Œ∏ 1 gains water from effective rainfall and loses water through evaporation and percolation percolated water joins that which has bypassed the production store and is routed with a fixed split in which 90 is propagated through slow routing with a unit hydrograph uh1 with the time lag Œ∏ 4 while the other 10 is propagated through fast routing with another single unit hydrograph uh2 with the time lag 2 Œ∏ 4 additionally a groundwater exchange that acts on both flow components is calculated with the groundwater exchange coefficient Œ∏ 2 and capacity of the routing store Œ∏ 3 the hydrological model hymod is a watershed scale conceptual rainfall runoff model based on the probability distributed theory introduced by moore 1985 and originally developed by boyle et al 2003 this model describes runoff generation using a rainfall excess model which is based on a nonlinear water storage capacity distribution function whose maximum storage capacity is represented as cmax and spatial variability degree of the soil moisture capacity is represented as bexp the routing system is reflected by two sets of linear tanks the ratio Œ± of flow goes to the quick release reservoirs which is a sequence of three quick flow tanks with the residence time kq describing the surface flow the ratio 1 Œ± of flow goes to a slow flow tank with the residence time ks describing the groundwater the details of the hymod parameters are described in table 2 3 2 case study 1 synthetic data in building the synthetic data the true precipitation x is set as the daily average precipitation of 10 rain gauges in the catchment in the real case covering 2001 11 04 to 2007 04 27 2000 days the details of rain gauges are described in table 4 the potential evapotranspiration is set as zero in the synthetic case to remove its impact in calculating the effective rainfall and to make the forcing data error only a function of precipitation the true output y is the simulated streamflow via the gr4j model corresponding to the true input x and model parameters set as the reference values in table 2 i e y y g r 4 j s m g r 4 j x Œ∏ g r 4 j the observed precipitation x o is built by multiplying the exponential noise to the true precipitation and the noise is sampled from an assumed error distribution as eq 9 9 x i o x i exp Œµ x i x i o 0 Œµ x n 0 2 0 5 2 to introduce the model structural error Œµ m the synthetic case calibrates the hymod parameters to fit the true gr4j simulation y therefore the synthetic case considers three scenarios the details are shown in table 3 scenario 1 only suffers from the input error and parameter error in model calibration scenario 2 and scenario 3 additionally suffer from the model structural error in some real life applications the error parameters œÉ and Œº in this study are challenging to estimate precisely before calibration the following case studies will attempt to calibrate these error parameters along with model parameters to explore the ability of the bear method in wider applications therefore all scenarios are based on the assumption of the true error distribution family like x o x exp Œµ x Œµ x n Œº œÉ 2 and infer the error parameters Œº and œÉ in the calibration scenario 3 has accurate prior information about Œº while scenario 1 and scenario 2 estimate Œº from a uniform distribution ranging from 5 to 5 this study sets the objective function as the mean squared error mse of the model residuals and discards a warmup period of 365 days from the objective function calculation to reduce the impacts of unknown initial conditions fig 3 compares the results of the four calibration methods via the posterior distribution of the error parameters and the taylor diagram taylor diagram taylor 2001 is used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the estimated and true behavior in terms of three statistics the pearson correlation coefficient the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation estimated patterns that agree well with the true behavior will lie nearest to the point marked observed on the x axis in each population of the abc smc calibration scheme 50 sets of model parameters are updated therefore there are 50 plots to show the results for each method marked in different colors in fig 3 in scenario 1 where the modeling only suffers from the input error and parameter error the plots show consistent hierarchy in the methods where r ar r d for the well performance of estimating the input error fig 3 1a modifying the input data fig 3 1b and model simulation fig 3 1c method r ar even improves the correlations of both input and output to 0 98 it illustrates that this new algorithm can identify the input error series effectively in the model calibration even when these input errors have a systematic bias Œº 0 2 but scenario 1 does not suffer from model structural error in scenario 2 and 3 where the model structural error is added in the hymod calibration the method performance depends on the prior information on the error parameters if Œº is constrained to the true value 0 2 in scenario 3 method r ar still outperforms other methods the pink plots are closest to the observed point in all the figures fig 3 3a 3b and 3c although the advantage is not distinct as in scenario 1 if Œº and œÉ are inferred in the calibration in scenario 2 the estimated errors via the method r and r ar have a higher correlation fig 3 2c and a more accurate sd estimation fig 3 2d than method d but for the modification of the input fig 3 2b and output fig 3 2c the plots of all the methods almost overlap these unimproved results via method r ar and method r are probably caused by more uncertain estimations of Œº fig 3 2d which is often impaired by the model structural error the impacts of model structural error will be discussed further in section 4 4 3 3 case study 2 real data in order to explore the ability of the bear algorithm in a real situation this study undertakes an application in the macintyre river catchment at inverell middle creek in new south wales nsw australia this study catchment is a part of the macintyre river basin located in the northern tablelands of nsw with the area of 726 km2 macintyre river is a perennial river that forms part of the border rivers group in this catchment we collected daily observations of streamflow potential evaporation and precipitation at the outlet station station id 416016 and the daily precipitation data of other nine rainfall gauges in this catchment covering the period from 2001 11 04 to 2007 04 27 2000 days these data can be accessed at https realtimedata waternsw com au more details of these stations can be seen in table 4 and their location is given in fig 4 considering the presence of multiple rain gauges the model calibration using each gauge separately will indicate the range of potential input uncertainty due to representational error and a weighted average of the gauges will approach an approximation of the true rainfall data this study calculates the mean of rainfall from ten available rainfall gauges as the areal rainfall referring to average in the following figures and compare its estimated results with other results using data from each rainfall gauge separately according to the related studies ajami et al 2007 kavetski et al 2006 the relationship between the precipitation observation and its error in this real case is also assumed to follow eq 1 if the rainfall data of r1 station is regarded as the true value the data error for all the rain gauges can be approximated as the difference between the rainfall data of r1 station and the rest 10 sets of rainfall data after analyzing these data errors the mean Œº and sd œÉ of the normal distribution in eq 1 is assessed as 0 and 0 46 respectively to test the ability of the bear method in more common situations with imprecise prior information on the input error in the calibration of this real case Œº is fixed as 0 but œÉ is inferred assuming a prior range of 0 5 0 46 can be regarded as the reference value of input error œÉ green line in fig 5 b the three methods incorporating the input errors are compared in terms of rmse of the model residuals and the œÉ estimation shown in fig 5 regardless of the rainfall data sources method r and method r ar applying the reordering strategy always bring a much lower rmse on the model output than method d between the method r and method r ar there is no significant difference for the fit of model outputs fig 6 selects two sets of input data from station r1 and average to demonstrate the dynamic of their estimations via different methods fig 6 shows between two data sets the uncertainty bands of simulation via the method d and method t change a lot while the uncertainty bands of simulation via the method r and method r ar are consistent from the above the estimations via method t and method d depend more on the input data accuracy while method r and method r ar are more impacted by the output observations in situations where the output observation is more accurate than the input observation the reordering strategy outperforms the traditional methods compared with the reference value of œÉ in the real case green line in fig 5 b except for the result of r2 other œÉ estimations via method d are generally lower than it which is the same as the results in the synthetic case shown in fig 3 d and the conclusion explored in the study of renard et al 2009 compared with method d the reordering strategy applied in method r and method r ar brings more stable estimates among the different rainfall data sources in one catchment the statistical features of input errors among different gauges should be quite similar due to the close locations and similar impacts of weather conditions besides the majority of the estimates via method r and method r ar are closer to the reference values than method d given the above claims method r ar and r lead to a better quantification of input errors than method d 4 discussion 4 1 the ability of the rank estimation in quantifying input errors according to the above comparisons the results of the synthetic data study fig 3 and the real data study fig 5 both support that the reordering strategy applied in method r and r ar can reduce the impacts of input errors in calibration and give a better fit to the output observations method r r ar and d have the same basic underlying motivation in that they counteract the impact of input error by removing the estimated error which is also the general concept in other existing methods ajami et al 2007 kavetski et al 2006 renard et al 2009 for each of these approaches it is necessary to set an assumption about the error distribution like eq 1 and sample the error from this distribution if the sampled errors are coincidentally similar to the true input errors the impact of the input errors will be eliminated and the simulation will be improved but the probability of this is negligible and it is likely that imprecise errors will be sampled therefore the variability of random errors will reduce to minimize the adverse impacts of the wrong estimations that s why method d always underestimates the sd of input errors demonstrated in fig 3 d and fig 5 b like the comments from renard et al 2009 on the approach in ibune ajami et al 2007 the randomness in the objective function will lead to an underestimation of the error variance if the input error distribution can be estimated in advance the value equivalence can be transformed into a rank equivalence a continuous sequence of data has an infinite potential error value while the error rank has a limited number of possible values equal to the data length reducing the number of possible optimizations dramatically will improve the efficiency of updating input errors significantly besides the adjustment of error rank relative magnitude is an improvement based on the ibune approach which avoids the high computing dimensions existed in batea in the reordering strategy via the secant method the optimal error rank is not random but determined by the residual error varying with the generated model parameters so this strategy is not subject to the randomness deficiency in ibune posterior distribution and provides more promising results supported by the comparison of method d and method r in fig 3 and fig 5 the application of the secant method can effectively optimize the input error to minimize the model residual error if the input error is dominant in the total uncertainty minimizing the model residual has a similar effect of minimizing the input error from the above the rank estimation via the secant method can improve the efficiency and accuracy of input error identification in model calibration but its ability is limited by the assumption that the input error should be dominant in the total error it should be noted that the secant method is an iterative approximation which needs multiple iterations according to the discussion in section 2 5 the maximum number of iterations q should be set to reduce the calculation loss arising from the large parameter error fig a1 demonstrates that when q is smaller than 10 the ability of method r ar improves slightly with the increasing q when q is larger than 10 the statistics are almost the same q 10 is a suitable set for this synthetic case compared with different strategies applied in method d and method r ar the selection of q plays a much less important role in the quantification ability therefore q 10 can be applied in other cases given the value of q doesn t have much effect on the outcomes 4 2 the setting of lag time between forcing data and response in hydrologic systems the response caused by an input is generally not instantaneous the travel time of rainfall to the catchment outlet should be considered to make sure the correspondence between forcing data and response the travel time considered in the bear method is not event based but data based seen in fig 1 section 2 3 introduces a new method to calculate the data based lag time by decomposing the simulated hydrograph for each positive precipitation input in the application of the gr4j model the data based lag times for all the positive inputs are the same and they are related to the gr4j parameter Œ∏ 4 therefore the synthetic data with different true lag times can be generated regarding different Œ∏ 4 settings three sets of synthetic data with different true lag times are generated and calibrated in the same process as scenario 1 in table 3 considering the different approaches to address the lag time including calculating the lag time via the method in section 2 2 denoted cal in fig 7 and fixing the lag time as 0 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 7 demonstrates that for all the synthetic data with different true lag times the accuracy of the lag time setting is significant for the quantification of input errors and cal algorithm can identify the lag time precisely and bring the same performance as the true lag time setting it is the nature of gr4j that estimated lag times are approximately the same for all inputs and depend on the parameter Œ∏ 4 in this case the algorithm for method r ar can be simplified for computational efficiency after the model parameters are generated there is no need to calculate the lag times for all input data the average lag time for a select data sub set for example 10 forcing data observations can be assumed to approximate the lag time for the entire time series referred to herein as lag the lag time lag i in eq 7 then does not change with the time step i but is fixed at a single value this algorithm simplification can only be applied for model structures such as gr4j where the data based lag times are the same for all the inputs as examples the hydrologic model hymod boyle et al 2003 has the same nature but the australian water balance model awbm boughton 2004 does not when the awbm parameters are fixed the data based lag times will be time varying it should be noted that this lag time is analyzed from the simulated hydrograph while the observed hydrograph is commonly used in analyzing the event based lag time given the error is propagated in the model the calculation from the modeled hydrograph is more suitable for quantifying errors this approach is also flexible for other types of inputs for a catchment where snowmelt processes interact with rainfall the algorithm can be adapted to consider the sum of snowmelt and rainfall in the same way as rainfall data alone because this lag time is calculated from the modeled hydrograph which is fixed when the model parameter has been sampled 4 3 the usefulness of incorporating an autoregressive ar error model a significant advancement of the bear methodology applied here is in the use of an autoregressive model to explicitly represent the persistence of residual errors fig 3 demonstrates that in scenario 1 without the model structural error method r ar outperforms method r apparently while in scenario 2 where the model structural error is added the advantage of method r ar is not distinct but in scenario 3 where the mean of input error is accurate as the prior information the method r ar can have a better performance than method r again it suggests that the introduction of the model structural error impairs estimation of the systematic bias of the input data if this deficiency can be solved by accurate prior information on the mean of input error the ability of the ar model can be taken advantage of even in the real case shown in fig 5 where more error sources interfere the œÉ estimations via method r ar are generally nearer to the reference value than method r under an assumption of zero mean it suggests that addressing the autocorrelation in the model residuals via employing the ar model can improve the correspondence between the residual error and input error and then promote the precision of the input error quantification in the bear method the ar model is built by analyzing the model residuals via pacf so it changes with the varied model residuals its coefficients are easy to estimate but its order is hard to select automatically in the calibration the order of the ar model should be fixed in the whole approach in fig a2 the results corresponding to its order from 1 to 5 are compared the result with the order as 2 shows the best performance but the difference is not appreciable among different ar models and all results via method r ar show better fits to the true input and output data than method r not using an ar model therefore 2 is a suitable set for the order of the ar model and this value can be extended to other cases not making much difference to the outcome 4 4 the impacts of different sources of error if the model only suffers from input error and parameter error like scenario 1 in fig 3 the performance hierarchy of the different methods is r ar r d for method r ar the correlation with the true input and true output can even be up to 0 98 this means the application of the ar model and the reordering strategy can improve the identification of the input error and parameter error significantly in other words the impacts of parameter error can be effectively isolated by the bear algorithm under this error condition in the abc smc calibration schemes the tolerance of the total error sequentially reduces which will constrain the parameter error effectively a more accurate estimation of the model parameter will improve the quantification of input errors considering the interactions between input errors and model parameter errors when other sources of error are included the method r and method r ar implemented using a reordering strategy still improve the result compared to method d according to the above discussion of the synthetic case fig 3 and real case fig 5 this suggests that the reordering strategy is sufficiently robust to approximate the true input errors even in the real case with the interference from potential streamflow observational errors and model structural errors but the introduction of model structural error does undermine its advantages mainly impairing the estimation of input error mean demonstrated by the comparison of scenario 2 and scenario 1 in fig 3 we can reason that this result is similar to the potential impacts of output streamflow observational error when the model structural error and output observational error become more dominant the input error estimation is less effective considering the effectiveness of the ar model the presence of other sources of error will reduce the capacity of the reordering strategy to identify input errors in the real case method r ar does not show a distinct advantage over method r this suggests that the calculated ar model cannot represent the model structural error properly and conflicts with the independence of the output observational errors if the streamflow observational errors and model structural error can be considered alongside the input errors as in the batea framework renard et al 2010 and ibune approach ajami et al 2007 the identification of input errors via the bear method might be improved by alleviating the impacts of other sources of error it should be noted that the above discussion focuses on uncertainty quantification in model calibration schemes analyzing the impacts of other sources of uncertainty on the model parameter estimates this is similar to the hydrologic uncertainty identified in the bayesian forecasting system bfs krzysztofowicz 1999 in the bfs framework more accurate knowledge of the input uncertainty and parameter estimation will support an improved hydrological forecast krzysztofowicz 1999 however applying this information to improve the hydrological forecast is not the aim of this study 5 conclusion input error as a major source of modeling uncertainty should be quantified carefully in hydrologic model calibration to improve parameter estimation updating input errors according to model residuals is challenging because a backward model transformation of inputs generally cannot be derived analytically and is inefficient numerically furthermore in a hydrologic system the delay in response and the system persistence complicates attempts to find the corresponding and independent parts of the response to each input to deal with these problems a new algorithm bayesian error analysis with reordering bear method r ar in the above discussion has been developed in the following ways 1 applying the secant method to calculate the direction and magnitude of input error rank changes and improve updating efficiency 2 considering the data based lag time between the model input and output to identify the corresponding response for an input 3 applying an ar model in evaluating errors in the response to explicitly include the system persistence in the model calibration through the analysis of synthetic data and real data these actions in the bear method have been proven robust to improve the modification of input data and simulation in a hydrologic model however the results highlight several further considerations to address first prior knowledge about the input errors offers a significant advantage especially knowledge of the error mean this study only considers one type of assumption about input errors that they follow a lognormal distribution and are multiplicative as per eq 1 in fact other probability distributions and formulations could also be considered in this method and their implementation is flexible and easy further work will be aimed at developing appropriate model selection techniques that will robustly compare alternative input error assumptions besides this study promotes the identification of input errors by modifying the residual error model to address the persistency and delay problem when incorporating other properties e g heteroscedasticity and zero inflation mcinerney et al 2017 wu et al 2019 smith et al 2015 their influence in the uncertainty decomposition needs more comprehensive understanding last but not least the bear method is effective under the assumption that the input error is dominant and the capacity of the reordering strategy and ar model is limited by the impacts of model structural error and the output observational error if these sources of error can be comprehensively identified along with the input error the error decomposition will be improved fundamentally but developing the rank estimation in quantifying multiple sources of error needs more careful examinations from the above based on the current bear algorithm more extensions can be explored in more complex applications or other environmental systems with a persistent response credit authorship contribution statement xia wu

4543,the high asia region supplies a substantial part of the water demands in south asia playing an important role in maintaining ecosystem stability both locally and downstream the yarlung tsangpo river the upper brahmaputra basin in high asia is especially sensitive to climate change however climate driven hydrological changes and hydrodynamic processes are not well understood in this study hydrological and 2 d hydrodynamic numerical modelling were combined providing a better representation of basin runoff and wetland fluvial dynamics with improved spatial resolution over the sparsely gauged yarlung tsangpo river and the combination provided reliable results for watershed and wetland analysis from 1979 to 2019 significant upward trends p 0 05 in temperature were observed in lazi zedang linzhi and bomi located from the upper reaches to lower reaches however the variation trends of precipitation displayed great spatial differences as a result runoff in lazi zedang and bomi showed an increasing trend with the most significant trend observed in zedang p 0 04 with the increases in wetland area and water depth but non significant variations in velocity the impacts of climate variations were more pronounced in rainy periods than in snowmelt periods during rainy periods the water depth in the western wetland ranged from 0 m to 7 m in the early 1980s and middle 2000s and increased to 10 m in the late 2010s furthermore our study revealed that changes in the daily maximum temperature the daily minimum temperature and the ratio of snow period precipitation to rainy period precipitation accounted for most of the variance observed in rivers and wetlands in particular the upper reach with more obvious freeze thaw processes was more sensitive to temperature changes than were the middle to lower reaches during snowmelt periods this study provides vital information for the sustainability of water resource management and wetland conservation in the context of climate change in the high asia region keywords temperature precipitation river discharge fluvial dynamics snowmelt modelling 1 introduction global climate change during recent decades has exerted significant impacts on regional water cycle processes altering riverine and wetland environments bloeschl et al 2019 xu et al 2019a temperature and precipitation are dominant aspects of climate change wu et al 2018 an increase in temperature may lead to a reduction in river discharge due to the increase in evaporation delire et al 2008 grafton et al 2013 furthermore combined changes in temperature and precipitation impact both coastal wetlands by raising the sea level and inland wetlands by altering the river discharge mitsch and hernandez 2013 wetland ecosystems are especially sensitive to the quantity and quality of their water supply erwin 2009 given that climate change may have irreparable consequences on river and wetland systems it is necessary to substantially enhance our understanding of how rivers and wetlands respond to temperature and precipitation variations hydrological and hydrodynamic processes in high altitude areas are particularly vulnerable to temperature and precipitation variations alikadic et al 2019 wu et al 2020 in high altitude areas climatic characteristics over decades were found to have mixed variation trends compared with low altitude areas and unexpectedly may not be consistent with broad scale warming revadekar et al 2013 rainfall events directly lead to changes in the overland hydrological cycle river floods and wetland fluvial dynamics in addition to rainfall events snowmelt events generate runoff and make fluvial contributions in high altitude areas snowmelt events control the vegetation index and the increase in runoff in early spring suzuki et al 2020 with broader water areas and shallow depths wetlands are very sensitive to climate warming and snowmelt runoff is critically important in determining wetland status ray et al 2019 therefore wetland water depth flow rate sediment concentration and erosion are usually subject to snowmelt events which in turn significantly affect environmental and ecological changes han et al 2020 a warming climate generally increases snowmelt runoff however climate impacts may be enhanced or moderated as elevations and latitudes vary rasouli et al 2019 despite the rich literature the further analysis of riverine and wetland environments under climate variations remains less explored especially in headwater areas that are sparsely populated but critical to downstream water security the tibetan plateau atop the roof of the world is known as the third pole qiu 2008 with the highest water tower index the headwater area in the tibetan plateau supplies a substantial part of the water demands in the heavily populated south asia and has drawn broad attention due to its importance and high vulnerability to climate change immerzeel et al 2020 the yarlung tsangpo river the upper brahmaputra is the largest river in tibet and plays an important role in ensuring regional water security and maintaining ecosystem stability pritchard 2019 historical periods witnessed significant growing trends in temperature while basin precipitation decreased from the 1960s to the 1980s and then increased starting in the 1980s you et al 2007 approximately more than 60 of the yearly precipitation occurs in summer playing a dominant role in seasonal runoff qu et al 2017 however melt water from snow glaciers may contribute 30 to the annual runoff in the brahmaputra river zhang et al 2013 in particular the warming climate over the past five decades led to glacier retreat and an increase in the water supply to lakes and pastures thus resulting in wetland expansion xu et al 2019b in this regard the promotion of river regulation and wetland restoration for climate change adaptation strategies requires broader knowledge of hydrological and hydrodynamic responses in the water tower area prior research in asian water tower areas analysed the climate indices e g absolute indices cooling indices warming indices and their induced runoff changes over decadal periods liu et al 2019 xu et al 2019a analyses of spatiotemporal precipitation and temperature variations and extreme climatic conditions have been widely employed you et al 2007 sang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the runoff composition and regimes of high asia rivers e g mekong salween and brahmaputra display very large differences and the runoff volume has been predicted to increase until at least 2050 zhang et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 therefore the variation characteristics call for a more comprehensive investigation at different scales however despite the crucial significance the data in water tower areas are less available due to the natural environments and limited social development unfavourable for observation in addition previous studies have focused on basin scale runoff predictions under the context of future climate change through different global regional climate models and hydrological modelling li et al 2014 sarkar 2015 xu et al 2019a in this context the analysis of integrating upscaled hydrological processes and downscaled hydrodynamics is helpful for further clarifying river and wetland responses to climate variations to date climate driven hydrological changes and hydrodynamic processes in high asia are still not well understood owing to the less available dataset masood et al 2015 the yarlung tsangpo river basin is one of the world s most under investigated and underdeveloped areas xu et al 2019a to address this gap we integrated approaches of hydrological modelling and fluvial numerical modelling which improved the spatial resolution of the analysis the objectives of this work are therefore to i obtain spatiotemporal runoff characteristics over the decades of the study period ii clarify changes in wetland fluvial dynamics in response to climate variations and iii reveal the combined impacts of temperature and precipitation changes on hydrological and hydrodynamic responses in the high asia region 2 methodology 2 1 study area description the yarlung tsangpo river ytr originates from the gyama langdzom glacier of the northern slope of the himalayan mountains fig 1 the yarlung tsangpo river has an average elevation of 4621 m shi et al 2018 the length of the river in china is approximately 2229 km you et al 2007 with a drainage area of approximately 240 000 km2 annual precipitation in the yarlung tsangpo river basin ytrb shows spatial variations due to terrain characteristics ranging from approximately 200 mm upstream to approximately more than 2000 mm downstream the average annual air temperature is 5 92 c li et al 2014 the average annual discharge is approximately 5 76 1010 m3 downstream shi et al 2018 more than 70 of the annual discharge occurs during the period from june to september while snow ice melt water contributes approximately 25 of the total annual discharge qu et al 2017 the yarlung tsangpo niyang river wetland fig 1 in the middle stream reach is located in one of the main administrative districts linzhi district in tibet and the wetland plays a fundamental role in terms of the environment ecology economy and politics with shoals and small islands at elevations from 0 m to 13 m above the main channel this area is very sensitive to climate variations and the upstream hydrological conditions 2 2 watershed runoff estimate to obtain watershed hydrological processes we utilized the process based and semi distributed soil water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 2012 https swat tamu edu the swat model is one of the most widely used hydrological models and it considers factors of meteorology underlying surfaces and human activities this model can effectively simulate hydrological soil erosion and pollutant migration processes importantly the swat model is effective in the simulation of snow and glacier melting processes and has been successfully applied at high altitudes in asia pritchard 2019 wu et al 2020 based on the characteristics of slope land use types and soil types the swat model divides a watershed into sub basins and then hydrological response units hrus for calculation the main governing equations of runoff estimates of the swat model are the soil conservation service curve number scs 1956 and manning s equation manning 1891 for snow melt simulation the swat model utilizes a temperature index based method the air temperature snowfall factor snowmelt factor snowpack temperature and its lag factor snow water content and fraction of areas covered by snow were especially considered in this model an areal depletion curve is employed in the swat model to calculate the growth and recession of snowpack anderson 1976 ficklin and barnhart 2014 this method improves snow and ice melt process simulations in the ytrb where snowpack is unevenly distributed due to topographic characteristics the snowmelt can be obtained using equation 1 ficklin and barnhart 2014 1 sn o mlt t b mlt i s n o cov i t sp i t max i 2 s m t m p where bmlt i

smtmp is the snow melt base temperature above which melting occurs c the input for the swat model includes information on topography soil land use meteorology and watershed management practices topographical data 1 km 1 km were obtained from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn soil data were obtained from the china soil scientific database provided by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences land use data 100 m 100 m were interpreted from landsat images classified based on the national land use database scheme and validated by field investigations the data set was provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc the dominant land use types in the study area are pasture barren land and forest accounting for approximately 50 25 and 20 respectively of the total basin area observed meteorological data for daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation were obtained from 10 local meteorological stations the annual precipitation in these local stations ranged from 157 4 mm to 881 4 mm meteorological uncertainty exists in the topographically varied ytrb we utilized data from these stations which were located within or around the ytrb and covered basically the whole basin fig 1 and hence the simulation accuracy of meteorology can be high 2 3 wetland fluvial dynamic estimate to obtain the high spatial resolution of fluvial dynamic changes in wetlands induced by climate variations we utilized an updated version of a 2 d numerical model the finite volume method fvm 2d zhao et al 1996 this model can accurately estimate hydraulic conditions including water level river depth flow velocity and sediment concentration in aquatic systems thus successfully performing a numerical simulation of large scale water areas with complex terrain wang et al 2020 in preference to the 1 d numerical model the 2 d model can obtain variations in each grid of a wetland which greatly benefits fluvial dynamic analysis under climate change the 2 d shallow water equation in the conservative form was used as the basic equation in this model 2 q t f q x

carrying capacity in this study unstructured grids were used to adapt to complex river boundaries the riverine topographical data were less available due to the difficulty of conducting field surveys in the yarlung tsangpo river however we established grids with a relatively high resolution 30 m by integrating the channel cross section obtained from hydrological stations and the digital elevation model a total of 10 151 grids covering the study area were constructed to reduce calculation errors due to the constantly varying terrain and the wetland fluvial dynamics were calculated in each sub unit the inflow and outflow data of the wetland were obtained from the observed datasets xu et al 2019a as well as the modelled datasets by swat which were validated with observed values 2 4 model calibration and validation the swat model calibration and validation were conducted after sensitivity analysis using the sufi 2 method abbaspour et al 2007 yan et al 2018 a total of 28 parameters significantly affecting hydrological process simulation were identified as being the most sensitive parameters in this study the parameters including snowfall temperature snow melt base temperature melt rate for snow snowpack temperature lag factor and snow water content affecting melting processes were calibrated observed monthly discharge data from three hydrological stations nugesha station yangcun station nuxia station fig 1 during 1983 2000 were used for model calibration and validation xu et al 2019a these three stations cover the area from the middle to downstream reaches of the yarlung tsangpo river the swat model was run at a monthly time step during calibration and validation the periods of 1979 1982 1983 1991 and 1992 2000 were used for model warm up calibration and validation respectively evaluation criteria indicators including the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which have been widely used to evaluate watershed modelling were used to evaluate the model performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2015 for the watershed scale modelling of discharge the performance can be considered very good good and satisfactory when r2 0 85 0 75 r2 0 85 and 0 60 r2 0 75 respectively in addition the performance can be considered very good good and satisfactory when the nse 0 80 0 70 nse 0 80 and 0 50 nse 0 70 respectively moriasi et al 2015 for the nugesha station and yangcun station the model performance was good or very good during the calibration period and validation period for nuxia station the performance was very good for both the calibration period and the validation period fig 2 these results validated the swat model for the runoff simulation in the yarlung tsangpo river the 2 d numerical model fvm 2d was validated with the annual suspended load runoff measured at nuxia station fig 1 the modelled total amount of suspended sediment 32 2 million tons passing through nuxia station agreed well with the observed amount 30 million tons over past decades wang et al 2014 the detailed procedure of model validation was described by wang et al 2020 2 5 data analysis to analyse climate variation trends and their impacts on rivers and wetlands in the ytrb representative areas lazi zedang linzhi and bomi fig 1 from a to d along the main stream were selected for analysis first to evaluate the variation trends for temperature precipitation and runoff over the four decades the sen s slope evaluation method sen 1968 was applied to the four areas as a nonparametric method the sen s slope evaluation method is extensively used for the analysis of hydrometeorological time series partal and kahya 2006 second to test the significance of the variation trend for temperature precipitation and runoff the mann kendall test method 1975 was used to obtain the significance of variation this test method requires no special distribution of the whole series and is also widely used in the analysis of hydrometeorological time series wu et al 2020 the details of the calculation method are available in previous research gocic and trajkovic 2013 third to clarify the impacts of different climatic factors on hydrological and hydrodynamic responses we conducted analysis of variance anova analysis of correlation through spearman s test wu et al 2018 and principal component analysis pca anova reveals if there are any statistically significant differences in climatic indices between the four representative areas pca is effective in extracting useful information from vast and complex data series ouyang et al 2018 climatic indices in the linzhi and bomi areas near the wetland including the daily maximum temperature tmax daily minimum temperature tmin diurnal temperature range dtr precipitation amount and ratio of snow period precipitation to rainy period precipitation rsr were analysed with climatic data from 1982 to 2019 before the analysis these indices were pre processed with the z score normalization method to eliminate the effects of data dimension the principal components were identified based on an eigenvalue higher than 1 which indicated the component could explain the variations 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of temperature and precipitation the average temperature from 1979 to 2019 exhibited an increasing trend spatially from the upper reach to the lower reach with values of 7 41 c in lazi 9 75 c in zedang 10 36 c in linzhi and 10 31 c in bomi temporally all four areas exhibited upward trends in both tmax and tmin fig 3 the mann kendall trend test showed that these upward trends were all significant with p values lower than 0 005 for tmax the value of sen s slope was the highest in zedang 0 044 and the lowest in lazi 0 010 the slope for tmax in the lower reach was 0 033 in linzhi and 0 030 in bomi for tmin the value of sen s slope was higher in the upper and middle reaches with values of 0 050 in lazi and 0 051 in zedang the annual precipitation from 1979 to 2019 showed very large spatial differences with average values of 349 6 mm in lazi 386 8 mm in zedang 696 5 mm in linzhi and 881 4 mm in bomi temporally the mann kendall trend test showed that only lazi was observed to have a significant upward trend in precipitation p 0 014 a downward trend was found in bomi however this trend was not significant p 0 11 sen s slope estimation also demonstrated that temporal variation trends of precipitation showed spatial differences the slope values were 2 85 in lazi 1 75 in zedang 0 71 in linzhi and 2 76 in bomi 3 2 variations in river runoff during snowmelt and rainy periods annually the temporal characteristics of the annual average runoff along the yarlung tsangpo river showed different variation trends table 1 the average yearly runoff during 1982 2019 was the lowest in lazi 319 m3 s 1 and highest in bomi 1380 m3 s 1 due to their locations in the upper and lower reaches of the main stream respectively the sen s slopes in all of the areas except linzhi 0 19 were greater than zero with the top two highest values in zedang 5 18 and bomi 4 95 the mann kendall trend test showed that runoff only in zedang was observed to have a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 04 while runoff in bomi was observed to have a non significant upward trend with p 0 08 runoff in snowmelt periods march to april may and rainy periods may june to october were analysed the upper reach lazi was more influenced by snowmelt events fig 4 than were other areas in lazi the peak runoff throughout a year may occur in snowmelt periods e g the snowmelt runoff in 1982 1092 m3 s 1 in 1989 1232 m3 s 1 and in 2019 1820 m3 s 1 the runoff in lazi during snowmelt periods was basically equal to or slightly higher than the annual average runoff for that reach indicating that the discharge in lazi was more snow dominated than the lower reaches further down to the lower reaches the monthly runoff during snowmelt periods in linzhi and bomi ranged from 12 m3 s 1 to 675 m3 s 1 and from 196 m3 s 1 to 2881 m3 s 1 respectively simulated runoff during rainy periods accounted for a higher percentage of the average annual runoff than simulated runoff during snowmelt periods fig 5 the precipitation in rainy periods in lazi and zedang were significantly lower than those in linzhi and bomi before the 2000s however after the 2000s the rainy period precipitation in the four areas became closer particularly in recent years in lazi a peak runoff during rainy periods occurred in 2015 1451 m3 s 1 and for the other three areas obvious peaks occurred in 1998 due to increasing precipitation fig 5 in the lower reach the monthly runoff in linzhi and bomi ranged from 74 m3 s 1 to 1617 m3 s 1 and from 835 m3 s 1 to 9826 m3 s 1 respectively the runoff in linzhi during rainy periods was basically equal to or slightly higher than the annual average runoff for that reach for bomi the runoff during rainy periods was obviously higher than the annual average runoff for that reach in the lower reaches the peak runoff during the year usually occurred in the rainy season 3 3 variations in wetland fluvial dynamics during snowmelt and rainy periods the variations in wetland areas and fluvial dynamics during snowmelt periods from the early 1980s 1982 to 1984 to the middle 2000s 2004 2006 and then to the late 2010s 2017 to 2019 are shown in fig 6 selected sub units located in the wetland showed the flow velocity and water depth variations across the three time periods compared with the average values over the full study period fig 7 the wetland in this period was mainly composed of rivers with narrow channels the variations in flow velocity u in the yarlung tsangpo niyang river wetland over the decades were not significant fig 6a c e the velocity was generally less than 1 2 m s 1 the water depth h in the shoals and ponds in the niyang river trunk fig 6b d f a b b d e and the main stream of the western to middle yarlung tsangpo river trunk fig 6b d f c f was mainly less than 5 m in the eastern wetland the water depth increased but the flow slowed with a velocity generally lower than 0 2 m s 1 fig 6a c e f to lower reach another change in fluvial dynamics was that the water area where the two rivers meet increased over time fig 6 b d e moreover the water depth along the channel after the confluence deepened by 1 to 2 m in the middle 2000s and late 2010s compared with that in the early 1980s fig 6b d f e f fig 7 during rainy periods the flow velocity in the section of the niyang river fig 8 a c e a b gradually decreased from the early 1980s to the middle 2000s and to the late 2010s but the changes in velocity were not significant in the main stream in the early 1980s the velocity in the niyang river trunk in the west fig 8a a b was high more than 1 0 m s 1 in the main channel and low in the shoals and deep ponds 0 2 m s 1 to 0 6 m s 1 in the late 2010s the niyang river trunk near the intersection of this river and the yarlung tsangpo river became more of a deep pond where the velocity decreased fig 8e f b d e moreover the wetland area in the northeast fig 8 f expanded greatly from the early 1980s to the late 2010s the water depth in the west fig 8b d c d d e ranged from 0 m to 7 m in the early 1980s and middle 2000s but increased to over 10 m in the late 2010s at the intersection of the niyang river and the yarlung tsangpo river fig 8f d e when moving on to the main stream an obvious increase in the water depth could be found where the orange turned red fig 8b d f e f selected sub units located in the wetland further showed the significant variations in water depth across the three time periods compared with the average value over the full study period fig 9 3 4 combined impacts of temperature and precipitation variations a comprehensive analysis of the combined impacts of temperature and precipitation variations was conducted during snowmelt periods fig 10 climatic indices between the four representative areas were significantly different table 2 the correlations between the precipitation in the four areas were not strong while the temperature between these areas were more correlated table 3 especially between linzhi and bomi average monthly runoff in snowmelt periods during 1982 to 2019 were investigated along the yarlung tsangpo river in lazi the precipitation during snowmelt periods was generally less than 4 mm upper quartile precipitation 3 8 mm and snowmelt runoff was more sensitive to temperature changes the top three highest runoff occurred when tmax varied approximately from 14 5 c to 16 0 c and tmin varied approximately from 0 5 c to 1 5 c in warmer years fig 10 lazi tmax 16 5 c to 18 0 c tmin 1 5 c to 2 5 c the runoff was significantly lower than the average runoff 331 m3 s 1 in zedang a combination of relatively lower temperature fig 10 zedang tmax 17 0 c to 18 0 c tmin 1 5 c to 3 0 c and medium precipitation fig 10 lazi 25 mm to 40 mm contributed to the top highest runoff in linzhi higher runoff 291 m3 s 1 to 345 m3 s 1 occurred with typical high precipitation fig 10 linzhi 101 mm to 130 mm and relatively higher temperature fig 10 linzhi tmin 4 5 c to 5 5 c in bomi higher runoff 1523 m3 s 1 to 1841 m3 s 1 also occurred with high precipitation fig 10 bomi 337 mm to 351 mm and relatively higher temperature fig 10 bomi tmin 4 5 c to 5 0 c during rainy periods fig 11 significant differences in climatic indices between the four representative areas were also observed table 4 in addition the correlations between the precipitation in linzhi and bomi were stronger than during snowmelt periods table 5 average monthly runoff in rainy periods during 1982 to 2019 were investigated along the yarlung tsangpo river in lazi higher runoff 580 m3 s 1 to 667 m3 s 1 was usually coupled with higher precipitation fig 11 lazi 319 mm to 541 mm but with relatively lower temperature fig 11 lazi tmax around 18 5 c tmin 6 0 c to 7 0 c in zedang a similar characteristic was observed that higher runoff was usually coupled with higher precipitation but with relatively lower temperature the top three highest runoff occurred with higher precipitation fig 11 zedang 380 mm to 517 mm in the downstream linzhi with a higher annual precipitation it was obvious that the runoff during rainy periods generally increased as the amount of precipitation increased however there was a different result in bomi in addition to precipitation temperature played an important role in affecting runoff in bomi a high precipitation fig 11 bomi 600 mm to 760 mm did not always result in a high runoff under a relatively low tmax and tmin fig 11 bomi tmax 19 5 c to 20 5 c tmin 9 0 c to 10 5 c 3 5 climatic contribution analysis taken together for the whole year pca highlighted the most influential factors contributing to river and wetland variance for linzhi three principal components pcs were identified which together accounted for 91 2 of the total variance table 6 the first second and third pcs explained approximately 42 7 27 0 and 21 5 of the total variance respectively the first pc mainly included tmax 0 889 rsr 0 711 and tmin 0 684 and the second pc was related to tmin 0 710 and precipitation 0 609 in the third pc dtr was the most important indicator 0 700 fig 12 for bomi two pcs were identified accounting for 66 8 of the total variance table 7 the first pc was associated with tmin 0 915 and tmax 0 767 and the second pc was primarily related to dtr 0 908 with the highest loading moreover the ratio of snow to rainfall contained more information than the precipitation amount 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of climate variations on river runoff the warming trend during the four decades was obvious in all four areas in the ytrb specifically the average value of the slope for tmin 0 044 was higher than that for tmax 0 029 indicating that the warming trend was more obvious for the daily minimum temperature liu et al 2019 also found that the minimum temperature increased faster than the maximum temperature by 0 12 0 13 c per decade for the precipitation variation the annual precipitation in the ytrb spatially increased from the upper reach to lower reach this variation was much affected by the basin s topography and indian summer monsoon sang et al 2016 temporally increasing trends in precipitation during 1979 2019 were found in the upper and middle reach areas lazi zedang while decreasing trends were found in the lower reach linzhi bomi based on sen s slope test the drier trend during the decades in the eastern ytrb middle to lower reach was observed as early as the 1960s wu et al 2016 the runoff characteristics throughout a year differed between these areas the impacts of melting on runoff were most significant in the uppermost area lazi with the peak runoff occurring in snowmelt periods in some years the peak runoff occurred in spring despite the seasonally delayed summer melt water pritchard 2019 our results highlighted the effects of melting in the upper reach with more obvious freeze thaw processes as reported by xu et al 2008 the increase in air temperature over the ytrb was significant in autumn and winter but was not very obvious in summer in the past several decades therefore more attention should be focused on runoff during the melt period because snow accumulation is dominant in autumn and winter ban et al 2020 in addition summer runoff accounted for the majority of the total annual discharge in most areas liu et al 2014 also revealed that rainy period runoff dominated annual runoff by over 70 in the ytrb our study stressed the role of melting in the upper reach but summer precipitation still accounted for most of the annual runoff across the basin 4 2 impacts of climate variations on wetland fluvial dynamics the wetlands in tibet are mainly lake wetlands which are less disturbed by human activities due to local development meng et al 2017 therefore climate change is the dominant reason for wetland changes in both snowmelt and rainy periods the confluence of the yarlung tsangpo river and the niyang river and the lower stream in the main channel were the most vulnerable to climate variations in this study explicit wetland changes 30 m 30 m during snowmelt and rainy periods were separately revealed the fluvial dynamics at a high resolution highlighted the water area expansion velocity redistribution and water depth growth from the early 1980s to late 2010s an estimate showed that glacier fed lakes in the third pole region had expanded by up to 123 km2 from 1990 to 1999 and further by 32 2 km2 from 2015 to 2018 shugar et al 2020 in addition runoff may still increase in future decades lutz et al 2014 supplying more water to lakes and wetlands the changes in wetland fluvial dynamics in response to climate variations during rainy periods were greater than those during snowmelt periods wetland hydrodynamic changes in response to climate change can indicate environmental and ecological processes the increases in water depth in the wetland especially during the flood season may favour nutrient transport and pollutant mitigation lee et al 2020 hansen et al 2018 found that hydrologic connectivity to the fluvial network of ephemeral wetlands was critical to watershed nitrate removal and the removal can be most effective under high flow conditions in addition velocity and water depth changes impacted water clarity and in turn photosynthesis limiting or accelerating phytoplankton growth velocity and water depth are also indicators of fish and migratory bird habitat conditions wang et al 2020 the velocity gradient somewhere in the studied wetland increased due to velocity changes over time indicating that more energy was needed for a fish to move upstream han et al 2020 further quantitative investigations with eco fluvial methods on wetland ecosystems in response to climate change are needed 4 3 implications for river and wetland systems under climate change the combined impacts of temperature and precipitation changes varied with location in the upper reach with more obvious freeze thaw processes and less precipitation the effect of temperature was more pronounced during snowmelt periods pronounced temperature effects on upper reach runoff during snowmelt periods were also found by wu et al 2020 in other rivers of the tibetan plateau in the middle to lower stream reaches temperature and precipitation together drove runoff changes our results revealed that the maximum temperature the minimum temperature and the ratio of snowfall to rainfall accounted for the most variance observed in rivers and wetlands precipitation was a more direct driver however temperature primarily controlled snow coverage over snowy glacier mountains compared with precipitation in all seasons and at all elevations in the ytrb ban et al 2020 in addition to local climate conditions the upper stream water supply from monsoon precipitation and glacier melt influenced the downstream rivers and wetlands wijngaard et al 2018 our study clarified river runoff and wetland fluvial dynamic characteristics in response to climate variations during historical periods based on long term estimates additionally this study can provide vital information for adaptation strategies for future climate change in the high asia region and useful insight into the potential future of a key freshwater supply for heavily populated south asia brahmaputra river past work has predicted that in the yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra river the runoff may increase by 6 9 under the scenario of representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and by 12 9 under rcp8 5 during 2020 to 2035 xu et al 2019a seasonally the runoff was predicted to be almost unchanged during dry periods and to have mixed varying characteristics during monsoon periods under rcp8 5 to 2100 islam et al 2018 however uncertainty exists in future climate data estimates partly due to the influences of great spatial variabilities khandu et al 2017 this variability in turn influences future runoff prediction although the new phase coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 is more skilful than its previous phases large cold biases still exist in simulations in the tibetan plateau zhu et al 2020 in this regard we utilized observed climate data from local stations and improved hydrological and hydrodynamic assessments for future climate change adaptation strategies based on the long term estimate under climate warming during historical periods our study provides vital references for runoff prediction under future climate change scenarios in addition our results revealed the increasing tendency of runoff in the main stream and in wetland areas and water depths in the past four decades the tendency may last until a maximum runoff volume occurs in the future however the peak water in the middle to lower basin was predicted to occur during 2030 to 2060 huss and hock 2018 future years should be the critical periods for water resource management and wetland ecosystem conservation for climate change adaptation 5 conclusions hydrological modelling and fluvial numerical model through the better representation of basin runoff and wetland characteristics with improved spatial resolution over the sparsely gauged yarlung tsangpo river were shown to provide reliable results suitable for climate impact studies from 1979 to 2019 four representative areas from the upper to lower stream reaches lazi zedang linzhi and bomi were observed with a significant upward trend in both daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature however precipitation displayed very large spatial differences only lazi was observed to have a significant upward trend in precipitation p 0 014 runoff in lazi zedang and bomi showed an increasing trend particularly in zedang where the increasing trend was the most significant p 0 04 moreover wetland area and water depth have enlarged over the past four decades with the non significant variations in velocity especially during rainy periods the water depth in the west ranged from 0 m to 7 m in the early 1980s and middle 2000s and increased to 10 m in the late 2010s during snowmelt periods the upper reach with more obvious freeze thaw processes was more sensitive to temperature changes than was the middle to lower reach changes in the maximum temperature the minimum temperature and the ratio of snow period precipitation to rainy period precipitation accounted for the most observed variance in rivers and wetlands this study presents powerful evidence that climate driven changes include increased river runoff expanded wetland water areas and disturbed wetland fluvial dynamics over the past decades in the high asia region our results could potentially indicate environmental and ecological processes as well this study provides vital information for water resource management and wetland conservation under climate change in the high asia region as well as useful insight into the potential future of a key freshwater supply for heavily populated south asia to advance our knowledge of the changing environment by the warming climate changes in sediment and nutrients and their impacts on phytoplankton and

4543,the high asia region supplies a substantial part of the water demands in south asia playing an important role in maintaining ecosystem stability both locally and downstream the yarlung tsangpo river the upper brahmaputra basin in high asia is especially sensitive to climate change however climate driven hydrological changes and hydrodynamic processes are not well understood in this study hydrological and 2 d hydrodynamic numerical modelling were combined providing a better representation of basin runoff and wetland fluvial dynamics with improved spatial resolution over the sparsely gauged yarlung tsangpo river and the combination provided reliable results for watershed and wetland analysis from 1979 to 2019 significant upward trends p 0 05 in temperature were observed in lazi zedang linzhi and bomi located from the upper reaches to lower reaches however the variation trends of precipitation displayed great spatial differences as a result runoff in lazi zedang and bomi showed an increasing trend with the most significant trend observed in zedang p 0 04 with the increases in wetland area and water depth but non significant variations in velocity the impacts of climate variations were more pronounced in rainy periods than in snowmelt periods during rainy periods the water depth in the western wetland ranged from 0 m to 7 m in the early 1980s and middle 2000s and increased to 10 m in the late 2010s furthermore our study revealed that changes in the daily maximum temperature the daily minimum temperature and the ratio of snow period precipitation to rainy period precipitation accounted for most of the variance observed in rivers and wetlands in particular the upper reach with more obvious freeze thaw processes was more sensitive to temperature changes than were the middle to lower reaches during snowmelt periods this study provides vital information for the sustainability of water resource management and wetland conservation in the context of climate change in the high asia region keywords temperature precipitation river discharge fluvial dynamics snowmelt modelling 1 introduction global climate change during recent decades has exerted significant impacts on regional water cycle processes altering riverine and wetland environments bloeschl et al 2019 xu et al 2019a temperature and precipitation are dominant aspects of climate change wu et al 2018 an increase in temperature may lead to a reduction in river discharge due to the increase in evaporation delire et al 2008 grafton et al 2013 furthermore combined changes in temperature and precipitation impact both coastal wetlands by raising the sea level and inland wetlands by altering the river discharge mitsch and hernandez 2013 wetland ecosystems are especially sensitive to the quantity and quality of their water supply erwin 2009 given that climate change may have irreparable consequences on river and wetland systems it is necessary to substantially enhance our understanding of how rivers and wetlands respond to temperature and precipitation variations hydrological and hydrodynamic processes in high altitude areas are particularly vulnerable to temperature and precipitation variations alikadic et al 2019 wu et al 2020 in high altitude areas climatic characteristics over decades were found to have mixed variation trends compared with low altitude areas and unexpectedly may not be consistent with broad scale warming revadekar et al 2013 rainfall events directly lead to changes in the overland hydrological cycle river floods and wetland fluvial dynamics in addition to rainfall events snowmelt events generate runoff and make fluvial contributions in high altitude areas snowmelt events control the vegetation index and the increase in runoff in early spring suzuki et al 2020 with broader water areas and shallow depths wetlands are very sensitive to climate warming and snowmelt runoff is critically important in determining wetland status ray et al 2019 therefore wetland water depth flow rate sediment concentration and erosion are usually subject to snowmelt events which in turn significantly affect environmental and ecological changes han et al 2020 a warming climate generally increases snowmelt runoff however climate impacts may be enhanced or moderated as elevations and latitudes vary rasouli et al 2019 despite the rich literature the further analysis of riverine and wetland environments under climate variations remains less explored especially in headwater areas that are sparsely populated but critical to downstream water security the tibetan plateau atop the roof of the world is known as the third pole qiu 2008 with the highest water tower index the headwater area in the tibetan plateau supplies a substantial part of the water demands in the heavily populated south asia and has drawn broad attention due to its importance and high vulnerability to climate change immerzeel et al 2020 the yarlung tsangpo river the upper brahmaputra is the largest river in tibet and plays an important role in ensuring regional water security and maintaining ecosystem stability pritchard 2019 historical periods witnessed significant growing trends in temperature while basin precipitation decreased from the 1960s to the 1980s and then increased starting in the 1980s you et al 2007 approximately more than 60 of the yearly precipitation occurs in summer playing a dominant role in seasonal runoff qu et al 2017 however melt water from snow glaciers may contribute 30 to the annual runoff in the brahmaputra river zhang et al 2013 in particular the warming climate over the past five decades led to glacier retreat and an increase in the water supply to lakes and pastures thus resulting in wetland expansion xu et al 2019b in this regard the promotion of river regulation and wetland restoration for climate change adaptation strategies requires broader knowledge of hydrological and hydrodynamic responses in the water tower area prior research in asian water tower areas analysed the climate indices e g absolute indices cooling indices warming indices and their induced runoff changes over decadal periods liu et al 2019 xu et al 2019a analyses of spatiotemporal precipitation and temperature variations and extreme climatic conditions have been widely employed you et al 2007 sang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the runoff composition and regimes of high asia rivers e g mekong salween and brahmaputra display very large differences and the runoff volume has been predicted to increase until at least 2050 zhang et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 therefore the variation characteristics call for a more comprehensive investigation at different scales however despite the crucial significance the data in water tower areas are less available due to the natural environments and limited social development unfavourable for observation in addition previous studies have focused on basin scale runoff predictions under the context of future climate change through different global regional climate models and hydrological modelling li et al 2014 sarkar 2015 xu et al 2019a in this context the analysis of integrating upscaled hydrological processes and downscaled hydrodynamics is helpful for further clarifying river and wetland responses to climate variations to date climate driven hydrological changes and hydrodynamic processes in high asia are still not well understood owing to the less available dataset masood et al 2015 the yarlung tsangpo river basin is one of the world s most under investigated and underdeveloped areas xu et al 2019a to address this gap we integrated approaches of hydrological modelling and fluvial numerical modelling which improved the spatial resolution of the analysis the objectives of this work are therefore to i obtain spatiotemporal runoff characteristics over the decades of the study period ii clarify changes in wetland fluvial dynamics in response to climate variations and iii reveal the combined impacts of temperature and precipitation changes on hydrological and hydrodynamic responses in the high asia region 2 methodology 2 1 study area description the yarlung tsangpo river ytr originates from the gyama langdzom glacier of the northern slope of the himalayan mountains fig 1 the yarlung tsangpo river has an average elevation of 4621 m shi et al 2018 the length of the river in china is approximately 2229 km you et al 2007 with a drainage area of approximately 240 000 km2 annual precipitation in the yarlung tsangpo river basin ytrb shows spatial variations due to terrain characteristics ranging from approximately 200 mm upstream to approximately more than 2000 mm downstream the average annual air temperature is 5 92 c li et al 2014 the average annual discharge is approximately 5 76 1010 m3 downstream shi et al 2018 more than 70 of the annual discharge occurs during the period from june to september while snow ice melt water contributes approximately 25 of the total annual discharge qu et al 2017 the yarlung tsangpo niyang river wetland fig 1 in the middle stream reach is located in one of the main administrative districts linzhi district in tibet and the wetland plays a fundamental role in terms of the environment ecology economy and politics with shoals and small islands at elevations from 0 m to 13 m above the main channel this area is very sensitive to climate variations and the upstream hydrological conditions 2 2 watershed runoff estimate to obtain watershed hydrological processes we utilized the process based and semi distributed soil water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 2012 https swat tamu edu the swat model is one of the most widely used hydrological models and it considers factors of meteorology underlying surfaces and human activities this model can effectively simulate hydrological soil erosion and pollutant migration processes importantly the swat model is effective in the simulation of snow and glacier melting processes and has been successfully applied at high altitudes in asia pritchard 2019 wu et al 2020 based on the characteristics of slope land use types and soil types the swat model divides a watershed into sub basins and then hydrological response units hrus for calculation the main governing equations of runoff estimates of the swat model are the soil conservation service curve number scs 1956 and manning s equation manning 1891 for snow melt simulation the swat model utilizes a temperature index based method the air temperature snowfall factor snowmelt factor snowpack temperature and its lag factor snow water content and fraction of areas covered by snow were especially considered in this model an areal depletion curve is employed in the swat model to calculate the growth and recession of snowpack anderson 1976 ficklin and barnhart 2014 this method improves snow and ice melt process simulations in the ytrb where snowpack is unevenly distributed due to topographic characteristics the snowmelt can be obtained using equation 1 ficklin and barnhart 2014 1 sn o mlt t b mlt i s n o cov i t sp i t max i 2 s m t m p where bmlt i

smtmp is the snow melt base temperature above which melting occurs c the input for the swat model includes information on topography soil land use meteorology and watershed management practices topographical data 1 km 1 km were obtained from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn soil data were obtained from the china soil scientific database provided by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences land use data 100 m 100 m were interpreted from landsat images classified based on the national land use database scheme and validated by field investigations the data set was provided by the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc the dominant land use types in the study area are pasture barren land and forest accounting for approximately 50 25 and 20 respectively of the total basin area observed meteorological data for daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation were obtained from 10 local meteorological stations the annual precipitation in these local stations ranged from 157 4 mm to 881 4 mm meteorological uncertainty exists in the topographically varied ytrb we utilized data from these stations which were located within or around the ytrb and covered basically the whole basin fig 1 and hence the simulation accuracy of meteorology can be high 2 3 wetland fluvial dynamic estimate to obtain the high spatial resolution of fluvial dynamic changes in wetlands induced by climate variations we utilized an updated version of a 2 d numerical model the finite volume method fvm 2d zhao et al 1996 this model can accurately estimate hydraulic conditions including water level river depth flow velocity and sediment concentration in aquatic systems thus successfully performing a numerical simulation of large scale water areas with complex terrain wang et al 2020 in preference to the 1 d numerical model the 2 d model can obtain variations in each grid of a wetland which greatly benefits fluvial dynamic analysis under climate change the 2 d shallow water equation in the conservative form was used as the basic equation in this model 2 q t f q x

carrying capacity in this study unstructured grids were used to adapt to complex river boundaries the riverine topographical data were less available due to the difficulty of conducting field surveys in the yarlung tsangpo river however we established grids with a relatively high resolution 30 m by integrating the channel cross section obtained from hydrological stations and the digital elevation model a total of 10 151 grids covering the study area were constructed to reduce calculation errors due to the constantly varying terrain and the wetland fluvial dynamics were calculated in each sub unit the inflow and outflow data of the wetland were obtained from the observed datasets xu et al 2019a as well as the modelled datasets by swat which were validated with observed values 2 4 model calibration and validation the swat model calibration and validation were conducted after sensitivity analysis using the sufi 2 method abbaspour et al 2007 yan et al 2018 a total of 28 parameters significantly affecting hydrological process simulation were identified as being the most sensitive parameters in this study the parameters including snowfall temperature snow melt base temperature melt rate for snow snowpack temperature lag factor and snow water content affecting melting processes were calibrated observed monthly discharge data from three hydrological stations nugesha station yangcun station nuxia station fig 1 during 1983 2000 were used for model calibration and validation xu et al 2019a these three stations cover the area from the middle to downstream reaches of the yarlung tsangpo river the swat model was run at a monthly time step during calibration and validation the periods of 1979 1982 1983 1991 and 1992 2000 were used for model warm up calibration and validation respectively evaluation criteria indicators including the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which have been widely used to evaluate watershed modelling were used to evaluate the model performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2015 for the watershed scale modelling of discharge the performance can be considered very good good and satisfactory when r2 0 85 0 75 r2 0 85 and 0 60 r2 0 75 respectively in addition the performance can be considered very good good and satisfactory when the nse 0 80 0 70 nse 0 80 and 0 50 nse 0 70 respectively moriasi et al 2015 for the nugesha station and yangcun station the model performance was good or very good during the calibration period and validation period for nuxia station the performance was very good for both the calibration period and the validation period fig 2 these results validated the swat model for the runoff simulation in the yarlung tsangpo river the 2 d numerical model fvm 2d was validated with the annual suspended load runoff measured at nuxia station fig 1 the modelled total amount of suspended sediment 32 2 million tons passing through nuxia station agreed well with the observed amount 30 million tons over past decades wang et al 2014 the detailed procedure of model validation was described by wang et al 2020 2 5 data analysis to analyse climate variation trends and their impacts on rivers and wetlands in the ytrb representative areas lazi zedang linzhi and bomi fig 1 from a to d along the main stream were selected for analysis first to evaluate the variation trends for temperature precipitation and runoff over the four decades the sen s slope evaluation method sen 1968 was applied to the four areas as a nonparametric method the sen s slope evaluation method is extensively used for the analysis of hydrometeorological time series partal and kahya 2006 second to test the significance of the variation trend for temperature precipitation and runoff the mann kendall test method 1975 was used to obtain the significance of variation this test method requires no special distribution of the whole series and is also widely used in the analysis of hydrometeorological time series wu et al 2020 the details of the calculation method are available in previous research gocic and trajkovic 2013 third to clarify the impacts of different climatic factors on hydrological and hydrodynamic responses we conducted analysis of variance anova analysis of correlation through spearman s test wu et al 2018 and principal component analysis pca anova reveals if there are any statistically significant differences in climatic indices between the four representative areas pca is effective in extracting useful information from vast and complex data series ouyang et al 2018 climatic indices in the linzhi and bomi areas near the wetland including the daily maximum temperature tmax daily minimum temperature tmin diurnal temperature range dtr precipitation amount and ratio of snow period precipitation to rainy period precipitation rsr were analysed with climatic data from 1982 to 2019 before the analysis these indices were pre processed with the z score normalization method to eliminate the effects of data dimension the principal components were identified based on an eigenvalue higher than 1 which indicated the component could explain the variations 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of temperature and precipitation the average temperature from 1979 to 2019 exhibited an increasing trend spatially from the upper reach to the lower reach with values of 7 41 c in lazi 9 75 c in zedang 10 36 c in linzhi and 10 31 c in bomi temporally all four areas exhibited upward trends in both tmax and tmin fig 3 the mann kendall trend test showed that these upward trends were all significant with p values lower than 0 005 for tmax the value of sen s slope was the highest in zedang 0 044 and the lowest in lazi 0 010 the slope for tmax in the lower reach was 0 033 in linzhi and 0 030 in bomi for tmin the value of sen s slope was higher in the upper and middle reaches with values of 0 050 in lazi and 0 051 in zedang the annual precipitation from 1979 to 2019 showed very large spatial differences with average values of 349 6 mm in lazi 386 8 mm in zedang 696 5 mm in linzhi and 881 4 mm in bomi temporally the mann kendall trend test showed that only lazi was observed to have a significant upward trend in precipitation p 0 014 a downward trend was found in bomi however this trend was not significant p 0 11 sen s slope estimation also demonstrated that temporal variation trends of precipitation showed spatial differences the slope values were 2 85 in lazi 1 75 in zedang 0 71 in linzhi and 2 76 in bomi 3 2 variations in river runoff during snowmelt and rainy periods annually the temporal characteristics of the annual average runoff along the yarlung tsangpo river showed different variation trends table 1 the average yearly runoff during 1982 2019 was the lowest in lazi 319 m3 s 1 and highest in bomi 1380 m3 s 1 due to their locations in the upper and lower reaches of the main stream respectively the sen s slopes in all of the areas except linzhi 0 19 were greater than zero with the top two highest values in zedang 5 18 and bomi 4 95 the mann kendall trend test showed that runoff only in zedang was observed to have a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 04 while runoff in bomi was observed to have a non significant upward trend with p 0 08 runoff in snowmelt periods march to april may and rainy periods may june to october were analysed the upper reach lazi was more influenced by snowmelt events fig 4 than were other areas in lazi the peak runoff throughout a year may occur in snowmelt periods e g the snowmelt runoff in 1982 1092 m3 s 1 in 1989 1232 m3 s 1 and in 2019 1820 m3 s 1 the runoff in lazi during snowmelt periods was basically equal to or slightly higher than the annual average runoff for that reach indicating that the discharge in lazi was more snow dominated than the lower reaches further down to the lower reaches the monthly runoff during snowmelt periods in linzhi and bomi ranged from 12 m3 s 1 to 675 m3 s 1 and from 196 m3 s 1 to 2881 m3 s 1 respectively simulated runoff during rainy periods accounted for a higher percentage of the average annual runoff than simulated runoff during snowmelt periods fig 5 the precipitation in rainy periods in lazi and zedang were significantly lower than those in linzhi and bomi before the 2000s however after the 2000s the rainy period precipitation in the four areas became closer particularly in recent years in lazi a peak runoff during rainy periods occurred in 2015 1451 m3 s 1 and for the other three areas obvious peaks occurred in 1998 due to increasing precipitation fig 5 in the lower reach the monthly runoff in linzhi and bomi ranged from 74 m3 s 1 to 1617 m3 s 1 and from 835 m3 s 1 to 9826 m3 s 1 respectively the runoff in linzhi during rainy periods was basically equal to or slightly higher than the annual average runoff for that reach for bomi the runoff during rainy periods was obviously higher than the annual average runoff for that reach in the lower reaches the peak runoff during the year usually occurred in the rainy season 3 3 variations in wetland fluvial dynamics during snowmelt and rainy periods the variations in wetland areas and fluvial dynamics during snowmelt periods from the early 1980s 1982 to 1984 to the middle 2000s 2004 2006 and then to the late 2010s 2017 to 2019 are shown in fig 6 selected sub units located in the wetland showed the flow velocity and water depth variations across the three time periods compared with the average values over the full study period fig 7 the wetland in this period was mainly composed of rivers with narrow channels the variations in flow velocity u in the yarlung tsangpo niyang river wetland over the decades

western to middle yarlung tsangpo river trunk fig 6b d f c f was mainly less than 5 m in the eastern wetland the water depth increased but the flow slowed with a velocity generally lower than 0 2 m s 1 fig 6a c e f to lower reach another change in fluvial dynamics was that the water area where the two rivers meet increased over time fig 6 b d e moreover the water depth along the channel after the confluence deepened by 1 to 2 m in the middle 2000s and late 2010s compared with that in the early 1980s fig 6b d f e f fig 7 during rainy periods the flow velocity in the section of the niyang river fig 8 a c e a b gradually decreased from the early 1980s to the middle 2000s and to the late 2010s but the changes in velocity were not significant in the main stream in the early 1980s the velocity in the niyang river trunk in the west fig 8a a b was high more than 1 0 m s 1 in the main channel and low in the shoals and deep ponds 0 2 m s 1 to 0 6 m s 1 in the late 2010s the niyang river trunk near the intersection of this river and the yarlung tsangpo river became more of a deep pond where the velocity decreased fig 8e f b d e moreover the wetland area in the northeast fig 8 f expanded greatly from the early 1980s to the late 2010s the water depth in the west fig 8b d c d d e ranged from 0 m to 7 m in the early 1980s and middle 2000s but increased to over 10 m in the late 2010s at the intersection of the niyang river and the yarlung tsangpo river fig 8f d e when moving on to the main stream an obvious increase in the water depth could be found where the orange turned red fig 8b d f e f selected sub units located in the wetland further showed the significant variations in water depth across the three time periods compared with the average value over the full study period fig 9 3 4 combined impacts of temperature and precipitation variations a comprehensive analysis of the combined impacts of temperature and precipitation variations was conducted during snowmelt periods fig 10 climatic indices between the four representative areas were significantly different table 2 the correlations between the precipitation in the four areas were not strong while the temperature between these areas were more correlated table 3 especially between linzhi and bomi average monthly runoff in snowmelt periods during 1982 to 2019 were investigated along the yarlung tsangpo river in lazi the precipitation during snowmelt periods was generally less than 4 mm upper quartile precipitation 3 8 mm and snowmelt runoff was more sensitive to temperature changes the top three highest runoff occurred when tmax varied approximately from 14 5 c to 16 0 c and tmin varied approximately from 0 5 c to 1 5 c in warmer years fig 10 lazi tmax 16 5 c to 18 0 c tmin 1 5 c to 2 5 c the runoff was significantly lower than the average runoff 331 m3 s 1 in zedang a combination of relatively lower temperature fig 10 zedang tmax 17 0 c to 18 0 c tmin 1 5 c to 3 0 c and medium precipitation fig 10 lazi 25 mm to 40 mm contributed to the top highest runoff in linzhi higher runoff 291 m3 s 1 to 345 m3 s 1 occurred with typical high precipitation fig 10 linzhi 101 mm to 130 mm and relatively higher temperature fig 10 linzhi tmin 4 5 c to 5 5 c in bomi higher runoff 1523 m3 s 1 to 1841 m3 s 1 also occurred with high precipitation fig 10 bomi 337 mm to 351 mm and relatively higher temperature fig 10 bomi tmin 4 5 c to 5 0 c during rainy periods fig 11 significant differences in climatic indices between the four representative areas were also observed table 4 in addition the correlations between the precipitation in linzhi and bomi were stronger than during snowmelt periods table 5 average monthly runoff in rainy periods during 1982 to 2019 were investigated along the yarlung tsangpo river in lazi higher runoff 580 m3 s 1 to 667 m3 s 1 was usually coupled with higher precipitation fig 11 lazi 319 mm to 541 mm but with relatively lower temperature fig 11 lazi tmax around 18 5 c tmin 6 0 c to 7 0 c in zedang a similar characteristic was observed that higher runoff was usually coupled with higher precipitation but with relatively lower temperature the top three highest runoff occurred with higher precipitation fig 11 zedang 380 mm to 517 mm in the downstream linzhi with a higher annual precipitation it was obvious that the runoff during rainy periods generally increased as the amount of precipitation increased however there was a different result in bomi in addition to precipitation temperature played an important role in affecting runoff in bomi a high precipitation fig 11 bomi 600 mm to 760 mm did not always result in a high runoff under a relatively low tmax and tmin fig 11 bomi tmax 19 5 c to 20 5 c tmin 9 0 c to 10 5 c 3 5 climatic contribution analysis taken together for the whole year pca highlighted the most influential factors contributing to river and wetland variance for linzhi three principal components pcs were identified which together accounted for 91 2 of the total variance table 6 the first second and third pcs explained approximately 42 7 27 0 and 21 5 of the total variance respectively the first pc mainly included tmax 0 889 rsr 0 711 and tmin 0 684 and the second pc was related to tmin 0 710 and precipitation 0 609 in the third pc dtr was the most important indicator 0 700 fig 12 for bomi two pcs were identified accounting for 66 8 of the total variance table 7 the first pc was associated with tmin 0 915 and tmax 0 767 and the second pc was primarily related to dtr 0 908 with the highest loading moreover the ratio of snow to rainfall contained more information than the precipitation amount 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of climate variations on river runoff the warming trend during the four decades was obvious in all four areas in the ytrb specifically the average value of the slope for tmin 0 044 was higher than that for tmax 0 029 indicating that the warming trend was more obvious for the daily minimum temperature liu et al 2019 also found that the minimum temperature increased faster than the maximum temperature by 0 12 0 13 c per decade for the precipitation variation the annual precipitation in the ytrb spatially increased from the upper reach to lower reach this variation was much affected by the basin s topography and indian summer monsoon sang et al 2016 temporally increasing trends in precipitation during 1979 2019 were found in the upper and middle reach areas lazi zedang while decreasing trends were found in the lower reach linzhi bomi based on sen s slope test the drier trend during the decades in the eastern ytrb middle to lower reach was observed as early as the 1960s wu et al 2016 the runoff characteristics throughout a year differed between these areas the impacts of melting on runoff were most significant in the uppermost area lazi with the peak runoff occurring in snowmelt periods in some years the peak runoff occurred in spring despite the seasonally delayed summer melt water pritchard 2019 our results highlighted the effects of melting in the upper reach with more obvious freeze thaw processes as reported by xu et al 2008 the increase in air temperature over the ytrb was significant in autumn and winter but was not very obvious in summer in the past several decades therefore more attention should be focused on runoff during the melt period because snow accumulation is dominant in autumn and winter ban et al 2020 in addition summer runoff accounted for the majority of the total annual discharge in most areas liu et al 2014 also revealed that rainy period runoff dominated annual runoff by over 70 in the ytrb our study stressed the role of melting in the upper reach but summer precipitation still accounted for most of the annual runoff across the basin 4 2 impacts of climate variations on wetland fluvial dynamics the wetlands in tibet are mainly lake wetlands which are less disturbed by human activities due to local development meng et al 2017 therefore climate change is the dominant reason for wetland changes in both snowmelt and rainy periods the confluence of the yarlung tsangpo river and the niyang river and the lower stream in the main channel were the most vulnerable to climate variations in this study explicit wetland changes 30 m 30 m during snowmelt and rainy periods were separately revealed the fluvial dynamics at a high resolution highlighted the water area expansion velocity redistribution and water depth growth from the early 1980s to late 2010s an estimate showed that glacier fed lakes in the third pole region had expanded by up to 123 km2 from 1990 to 1999 and further by 32 2 km2 from 2015 to 2018 shugar et al 2020 in addition runoff may still increase in future decades lutz et al 2014 supplying more water to lakes and wetlands the changes in wetland fluvial dynamics in response to climate variations during rainy periods were greater than those during snowmelt periods wetland hydrodynamic changes in response to climate change can indicate environmental and ecological processes the increases in water depth in the wetland especially during the flood season may favour nutrient transport and pollutant mitigation lee et al 2020 hansen et al 2018 found that hydrologic connectivity to the fluvial network of ephemeral wetlands was critical to watershed nitrate removal and the removal can be most effective under high flow conditions in addition velocity and water depth changes impacted water clarity and in turn photosynthesis limiting or accelerating phytoplankton growth velocity and water depth are also indicators of fish and migratory bird habitat conditions wang et al 2020 the velocity gradient somewhere in the studied wetland increased due to velocity changes over time indicating that more energy was needed for a fish to move upstream han et al 2020 further quantitative investigations with eco fluvial methods on wetland ecosystems in response to climate change are needed 4 3 implications for river and wetland systems under climate change the combined impacts of temperature and precipitation changes varied with location in the upper reach with more obvious freeze thaw processes and less precipitation the effect of temperature was more pronounced during snowmelt periods pronounced temperature effects on upper reach runoff during snowmelt periods were also found by wu et al 2020 in other rivers of the tibetan plateau in the middle to lower stream reaches temperature and precipitation together drove runoff changes our results revealed that the maximum temperature the minimum temperature and the ratio of snowfall to rainfall accounted for the most variance observed in rivers and wetlands precipitation was a more direct driver however temperature primarily controlled snow coverage over snowy glacier mountains compared with precipitation in all seasons and at all elevations in the ytrb ban et al 2020 in addition to local climate conditions the upper stream water supply from monsoon precipitation and glacier melt influenced the downstream rivers and wetlands wijngaard et al 2018 our study clarified river runoff and wetland fluvial dynamic characteristics in response to climate variations during historical periods based on long term estimates additionally this study can provide vital information for adaptation strategies for future climate change in the high asia region and useful insight into the potential future of a key freshwater supply for heavily populated south asia brahmaputra river past work has predicted that in the yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra river the runoff may increase by 6 9 under the scenario of representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and by 12 9 under rcp8 5 during 2020 to 2035 xu et al 2019a seasonally the runoff was predicted to be almost unchanged during dry periods and to have mixed varying characteristics during monsoon periods under rcp8 5 to 2100 islam et al 2018 however uncertainty exists in future climate data estimates partly due to the influences of great spatial variabilities khandu et al 2017 this variability in turn influences future runoff prediction although the new phase coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 is more skilful than its previous phases large cold biases still exist in simulations in the tibetan plateau zhu et al 2020 in this regard we utilized observed climate data from local stations and improved hydrological and hydrodynamic assessments for future climate change adaptation strategies based on the long term estimate under climate warming during historical periods our study provides vital references for runoff prediction under future climate change scenarios in addition our results revealed the increasing tendency of runoff in the main stream and in wetland areas and water depths in the past four decades the tendency may last until a maximum runoff volume occurs in the future however the peak water in the middle to lower basin was predicted to occur during 2030 to 2060 huss and hock 2018 future years should be the critical periods for water resource management and wetland ecosystem conservation for climate change adaptation 5 conclusions hydrological modelling and fluvial numerical model through the better representation of basin runoff and wetland characteristics with improved spatial resolution over the sparsely gauged yarlung tsangpo river were shown to provide reliable results suitable for climate impact studies from 1979 to 2019 four representative areas from the upper to lower stream reaches lazi zedang linzhi and bomi were observed with a significant upward trend in both daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature however precipitation displayed very large spatial differences only lazi was observed to have a significant upward trend in precipitation p 0 014 runoff in lazi zedang and bomi showed an increasing trend particularly in zedang where the increasing trend was the most significant p 0 04 moreover wetland area and water depth have enlarged over the past four decades with the non significant variations in velocity especially during rainy periods the water depth in the west ranged from 0 m to 7 m in the early 1980s and middle 2000s and increased to 10 m in the late 2010s during snowmelt periods the upper reach with more obvious freeze thaw processes was more sensitive to temperature changes than was the middle to lower reach changes in the maximum temperature the minimum temperature and the ratio of snow period precipitation to rainy period precipitation accounted for the most observed variance in rivers and wetlands this study presents powerful evidence that climate driven changes include increased river runoff expanded wetland water areas and disturbed wetland fluvial dynamics over the past decades in the high asia region our results could potentially indicate environmental and ecological processes as well this study provides vital information for water resource management and wetland conservation under climate change in the high asia region as well as useful insight into the potential future of a key freshwater supply for heavily populated south asia to advance our knowledge of the changing environment by the warming climate changes in sediment and nutrients and their impacts on phytoplankton and

4544,fine sediment is a key driver of water quality degradation in rivers globally and improved knowledge of its source and transport is required to assess the efficacy of sediment control options and pollution abatement strategies here the transport characteristics deposition erosion and flocculation of fine sediment were studied experimentally in an annular flume to provide parameters necessary to model fine sediment transport in the upper river taw in southwest england deposition experiments were carried out using a sediment water mixture in the flume and in situ size distributions of sediment flocs were measured to assess flocculation and settling behavior of sediment the influence of bed shear stress and bed consolidation were investigated in a series of erosion experiments these data were used to calibrate and test a mathematical model of fine sediment transport in annular flumes flume model and the measured and modelled data were in good agreement transport parameters for cohesive sediments such as the critical shear stresses for deposition and erosion as well as the particle density porosity and settling velocity as a function of floc size were established the density and settling velocity of the cohesive sediments were sensitive to the biological activity within the floc structure data from the flume experiments are necessary as input parameters to models such as rivfloc or shetran that simulate fine sediment transport in the river taw at the catchment scale and assess the efficacy of sediment control options and catchment management scenarios keywords cohesive sediment rotating circular flume deposition and erosion rate settling rate bed shear stress flocculation 1 introduction excessive fine grained sediment inputs pose a serious threat to lotic

al 2011 such negative impacts arise due to a multitude of factors and responses associated with the presence of elevated levels of fine grained sediment including reduced light penetration and photosynthesis physiological abrasion or damage to organisms and lower availability of dissolved oxygen or prey wood and armitage 1997 von vertrab et al 2013 chapman et al 2014 fine grained sediment erosion transport and deposition processes also exert a fundamental control on the redistribution and fate of nutrients and contaminants which degrade water quality and can also impact on aquatic ecology ackroyd et al 1986 horowitz and elrick 1987 horowitz 1991 1999 waters 1995 westrich and f√∂rstner 2007 given the above context erosion and sediment management in river catchments continues to represent a policy priority especially since sediment pollution is frequently a reason for not achieving compliance with water quality or biological standards collins et al 2011 montanarella et al 2016 in response scientific research continues to be directed towards assessing the efficacy of sediment control options or strategies either experimentally or using elicitation of expert judgement e g braskerud 2002 ockenden et al 2012 cuttle et al 2016 or using modelling frameworks e g taguas et al 2012 luz et al 2016 collins and zhang 2016 gudino elizondo et al 2019 in scaling up from experimental e g mitigation measure to landscape scales it becomes important to consider the sediment budget dietrich and dunne 1978 trimble 1983 1995 walling et al 2001 2002 2006 since storage terms within budgets can influence the timeliness of response to catchment best management summer et al 1996 in essence those systems with higher sediment delivery ratios can be expected to be more sensitive and responsive to best management interventions walling 1999 whereas those systems with more retentive pollutant delivery cascades are likely to take years to decades to respond to land management meals et al 2010 sharpley et al 2013 bieroza et al 2019 here a number of points are noteworthy channel sediment stores in catchments can be divided into longer term overbank floodplain deposits and shorter term repositories of riverbed sediment the magnitudes of both storage terms as proportions of catchment fine grained sediment budgets have been reported in the international literature e g walling et al 1999 2001 2006 walling and collins 2008 but the significance of the character of riverbed sediment has rarely been considered in the context of landscape management and response to targeted sediment mitigation in wanting to take explicit account of any temporal mismatch between sediment control policies and landscape response driven by the erosion deposition and potential remobilisation of fine grained sediment in catchments it is necessary to study and understand cohesive sediments since these represent the natural in situ characteristics of the material moving through the landscape delivery cascade research on cohesive sediment transport has shown that materials can interact with gravel beds and result in the entrapment of fine sediments in the channel system glasbergen et al 2014 harper et al 2017 cohesive sediments are comprised predominantly of clay and silt size fractions winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 grabowski et al 2011 due to inter particle physical chemical forces of attraction and repulsion cohesive sediments exhibit a tendency to flocculate in the water column which can strongly influence transport properties such as porosity density and settling velocity of particles partheniades 1962 krone 1962 lick 1982 accordingly the effective size and density of cohesive sediments change as a function of the flow field lau and krishnappan 1997 and the degree of flocculation which is dependent upon several factors including the surface chemistry of particles physico chemical properties of the water column biological factors such as bacteria and the hydrodynamic nature of flowing water droppo et al 2001 flocculation of cohesive materials in the water column and subsequent settling of flocs on the riverbed result in the formation of surficial fine grained laminae sfgl droppo and stone 1994 which represents a significant potential sink for contaminants bound to cohesive sediments stone and droppo 1994 numerical models have been developed to predict the transport and fate of sediment and associated contaminants but they require information on the transport characteristics of sediment as input parameters wiilis and krishnappan 2011 krishnappan 1991 1997 ewen et al 2000 transport variables for cohesive sediments such as erosion rate as well as the critical shear stress for erosion and deposition must be determined by direct measurement lukey et al 1995 rotating annular flumes have been widely used for this purpose whereby circulating flow is triggered in the annulus through the rotation of an annular ring with the infinite flow length resulting in a fully developed boundary layer andersen 2001 stone and krishnappan 2003 this experimental setup is ideal for studying cohesive sediment dynamics as flocculated sediments are undisturbed by re circulation this approach can be used to determine the effects of flow field on erosion and deposition of cohesive sediments collected from different geographical locations and aquatic systems graham et al 1992 widdows et al 1998 pope et al 2006 to improve knowledge of flocculation manning et al 2007 to evaluate the effects of gravel on fine sediment dynamics glasbergen et al 2014 and to study the roles of consolidation and bio stabilization for sediment erodibility stone et al 2011 critically data derived from flume experiments have enabled the development of models such as rivfloc krishnappan 1991 1997 that can be used to simulate fine sediment transport at multiple scales in storm water management ponds krishnappan and marsalek 2002 harbours skafel and krishnappan 1999 and large river systems in canada milburn and krishnappan 2003 droppo and krishnappan 2016 even where in channel sediment transport and deposition are represented explicitly within catchment modelling frameworks the need for empirical calibration of relevant parameters remains important to ensure acceptable model performance on a catchment specific basis one such example is shetran ewen et al 2000 birkinshaw et al 2010 however it should be noted that the in channel sediment transport component of this model lukey et al 1995 estimates the deposition of suspended sediment using the finite element equation derived by ariathurai and krone 1976 but this is dependent on empirical calibration there remains a general lack of knowledge regarding the transport and fate of cohesive sediments in many fluvial systems including those rivers in the uk that originate from moors and a concomitant lack of consideration of the implications for both landscape management and modelling process based models require knowledge of transport parameters such as the critical shear stress for deposition and erosion as well as empirical coefficients that are needed to define the relationships among sediment size density and settling velocities ewen et al 2000 at the present state of knowledge these transport parameters and the empirical coefficients for cohesive sediments can only be obtained by direct measurements in the laboratory using site specific sediment in specialized rotating annular flumes lukey et al 1995 accordingly the objectives of this study were to 1 rigorously quantify the deposition and erosion characteristics of fine sediment from the upper river taw river observatory in southwest uk in a rotating annular flume 2 evaluate the relationship among sediment size density and settling velocity and erosion and deposition rates using a fine sediment transport model for the annular flume flume model and 3 to discuss the implications for sediment management and modelling such information can then be used in within channel sediment transport models such as rivfloc krishnappan 1991 or slope to channel models like shetran birkinshaw et al 2010 that utilize a finite sediment transport component 2 methods 2 1 2 1study area the river taw catchment is located in devon south west england and drains a total area of 914 km2 fig 1 the headwaters are located on the dartmoor granite plateau ca 550 m a s l and the river then flows over predominantly carboniferous interbedded sandstones and shales before draining into bideford bay in the bristol channel average annual rainfall for the period 1992 to 2014 ranges from a high of 1601 mm at dartmoor 50 703 n 3 976 w to 940 mm at the river mouth 51 089 n 4 147 w uk national meteorological archive most of the precipitation falls in the winter and the climate is typical of temperate regions in southwestern uk 5 20 c this study was conducted along a 19 km reach that drains an area of 41 3 km2 in the river taw catchment fig 1 general topographical and hydrological characteristics are summarised in table 1 land use is predominantly improved agricultural land mainly grassland supporting beef dairy and sheep production with a limited amount of cultivated land spring and winter wheat and barley maize winter oil seed rape and deciduous woodland soils of the lowland portion of the study catchment are typically poorly draining clay rich gley soils and brown earths while the soils on the dartmoor upland at the source consist of peat and podzols river hydrology is primarily surface water driven and river discharge q is flashy in response to rainfall events base flow in the study reach is maintained during extended dry periods by water stored within the peat soils on dartmoor and rock fissures of the carboniferous country rock gafni and brooks 1986 show that peatland drainage during large runoff events can lead to increased erosion and that suspended solids from these sources can cause siltation and nutrient enrichment of downstream watercourses kl√∏ve 1997 eroded peat deposits can have cohesive properties that cause particles to flocculate and that once deposited biostabilization can influence the critical shear stress for erosion of these materials marttila and kl√∏ve 2008 sediment erosion from agricultural land in the upper river taw is a key pressure on fish habitat as noted in conjunction with the eu water framework directive wfd european union 2000 2 2 sampling of channel bed cohesive sediments a hydrometric survey consisting of 18 river cross sections located 0 5 km apart was conducted during summer low flows in 2018 fig 1 the bank full width of the river along the study reach is 10 m and the bank full depth is 1 m the riverbed is armoured with large stones including pebbles cobbles and bedrock outcrops a profile of the riverbed was constructed from cross section survey data and the average slope of the riverbed is 0 0105 fig 2 although the bed material in the study river reach is very coarse fine grained material is present in the river channel bed because of the entrapment process which retains fine material in the lee of large rocks or directly in the gravel bed matrix as interstitial material fine sediment deposits are also present in recirculation eddy zones and along the edges of the river channel where the shear stresses of the flow field are low samples of cohesive channel bed sediment were collected using a remobilisation technique lambert and walling 1988 collins and walling 2007 quinn et al 2009 clapcott et al 2011 naden et al 2016 this method provides robust and precise estimates of the quality and quantity of fine sediment stored on and within river channel beds duerdoth et al 2015 during sample collection a plastic stilling well height 0 4 m surface area 0 125 m2 was inserted carefully into the riverbed gravel matrix to minimise the loss of resuspended sediment by winnowing the river water and upper 5 10 cm of the channel bed enclosed in the stilling well were stirred and agitated agitation of both the water column and riverbed provided a basis for sampling fine sediment stored both as a surface drape and within the interstices of the gravel matrix each bed sediment sample comprised a composite of 3 5 sub samples retrieved from different points in the channel at each cross section location fig 1 the river water and substrate were consistently agitated for 60 s prior to sampling of the resuspended bed sediment within the stilling well approximately 20 l of sediment river water mixture was collected at each sample location and stored at 4 c prior to sample processing once the sediment had settled they were dewatered by first decanting the majority of the water into a second barrel via a 2 mm sieve to remove any large organic debris this largely sediment free water was cycled for 1 h through an alfa laval ifb403x 73 mobile centrifuge to remove any residual fine sediment sediment collected on the centrifuge lamellae was washed off and collected and added to that collected in the liquid return vessel the bulk of the sediment remaining in the initial sample barrel was then also passed through a 2 mm sieve the barrel was washed clean with minimal water and this was used to wash through material retained on the sieve mesh all residual sediment water was allowed to settle and dewatered further by decanting the upper part of the water column 2 3 l and centrifuging using a sorvall rc5b plus centrifuge with a sla 3000 rotor at 11 000 rpm for 15 mins supernatant water was then discarded from the centrifuge vessels the residual sediment was then washed out of the centrifuge vessels and returned to the bulk of the remaining sediment creating a sediment water mix of 1l for each sampling site these samples were stored at 4 c before being shipped from the uk to canada where they were stored in a laboratory cold room a composite sediment sample was prepared for the flume experiment by mixing sediment from all 18 sampling sites in a pail and wet sieved using a 200 mesh sieve 2 3 description of the rotating annular flume the rotating annular flume assembly used in this study is located at the national water research institute at burlington ontario canada the annular flume is 5 0 m in mean diameter 0 30 m wide and 0 30 m deep and it rests on a rotating platform which is 7 0 m in diameter a counter rotating lid fits inside the flume with close tolerance 1 5 mm gap on either side experimental krishnappan 1993 and theoretical petersen and krishnappan 1994 studies carried out in this flume assembly show that the flow field generated is nearly two dimensional with nearly constant bed shear stress across the width of the flume a computational fluid dynamics model called phoenics was used to predict the bed shear stress distributions across the width of the flume for a given rotational speed of the flume taking into account the roughness characteristics of the flow boundaries krishnappan and engel 2004 phoenics also provided the turbulence characteristics such as the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and the turbulent eddy viscosity that are needed for the flume model the particle size distributions and images of suspended solids during erosion experiments were measured using image analysis suspended solids were collected from the flume sampling port and 5 ml aliquots of the sample were transferred into each of three 50 ml plastic columns and then filtered under low vacuum 13 3 kpa to prevent floc breakage flocs settled on 0 45 mm millipore ha filters were placed in petri dishes and air dried at room temperature for 48 h particles on filters were evaluated using image analysis to a lower resolution of 2 mm with a zeiss axiovert 100 microscope fitted with a sony xc75 ccd camera connected to a computer running northern eclipse image analysis software de boer and stone 1999 2 4 deposition tests in the deposition experiments the flume was filled to a depth of 12 cm with tap water and a known mass of fine channel bed sediment sampled from the upper river taw was added to achieve a fully mixed initial sediment concentration of about 300 mg l 1 the sediment water suspension was then thoroughly mixed in the flume first by mechanical mixing and then by rotating the flume and the lid at relatively high speeds 2 5 rpm for the lid and 2 0 rpm for the flume yielding a bed shear stress of 0 6 pa after operating the flume at this high speed for about twenty minutes the speeds were lowered to achieve a bed shear stress of 0 12 pa and the flume was operated at this shear stress level for five hours water sediment samples were extracted from the flume through a sampling port located at the mid depth at five minute intervals during the first hour of the test and every ten minutes thereafter until the completion of the test each time a sample was withdrawn the volume removed was replaced by adding an equivalent amount of sediment water mixture back into the flume in order to keep the water surface in contact with the lid all the time a test was completed after the suspended sediment concentration remained quasi constant for 1 h the entire process took five hours to complete water sediment samples were analysed for concentrations of solids by a gravimetric method environment canada 1988 which consisted of filtering each sample and drying and weighing the residue the size distribution of the sediment in suspension was measured when the flume was operated at high speed and at the end of the test by collecting samples and undertaking measurements using a lisst laser in situ scattering and transmissometry 100x sequioa scientific particle size analyser upon completion of a test the entire procedure was repeated for another initial concentration of 600 mg l 1 the bed shear stress was maintained at the same level after the completion of this test three other deposition tests were conducted for bed shear stresses of 0 06 pa 0 21 pa and 0 33 pa keeping the initial concentration at 600 mg l 1 five deposition tests were conducted in total the hydraulic conditions for all five deposition tests are summarized in table 2 2 5 erosion tests erosion characteristics of fine sediment deposits resulting from the settling of the sediment used in the deposition experiments were examined using erosion tests in these tests the sediment water mixture in the flume was left undisturbed for a period to allow the sediment to settle and consolidate on the flume bed three different consolidation times were used 22 h 38 h and 160 h in each erosion test care was taken to ensure that the depth of water in the flume was maintained at 12 cm so that the lid was in contact with the water surface the flume and the lid were then set in motion and their speeds were increased in steps at each step sediment samples were collected to measure the concentration of the eroded sediment as a function of time when the sediment concentration reached a steady state value the flume speed was increased to the next level whenever there was sufficient sediment suspended in the water column sediment samples were collected for size analysis using the lisst this procedure was repeated until the maximum permissible flume speed was reached a summary of the erosion test parameters is provided in table 3 2 6 determination of transport parameters for the upper river taw cohesive sediment transport parameters for the upper river taw cohesive sediment were determined using the fine sediment transport model flume complete details of the flume model can be found in krishnappan and marsalek 2002 but a brief outline of the model is provided here flume treats the motion of sediment in two stages a transport or a settling stage and a flocculation stage the governing equation for the settling stage was obtained from mass balance considerations and assuming that the flow in the rotating flume is uniform in the longitudinal and tangential directions the one dimensional mass balance equation shown below was adopted 1 c k t w k c k z z Œ≥ c k z s where c k is the concentration of sediment in size fraction k w k is the settling velocity of that fraction and Œ≥ is the dispersion coefficient in the vertical direction the symbol t represents the time axis and the symbol z represents the coordinate axis in the vertical direction s is the source sink term the boundary conditions used for the settling stage are as follows at the free surface 2 w k c k Œ≥ c k z 0 at the bed 3 w k c k Œ≥ c k z q e q d q entrap the free surface boundary condition expresses the balance between the settling flux and the dispersive flux so that there is no external input of sediment at this boundary at the bed surface it is assumed that the settling and dispersive fluxes are balanced by the net amount of sediment exchanged at the sediment water interface the sediment exchange at this interface can occur in three ways i sediment can be eroded from the bed because of the shear stress induced by the flow and entrainment into the water column q e ii sediment can settle to the bed and stays at the bed as the deposited sediment q d and iii sediment can settle to the bed and a portion of the settled sediment can ingress into the interstitial pores of the bed sediment and become unavailable for further erosion and entrainment q entrap the first two components of the sediment exchange at the sediment water interface have been studied extensively in the literature several formulations exist to quantify these components for example the erosion rate of fine sediment has been studied by partheniades 1962 mehta and partheniades 1975 parchure 1980 lick 1982 and krone 1999 deposition characteristics of fine sediment have been studied among others by krone 1962 mehta and partheniades 1975 and lick 1982 in this study the approach proposed by krone 1999 for erosion and krone 1962 for deposition have been adopted accordingly the erosion flux was calculated as 4 q e e where e is the erosion rate function evaluated by krishnappan et al 2020 using krone s 1999 approach the deposition flux was calculated as 5 q d p w k c kb where p is a probability parameter which gives a measure of the probability that a floc settling to the riverbed stays at the bed krone 1962 proposed a relationship for p as 6 p 1 œÑ œÑ crd where œÑ is the bed shear stress and œÑ crd is the critical shear stress for deposition which is defined as the bed shear stress above which none of the initially suspended sediment would deposit krones definition the third entrapment component is assumed to be directly proportional to the settling flux near the riverbed and is expressed as 7 q entrap Œ± w k c kb where Œ± is the proportionality constant and is termed the entrapment coefficient this coefficient is expected to be a function of porosity of the gravel substrate thickness of the gravel bed layer and the permeability of the substrate this term has to be determined from experiments using the rotating annular flume the flocculation stage was modelled based on the coagulation equation fuchs 1964 shown below 8 n i j t Œ≤ n i t i 1 k i j n j t 1 2 Œ≤ i 1 k i j j n i j j n j t where n i t and n j t are number concentrations of particle size classes i and j respectively k i j is the collision frequency function which is a measure of the probability that a particle of size i collides with a particle of size j in unit time and Œ≤ is the cohesion factor which defines the probability that a pair of collided particles will coalesce and form a new floc the term Œ≤ accounts for the effects of cohesion properties such as the electrochemical properties of the sediment water mixture and the effects of polymers secreted by micro organisms in this study Œ≤ is treated as an empirical parameter and was determined through the calibration of the model using the annular flume data the first term on the right side of eq 8 gives the reduction of particles in size class i because of flocculation of these particles in size class i with all other size classes the second term gives the generation of new particles in the size class i because of flocculation of particles in smaller size classes in this process the mass of particles is assumed to be conserved equation 8 was simplified by considering the particle sizes in discrete size classes where the continuous particle size space is considered in discrete size ranges each range is considered as a bin containing particles of certain size range for example r 1 is the geometric mean radius of particles in bin 1 the particle ranges were selected in such a way that the mean volume of particles in bin i is twice that of the preceding bin under this scheme when particles of bin i flocculate with particles in bin j j i the newly formed particles will fit into bins i and i 1 the proportion of particles going to these bins can be calculated by considering the mass balance of particles before and after flocculation with this simplification the coagulation equation can be expressed in discrete form as follows 9 Œ¥ n i Œ¥ t Œ≤ k r i r j n i n j f i j Œ≤ k r i r j n i n j 1 f i j Œ≤ k r i r j n i 1 n j where f i j is the allocation function given by 10 f i j œÅ s j v i œÅ s j v j œÅ s j 1 v i 1 œÅ s i v i œÅ s j 1 v i 1 where œÅ s denotes the density of the flocs and v is the volume of the flocs the density of the flocs is dependent on their size and an empirical relationship proposed by lau and krishnappan 1997 was adopted in this study the form of the relationship is 11 œÅ s œÅ œÅ p œÅ e x p b d c where œÅ s œÅ and œÅ p are densities of flocs water and parent material forming the flocs respectively d is the diameter of the floc and b and c are empirical coefficients to be determined through model calibration the settling velocity of flocs needed for the settling stage of the particle motion was calculated using the above density relation and stoke s law the resulting expression is as follows 12 w k 1 65 18 g d k 2 œÖ e x p b d c where g stands for acceleration due to gravity and œÖ stands for the kinematic viscosity of water the collision frequency function k i j takes different functional forms depending on the collision mechanisms that bring the particles to close proximity the mechanisms considered in this study include i brownian motion kb ii turbulent fluid shear ksh iii inertia of particles in turbulent flow ki and 4 differential settling of flocs kds an effective collision frequency function kef as calculated in terms of the individual collision functions as follows 13 k ef k b k sh 2 k i 2 k ds 2 the collision frequency functions for the individual collision mechanisms are found in valioulis and list 1984 the break up of flocs due to turbulent fluctuations of the flow was modelled using a scheme proposed by tambo and watanabe 1979 according to this scheme a collision agglomeration function was introduced as a multiplier to the collision frequency function kef this produced an effective collision frequency that resulted in an optimum floc size distribution for a given level of turbulence the function proposed by tambo and watanabe 1979 is as follows 14 Œ± r Œ± 0 1 r r m n where r is the number of primary particles contained in a floc and rm is the number of particles contained in the biggest floc for the given level of turbulence the parameters Œ± 0 and n assume values of 1 3 and 6 respectively application of the flume model to simulate the deposition and erosion tests in the annular flume is discussed under the following results and discussion section 3 results and discussion 3 1 deposition tests the results from the deposition experiments showed that sediment concentration decreases as a function of time and reached a steady state value for all the tests fig 3 the steady state concentration is a function of both initial concentration and bed shear stresses the influence of initial concentration on the deposition process from tests 1 and 2 show that the steady state concentration depends on the initial concentration when the bed shear stress is held constant fig 4 this result is in agreement with partheniades et al 1968 who hypothesized that the dependence of steady state concentration on initial concentration is due to the peculiar settling behaviour of flocculated material cohesive sediments because only stronger flocs that can withstand the higher shear stresses near the riverbed can deposit weaker flocs are however likely to break up by the high shear stresses near the riverbed and are brought back into suspension again the number of stronger flocs that could form in a given sediment mixture is a function of the total amount of sediment suspended in the water column the amount of sediment deposited is therefore a function of the initial amount of cohesive sediment in the water column partheniades et al 1968 observed that when the suspended sediment was normalized using the initial concentration the two curves collapse into one suggesting that when the amount of sediment deposited is expressed as the fraction of the amount of sediment initially in the water column it becomes independent of the initial amount concentration and instead is a function of bed shear stress only in the present study normalized concentration plots for deposition tests 1 and 2 show that the two curves indeed collapse into one and are nearly equal fig 5 during deposition tests 2 to 5 where the initial concentration was held constant at 600 mg l 1 the steady state concentration is a function of bed shear stress fig 3 for the lowest bed shear stress tested 0 06 n m2 the steady state concentration was about 40 mg l 1 6 7 of the initial concentration whereas for the highest shear stress 0 33 n m2 tested the steady state concentration was about 530 mg l 1 88 of the initial concentration if the bed shear stresses tested were somewhat 0 06 n m2 then all initially suspended sediment would have deposited similarly if the bed shear stress is slightly higher than 0 33 n m2 then none of the initially suspended sediment would deposit there have been two proposed definitions of critical shear stress for deposition of fine sediment in the first partheniades 1968 defined the critical shear stress for deposition as the bed shear stress below which all of the initially suspended sediment would deposit alternatively krone 1962 proposed the critical shear stress for deposition as the bed shear stress above which none of the initially suspended sediment will deposit using the results of our deposition experiments critical shear stress for deposition for the two definitions were estimated the value of critical shear stress for deposition according to partheniades definition is 0 05 n m2 whereas the corresponding value according to krone s definition was 0 40 n m2 3 2 application of the flume model to simulate the deposition experiments in the flume the flume model was applied to the rotating flume for the conditions in which the deposition experiments were carried out the flow field generated in the flume was predicted using the phoenics model and the bed shear stress œÑ needed for the flume model see eq 6 was evaluated from the phoenics model results phoenics also provided the turbulence characteristics such as turbulent diffusivity to calculate the dispersion coefficient Œ≥ and the turbulence dissipation rate that is needed for evaluating the collision frequency functions sediment size classes needed for the model were obtained from the measured size distribution data during the high speed operation of the flume using the lisst 100x the parameters appearing in the model such as the coefficients b and c which appear in the relationship between the floc density and floc sizes i e eq 11 the cohesion parameter Œ≤ which appears in the coagulation equation i e equation 8 and the critical shear stress for deposition crd i e equation 6 were adjusted until the predicted concentration variations compared reasonably well with the measured data a comparison between measured and predicted concentration for deposition test 1 and 2 are presented in fig 6 and show good agreement between the measured values and the model prediction for most of the elapsed time at the beginning of the experiment when the flume speed was lowered from high speed operation to the experimental condition the agreement between measured and modelled predictions was poor during this period it is likely that the concentration field is highly three dimensional and the measured data might not have captured the true variation the parameters used in the predictions for test 1 and 2 are b 0 025 c 1 35 and Œ≤ 0 13 knowing the values of b and c the relationships for density and settling velocity as a function of floc size i e eqs 11 and 12 can be quantified and hence the density and settling velocity of the upper river taw sediment can be evaluated as shown in fig 7 this figure shows that flocs around 20 to 30 ¬µm have the highest settling velocity and that these fractions are likely to participate in the settling process flocs in the size ranges of 0 to 5 ¬µm and 50 to 400 ¬µm are likely to be transported mainly in suspension through the upper river taw main river channel the comparison between measured concentration and the predicted values using the flume model for tests 3 4 ad 5 fig 8 shows that the agreement is fairly good for most of the elapsed time similar to what was observed for tests 1 and 2 the transport parameters that were employed for these three tests are as follows b 0 02 c 1 15 and Œ≤ 0 25 note that these values are different from those used for tests 1 and 2 with these new values the density and settling velocity relationships i e eqs 11 and 12 yield different values for density and settling velocity as shown in fig 9 in this figure settling velocities are much higher than values corresponding to the flocs in tests 1 and 2 and a broader size range of sediment flocs are likely to participate in the settling process the maximum settling velocity is close to 0 35 mm sec compared to 0 085 mm sec for tests 1 and 2 and flocs in the size range of 20 to 120 ¬µm have a settling velocity 0 1 mm sec the reason for the observed change in density and settling velocity of the flocs for tests 3 4 and 5 compared with tests 1and 2 may be biological activity that might have been activated when the sediment was placed in the flume and subjected to room temperature prior to the commencement of the experiments on nov 13 2018 test 1 was carried out on this day see table 1 the sediment was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c when the sediment is in the flume and is subjected to the room temperature it is possible that bacteria could have altered the floc structure of the sediment in addition to making the flocs stronger and hence characterized by a higher settling velocity the flocs are more efficient in floc formation as has been indicated by the change in the Œ≤ value from 0 13 for tests 1 and 2 to 0 25 for tests 3 4 and 5 when Œ≤ values are high the efficiency of flocculation is high i e higher numbers of collisions will result in the formation of flocs 3 3 erosion tests erosion tests were conducted for three different consolidation periods table 2 and the corresponding concentration profiles as a function of shear stress are presented in fig 10 the erosion data indicate that the sediment deposit was completely stable until the shear stress reached a value of 0 09 n m2 which can be considered as the critical shear stress for erosion of the surficial riverbed sediment layer notably the critical shear stress for erosion is larger than the critical shear stress for deposition i e 0 05 n m2 partheniades definition which is a distinguishing characteristic of cohesive sediment for coarse grained cohesionless sediment the two critical shear stresses are equal the difference in critical shear stresses has implications for modelling the transport behaviour of cohesive sediments for shear stress step values exceeding the critical shear stress for erosion the sediment bed started to erode and the concentration of sediment in suspension increased at each shear stress step the eroded sediment concentration increased suddenly after the shear stress change suggesting that the sediment erosion follows the pattern of bulk erosion as the sediment erosion continues the erosion rate decreases due to the increasing strength of the bed with bed depth erosion during the later stages of the shear stress step is defined as the surface erosion when the removal of the material from the bed is particle by particle and the sediment concentration in the water column approaches a steady state value fig 10 such a behaviour is also a characteristic of cohesive sediments as previously reported lick 1982 partheniades 1984 parchure and mehta 1985 an increased shear strength in the bed interior due to sediment consolidation by its own weight reduced water content and possibly by biological processes maa et al 1998 thomsen and gust 2000 bale et al 2006 2007 droppo et al 2009 amos et al 2010 is offered as an explanation for attaining the steady state concentration during erosion therefore increasing shear stresses are needed to erode deposited material from the interior of the cohesive sediment deposits the influence of the consolidation period on the amount sediment eroded for the lower shear stresses i e for shear stresses up to 0 21 n m2 is shown in fig 10 3 4 application of the flume model to simulate the erosion experiments in the flume the flume model was applied to the erosion tests and the concentration of eroded sediment was simulated for all the tests the erosion rate function e needed for the model was calculated using the approach of krone 1999 and reported by krishnappan et al 2020 as 15 e h 1 c 1 c 0 c 1 t 1 2 where h c 1 is the erosion rate at the start of the shear stress step and 1 c 0 is the concentration of the eroded sediment at the end of the shear stress step using eq 15 the flume model was run for all the shear stress steps and for all three consolidation periods while running the model the deposition and entrapment processes were suppressed and only the erosion process was modelled figure 11 shows the comparison between model predictions and measured data and as can be seen from this figure the agreement between the two is favourable the coefficients c 0 and c 1 used in the model varied depending on the shear stress and the consolidation times these values for all shear stress steps and consolidation times are summarized in table 4 and their variations are plotted as shown in figure 12 from figure 12 it can be seen that the coefficients exhibit a complex behaviour with respect to the bed shear stress both coefficients decrease initially as the shear stress increases reach minimum values and then increase as the shear stress is further increased the minimum conditions for the coefficients imply maximum erosion rate and maximum amount of sediment eroded implying bulk erosion the minimum coefficients shifts to the right as the consolidation period increases see figure 12 indeed when the consolidation period is 22 hrs minimum conditions for both coefficients are around 0 15 pa whereas for the consolidation period of 160 hrs the minimum conditions are shifted to 0 21 pa for c 0 and 0 25 pa for c 1 this suggests that consolidation has played a role in strengthening the river bed and hence under these conditions higher shear stresses are needed to cause bulk erosion changes in floc number size and shape during erosion experiments as a function of shear stress and consolidation period are presented in figure 13 and particle size characteristics of these samples are listed in table 5 biostabilization has been recognized as an important factor affecting the erodibility of fine sediment and previous studies show that increasing consolidation time and related development of phytomicrobenthos on the sediment bed cause the critical shear stress for erosion œÑcrit to increase with increasing consolidation period stone et al 2011 in the present study erosion data show that longer consolidation times reduce the amount of sediment initially eroded for a given shear stress and œÑcrit for upper river taw sediment was similar for all three erosion experiments these results highlight the need to take into account the benthic and microbial communities for various sediment types when applying the results of other studies to parameterize fine sediment transport models with regard to the effects of consolidation on the size number and shape of flocs in suspension there was an increase in floc size at t 240 min 2c but floc size decreased at maximum shear t 420 suggesting that the larger flocs formed previously in the flume at lower shear break up at conditions of higher shear while this observation is expected and consistent with previous studies stone et al 2008 the number of flocs decreased with increasing shear stress during the erosion experiment with the longest consolidation period figure 12 3a d and surprisingly the median diameter d50 in image 3d increased suggesting that flocs produced under these conditions are more stable than for shorter consolidation periods figure 12 1d and 2d 3 5 implications for management the fact that agricultural soils and additional sediment sources in the study landscape will be releasing water stable aggregates which evolve during the sediment delivery cascade from slopes or channel margins to and through the river channel has important implications for the hydraulic behaviour of fluvial fine grained sediment ongley et al 1981 droppo et al 2005 recent monitoring and observational work on cohesive heavy seasonally waterlogged soils in the study area has identified raindrop impacted saturation excess overland flow as an important mechanism for sediment mobilisation and delivery from agricultural land to the channel system pulley and collins 2019 rain splash has been reported to detach both aggregates and primary particles young 1980 deploey 1981 meyer et al 1992 slattery and burt 1993 however with increasing runoff depth direct raindrop impact will be replaced by other mechanisms of aggregate detachment and disintegration including slaking differential swelling and physico chemical dispersion le bissonnais 1996 soil aggregate stability in essential for helping to control erosion six and paustian 2014 and is closely linked to soil structure and critical functions including water holding capacity whilst this study has not explicitly examined and compared water stable aggregates in runoff from landscape sediment sources and cohesive riverbed sediment the flume experiments using the latter clearly suggest that aggregate disintegration with factors including ploughing and tillage chrenkov√° et al 2014 of arable land or during grassland scheduled re seeds is likely to deliver finer cohesive sediment with a greater propensity for settling on the riverbed the experimental work suggested that biostabilisation is likely to increase the critical shear necessary for remobilisation of riverbed sediment and here it is important to acknowledge that the upper river taw catchment is currently failing the eu water framework directive due to excess phosphate loss which is likely to help promote biostabilisation in the channel system through impacts on lower trophic levels in turn such in channel storage could contribute to a temporal mismatch between on farm mitigation strategies for erosion control and positive landscape scale environmental outcomes in addition to farmed arable or grass land it would be useful to examine the water stable aggregates mobilised from different catchment sediment sources including damaged road verges and eroding channel banks and to apportion the relative inputs from all sources 3 6 implications for modelling physically based models require robust quantification of transport parameters such as the critical shear stress for deposition and erosion as well as empirical coefficients that are needed to define the relationships among sediment size density and settling velocities at the present state of knowledge these transport parameters and the empirical coefficients for cohesive sediments can only be obtained by direct measurements in the laboratory using site specific sediment in specialized rotating annular flumes the present study provides new knowledge of transport parameters critical shear stress for erosion and deposition and the effects of shear stress consolidation and flocculation on upper river taw sediment which is necessary to calibrate and validate fine sediment transport models such as rivfloc or shetran these models can be used to simulate the effects of flow and sediment inputs on the transport and fate of fine sediment and to evaluate the sediment control options and mitigation strategies for catchment management 4 conclusions the transport characteristics of fine sediment in the upper river taw were studied in a rotating annular flume transport parameters for cohesive sediments critical shear stress for deposition and erosion and parameters governing the density and settling velocity of the sediment flocs as a function of floc size were established deposition experiments showed that the amount of sediment deposited is a function of the bed shear stress and the initial concentration of sediment in suspension data from deposition experiments were analyzed using a fine sediment transport model for the rotating annular flume flume model and the transport parameters that gave the best agreement between the model predictions and measurements were established the results show that density and settling velocity of the cohesive sediments are sensitive to changes in floc structure as a function of shear stress and consolidation period erosion experiments were conducted for three different consolidation periods and the data show that the amount of sediment eroded was a function of bed shear stress and consolidation period the influence of the consolidation period was significant only when the bed shear stresses were low below 0 21 n m2 and for higher bed shear stresses the consolidation period played a minor role the retention of cohesive riverbed sediment in the upper river taw will continue to degrade spawning habitat quality govern the transfer and fate of sediment associated nutrients and contaminants and potentially create a temporal mismatch between sediment control strategies and improved environmental outcomes declaration of competing interest

4544,fine sediment is a key driver of water quality degradation in rivers globally and improved knowledge of its source and transport is required to assess the efficacy of sediment control options and pollution abatement strategies here the transport characteristics deposition erosion and flocculation of fine sediment were studied experimentally in an annular flume to provide parameters necessary to model fine sediment transport in the upper river taw in southwest england deposition experiments were carried out using a sediment water mixture in the flume and in situ size distributions of sediment flocs were measured to assess flocculation and settling behavior of sediment the influence of bed shear stress and bed consolidation were investigated in a series of erosion experiments these data were used to calibrate and test a mathematical model of fine sediment transport in annular flumes flume model and the measured and modelled data were in good agreement transport parameters for cohesive sediments such as the critical shear stresses for deposition and erosion as well as the particle density porosity and settling velocity as a function of floc size were established the density and settling velocity of the cohesive sediments were sensitive to the biological activity within the floc structure data from the flume experiments are necessary as input parameters to models such as rivfloc or shetran that simulate fine sediment transport in the river taw at the catchment scale and assess the efficacy of sediment control options and catchment management scenarios keywords

within budgets can influence the timeliness of response to catchment best management summer et al 1996 in essence those systems with higher sediment delivery ratios can be expected to be more sensitive and responsive to best management interventions walling 1999 whereas those systems with more retentive pollutant delivery cascades are likely to take years to decades to respond to land management meals et al 2010 sharpley et al 2013 bieroza et al 2019 here a number of points are noteworthy channel sediment stores in catchments can be divided into longer term overbank floodplain deposits and shorter term repositories of riverbed sediment the magnitudes of both storage terms as proportions of catchment fine grained sediment budgets have been reported in the international literature e g walling et al 1999 2001 2006 walling and collins 2008 but the significance of the character of riverbed sediment has rarely been considered in the context of landscape management and response to targeted sediment mitigation in wanting to take explicit account of any temporal mismatch between sediment control policies and landscape response driven by the erosion deposition and potential remobilisation of fine grained sediment in catchments it is necessary to study and understand cohesive sediments since these represent the natural in situ characteristics of the material moving through the landscape delivery cascade research on cohesive sediment transport has shown that materials can interact with gravel beds and result in the entrapment of fine sediments in the channel system glasbergen et al 2014 harper et al 2017 cohesive sediments are comprised predominantly of clay and silt size fractions winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 grabowski et al 2011 due to inter particle physical chemical forces of attraction and repulsion cohesive sediments exhibit a tendency to flocculate in the water column which can strongly influence transport properties such as porosity density and settling velocity of particles partheniades 1962 krone 1962 lick 1982 accordingly the effective size and density of cohesive sediments change as a function of the flow field lau and krishnappan 1997 and the degree of flocculation which is dependent upon several factors including the surface chemistry of particles physico chemical properties of the water column biological factors such as bacteria and the hydrodynamic nature of flowing water droppo et al 2001 flocculation of cohesive materials in the water column and subsequent settling of flocs on the riverbed result in the formation of surficial fine grained laminae sfgl droppo and stone 1994 which represents a significant potential sink for contaminants bound to cohesive sediments stone and droppo 1994 numerical models have been developed to predict the transport and fate of sediment and associated contaminants but they require information on the transport characteristics of sediment as input parameters wiilis and krishnappan 2011 krishnappan 1991 1997 ewen et al 2000 transport variables for cohesive sediments such as erosion rate as well as the critical shear stress for erosion and deposition must be determined by direct measurement lukey et al 1995 rotating annular flumes have been widely used for this purpose whereby circulating flow is triggered in the annulus through the rotation of an annular ring with the infinite flow length resulting in a fully developed boundary layer andersen 2001 stone and krishnappan 2003 this experimental setup is ideal for studying cohesive sediment dynamics as flocculated sediments are undisturbed by re circulation this approach can be used to determine the effects of flow field on erosion and deposition of cohesive sediments collected from different geographical locations and aquatic systems graham et al 1992 widdows et al 1998 pope et al 2006 to improve knowledge of flocculation manning et al 2007 to evaluate the effects of gravel on fine sediment dynamics glasbergen et al 2014 and to study the roles of consolidation and bio stabilization for sediment erodibility stone et al 2011 critically data derived from flume experiments have enabled the development of models such as rivfloc krishnappan 1991 1997 that can be used to simulate fine sediment transport at multiple scales in storm water management ponds krishnappan and marsalek 2002 harbours skafel and krishnappan 1999 and large river systems in canada milburn and krishnappan 2003 droppo and krishnappan 2016 even where in channel sediment transport and deposition are represented explicitly within catchment modelling frameworks the need for empirical calibration of relevant parameters remains important to ensure acceptable model performance on a catchment specific basis one such example is shetran ewen et al 2000 birkinshaw et al 2010 however it should be noted that the in channel sediment transport component of this model lukey et al 1995 estimates the deposition of suspended sediment using the finite element equation derived by ariathurai and krone 1976 but this is dependent on empirical calibration there remains a general lack of knowledge regarding the transport and fate of cohesive sediments in many fluvial systems including those rivers in the uk that originate from moors and a concomitant lack of consideration of the implications for both landscape management and modelling process based models require knowledge of transport parameters such as the critical shear stress for deposition and erosion as well as empirical coefficients that are needed to define the relationships among sediment size density and settling velocities ewen et al 2000 at the present state of knowledge these transport parameters and the empirical coefficients for cohesive sediments can only be obtained by direct measurements in the laboratory using site specific sediment in specialized rotating annular flumes lukey et al 1995 accordingly the objectives of this study were to 1 rigorously quantify the deposition and erosion characteristics of fine sediment from the upper river taw river observatory in southwest uk in a rotating annular flume 2 evaluate the relationship among sediment size density and settling velocity and erosion and deposition rates using a fine sediment transport model for the annular flume flume model and 3 to discuss the implications for sediment management and modelling such information can then be used in within channel sediment transport models such as rivfloc krishnappan 1991 or slope to channel models like shetran birkinshaw et al 2010 that utilize a finite sediment transport component 2 methods 2 1 2 1study area the river taw catchment is located in devon south west england and drains a total area of 914 km2 fig 1 the headwaters are located on the dartmoor granite plateau ca 550 m a s l and the river then flows over predominantly carboniferous interbedded sandstones and shales before draining into bideford bay in the bristol channel average annual rainfall for the period 1992 to 2014 ranges from a high of 1601 mm at dartmoor 50 703 n 3 976 w to 940 mm at the river mouth 51 089 n 4 147 w uk national meteorological archive most of the precipitation falls in the winter and the climate is typical of temperate regions in southwestern uk 5 20 c this study was conducted along a 19 km reach that drains an area of 41 3 km2 in the river taw catchment fig 1 general topographical and hydrological characteristics are summarised in table 1 land use is predominantly improved agricultural land mainly grassland supporting beef dairy and sheep production with a limited amount of cultivated land spring and winter wheat and barley maize winter oil seed rape and deciduous woodland soils of the lowland portion of the study catchment are typically poorly draining clay rich gley soils and brown earths while the soils on the dartmoor upland at the source consist of peat and podzols river hydrology is primarily surface water driven and river discharge q is flashy in response to rainfall events base flow in the study reach is maintained during extended dry periods by water stored within the peat soils on dartmoor and rock fissures of the carboniferous country rock gafni and brooks 1986 show that peatland drainage during large runoff events can lead to increased erosion and that suspended solids from these sources can cause siltation and nutrient enrichment of downstream watercourses kl√∏ve 1997 eroded peat deposits can have cohesive properties that cause particles to flocculate and that once deposited biostabilization can influence the critical shear stress for erosion of these materials marttila and kl√∏ve 2008 sediment erosion from agricultural land in the upper river taw is a key pressure on fish habitat as noted in conjunction with the eu water framework directive wfd european union 2000 2 2 sampling of channel bed cohesive sediments a hydrometric survey consisting of 18 river cross sections located 0 5 km apart was conducted during summer low flows in 2018 fig 1 the bank full width of the river along the study reach is 10 m and the bank full depth is 1 m the riverbed is armoured with large stones including pebbles cobbles and bedrock outcrops a profile of the riverbed was constructed from cross section survey data and the average slope of the riverbed is 0 0105 fig 2 although the bed material in the study river reach is very coarse fine grained material is present in the river channel bed because of the entrapment process which retains fine material in the lee of large rocks or directly in the gravel bed matrix as interstitial material fine sediment deposits are also present in recirculation eddy zones and along the edges of the river channel where the shear stresses of the flow field are low samples of cohesive channel bed sediment were collected using a remobilisation technique lambert and walling 1988 collins and walling 2007 quinn et al 2009 clapcott et al 2011 naden et al 2016 this method provides robust and precise estimates of the quality and quantity of fine sediment stored on and within river channel beds duerdoth et al 2015 during sample collection a plastic stilling well height 0 4 m surface area 0 125 m2 was inserted carefully into the riverbed gravel matrix to minimise the loss of resuspended sediment by winnowing the river water and upper 5 10 cm of the channel bed enclosed in the stilling well were stirred and agitated agitation of both the water column and riverbed provided a basis for sampling fine sediment stored both as a surface drape and within the interstices of the gravel matrix each bed sediment sample comprised a composite of 3 5 sub samples retrieved from different points in the channel at each cross section location fig 1 the river water and substrate were consistently agitated for 60 s prior to sampling of the resuspended bed sediment within the stilling well approximately 20 l of sediment river water mixture was collected at each sample location and stored at 4 c prior to sample processing once the sediment had settled they were dewatered by first decanting the majority of the water into a second barrel via a 2 mm sieve to remove any large organic debris this largely sediment free water was cycled for 1 h through an alfa laval ifb403x 73 mobile centrifuge to remove any residual fine sediment sediment collected on the centrifuge lamellae was washed off and collected and added to that collected in the liquid return vessel the bulk of the sediment remaining in the initial sample barrel was then also passed through a 2 mm sieve the barrel was washed clean with minimal water and this was used to wash through material retained on the sieve mesh all residual sediment water was allowed to settle and dewatered further by decanting the upper part of the water column 2 3 l and centrifuging using a sorvall rc5b plus centrifuge with a sla 3000 rotor at 11 000 rpm for 15 mins supernatant water was then discarded from the centrifuge vessels the residual sediment was then washed out of the centrifuge vessels and returned to the bulk of the remaining sediment creating a sediment water mix of 1l for each sampling site these samples were stored at 4 c before being shipped from the uk to canada where they were stored in a laboratory cold room a composite sediment sample was prepared for the flume experiment by mixing sediment from all 18 sampling sites in a pail and wet sieved using a 200 mesh sieve 2 3 description of the rotating annular flume the rotating annular flume assembly used in this study is located at the national water research institute at burlington ontario canada the annular flume is 5 0 m in mean diameter 0 30 m wide and 0 30 m deep and it rests on a rotating platform which is 7 0 m in diameter a counter rotating lid fits inside the flume with close tolerance 1 5 mm gap on either side experimental krishnappan 1993 and theoretical petersen and krishnappan 1994 studies carried out in this flume assembly show that the flow field generated is nearly two dimensional with nearly constant bed shear stress across the width of the flume a computational fluid dynamics model called phoenics was used to predict the bed shear stress distributions across the width of the flume for a given rotational speed of the flume taking into account the roughness characteristics of the flow boundaries krishnappan and engel 2004 phoenics also provided the turbulence characteristics such as the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and the turbulent eddy viscosity that are needed for the flume model the particle size distributions and images of suspended solids during erosion experiments were measured using image analysis suspended solids were collected from the flume sampling port and 5 ml aliquots of the sample were transferred into each of three 50 ml plastic columns and then filtered under low vacuum 13 3 kpa to prevent floc breakage flocs settled on 0 45 mm millipore ha filters were placed in petri dishes and air dried at room temperature for 48 h particles on filters were evaluated using image analysis to a lower resolution of 2 mm with a zeiss axiovert 100 microscope fitted with a sony xc75 ccd camera connected to a computer running northern eclipse image analysis software de boer and stone 1999 2 4 deposition tests in the deposition experiments the flume was filled to a depth of 12 cm with tap water and a known mass of fine channel bed sediment sampled from the upper river taw was added to achieve a fully mixed initial sediment concentration of about 300 mg l 1 the sediment water suspension was then thoroughly mixed in the flume first by mechanical mixing and then by rotating the flume and the lid at relatively high speeds 2 5 rpm for the lid and 2 0 rpm for the flume yielding a bed shear stress of 0 6 pa after operating the flume at this high speed for about twenty minutes the speeds were lowered to achieve a bed shear stress of 0 12 pa and the flume was operated at this shear stress level for five hours water sediment samples were extracted from the flume through a sampling port located at the mid depth at five minute intervals during the first hour of the test and every ten minutes thereafter until the completion of the test each time a sample was withdrawn the volume removed was replaced by adding an equivalent amount of sediment water mixture back into the flume in order to keep the water surface in contact with the lid all the time a test was completed after the suspended sediment concentration remained quasi constant for 1 h the entire process took five hours to complete water sediment samples were analysed for concentrations of solids by a gravimetric method environment canada 1988 which consisted of filtering each sample and drying and weighing the residue the size distribution of the sediment in suspension was measured when the flume was operated at high speed and at the end of the test by collecting samples and undertaking measurements using a lisst laser in situ scattering and transmissometry 100x sequioa scientific particle size analyser upon completion of a test the entire procedure was repeated for another initial concentration of 600 mg l 1 the bed shear stress was maintained at the same level after the completion of this test three other deposition tests were conducted for bed shear stresses of 0 06 pa 0 21 pa and 0 33 pa keeping the initial concentration at 600 mg l 1 five deposition tests were conducted in total the hydraulic conditions for all five deposition tests are summarized in table 2 2 5 erosion tests erosion characteristics of fine sediment deposits resulting from the settling of the sediment used in the deposition experiments were examined using erosion tests in these tests the sediment water mixture in the flume was left undisturbed for a period to allow the sediment to settle and consolidate on the flume bed three different consolidation times were used 22 h 38 h and 160 h in each erosion test care was taken to ensure that the depth of water in the flume was maintained at 12 cm so that the lid was in contact with the water surface the flume and the lid were then set in motion and their speeds were increased in steps at each step sediment samples were collected to measure the concentration of the eroded sediment as a function of time when the sediment concentration reached a steady state value the flume speed was increased to the next level whenever there was sufficient sediment suspended in the water column sediment samples were collected for size analysis using the lisst this procedure was repeated until the maximum permissible flume speed was reached a summary of the erosion test parameters is provided in table 3 2 6 determination of transport parameters for the upper river taw cohesive sediment transport parameters for the upper river taw cohesive sediment were determined using the fine sediment transport model flume complete details of the flume model can be found in krishnappan and marsalek 2002 but a brief outline of the model is provided here flume treats the motion of sediment in two stages a transport or a settling stage and a flocculation stage the governing equation for the settling stage was obtained from mass balance considerations and assuming that the flow in the rotating flume is uniform in the longitudinal and tangential directions the one dimensional mass balance equation shown below was adopted 1 c k t w k c k z z Œ≥ c k z s where c k is the concentration of sediment in size fraction k w k is the settling velocity of that fraction and Œ≥ is the dispersion coefficient in the vertical direction the symbol t represents the time axis and the symbol z represents the coordinate axis in the vertical direction s is the source sink term the boundary conditions used for the settling stage are as follows at the free surface 2 w k c k Œ≥ c k z 0 at the bed 3 w k c k Œ≥ c k z q e q d q entrap the free surface boundary condition expresses the balance between the settling flux and the dispersive flux so that there is no external input of sediment at this boundary at the bed surface it is assumed that the settling and dispersive fluxes are balanced by the net amount of sediment exchanged at the sediment water interface the sediment exchange at this interface can occur in three ways i sediment can be eroded from the bed because of the shear stress induced by the flow and entrainment into the water column q e ii sediment can settle to the bed and stays at the bed as the deposited sediment q d and iii sediment can settle to the bed and a portion of the settled sediment can ingress into the interstitial pores of the bed sediment and become unavailable for further erosion and entrainment q entrap the first two components of the sediment exchange at the sediment water interface have been studied extensively in the literature several formulations exist to quantify these components for example the erosion rate of fine sediment has been studied by partheniades 1962 mehta and partheniades 1975 parchure 1980 lick 1982 and krone 1999 deposition characteristics of fine sediment have been studied among others by krone 1962 mehta and partheniades 1975 and lick 1982 in this study the approach proposed by krone 1999 for erosion and krone 1962 for deposition have been adopted accordingly the erosion flux was calculated as 4 q e e where e is the erosion rate function evaluated by krishnappan et al 2020 using krone s 1999 approach the deposition flux was calculated as 5 q d p w k c kb where p is a probability parameter which gives a measure of the probability that a floc settling to the riverbed stays at the bed krone 1962 proposed a relationship for p as 6 p 1 œÑ œÑ crd where œÑ is the bed shear stress and œÑ crd is the critical shear stress for deposition which is defined as the bed shear stress above which none of the initially suspended sediment would deposit krones definition the third entrapment component is assumed to be directly proportional to the settling flux near the riverbed and is expressed as 7 q entrap Œ± w k c kb where Œ± is the proportionality constant and is termed the entrapment coefficient this coefficient is expected to be a function of porosity of the gravel substrate thickness of the gravel bed layer and the permeability of the substrate this term has to be determined from experiments using the rotating annular flume the flocculation stage was modelled based on the coagulation equation fuchs 1964 shown below 8 n i j t Œ≤ n i t i 1 k i j n j t 1 2 Œ≤ i 1 k i j j n i j j n j t where n i t and n j t are number concentrations of particle size classes i and j respectively k i j is the collision frequency function which is a measure of the probability that a particle of size i collides with a particle of size j in unit time and Œ≤ is the cohesion factor which defines the probability that a pair of collided particles will coalesce and form a new floc the term Œ≤ accounts for the effects of cohesion properties such as the electrochemical properties of the sediment water mixture and the effects of polymers secreted by micro organisms in this study Œ≤ is treated as an empirical parameter and was determined through the calibration of the model using the annular flume data the first term on the right side of eq 8 gives the reduction of particles in size class i because of flocculation of these particles in size class i with all other size classes the second term gives the generation of new particles in the size class i because of flocculation of particles in smaller size classes in this process the mass of particles is assumed to be conserved equation 8 was simplified by considering the particle sizes in discrete size classes where the continuous particle size space is considered in discrete size ranges each range is considered as a bin containing particles of certain size range for example r 1 is the geometric mean radius of particles in bin 1 the particle ranges were selected in such a way that the mean volume of particles in bin i is twice that of the preceding bin under this scheme when particles of bin i flocculate with particles in bin j j i the newly formed particles will fit into bins i and i 1 the proportion of particles going to these bins can be calculated by considering the mass balance of particles before and after flocculation with this simplification the coagulation equation can be expressed in discrete form as follows 9 Œ¥ n i Œ¥ t Œ≤ k r i r j n i n j f i j Œ≤ k r i r j n i n j 1 f i j Œ≤ k r i r j n i 1 n j where f i j is the allocation function given by 10 f i j œÅ s j v i œÅ s j v j œÅ s j 1 v i 1 œÅ s i v i œÅ s j 1 v i 1 where œÅ s denotes the density of the flocs and v is the volume of the flocs the density of the flocs is dependent on their size and an empirical relationship proposed by lau and krishnappan 1997 was adopted in this study the form of the relationship is 11 œÅ s œÅ œÅ p œÅ e x p b d c where œÅ s œÅ and œÅ p are densities of flocs water and parent material forming the flocs respectively d is the diameter of the floc and b and c are empirical coefficients to be determined through model calibration the settling velocity of flocs needed for the settling stage of the particle motion was calculated using the above density relation and stoke s law the resulting expression is as follows 12 w k 1 65 18 g d k 2 œÖ e x p b d c where g stands for acceleration due to gravity and œÖ stands for the kinematic viscosity of water the collision frequency function k i j takes different functional forms depending on the collision mechanisms that bring the particles to close proximity the mechanisms considered in this study include i brownian motion kb ii turbulent fluid shear ksh iii inertia of particles in turbulent flow ki and 4 differential settling of flocs kds an effective collision frequency function kef as calculated in terms of the individual collision functions as follows 13 k ef k b k sh 2 k i 2 k ds 2 the collision frequency functions for the individual collision mechanisms are found in valioulis and list 1984 the break up of flocs due to turbulent fluctuations of the flow was modelled using a scheme proposed by tambo and watanabe 1979 according to this scheme a collision agglomeration function was introduced as a multiplier to the collision frequency function kef this produced an effective collision frequency that resulted in an optimum floc size distribution for a given level of turbulence the function proposed by tambo and watanabe 1979 is as follows 14 Œ± r Œ± 0 1 r r m n where r is the number of primary particles contained in a floc and rm is the number of particles contained in the biggest floc for the given level of turbulence the parameters Œ± 0 and n assume values of 1 3 and 6 respectively application of the flume model to simulate the deposition and erosion tests in the annular flume is discussed under the following results and discussion section 3 results and discussion 3 1 deposition tests the results from the deposition experiments showed that sediment concentration decreases as a function of time and reached a steady state value for all the tests fig 3 the steady state concentration is a function of both initial concentration and bed shear stresses the influence of initial concentration on the deposition process from tests 1 and 2 show that the steady state concentration depends on the initial concentration when the bed shear stress is held constant fig 4 this result is in agreement with partheniades et al 1968 who hypothesized that the dependence of steady state concentration on initial concentration is due to the peculiar settling behaviour of flocculated material cohesive sediments because only stronger flocs that can withstand the higher shear stresses near the riverbed can deposit weaker flocs are however likely to break up by the high shear stresses near the riverbed and are brought back into suspension again the number of stronger flocs that could form in a given sediment mixture is a function of the total amount of sediment suspended in the water column the amount of sediment deposited is therefore a function of the initial amount of cohesive sediment in the water column partheniades et al 1968 observed that when the suspended sediment was normalized using the initial concentration the two curves collapse into one suggesting that when the amount of sediment deposited is expressed as the fraction of the amount of sediment initially in the water column it becomes independent of the initial amount concentration and instead is a function of bed shear stress only in the present study normalized concentration plots for deposition tests 1 and 2 show that the two curves indeed collapse into one and are nearly equal fig 5 during deposition tests 2 to 5 where the initial concentration was held constant at 600 mg l 1 the steady state concentration is a function of bed shear stress fig 3 for the lowest bed shear stress tested 0 06 n m2 the steady state concentration was about 40 mg l 1 6 7 of the initial concentration whereas for the highest shear stress 0 33 n m2 tested the steady state concentration was about 530 mg l 1 88 of the initial concentration if the bed shear stresses tested were somewhat 0 06 n m2 then all initially suspended sediment would have deposited similarly if the bed shear stress is slightly higher than 0 33 n m2 then none of the initially suspended sediment would deposit there have been two proposed definitions of critical shear stress for deposition of fine sediment in the first partheniades 1968 defined the critical shear stress for deposition as the bed shear stress below which all of the initially suspended sediment would deposit alternatively krone 1962 proposed the critical shear stress for deposition as the bed shear stress above which none of the initially suspended sediment will deposit using the results of our deposition experiments critical shear stress for deposition for the two definitions were estimated the value of critical shear stress for deposition according to partheniades definition is 0 05 n m2 whereas the corresponding value according to krone s definition was 0 40 n m2 3 2 application of the flume model to simulate the deposition experiments in the flume the flume model was applied to the rotating flume for the conditions in which the deposition experiments were carried out the flow field generated in the flume was predicted using the phoenics model and the bed shear stress œÑ needed for the flume model see eq 6 was evaluated from the phoenics model results phoenics also provided the turbulence characteristics such as turbulent diffusivity to calculate the dispersion coefficient Œ≥ and the turbulence dissipation rate that is needed for evaluating the collision frequency functions sediment size classes needed for the model were obtained from the measured size distribution data during the high speed operation of the flume using the lisst 100x the parameters appearing in the model such as the coefficients b and c which appear in the relationship between the floc density and floc sizes i e eq 11 the cohesion parameter Œ≤ which appears in the coagulation equation i e equation 8 and the critical shear stress for deposition crd i e equation 6 were adjusted until the predicted concentration variations compared reasonably well with the measured data a comparison between measured and predicted concentration for deposition test 1 and 2 are presented in fig 6 and show good agreement between the measured values and the model prediction for most of the elapsed time at the beginning of the experiment when the flume speed was lowered from high speed operation to the experimental condition the agreement between measured and modelled predictions was poor during this period it is likely that the concentration field is highly three dimensional and the measured data might not have captured the true variation the parameters used in the predictions for test 1 and 2 are b 0 025 c 1 35 and Œ≤ 0 13 knowing the values of b and c the relationships for density and settling velocity as a function of floc size i e eqs 11 and 12 can be quantified and hence the density and settling velocity of the upper river taw sediment can be evaluated as shown in fig 7 this figure shows that flocs around 20 to 30 ¬µm have the highest settling velocity and that these fractions are likely to participate in the settling process flocs in the size ranges of 0 to 5 ¬µm and 50 to 400 ¬µm are likely to be transported mainly in suspension through the upper river taw main river channel the comparison between measured concentration and the predicted values using the flume model for tests 3 4 ad 5 fig 8 shows that the agreement is fairly good for most of the elapsed time similar to what was observed for tests 1 and 2 the transport parameters that were employed for these three tests are as follows b 0 02 c 1 15 and Œ≤ 0 25 note that these values are different from those used for tests 1 and 2 with these new values the density and settling velocity relationships i e eqs 11 and 12 yield different values for density and settling velocity as shown in fig 9 in this figure settling velocities are much higher than values corresponding to the flocs in tests 1 and 2 and a broader size range of sediment flocs are likely to participate in the settling process the maximum settling velocity is close to 0 35 mm sec compared to 0 085 mm sec for tests 1 and 2 and flocs in the size range of 20 to 120 ¬µm have a settling velocity 0 1 mm sec the reason for the observed change in density and settling velocity of the flocs for tests 3 4 and 5 compared with tests 1and 2 may be biological activity that might have been activated when the sediment was placed in the flume and subjected to room temperature prior to the commencement of the experiments on nov 13 2018 test 1 was carried out on this day see table 1 the sediment was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c when the sediment is in the flume and is subjected to the room temperature it is possible that bacteria could have altered the floc structure of the sediment in addition to making the flocs stronger and hence characterized by a higher settling velocity the flocs are more efficient in floc formation as has been indicated by the change in the Œ≤ value from 0 13 for tests 1 and 2 to 0 25 for tests 3 4 and 5 when Œ≤ values are high the efficiency of flocculation is high i e higher numbers of collisions will result in the formation of flocs 3 3 erosion tests erosion tests were conducted for three different consolidation periods table 2 and the corresponding concentration profiles as a function of shear stress are presented in fig 10 the erosion data indicate that the sediment deposit was completely stable until the shear stress reached a value of 0 09 n m2 which can be considered as the critical shear stress for erosion of the surficial riverbed sediment layer notably the critical shear stress for erosion is larger than the critical shear stress for deposition i e 0 05 n m2 partheniades definition which is a distinguishing characteristic of cohesive sediment for coarse grained cohesionless sediment the two critical shear stresses are equal the difference in critical shear stresses has implications for modelling the transport behaviour of cohesive sediments for shear stress step values exceeding the critical shear stress for erosion the sediment bed started to erode and the concentration of sediment in suspension increased at each shear stress step the eroded sediment concentration increased suddenly after the shear stress change suggesting that the sediment erosion follows the pattern of bulk erosion as the sediment erosion continues the erosion rate decreases due to the increasing strength of the bed with bed depth erosion during the later stages of the shear stress step is defined as the surface erosion when the removal of the material from the bed is particle by particle and the sediment concentration in the water column approaches a steady state value fig 10 such a behaviour is also a characteristic of cohesive sediments as previously reported lick 1982 partheniades 1984 parchure and mehta 1985 an increased shear strength in the bed interior due to sediment consolidation by its own weight reduced water content and possibly by biological processes maa et al 1998 thomsen and gust 2000 bale et al 2006 2007 droppo et al 2009 amos et al 2010 is offered as an explanation for attaining the steady state concentration during erosion therefore increasing shear stresses are needed to erode deposited material from the interior of the cohesive sediment deposits the influence of the consolidation period on the amount sediment eroded for the lower shear stresses i e for shear stresses up to 0 21 n m2 is shown in fig 10 3 4 application of the flume model to simulate the erosion experiments in the flume the flume model was applied to the erosion tests and the concentration of eroded sediment was simulated for all the tests the erosion rate function e needed for the model was calculated using the approach of krone 1999 and reported by krishnappan et al 2020 as 15 e h 1 c 1 c 0 c 1 t 1 2 where h c 1 is the erosion rate at the start of the shear stress step and 1 c 0 is the concentration of the eroded sediment at the end of the shear stress step using eq 15 the flume model was run for all the shear stress steps and for all three consolidation periods while running the model the deposition and entrapment processes were suppressed and only the erosion process was modelled figure 11 shows the comparison between model predictions and measured data and as can be seen from this figure the agreement between the two is favourable the coefficients c 0 and c 1 used in the model varied depending on the shear stress and the consolidation times these values for all shear stress steps and consolidation times are summarized in table 4 and their variations are plotted as shown in figure 12 from figure 12 it can be seen that the coefficients exhibit a complex behaviour with respect to the bed shear stress both coefficients decrease initially as the shear stress increases reach minimum values and then increase as the shear stress is further increased the minimum conditions for the coefficients imply maximum erosion rate and maximum amount of sediment eroded implying bulk erosion the minimum coefficients shifts to the right as the consolidation period increases see figure 12 indeed when the consolidation period is 22 hrs minimum conditions for both coefficients are around 0 15 pa whereas for the consolidation period of 160 hrs the minimum conditions are shifted to 0 21 pa for c 0 and 0 25 pa for c 1 this suggests that consolidation has played a role in strengthening the river bed and hence under these conditions higher shear stresses are needed to cause bulk erosion changes in floc number size and shape during erosion experiments as a function of shear stress and consolidation period are presented in figure 13 and particle size characteristics of these samples are listed in table 5 biostabilization has been recognized as an important factor affecting the erodibility of fine sediment and previous studies show that increasing consolidation time and related development of phytomicrobenthos on the sediment bed cause the critical shear stress for erosion œÑcrit to increase with increasing consolidation period stone et al 2011 in the present study erosion data show that longer consolidation times reduce the amount of sediment initially eroded for a given shear stress and œÑcrit for upper river taw sediment was similar for all three erosion experiments these results highlight the need to take into account the benthic and microbial communities for various sediment types when applying the results of other studies to parameterize fine sediment transport models with regard to the effects of consolidation on the size number and shape of flocs in suspension there was an increase in floc size at t 240 min 2c but floc size decreased at maximum shear t 420 suggesting that the larger flocs formed previously in the flume at lower shear break up at conditions of higher shear while this observation is expected and consistent with previous studies stone et al 2008 the number of flocs decreased with increasing shear stress during the erosion experiment with the longest consolidation period figure 12 3a d and surprisingly the median diameter d50 in image 3d increased suggesting that flocs produced under these conditions are more stable than for shorter consolidation periods figure 12 1d and 2d 3 5 implications for management the fact that agricultural soils and additional sediment sources in the study landscape will be releasing water stable aggregates which evolve during the sediment delivery cascade from slopes or channel margins to and through the river channel has important implications for the hydraulic behaviour of fluvial fine grained sediment ongley et al 1981 droppo et al 2005 recent monitoring and observational work on cohesive heavy seasonally waterlogged soils in the study area has identified raindrop impacted saturation excess overland flow as an important mechanism for sediment mobilisation and delivery from agricultural land to the channel system pulley and collins 2019 rain splash has been reported to detach both aggregates and primary particles young 1980 deploey 1981 meyer et al 1992 slattery and burt 1993 however with increasing runoff depth direct raindrop impact will be replaced by other mechanisms of aggregate detachment and disintegration including slaking differential swelling and physico chemical dispersion le bissonnais 1996 soil aggregate stability in essential for helping to control erosion six and paustian 2014 and is closely linked to soil structure and critical functions including water holding capacity whilst this study has not explicitly examined and compared water stable aggregates in runoff from landscape sediment sources and cohesive riverbed sediment the flume experiments using the latter clearly suggest that aggregate disintegration with factors including ploughing and tillage chrenkov√° et al 2014 of arable land or during grassland scheduled re seeds is likely to deliver finer cohesive sediment with a greater propensity for settling on the riverbed the experimental work suggested that biostabilisation is likely to increase the critical shear necessary for remobilisation of riverbed sediment and here it is important to acknowledge that the upper river taw catchment is currently failing the eu water framework directive due to excess phosphate loss which is likely to help promote biostabilisation in the channel system through impacts on lower trophic levels in turn such in channel storage could contribute to a temporal mismatch between on farm mitigation strategies for erosion control and positive landscape scale environmental outcomes in addition to farmed arable or grass land it would be useful to examine the water stable aggregates mobilised from different catchment sediment sources including damaged road verges and eroding channel banks and to apportion the relative inputs from all sources 3 6 implications for modelling physically based models require robust quantification of transport parameters such as the critical shear stress for deposition and erosion as well as empirical coefficients that are needed to define the relationships among sediment size density and settling velocities at the present state of knowledge these transport parameters and the empirical coefficients for cohesive sediments can only be obtained by direct measurements in the laboratory using site specific sediment in specialized rotating annular flumes the present study provides new knowledge of transport parameters critical shear stress for erosion and deposition and the effects of shear stress consolidation and flocculation on upper river taw sediment which is necessary to calibrate and validate fine sediment transport models such as rivfloc or shetran these models can be used to simulate the effects of flow and sediment inputs on the transport and fate of fine sediment and to evaluate the sediment control options and mitigation strategies for catchment management 4 conclusions the transport characteristics of fine sediment in the upper river taw were studied in a rotating annular flume transport parameters for cohesive sediments critical shear stress for deposition and erosion and parameters governing the density and settling velocity of the sediment flocs as a function of floc size were established deposition experiments showed that the amount of sediment deposited is a function of the bed shear stress and the initial concentration of sediment in suspension data from deposition experiments were analyzed using a fine sediment transport model for the rotating annular flume flume model and the transport parameters that gave the best agreement between the model predictions and measurements were established the results show that density and settling velocity of the cohesive sediments are sensitive to changes in floc structure as a function of shear stress and consolidation period erosion experiments were conducted for three different consolidation periods and the data show that the amount of sediment eroded was a function of bed shear stress and consolidation period the influence of the consolidation period was significant only when the bed shear stresses were low below 0 21 n m2 and for higher bed shear stresses the consolidation period played a minor role the retention of cohesive riverbed sediment in the upper river taw will continue to degrade spawning habitat quality govern the transfer and fate of sediment associated nutrients and contaminants and potentially create a temporal mismatch between sediment control strategies and improved environmental outcomes declaration of competing interest
