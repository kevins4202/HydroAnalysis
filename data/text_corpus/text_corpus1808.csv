9040,the use of greywater for agricultural purposes can contribute to water conservation the resilience of family farming food systems and food security especially in regions with higher water deficits however the social acceptance of this practice has been poorly evaluated systematically and hinders the implementation due to the resulting uncertainty among decision makers and other stakeholders in the management of alternative sources of water in agriculture this study was designed in the concept of the attitude and the perceived behavioral control to investigate the acceptance and perception of risks and benefits of the use of greywater as an alternative water resource in agriculture and the personal environmental values and beliefs new ecological paradigm scale by 300 professionals of agricultural technicians from 12 meso regions in minas gerais state brazil in general the technicians showed a positive attitude toward reusing greywater in agriculture the willingness to consume food grown with greywater was the least positive aspect 59 3 compared to the willingness to perform the practice 87 7 and the belief in reusing greywater as an alternative water resource 81 7 the result indicates a great potential for using greywater as an alternative water resource for irrigating non food crops the environmental position of the studied public was not a decisive guarantee for a final attitude towards the use of greywater in agriculture the study identified a clear relationship between a positive acceptance to support the development of public policies for water reuse 81 7 and the interviewee s local contexts of water scarcity lack of sanitation and socioeconomic conditions this study contributes to the discussions about water reuse in agriculture and developing public wastewater reuse policies keywords water scarcity greywater reuse food systems resilience public policies new ecological paradigm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increasing episodes of water scarcity worldwide are of concern and for at least one month a year 4 billion people are affected mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 factors as climate change and the unsafe disposal of wastewater contribute to the scarcity of quality water who 2009 directly affecting the water supply for human consumption industry and agricultural irrigation in many regions coelho et al 2016 the scenario of exacerbation of water resources favors the creation of more sustainable water management programs to address the challenges faced in scarcity esrey 2002 especially those for alternative water sources in irrigated agriculture responsible for the 70 of the water use in the world fao 2017 and 60 in brazil in the 2017 year the world bank 2022 the use of treated wastewater for agricultural purposes is part of the debates of decision makers in brazil brasil 2010 which has faced successive water scarcity crises in the last years targa and batista 2015 there is a gradual increase of governmental guidelines for this practice as verified in the states of são paulo ceará and minas gerais são paulo 2017 ceará 2016 minas gerais 2020 the non potable reuse of greywater wastewater from showers laundries and kitchens is also presented globally as an alternative to local drinkable water conservation for more essential proposes radingoana et al 2020 maimon and gross 2018 greywater differs from the backwater which is from bathrooms and toilets and can contains faecal matter and urine for the agricultural purposes the greywater reuse can also contribute to increasing the crop production and resilience of family farming food systems especially in higher water deficit regions the domestic use of greywater in agriculture is disseminated in brazil in projects well accepted by family farmers in the semi arid region where they historically coexist with drought santiago et al 2015 these initiatives are in accordance to the 2030 agenda for the sustainable development goals sdgs as tools for regional and local planning contexts to contribute to the implementation of public policies based on the priority objectives of governments and local actors un 2015 the local use of greywater in agriculture as well as other new sanitation practices bring up new paradigms and requires the human perception change to the reuse of waste bracken et al 2007 brands 2014 buyukkamacia and alkan 2013 hu et al 2016 langergraber and muellegger 2005 werner et al 2009 the implementation of these new sanitation procedures could be a challenge concerning the insecurity and aversion to wastewater reuse and to know the people acceptance of the greywater reuse in agriculture is crucial to guide public policies and the decision making by public agents poortvliet et al 2018 brands 2014 garcia cuerva et al 2016 gu et al 2015 in this scenario researches dedicated to social acceptance and perceptions of the risks and benefits of greywater reuse practices are needed simha 2018 domènecha and saurí 2010 accepting this reuse requires a change of mind in society therefore knowing the perception is crucial to propose better actions of sensibilization of the people to this new practice studies from different parts of the world aiming to evaluate the public perception and acceptation for the greywater reuse have been developed looking for provide indicators for the establishment of local development policies domènecha and saurí 2010 bakare et al 2016 radingoana et al 2019 even there is a predominance of perception evaluations using a general public it would be more interesting and effective to know the perception of specific groups concerning to the wastewater reuse poortvliet et al 2018 then different research strategies have been adopted focusing in groups as key social actors climatic region and water availability oteng peprah et al 2018 an interesting group are the professionals that work directly with rural communities such as agricultural technicians because they are potential disseminators of sanitation practices in these places this study addresses the following research question what is the acceptance for the greywater reuse in agriculture in the brazilian state of minas gerais this study aims to evaluate the acceptance and perception of the risks and benefits of greywater reuse as an alternative water resource in agriculture in brazil a survey was carried out with agricultural technicians professionals in minas gerais to answer the research questions the research chose to evaluate the acceptance and perception of the use of greywater in agriculture with agricultural technicians because this group aims to promote sustainable development through technical assistance in the field to improve the quality of rural life emater mg 2021 understanding the position of these professionals is one of the initial steps to evaluate the effectiveness of public policies and even the need to reorient them to achieve the intended goals the opinion of these professionals is relevant because it can contribute to the actions of farmers since most of the time they are the technical opinion that supports them in making decisions in this study we considered the attitude and the perceived behavioral control pbc to investigate the acceptance and perception of the risks and benefits of the agricultural technicians professionals to use greywater in agriculture the attitude is a favorable or unfavorable feeling associated with performing a particular behavior ajzen 1991 it means that a person will have a favorable attitude toward performing a particular behavior if they believe it will be positive and vice versa the pbc refers to the person s perception of capacity or difficulty to perform the behavior ajzen 2002 it is the person s understanding if they believe they have the tools or resources necessary to perform the behavior based on this we hypothesize that the acceptance to perform the greywater use in agriculture behavior will be identified by those professionals who demonstrate a positive attitude about greywater reuse and who believes that the practice is possible to be performed due to its risks and benefits 2 methods this study was previously approved by the committee for ethics in research with humans from the federal university of viçosa mg caae 36853620 0 0000 5153 2 1 study area and sampling procedures the population surveyed considers professionals from the technical assistance and rural extension company of the state of minas gerais emater mg in portuguese acronyms a public institution involved in promoting agricultural practices water management and sanitation in rural areas this company staff was considered an interesting public to evaluate the acceptance and perception of greywater use in agriculture because they are opinion makers with farmers the technical staff is formed mainly by agronomists veterinarians and zootechnics these professionals provide a rural technical assistance service a public government service that assists farmers demands in agricultural and animal production matters the study area is the state of minas gerais the fourth largest state in brazil 586 522 km2 and the second most populated 21 411 923 inhabitants ibge 2021 minas gerais is the second brazilian state with the most people employed in the agriculture sector with 607 557 rural establishments and 73 of them consider family farmers teixeira and ribeiro 2020 agribusiness is responsible for almost 30 of the minas gerais gdp 2012 and almost 14 of the brazilian gdp 2015 with a production chain that includes a large production of coffee and milk in addition to being a significant producer of sugar cane potatoes oranges beans and cassava and cattle gilio et al 2016 although there is a region in the north of the state considered semi arid in minas gerais is not documented extensive reuse of greywater in agriculture all professionals were contacted by institutional e mails facilitated by the emater mg administration when the research goals were previously presented the data collection was carried out through a structured questionnaire in an online format designed using google forms participants were invited to answer the questions from november to december 2020 in total 1243 professionals were invited to participate in this study voluntarily the sampling was restricted to the emater mg actuation regions in the 12 mesoregions of the minas gerais state in the southeast of brazil fig 1 2 2 questionnaire form before answering the questionnaire supplementary material the participants were invited to accept the terms of informed consent a condition required to get access to the form the questionnaire consisted of three consecutive sections participant information acceptance and perception towards greywater and its use and new ecological paradigm nep scale the participant information section requested demographic information including gender age and professional actuation mesoregion participants were asked for single responses to multiple choice questions the acceptance and perception towards greywater and its reuse section s2 was divided into subsections to evaluate the perception about water scarcity three questions q5 to q7 perceived advantages four questions q8 to q11 perceived risks six questions q12 to q17 and attitudes associated eight questions q18 to q25 all of them related to the use of greywater as a resource these 21 questions were designed with adaptations of previous studies domènecha and saurí 2010 busgang et al 2015 bakare et al 2016 and can be accessed in the questionnaire supplementary material the new ecological paradigm scale nep section s3 proposed by dunlap aimed to assess the personal environmental values and beliefs 15 statements poortvliet et al 2018 simha 2018 dunlap et al 2000 these statements can be accessed in the questionnaire supplementary material the two last sections s2 and s3 were measured using a 6 point likert scale requiring the participants to react to affirmatives considering their level of agreement entirely disagree 1 disagree 2 slightly disagree 3 slightly agree 4 agree 5 and entirely agree 6 dunlap et al 2000 2 3 new ecological paradigm the nep analysis considered the response for each statement of the section for each nep statement we recorded the percentage of interviewers who declare their level of agreement from entirely disagree 1 to entirely agree 6 the 15 statements of the nep scale are divided into five hypothetical facets of ecological worldview 1st facet limits to growth statements 1 6 and 11 2nd facet anti anthropocentrism statements 2 7 and 12 3rd facet balance of nature statements 3 8 and 13 4th facet anti exemptionalism statements 4 9 and 14 5th facet eco crisis statements 5 10 and 15 dunlap et al 2000 the score of each facet ranged from 3 anthropocentric vision to 18 pro environmental vision with a 10 5 neutral score de souza et al 2021 we analyze the mean nep score for both each statement and each facet and use this value to classify the positioning in the class approach anthropocentric vision 3 5 and environmental vision 3 5 the general nep score can vary from 15 anthropocentric vision to 90 environmental vision where 52 5 is neutral score dunlap et al 2000 2 4 attitude and perceived behavioral control for the attitude three aspects were considered to evaluate the respondents attitude towards the use of greywater as1 perception of greywater as an alternative water resource questions 8 11 as2 willingness to carry out the greywater use practice questions 18 20 and as3 willingness to consume food grown with greywater questions 21 and 22 the individual attitude score for each aspect iassc was estimated using eq 1 where r is the response between 1 and 6 for each question using this procedure the three aspects were considered with equal importance even with a different number of questions nq to estimate the individual attitude score iatsc concerning the use of greywater in agriculture eq 2 the overall attitude score was calculated with eq 3 considering the number of participants n aiming to evaluate the attitude concerning each aspect as we use the overall aspect score eq 4 1 individual

asking the technicians concerning human health risks to using greywater as a water resource in agriculture questions q12 and q13 in addition questions q14 to q17 ask about the viability of performing the practice more safely the pbc score is estimated by the mean of the grades recorded in the questions from questions q12 to q17 2 5 data and statistical analysis the kruskal wallis test kruskal and wallis 1952 was used to evaluate the influence of demographic variables on the participants perceptions about greywater reuse and environmental attitudes nep the dunn test was performed to evaluate the influence of the different groups age and mesoregions on each demographic variable by multiple comparisons per question of the questionnaire the differentiation among demographic variables groups gender age and mesoregions considered a 0 05 significance level individual responses from the professionals from 1 to 6 to the nep statements were assessed to the internal consistency by the coefficient of cronbach s alpha α cronbach 1951 the α coefficient 0 α 1 was calculated to check whether the research participants were internally consistent in their stated responses on the nep scale dunlap et al 2000 in the nep scale evaluation the factor analysis with varimax rotation and the kaiser meyer olkin kmo test were used to estimate sampling adequacy the average of the overall rating in the 6 point likert scale 1 µ 6 was used to analyze the respondents environmental perspectives we consider positive perceptions to use of greywater s2 and pro environmental attitudes s3 when µ 3 5 and negative perceptions to greywater use and pro anthropocentrism attitudes when µ 3 5 all statistical analyses were carried out using r r core team 2020 version 4 0 2 3 results we obtained 300 responses to the questionnaire representing 24 1 of the study population n 1243 with 95 confidence level the margin of error was estimated to be 5 3 1 new ecological paradigm the nep mean score of 65 80 10 27 indicates that respondents in general tend to be more pro environment table 1 the cronbach s alpha α 0 α 1 varied between 0 75 and 0 80 indicating as acceptable the internal consistency in the nep scale cronbach 1951 the kmo test was estimated equal to 0 81 indicating optimal sampling adequacy to the factor analysis the comparison between the facets showed nep score with low variance and a pro environmental tendency in a scale from 3 to 18 the nep scores varied from 12 56 to 13 87 to limits to growth mean of 12 96 2 75 anti anthropocentrism mean of 13 25 2 99 balance of nature mean of 13 87 2 74 anti exemptionalism mean of 12 56 2 55 and eco crisis mean of 13 15 3 32 3 2 attitude towards the use of greywater the demographic profile of respondents who responded to our questionnaire form is composed of men 84 3 aged over 40 years 89 0 from all 12 mesoregions of minas gerais and have a pro environmental vision 85 3 table 2 the overall attitude score concerning the use of greywater in agriculture was 4 39 0 93 considering this average is 3 5 the result suggests that in general there is a positive attitude of the surveyed professionals to the use of greywater in agriculture table 2 the general attitude concerning the use of greywater in agriculture was not affected by age mesoregion based and environmental position nep of professionals just gender influenced this attitude with women attitude score 4 69 table 2 presenting more positive attitude than men attitude score 4 33 table 2 to the agriculture use of greywater the analysis of the overall aspect scores as1 as2 and as3 related to the attitude to using greywater revealed that most professionals present a positive attitude for all aspects evaluated both for all responders and the demographic categories table 2 when asked about the possibility of using greywater as an alternative water resource as1 and the willingness to perform the practice of this use as2 more than 80 of interviewers exhibit a very positive attitude 81 3 to as1 and 87 7 to as2 this performance is reduced when asked about the willingness to consume food grown with greywater as3 in this case the overall aspect score was 59 3 for the all interviewed group the kruskal wallis test was applied to assess if there are differences inside the demographic categories to the perceptions of greywater use table 3 the environmental position nep scale of professionals is not affected by gender and age but is influenced by where they are based table 2 this can indicate that their surroundings influence the professional perception gender age and professional mesoregions influenced some agreement of some of the questions about water scarcity questions q5 to q7 perceived advantages questions q8 to q11 perceived risks questions q12 to q17 and acceptance attitudes questions q19 to q25 related to the use of greywater in agriculture questions not affected by gender age mesoregion and environmental position nep were q10 perceived advantages q12 q13 q14 q15 and q16 perceived risks and q21 and q22 attitudes associated there was no difference between gender and age concerning the questions related to water scarcity table 3 when is considered the mesoregion where professionals are based differences are observed and are related to the water available dissimilarity observed in this state professionals from norte de minas questions q5 q6 and q7 and jequitinhonha questions q6 and q7 agreed more regarding the statements presented by the questions related to water scarcity than ones from other mesoregions differences among professionals from these two regions in comparison to the others are presented in table 4 for the questions about perceived advantages and risks of using greywater reuse woman perceptions are more favorable to this use table 3 there are no differences in perceived advantages and risks to different groups or age and mesoregion questions related to the attitudes attitudes revealed the influence of gender age and mesoregion in some questions but without any standardization table 3 woman professionals exhibit more acceptance to use greywater in agriculture question q18 mean 5 15 and this wastewater use is a potential resource to small farmers question q24 mean 4 34 than men professionals mean of 4 69 and 3 85 respectively the perception of the feeling safe to apply greywater in food gardens question q20 exhibits differences just when age groups were considered table 3 according to dunn s test the oldest group 50 mean 3 46 is less favorable to this statement than professionals with 41 50 years old mean 3 95 the youngest group 40 mean 3 79 stand between those two other age groups the origin mesoregions of professionals influenced their acceptance to apply greywater in flower gardens and trees question q19 and the perception that greywater use is more appropriated in the dry season question q23 but just for one pair of comparison between two mesoregions in each question most parts of mesoregions agree to present the same perception level about both statements when asked if greywater use in agriculture would be a promising practice for family farmers in the region where professionals are based question q24 most professionals 65 0 believe that greywater use is a promissory practice to the family farmers this finding considers the professional percentage whom grade 3 5 on q24 we find a correlation between the individual score on question q24 and each final attitude score of the professional r 0 56 p 0 05 this correlation coefficient reflects a moderate relationship between the two variables therefore professionals who exhibit a more favorable attitude to the greywater use in agriculture are related to them believe this practice is promissory to the family farmers when asked if public policies would be interesting to expand the greywater use where they are based question q25 no differences were verified to gender age groups and origin mesoregion table 3 however in general 81 7 of the respondents agree with this statement table 5 highlighting the noroeste de minas no and norte de minas nm mesoregions with more acceptance this agreement considered those answers with the grade 3 5 according to data from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge these two mesoregions present the lowest per capita monthly income no and the highest deficit of wastewater collection in the state nm ibge 2012 when we compare the two classes of nep anthropocentric 3 5 or environmental 3 5 table 3 we observed that professionals more pro environmental notice more that water scarcity is recently increasing question q7 accept more the use of greywater in agriculture question q18 and believe more in public policies to improve the greywater use in agriculture question q25 3 3 perceived behavioral control the professionals were asked if they believed that greywater use could concern any risk to human health and if it is possible and viable to perform this agriculture practice more safely when asked if irrigation using greywater can present risks to the population in general question q13 63 7 3 5 agree with this statement and 47 3 5 believe that greywater contains pathogenic microorganisms question q12 when asked about reducing the risks involved 72 6 3 5 believe drip systems are a preventive irrigation technique question q16 and 77 0 3 5 that it is viable to perform the previous local treatment of this wastewater question q17 therefore the perceived behavioral control of most professionals is that the risks involved in the use of greywater in agriculture could be mitigated the perceived behavioral control verified in this study was not influenced by demographic variables as gender age and mesoregion based the nep classes affect the pbc in this case the pbc of professionals with environmental vision 3 5 is bigger than those from anthropocentric vision ones 3 5 4 discussion in general the rural technicians interviewed presented a positive attitude towards using greywater in agriculture mean attitude score of 4 39 0 93 much higher than the minimum required 3 5 for a positive acceptance towards the practice the willingness of these technicians to consume food grown with greywater as3 was the least positive aspect compared to the other aspects as1 as2 considered to interpret the attitude towards the reuse of this water in this case the willingness to consume food grown with reused water indicates a factor that may reduce acceptance of the practice this behavior can be considered natural given that greywater like other wastewaters can have harmful impacts on human health busgang et al 2015 shi et al 2018 caused by human enteric pathogens and responsible for low level incidence of chronic gastroenteritis upset stomach vomiting and diarrhea as well as other mild illness in people al hamaiedeh 2010 the world health organization who suggests that greywater could be used in vegetable irrigation for raw consumption if quality control techniques are adopted to reduce pathogen contamination who 2006 radingoana et al 2020 show that the level of public acceptance for greywater use in food production is mainly conditioned on the type of crop to be consumed uncooked given the previously mentioned concern for the health safety of the practice this same finding can be highlighted in our study since there was greater acceptance of the greywater use in tree and garden irrigation question q19 than in vegetable gardens question q20 the result indicates great potential for the use of greywater as an alternative water resource for irrigation of non food crops or crops that depend on cooking this same public understanding of greywater use in garden irrigation is perceived in different places such as in oman jamrah et al 2007 and bangkok jiawkok et al 2013 where respectively 76 and 74 of the interviewed population favored this use in general the agricultural technicians interviewed presented a more pro environmental position mean nep score of 4 17 0 7 however this environmental position did not influence the general attitude of the interviewees towards the acceptance of greywater use in agriculture this shows that environmental position as defined by the nep scale is not a decisive guarantee for a final attitude towards the use of greywater in agriculture for the studied public this same situation was observed when individual consumers from an indian university was evaluated to assess the intention to use ecological sanitation solutions for agricultural purposes simha 2018 however when another study was carried out with a more general audience environmental position influenced the intention to use new sanitation systems poortvliet et al 2018 this contrast suggests that environmental position when evaluating the positioning of more diverse groups regarding the use of new sanitation alternatives may be more determinant than when more homogeneous groups are considered more homogeneous groups tend to be less diverse and have more common perceptions about environmental issues in different studies demographic variables are interpreted as indicators to predict a population s acceptance to water reuse radingoana et al 2020 in this study gender was a strong indicator of attitude acceptance and perceptions of advantages and risks women were shown to have the most favorable acceptance and the most positive perception of the environmental and economic benefits of greywater use in irrigation and the increased availability of potable water previous studies found the same situation when assessing the attitude and perceived advantages for greywater reuse in a low cost housing development in south africa bakare et al 2016 the demographic variable age did not prove to be a strong indicator of the behavior of this population probably because our public was formed by more mature people 30 years old it only proved to be significant in relation to the respondents comfort in applying greywater in vegetable gardens we identified that the intermediate age group 41 50 years were more favorable when compared to the younger 40 years and the older 51 years this is interesting as different results have been reported in previous studies where it was observed that the most favorable acceptance of water reuse is correlated to younger audiences radingoana et al 2020 this was the case in the study by bakare et al 2016 who evidenced decreasing willingness to reuse greywater with increasing age groups our study indicated a relationship between the demographic variable mesoregion and water scarcity and attitude towards the use of greywater in agriculture the positioning of respondents to the statements related to water scarcity questions q5 q6 q7 and q23 indicated a significant difference in attitudes in different mesoregions these differences were related to water availability in this state the mesoregions norte de minas and jequitinhonha which most agreed with the statements are included in the sudene superintendence for the development of the northeast area a brazilian agency created to address chronic droughts and the semi arid climate naturally there is a predominance of research with populations living under increased water stress indicating higher acceptance for alternative uses of this resource oteng peprah et al 2018 this finding indicates in our study a more favorable attitude towards the use of greywater in agriculture by technicians working in places that have historically lived with drought for more time a similar result can be highlighted with the agreement to develop a public policy to expand greywater reuse the climatic and socioeconomic characteristics of local contexts are determinants of users attitudes in our study it was evident that the respondents from the mesoregions with the most significant deficit in water supply wastewater collection and lower monthly average income are the ones that most approve of developing a public policy for greywater reuse fig 2 as presented and discussed in the attitude the interviewees presented less acceptance for consuming food grown with greywater use asp3 we identified that this behavior is in agreement with perceived behavioral control pbc the perception of possible health risks from greywater indicates the repugnance of food consumption that may interfere with the user s intention to perform the practice amaris buyukkamacia and alkan et al 2020 2013 therefore it is evident that the quality of greywater is a determining factor in the attitude towards greywater use in agriculture newcomer et al 2017 our results highlight that most professionals believe that greywater use in agriculture is achievable with the adoption of local treatment and irrigation techniques for the risk mitigation example drip irrigation as indicated by who 2006 however consumers may still experience a lack of quality control simha 2018 our study evidence that professionals have a higher acceptance of consuming food produced at home question q22 than produced by other farmers question q21 in addition to these issues previous studies have shown that the source of greywater is also determinant in acceptance of greywater use in food cultivation and users reported high acceptance of the practice with bath water newcomer et al 2017 in brazil 90 of the family farmers interviewed in semi arid regions presented a positive perception for the consumption of food grown with greywater cunha 2018 these perceptions indicate that the practice of greywater reuse in agriculture is a proposal well received by farmers in these regions there are some limitations to this study one limitation is the uncertainty in the sampled population if it represents all technician categories we work with volunteer respondents and no adjustment could be performed to balance this sample with the emater staff composition regarding gender age and mesoregion origin another limitation is the fewer women surveyed although the men s mayoralty presence is a characteristic of the brazilian agribusiness sector and rural extension service women are only 14 38 of farmers and 35 11 of managers in brazilian agricultural properties cepea 2018 although we recognize these limitations we hope the present study can broaden the debate about greywater reuse in society and contribute to the existing gap with subsidies for future legislation about this practice 5 conclusions there is a positive attitude towards the use of greywater in agriculture by agricultural technicians they believe in the possibility of using greywater as an alternative water resource willing to perform the practice and consuming food grown with this effluent despite the perception of possible health risks these professionals believe that it is possible to perform the practice safely by adopting irrigation and treatment techniques on site there is more interest in greywater reuse in regions with water scarcity and a more precarious socioeconomic situation the study highlights a positive perspective for developing public policies for water reuse considering the agricultural technicians staff positioning future studies concerning the acceptance of greywater use in agriculture are

decision making by public agents poortvliet et al 2018 brands 2014 garcia cuerva et al 2016 gu et al 2015 in this scenario researches dedicated to social acceptance and perceptions of the risks and benefits of greywater reuse practices are needed simha 2018 domènecha and saurí 2010 accepting this reuse requires a change of mind in society therefore knowing the perception is crucial to propose better actions of sensibilization of the people to this new practice studies from different parts of the world aiming to evaluate the public perception and acceptation for the greywater reuse have been developed looking for provide indicators for the establishment of local development policies domènecha and saurí 2010 bakare et al 2016 radingoana et al 2019 even there is a predominance of perception evaluations using a general public it would be more interesting and effective to know the perception of specific groups concerning to the wastewater reuse poortvliet et al 2018 then different research strategies have been adopted focusing in groups as key social actors climatic region and water availability oteng peprah et al 2018 an interesting group are the professionals that work directly with rural communities such as agricultural technicians because they are potential disseminators of sanitation practices in these places this study addresses the following research question what is the acceptance for the greywater reuse in agriculture in the brazilian state of minas gerais this study aims to evaluate the acceptance and perception of the risks and benefits of greywater reuse as an alternative water resource in agriculture in brazil a survey was carried out with agricultural technicians professionals in minas gerais to answer the research questions the research chose to evaluate the acceptance and perception of the use of greywater in agriculture with agricultural technicians because this group aims to promote sustainable development through technical assistance in the field to improve the quality of rural life emater mg 2021 understanding the position of these professionals is one of the initial steps to evaluate the effectiveness of public policies and even the need to reorient them to achieve the intended goals the opinion of these professionals is relevant because it can contribute to the actions of farmers since most of the time they are the technical opinion that supports them in making decisions in this study we considered the attitude and the perceived behavioral control pbc to investigate the acceptance and perception of the risks and benefits of the agricultural technicians professionals to use greywater in agriculture the attitude is a favorable or unfavorable feeling associated with performing a particular behavior ajzen 1991 it means that a person will have a favorable attitude toward performing a particular behavior if they believe it will be positive and vice versa the pbc refers to the person s perception of capacity or difficulty to perform the behavior ajzen 2002 it is the person s understanding if they believe they have the tools or resources necessary to perform the behavior based on this we hypothesize that the acceptance to perform the greywater use in agriculture behavior will be identified by those professionals who demonstrate a positive attitude about greywater reuse and who believes that the practice is possible to be performed due to its risks and benefits 2 methods this study was previously approved by the committee for ethics in research with humans from the federal university of viçosa mg caae 36853620 0 0000 5153 2 1 study area and sampling procedures the population surveyed considers professionals from the technical assistance and rural extension company of the state of minas gerais emater mg in portuguese acronyms a public institution involved in promoting agricultural practices water management and sanitation in rural areas this company staff was considered an interesting public to evaluate the acceptance and perception of greywater use in agriculture because they are opinion makers with farmers the technical staff is formed mainly by agronomists veterinarians and zootechnics these professionals provide a rural technical assistance service a public government service that assists farmers demands in agricultural and animal production matters the study area is the state of minas gerais the fourth largest state in brazil 586 522 km2 and the second most populated 21 411 923 inhabitants ibge 2021 minas gerais is the second brazilian state with the most people employed in the agriculture sector with 607 557 rural establishments and 73 of them consider family farmers teixeira and ribeiro 2020 agribusiness is responsible for almost 30 of the minas gerais gdp 2012 and almost 14 of the brazilian gdp 2015 with a production chain that includes a large production of coffee and milk in addition to being a significant producer of sugar cane potatoes oranges beans and cassava and cattle gilio et al 2016 although there is a region in the north of the state considered semi arid in minas gerais is not documented extensive reuse of greywater in agriculture all professionals were contacted by institutional e mails facilitated by the emater mg administration when the research goals were previously presented the data collection was carried out through a structured questionnaire in an online format designed using google forms participants were invited to answer the questions from november to december 2020 in total 1243 professionals were invited to participate in this study voluntarily the sampling was restricted to the emater mg actuation regions in the 12 mesoregions of the minas gerais state in the southeast of brazil fig 1 2 2 questionnaire form before answering the questionnaire supplementary material the participants were invited to accept the terms of informed consent a condition required to get access to the form the questionnaire consisted of three consecutive sections participant information acceptance and perception towards greywater and its use and new ecological paradigm nep scale the participant information section requested demographic information including gender age and professional actuation mesoregion participants were asked for single responses to multiple choice questions the acceptance and perception towards greywater and its reuse section s2 was divided into subsections to evaluate the perception about water scarcity three questions q5 to q7 perceived advantages four questions q8 to q11 perceived risks six questions q12 to q17 and attitudes associated eight questions q18 to q25 all of them related to the use of greywater as a resource these 21 questions were designed with adaptations of previous studies domènecha and saurí 2010 busgang et al 2015 bakare et al 2016 and can be accessed in the questionnaire supplementary material the new ecological paradigm scale nep section s3 proposed by dunlap aimed to assess the personal environmental values and beliefs 15 statements poortvliet et al 2018 simha 2018 dunlap et al 2000 these statements can be accessed in the questionnaire supplementary material the two last sections s2 and s3 were measured using a 6 point likert scale requiring the participants to react to affirmatives considering their level of agreement entirely disagree 1 disagree 2 slightly disagree 3 slightly agree 4 agree 5 and entirely agree 6 dunlap et al 2000 2 3 new ecological paradigm the nep analysis considered the response for each statement of the section for each nep statement we recorded the percentage of interviewers who declare their level of agreement from entirely disagree 1 to entirely agree 6 the 15 statements of the nep scale are divided into five hypothetical facets of ecological worldview 1st facet limits to growth statements 1 6 and 11 2nd facet anti anthropocentrism statements 2 7 and 12 3rd facet balance of nature statements 3 8 and 13 4th facet anti exemptionalism statements 4 9 and 14 5th facet eco crisis statements 5 10 and 15 dunlap et al 2000 the score of each facet ranged from 3 anthropocentric vision to 18 pro environmental vision with a 10 5 neutral score de souza et al 2021 we analyze the mean nep score for both each statement and each facet and use this value to classify the positioning in the class approach anthropocentric vision 3 5 and environmental vision 3 5 the general nep score can vary from 15 anthropocentric vision to 90 environmental vision where 52 5 is neutral score dunlap et al 2000 2 4 attitude and perceived behavioral control for the attitude three aspects were considered to evaluate the respondents attitude towards the use of greywater as1 perception of greywater as an alternative water resource questions 8 11 as2 willingness to carry out the greywater use practice questions 18 20 and as3 willingness to consume food grown with greywater questions 21 and 22 the individual attitude score for each aspect iassc was estimated using eq 1 where r is the response between 1 and 6 for each question using this procedure the three aspects were considered with equal importance even with a different number of questions nq to estimate the individual attitude score iatsc concerning the use of greywater in agriculture eq 2 the

wallis 1952 was used to evaluate the influence of demographic variables on the participants perceptions about greywater reuse and environmental attitudes nep the dunn test was performed to evaluate the influence of the different groups age and mesoregions on each demographic variable by multiple comparisons per question of the questionnaire the differentiation among demographic variables groups gender age and mesoregions considered a 0 05 significance level individual responses from the professionals from 1 to 6 to the nep statements were assessed to the internal consistency by the coefficient of cronbach s alpha α cronbach 1951 the α coefficient 0 α 1 was calculated to check whether the research participants were internally consistent in their stated responses on the nep scale dunlap et al 2000 in the nep scale evaluation the factor analysis with varimax rotation and the kaiser meyer olkin kmo test were used to estimate sampling adequacy the average of the overall rating in the 6 point likert scale 1 µ 6 was used to analyze the respondents environmental perspectives we consider positive perceptions to use of greywater s2 and pro environmental attitudes s3 when µ 3 5 and negative perceptions to greywater use and pro anthropocentrism attitudes when µ 3 5 all statistical analyses were carried out using r r core team 2020 version 4 0 2 3 results we obtained 300 responses to the questionnaire representing 24 1 of the study population n 1243 with 95 confidence level the margin of error was estimated to be 5 3 1 new ecological paradigm the nep mean score of 65 80 10 27 indicates that respondents in general tend to be more pro environment table 1 the cronbach s alpha α 0 α 1 varied between 0 75 and 0 80 indicating as acceptable the internal consistency in the nep scale cronbach 1951 the kmo test was estimated equal to 0 81 indicating optimal sampling adequacy to the factor analysis the comparison between the facets showed nep score with low variance and a pro environmental tendency in a scale from 3 to 18 the nep scores varied from 12 56 to 13 87 to limits to growth mean of 12 96 2 75 anti anthropocentrism mean of 13 25 2 99 balance of nature mean of 13 87 2 74 anti exemptionalism mean of 12 56 2 55 and eco crisis mean of 13 15 3 32 3 2 attitude towards the use of greywater the demographic profile of respondents who responded to our questionnaire form is composed of men 84 3 aged over 40 years 89 0 from all 12 mesoregions of minas gerais and have a pro environmental vision 85 3 table 2 the overall attitude score concerning the use of greywater in agriculture was 4 39 0 93 considering this average is 3 5 the result suggests that in general there is a positive attitude of the surveyed professionals to the use of greywater in agriculture table 2 the general attitude concerning the use of greywater in agriculture was not affected by age mesoregion based and environmental position nep of professionals just gender influenced this attitude with women attitude score 4 69 table 2 presenting more positive attitude than men attitude score 4 33 table 2 to the agriculture use of greywater the analysis of the overall aspect scores as1 as2 and as3 related to the attitude to using greywater revealed that most professionals present a positive attitude for all aspects evaluated both for all responders and the demographic categories table 2 when asked about the possibility of using greywater as an alternative water resource as1 and the willingness to perform the practice of this use as2 more than 80 of interviewers exhibit a very positive attitude 81 3 to as1 and 87 7 to as2 this performance is reduced when asked about the willingness to consume food grown with greywater as3 in this case the overall aspect score was 59 3 for the all interviewed group the kruskal wallis test was applied to assess if there are differences inside the demographic categories to the perceptions of greywater use table 3 the environmental position nep scale of professionals is not affected by gender and age but is influenced by where they are based table 2 this can indicate that their surroundings influence the professional perception gender age and professional mesoregions influenced some agreement of some of the questions about water scarcity questions q5 to q7 perceived advantages questions q8 to q11 perceived risks questions q12 to q17 and acceptance attitudes questions q19 to q25 related to the use of greywater in agriculture questions not affected by gender age mesoregion and environmental position nep were q10 perceived advantages q12 q13 q14 q15 and q16 perceived risks and q21 and q22 attitudes associated there was no difference between gender and age concerning the questions related to water scarcity table 3 when is considered the mesoregion where professionals are based differences are observed and are related to the water available dissimilarity observed in this state professionals from norte de minas questions q5 q6 and q7 and jequitinhonha questions q6 and q7 agreed more regarding the statements presented by the questions related to water scarcity than ones from other mesoregions differences among professionals from these two regions in comparison to the others are presented in table 4 for the questions about perceived advantages and risks of using greywater reuse woman perceptions are more favorable to this use table 3 there are no differences in perceived advantages and risks to different groups or age and mesoregion questions related to the attitudes attitudes revealed the influence of gender age and mesoregion in some questions but without any standardization table 3 woman professionals exhibit more acceptance to use greywater in agriculture question q18 mean 5 15 and this wastewater use is a potential resource to small farmers question q24 mean 4 34 than men professionals mean of 4 69 and 3 85 respectively the perception of the feeling safe to apply greywater in food gardens question q20 exhibits differences just when age groups were considered table 3 according to dunn s test the oldest group 50 mean 3 46 is less favorable to this statement than professionals with 41 50 years old mean 3 95 the youngest group 40 mean 3 79 stand between those two other age groups the origin mesoregions of professionals influenced their acceptance to apply greywater in flower gardens and trees question q19 and the perception that greywater use is more appropriated in the dry season question q23 but just for one pair of comparison between two mesoregions in each question most parts of mesoregions agree to present the same perception level about both statements when asked if greywater use in agriculture would be a promising practice for family farmers in the region where professionals are based question q24 most professionals 65 0 believe that greywater use is a promissory practice to the family farmers this finding considers the professional percentage whom grade 3 5 on q24 we find a correlation between the individual score on question q24 and each final attitude score of the professional r 0 56 p 0 05 this correlation coefficient reflects a moderate relationship between the two variables therefore professionals who exhibit a more favorable attitude to the greywater use in agriculture are related to them believe this practice is promissory to the family farmers when asked if public policies would be interesting to expand the greywater use where they are based question q25 no differences were verified to gender age groups and origin mesoregion table 3 however in general 81 7 of the respondents agree with this statement table 5 highlighting the noroeste de minas no and norte de minas nm mesoregions with more acceptance this agreement considered those answers with the grade 3 5 according to data from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge these two mesoregions present the lowest per capita monthly income no and the highest deficit of wastewater collection in the state nm ibge 2012 when we compare the two classes of nep anthropocentric 3 5 or environmental 3 5 table 3 we observed that professionals more pro environmental notice more that water scarcity is recently increasing question q7 accept more the use of greywater in agriculture question q18 and believe more in public policies to improve the greywater use in agriculture question q25 3 3 perceived behavioral control the professionals were asked if they believed that greywater use could concern any risk to human health and if it is possible and viable to perform this agriculture practice more safely when asked if irrigation using greywater can present risks to the population in general question q13 63 7 3 5 agree with this statement and 47 3 5 believe that greywater contains pathogenic microorganisms question q12 when asked about reducing the risks involved 72 6 3 5 believe drip systems are a preventive irrigation technique question q16 and 77 0 3 5 that it is viable to perform the previous local treatment of this wastewater question q17 therefore the perceived behavioral control of most professionals is that the risks involved in the use of greywater in agriculture could be mitigated the perceived behavioral control verified in this study was not influenced by demographic variables as gender age and mesoregion based the nep classes affect the pbc in this case the pbc of professionals with environmental vision 3 5 is bigger than those from anthropocentric vision ones 3 5 4 discussion in general the rural technicians interviewed presented a positive attitude towards using greywater in agriculture mean attitude score of 4 39 0 93 much higher than the minimum required 3 5 for a positive acceptance towards the practice the willingness of these technicians to consume food grown with greywater as3 was the least positive aspect compared to the other aspects as1 as2 considered to interpret the attitude towards the reuse of this water in this case the willingness to consume food grown with reused water indicates a factor that may reduce acceptance of the practice this behavior can be considered natural given that greywater like other wastewaters can have harmful impacts on human health busgang et al 2015 shi et al 2018 caused by human enteric pathogens and responsible for low level incidence of chronic gastroenteritis upset stomach vomiting and diarrhea as well as other mild illness in people al hamaiedeh 2010 the world health organization who suggests that greywater could be used in vegetable irrigation for raw consumption if quality control techniques are adopted to reduce pathogen contamination who 2006 radingoana et al 2020 show that the level of public acceptance for greywater use in food production is mainly conditioned on the type of crop to be consumed uncooked given the previously mentioned concern for the health safety of the practice this same finding can be highlighted in our study since there was greater acceptance of the greywater use in tree and garden irrigation question q19 than in vegetable gardens question q20 the result indicates great potential for the use of greywater as an alternative water resource for irrigation of non food crops or crops that depend on cooking this same public understanding of greywater use in garden irrigation is perceived in different places such as in oman jamrah et al 2007 and bangkok jiawkok et al 2013 where respectively 76 and 74 of the interviewed population favored this use in general the agricultural technicians interviewed presented a more pro environmental position mean nep score of 4 17 0 7 however this environmental position did not influence the general attitude of the interviewees towards the acceptance of greywater use in agriculture this shows that environmental position as defined by the nep scale is not a decisive guarantee for a final attitude towards the use of greywater in agriculture for the studied public this same situation was observed when individual consumers from an indian university was evaluated to assess the intention to use ecological sanitation solutions for agricultural purposes simha 2018 however when another study was carried out with a more general audience environmental position influenced the intention to use new sanitation systems poortvliet et al 2018 this contrast suggests that environmental position when evaluating the positioning of more diverse groups regarding the use of new sanitation alternatives may be more determinant than when more homogeneous groups are considered more homogeneous groups tend to be less diverse and have more common perceptions about environmental issues in different studies demographic variables are interpreted as indicators to predict a population s acceptance to water reuse radingoana et al 2020 in this study gender was a strong indicator of attitude acceptance and perceptions of advantages and risks women were shown to have the most favorable acceptance and the most positive perception of the environmental and economic benefits of greywater use in irrigation and the increased availability of potable water previous studies found the same situation when assessing the attitude and perceived advantages for greywater reuse in a low cost housing development in south africa bakare et al 2016 the demographic variable age did not prove to be a strong indicator of the behavior of this population probably because our public was formed by more mature people 30 years old it only proved to be significant in relation to the respondents comfort in applying greywater in vegetable gardens we identified that the intermediate age group 41 50 years were more favorable when compared to the younger 40 years and the older 51 years this is interesting as different results have been reported in previous studies where it was observed that the most favorable acceptance of water reuse is correlated to younger audiences radingoana et al 2020 this was the case in the study by bakare et al 2016 who evidenced decreasing willingness to reuse greywater with increasing age groups our study indicated a relationship between the demographic variable mesoregion and water scarcity and attitude towards the use of greywater in agriculture the positioning of respondents to the statements related to water scarcity questions q5 q6 q7 and q23 indicated a significant difference in attitudes in different mesoregions these differences were related to water availability in this state the mesoregions norte de minas and jequitinhonha which most agreed with the statements are included in the sudene superintendence for the development of the northeast area a brazilian agency created to address chronic droughts and the semi arid climate naturally there is a predominance of research with populations living under increased water stress indicating higher acceptance for alternative uses of this resource oteng peprah et al 2018 this finding indicates in our study a more favorable attitude towards the use of greywater in agriculture by technicians working in places that have historically lived with drought for more time a similar result can be highlighted with the agreement to develop a public policy to expand greywater reuse the climatic and socioeconomic characteristics of local contexts are determinants of users attitudes in our study it was evident that the respondents from the mesoregions with the most significant deficit in water supply wastewater collection and lower monthly average income are the ones that most approve of developing a public policy for greywater reuse fig 2 as presented and discussed in the attitude the interviewees presented less acceptance for consuming food grown with greywater use asp3 we identified that this behavior is in agreement with perceived behavioral control pbc the perception of possible health risks from greywater indicates the repugnance of food consumption that may interfere with the user s intention to perform the practice amaris buyukkamacia and alkan et al 2020 2013 therefore it is evident that the quality of greywater is a determining factor in the attitude towards greywater use in agriculture newcomer et al 2017 our results highlight that most professionals believe that greywater use in agriculture is achievable with the adoption of local treatment and irrigation techniques for the risk mitigation example drip irrigation as indicated by who 2006 however consumers may still experience a lack of quality control simha 2018 our study evidence that professionals have a higher acceptance of consuming food produced at home question q22 than produced by other farmers question q21 in addition to these issues previous studies have shown that the source of greywater is also determinant in acceptance of greywater use in food cultivation and users reported high acceptance of the practice with bath water newcomer et al 2017 in brazil 90 of the family farmers interviewed in semi arid regions presented a positive perception for the consumption of food grown with greywater cunha 2018 these perceptions indicate that the practice of greywater reuse in agriculture is a proposal well received by farmers in these regions there are some limitations to this study one limitation is the uncertainty in the sampled population if it represents all technician categories we work with volunteer respondents and no adjustment could be performed to balance this sample with the emater staff composition regarding gender age and mesoregion origin another limitation is the fewer women surveyed although the men s mayoralty presence is a characteristic of the brazilian agribusiness sector and rural extension service women are only 14 38 of farmers and 35 11 of managers in brazilian agricultural properties cepea 2018 although we recognize these limitations we hope the present study can broaden the debate about greywater reuse in society and contribute to the existing gap with subsidies for future legislation about this practice 5 conclusions there is a positive attitude towards the use of greywater in agriculture by agricultural technicians they believe in the possibility of using greywater as an alternative water resource willing to perform the practice and consuming food grown with this effluent despite the perception of possible health risks these professionals believe that it is possible to perform the practice safely by adopting irrigation and treatment techniques on site there is more interest in greywater reuse in regions with water scarcity and a more precarious socioeconomic situation the study highlights a positive perspective for developing public policies for water reuse considering the agricultural technicians staff positioning future studies concerning the acceptance of greywater use in agriculture are

9041,the potential of digital agriculture to support on farm decision making is predicated on the assumption that cause and effect relationships can be encoded in a mathematical form one particularly important application area is irrigation decision making which is informed by the relationship between applied water and end of season crop yield water production relations yet this relationship is often partial owing to its many determining factors especially for woody perennial crops such as grapevines process based models are a way in which to represent these relationships in a manner that is both interpretable and generalizable here we conduct numerical experiments using a process based crop model to evaluate water production relations for grapevines and how these relations are influenced by genetic and environmental factors as well as irrigation timing decisions a real world case study representing a shiraz vineyard in south australia is considered results show a largely linear relation between total irrigation applied and yield across all numerical experiments notwithstanding significant uncertainty due to genetic and environmental factors however when considering water production relations in relative terms e g change in tonnes per megalitre the influence of these factors between seasons is reduced allowing for more robust insights exploration of water productivity as a function of phenological stage shows that the average production sensitivity is greatest during veraison 3 5 tonnes per megalitre and least between bud burst and flowering 2 3 tonnes per megalitre despite considerable overlap in productivity range between stages by putting meaningful bounds on water production relations through process based modeling growers and their advisors can achieve improved farm outcomes by better informed water application decisions keywords decision agriculture water production function crop model viticulture irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction for digital agriculture to support on farm decision making cause and effect relationships are required to be expressed mathematically no more important relationship exists in the context of irrigated agriculture than the relationship between water application and yield this relationship both enables improved water use efficiency a global priority given expected increases in water scarcity and demand mancosu et al 2015 and represents one of the primary controls to enable prediction of end of season outcomes yet whilst these relationships have been investigated extensively through field trials representing specific contexts with few exceptions there have been limited attempts at generalizing these relationships to new environments where for example different climate and management strategies exist to make effective decisions regarding efficient water application a rigorous understanding of how crops respond to water limitation or stress is essential such an understanding is often encapsulated via crop water production functions or relations which express mathematically the response of a crop to irrigation applied over the growing season in terms of end of season yield helweg 1991 crop water production relations have been used extensively as decision support tools across the agriculture domain serving as a basis for predicting and sometimes optimizing likely crop yield for different irrigation scenarios and for identifying irrigation requirements e g brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 schütze and schmitz 2010 garcía vila and fereres 2012 linker et al 2016 they are also commonly employed within socio econometric analyses e g cai et al 2008 maneta et al 2009 dozier et al 2017 we refer the reader to foster and brozović 2018 for a review of crop water production relations traditionally crop water production relations are derived empirically from field experiments hexem and heady 1978 vaux and pruitt 1983 experimental derivation of this relation requires an extensive dataset that spans both multiple growing seasons to sample the influence of environmental factors such as inter annual rainfall variability as well as irrigation treatments to sample the influence of decisions such as irrigation timing zhang and oweis 1999 geerts and raes 2009 as such the time and cost investment associated with this approach is significant in addition experimentally derived water production relations are not considered to be geographically portable meaning that generalization between different field sites and cultivars is problematic clumpner and solomon 1987 brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 there is increasing interest in complementing empirically rich datasets obtained from controlled field experiments with the capacity to generalize across application contexts using process based crop modeling geerts and raes 2009 dejonge et al 2012 cuddington et al 2013 saseendran et al 2015 knowling et al 2021 in particular process based crop models can be used to characterize water production relations this involves simulation of crop growth and development typically at a daily time resolution under different irrigation scenarios that induce different severity and or timing of water stress these models are particularly powerful in that they are designed to account for the effects of myriad factors on water production relations including genetic environmental and management g x e x m factors despite their significant potential crop models have seldom been used to derive water production relations while accounting for the effect of management decisions and uncertain e g environmental factors an exception includes the study of foster and brozović 2018 who simulated water production relations that account for the effect of irrigation timing decisions and climate factors for maize using aquacrop steduto et al 2009 foster et al 2017 however to date crop models have not been applied to simulate water production relations for crops that are more complex in their formation of yield components and their sensitivity to stress factors including woody perennial crops such as fruit trees and grapevines laurent et al 2021 while this reflects the fact that more sophisticated models are required to adequately simulate the complex behavior of these crops moriondo et al 2015 existing crop models are capable of mapping water application decisions to grapevine yield knowling et al 2021 to address this gap this study addresses evaluates water production relations for grapevines while accounting for the effect of management decisions as well as genetic and environmental factors through process based modeling we focus on viticulture because the relationship between water application and yield is a key factor determining vineyard performance in many regions miras avalos and araujo 2021 while noting that grape composition at harvest also represents an important vineyard performance metric poni et al 2017 the specific objectives are to 1 assess the ability of a process based grapevine growth and development model to appropriately simulate key state and flux variables as well as vineyard outcomes related to water production relations for a commercial vineyard case study located in the riverland region of south australia 2 evaluate simulated water production relations expressed in both absolute and relative terms for the case study and investigate how these relations are influenced by 3 genetic and environmental factors e g climate weather crop and rootstock genetic coefficients soil properties and 4 operational decisions controlling irrigation timing i e on a phenological stage resolution 2 case study to evaluate grapevine water production relations and their dependence on genetic and environmental factors as well as within season decisions a viticulture case study with several properties is required including significant irrigation application and high volume production such that the focus is on yield rather than grape quality attributes our case study a 0 94 hectare ha vineyard block part of a vineyard located in loxton within the riverland region of south australia satisfies these criteria a summary of key attributes of the vineyard case study is given in table 1 the riverland region experiences a mediterranean climate characterized by hot dry summers and cold wet winters with an average annual rainfall and pan evaporation rate taken at loxton of 270 and 1900 mm respectively three growing seasons 2011 12 2015 16 and 2020 21 are considered herein the riverland region of south australia is the largest wine grape producing region in australia wine australia 2021 high production rates per unit area are typical of the region for

model employed herein is specifically designed to simulate grapevine growth and development section 3 1 through application of the model to a real world vineyard case study section 3 2 we first evaluate the crop model s ability to reasonably simulate key variables that underpin water production relations and their sensitivity to different irrigation scenarios section 3 3 following model evaluation numerical experiments are undertaken to simulate grapevine water production relations for the case study section 3 4 and quantify the extent to which these relations depend on uncertain factors and irrigation timing sections 3 5 and 3 6 3 1 process based crop model following a recent review of process based crop models for simulating grapevine growth and development in the context of decision support by knowling et al 2021 vinelogic walker et al 2005 2020a 2020b 2020c was chosen for its relatively detailed representation of soil water dynamics and the influence of water deficit on grapevine growth including berry development vinelogic was recently made open source which enhances reproducibility and further comparative studies 3 1 1 overview of vinelogic vinelogic simulates on a daily basis state and flux variables associated with the following key processes across the soil water atmosphere continuum fig 1 soil water dynamics thermal time used to control phenological transitions light interception biomass accumulation i e carbon assimilation and partitioning to different organs leaf shoot fruit and root depending on phenological stage six grapevine phenological stage transitions are simulated dormancy to bud burst bud burst to start of flowering start of flowering to fruit set fruit set to veraison veraison to harvest and harvest to leaf fall vinelogic simulates the effect of several stress factors including water deficit discussed below temperature salinity nutrient and aeration on grapevine growth and development input variables requiring specification in vinelogic can be categorized as forcing variables static parameters and decision levers knowling et al 2021 forcing variables include daily climate weather variables such as solar radiation minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall climate weather data are required not only for the growing season under investigation but also the penultimate growing season to account for important factors affecting fruitfulness clingeleffer 2010 guilpart et al 2014 static parameters include cultivar variables such as genetic coefficients responsible for biomass partitioning and thermal time thresholds rootstock variables such as vigor and aeration sensitivity indices soil variables as a function of depth such as moisture content at the start of the season and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity hydrology variables such as depth to water table and vineyard attributes such as row and inter vine spacing and trellis height decision levers include those relating to irrigation and canopy management practices daily irrigation rates can be specified by directly inputting a time series of irrigation rates or be simulated based on simulated soil moisture deficit and deficit related irrigation rules e g steduto et al 2009 comas et al 2019 canopy management e g trimming can be specified by reducing the leaf area index lai state variable when it reaches a threshold e g 2 0 m2 m2 by some extent e g 0 5 m2 m2 vinelogic simulates the effect of water deficit caused by rainfall or irrigation shortfall through water stress indices fig 1 water stress indices are model output quantities normalized between zero and unity that are used to represent the plant water status e g plant water potential these water stress indices serve to limit the predicted rate of growth in various grapevine organs including fruit by reducing the simulated available carbon assimilate store biomass pool via two means fig 1 i reducing the canopy area and therefore the amount of light intercepted and ii reducing the photosynthetic activity and therefore the amount of carbon assimilate produced by light interception simulated canopy area and photosynthetic activity are also a function of climate and weather variables water stress indices are computed based on simulated rates of root water uptake and potential vine transpiration smith et al 1997 shaw and meyer 2015 simulated root water uptake rate is a function of simulated soil moisture content and a soil hospitality index representing factors affecting root growth such as ph nutrient availability etc apart from soil physical characteristics soil moisture content is a function of rainfall and irrigation rates which affect soil moisture directly as well as other climate weather variables e g temperature solar radiation that indirectly affect soil moisture through altered vine water demands fig 1 vinelogic can simulate potential evapotranspiration by different means depending on daily weather data availability for example if wind run and dew point temperature data are available a modified penman monteith procedure can be used which has been found to be the most useful model for most though not all situations valipour 2017 however if only solar radiation and maximum and minimum temperature are available as is the case here the priestly taylor procedure is suitable ritchie 1985 here potential vine transpiration rate is simulated as a function of potential evapotranspiration via the priestly taylor method and simulated lai knowling et al under review it should be noted that vinelogic may be less reliable when simulating the impact of extreme water stress conditions on grapevine growth and development e g to the point of non production 3 1 2 representation of seasonal irrigation and yield vinelogic simulates irrigation rate and fruit weight on a daily basis to derive water production relations these variables need to be aggregated in time to produce total seasonal irrigation and end of season yield total seasonal irrigation q total is given by 1 q total bb lf q i dt where q i is the irrigation rate for day i and bb and lf are the day indices of bud burst initiation and leaf fall initiation respectively both of which are controlled by simulated thermal time fig 1 q total is integrated only over the period between bud burst and leaf fall because water balance components including irrigation are not simulated during dormancy end of season yield y is given by 2 y fs h p i dw i fdt where dw i is the simulated change monotonic increase in total crop dry mass including fruit shoot leaf plus stem and root for day i p i is the proportion of dry mass partitioned to fruit for day i f is the dry to fresh weight conversion factor 4 garcia de cortazar atauri et al 2009 fs is the day index at which fruit set is initiated which is controlled by simulated thermal time and h is the day index at which harvest is initiated which occurs when simulated fruit sugar concentrations in brix reach a desired threshold critbrix table 3 3 2 parameterization of baseline model the first step to addressing the study objectives is to apply vinelogic to the case study conditions section 2 this involves specifying model forcing variables static parameters and decision levers such that they reflect the main attributes of the vineyard e g grape variety soil type observation data e g climate weather data and typical management practices e g frequent irrigation application mechanical pruning and trimming that collectively reflect case study conditions we refer to this as the baseline model and it serves as a basis for subsequently comparing the outcome of different hypothetical irrigation scenarios and irrigation perturbations 3 2 1 forcing variables daily climate weather data from a weather station located 100 m from the vineyard loxton research centre station 024024 bureau of meteorology 2021 are used to force the baseline model climate weather data spanning the 2020 21 and 2019 20 growing seasons are used for the baseline model 3 2 2 static parameters table 2 lists model static parameters specified for the baseline model parameter values and bounds are specified in accordance with available site specific data and viticultural expert knowledge 3 2 3 decision levers we simulate daily irrigation rates using the soil moisture deficit approach section 3 1 this is appropriate since actual daily irrigation data are not available for our case study table 3 lists irrigation related decision levers specified for the baseline model these decision levers are specified to give rise to total seasonal irrigation and irrigation frequencies that are typical in the case study region 3 3 methodology for baseline model evaluation before simulating grapevine water production relations we evaluate the baseline model growing season 2020 21 in terms of its ability to appropriately simulate key state and flux variables that underpin water production relations such an evaluation is necessary because water production relations are time integrated in nature and therefore consideration of intermediate vineyard state and flux variables particularly those that are observable in the field allows for determination of whether water production relations are being appropriately simulated i e the right answers for the right reasons kirchner 2006 simulated state and flux variables that are involved in mapping irrigation decisions to yield and evaluated herein are as follows irrigation mm day soil moisture cm3 cm3 water stress index dimensionless lai m2 m2 available carbohydrates carbpool g and carbohydrate demand for fruit development fruitsink g how these intermediate variables respond to a varying degree of water deficit due to changes in irrigation is also assessed this is achieved by comparing these variables from the baseline model with a reduced irrigation model which represents a hypothetical reduced irrigation scenario decision levers for the reduced irrigation model are specified such that q total is approximately 40 lower than the baseline model table 3 the model is also evaluated in terms of how well simulated values from the baseline model correspond to available data while actual irrigation data are not available for the case study vineyard average seasonal irrigation volumes for the region 7 6 ml ha wheeler et al 2022 are used to ensure the model is simulating appropriately in a first order sense irrigation actual yield data are also not available for the case study vineyard we therefore compare simulated yield values to averages from the region for vineyards of red varietals 23 tonnes ha wheeler et al 2022 3 4 numerical experiments for simulating water production relations the simulation of water production relations for the case study vineyard involves numerical experiments within vinelogic whereby q total and y are simulated under a series of irrigation perturbations simulated water production relations are expressed in absolute i e y as a function of q total and relative terms i e change in y as a function of change in q total 3 4 1 absolute water production relations to simulate y as a function of q total requires that q total be perturbed and the associated y for each q total be recorded the resulting set of q total y pairs can be used to plot water production relations in this study we perturb q total by adjusting trig swt section 3 2 3 perturbations of trig swt ranged from 10 to 90 ignoring extreme conditions at 1 increments table 3 this generates 80 model evaluations per water production relation other decision levers associated with irrigation simulation such as soil deficit re fill percentage were held constant 3 4 2 relative water production relations we also express water production relations in a relative sense expressing water production relation in a relative sense facilitates an understanding of the return per unit of water applied e g tonnes of yield per ml we quantify changes in y with respect to changes in q total i e the derivative dy dq total the change in q total and y is computed between successive perturbations that is 3 dy dq total i y i 1 y i q i 1 total q i total where i is the perturbation index associated with trig swt values e g the 1st 2nd and 3rd perturbations correspond to trig swt values of 10 11 and 12 3 5 influence of genetic and environmental factors since q total and y are both sensitive to climate weather forcing variables and static model parameters representing genetic and environmental factors simulated water production relations are expected to display uncertainty zhang et al 2020 here we express uncertainty associated with both climate weather variables and static parameters and quantify their influence on simulated water production relations to quantify the uncertainty associated with water production relations attributable to static parameters we employ monte carlo simulation this involves propagating samples of static parameters through vinelogic to produce samples of quantities of interest including q total y and dy dq total gaussian probability distributions are assumed for static parameters with ranges given in table 2 representing approximately 95 confidence intervals these parameter distributions represent an unconditional a priori uncertainty stance parameters are also assumed to be uncorrelated an ensemble containing 20 samples or realizations is drawn using the pest suite white et al 2020a 2020b each realization is propagated through vinelogic using pest and its built in parallel run manager white et al 2020a 2020b to explore the uncertainty associated with water production relations attributable to climate weather variables we simulate water production relations for different years with substantial differences in total rainfall occurring during the growing season specifically we consider the growing seasons 2011 12 and 2015 16 in addition to the baseline 2020 21 season with rainfall during the growing season october march inclusive of 198 103 and 83 mm respectively 3 6 influence of irrigation timing irrigation timing is also expected to influence water production relations shani et al 2004 foster and brozović 2018 this is because q total is non unique i e different irrigation schedules can give rise to equal q total values and y depends on both the severity and timing of water stress saseendran et al 2015 jha et al 2018 to quantify the influence of within season irrigation timing on water production relations trig swt is perturbed for each phenological stage individually excluding harvest to leaf fall stage due to insensitivity of current season yield to post harvest changes in irrigation perturbations are again conducted from 10 to 90 however at increments of 10 because resolution beyond this is excessive in terms of characterizing water production relations perturbations are applied to each individual phenological stage while maintaining trig swt for other stages at each of the perturbation levels this gives rise to a total of 6561 94 model evaluations for each water production relation for each realization of genetic and environmental model parameters and for each growing season 4 results 4 1 model evaluation simulated state and flux variables display physically reasonable values as well as variability in time fig 2 first consider the baseline model trig swt 50 simulated irrigation occurs only when necessary to maintain soil moisture levels as expected for example the relatively low irrigation during november is due to significant rainfall during this period causing increased soil moisture simulated irrigation rates and total seasonal irrigation of 7 6 ml ha reflect what is typical irrigation practice in the case study vineyard and in the region more generally section 3 3 soil moisture varies within a relatively consistent range largely due to frequent daily irrigation application to reduce or maintain soil moisture deficit while also responding strongly to large rainfall events as expected the water stress index is strongly related inversely to the simulated soil moisture simulated lai displays a familiar evolution over the course of the season with distinct periods of canopy growth stabilization and senescence as well as the influence of canopy management mechanical trimming is simulated by instantaneously lowering lai when a specified threshold is encountered the available store of carbon assimilate carbpool generally exceeds its demand for fruit development until mid january after which carbohydrate demand for fruit development fruitsink exceeds supply causing depletion this is followed by a period of carbon accumulation for subsequent seasons once canopy and fruit mass accumulation have ceased and prior to leaf fall the simulated yield is in agreement with the average yield across the region 23 tonnes ha state and flux variables display substantial differences between the baseline trig swt 50 and reduced irrigation model trig swt 80 an expected divergence between the two simulated irrigation time series is apparent throughout the season with considerably more irrigation events for the baseline model this causes simulated soil moisture from the reduced irrigation model to be less than that of the baseline model throughout the season except in response to high rainfall events for the reduced irrigation model canopy growth rate is similar to the baseline model until october when it begins to lag due to water stress effects on vegetative growth the smaller canopy for the reduced irrigation model causes a considerable reduction in carbohydrate accumulation before berry development accelerates in mid january as a result the demand for carbohydrates exceeds the carbohydrate pool in the early stages of veraison this results in a considerable portion of the remaining demand for berry development to be unsatisfied ultimately serving to reduce yield in the reduced irrigation model the accumulation rate of carbohydrate reserves is also compromised compared to the baseline model potentially effecting subsequent growing seasons 4 2 simulated water production relations 4 2 1 absolute water production relations simulated water production relations display consistent attributes across the different growing seasons fig 3 approximately linear increases in y with respect to q total are apparent up to the point at which water demand for fruit development is satisfied where a maximum y value y max is encountered at a threshold q total value q y max total y displays insensitivity to q total increases above q y max total this insensitivity does not necessarily reflect an absence of water deficit but more specifically that fruit development is not being limited by water deficit that is caused by a shortfall in irrigation i e the available carbohydrate store is able to meet demand for fruit development simulated water production relations for all seasons converge on an approximately equal y max value 22 9 tonnes ha this is because zero water stress occurs where q total is sufficiently large meaning that the difference in y max is only a function of carbohydrate demand for fruit development driven by thermal time during fruit set and veraison which is similar between the three seasons moreover y values of between 4 and 7 tonnes ha are apparent with zero q total i e rainfall only despite relatively high water stress occurring during periods of vegetative growth and fruit development the q y max total ranges between 4 and 5 ml ha the only considerable difference in water production relations between seasons is the vertical offset in the sensitive portion of the relations with the y for the 2011 12 season being on average approximately 3 tonnes ha larger than that for the 2020 21 and 2015 16 seasons this reflects the substantially higher rainfall during the 2011 12 season section 3 5 it should be noted that q total and y values that are typical of the case study region are within the neighborhood of insensitivity while this suggests non productive water application e g losses to evaporation soil drainage the influence of genetic and environmental factors and irrigation timing also need to be accounted for to explore this in a more rigorous fashion sections 4 3 and 4 4 4 2 2 relative water production relations when expressing water production relations in relative terms section 3 4 a greater level of consistency is apparent between growing seasons as more systematic differences when expressing relations in absolute terms are no longer evident fig 4 over the sensitive portion of the relation dy dq total values range between approximately 1 6 tonnes ml with a mean of approximately 3 tonnes ml in other words for every 1 ml ha change in q total a change in y of 3 tonnes ha is expected on average providing q total is below q y max total 4 3 influence of genetic and environmental factors genetic and environmental factors table 2 display a substantial influence on water production relations in an absolute sense as evidenced by systematic differences between realizations fig 5 for example a q total of 4 ml ha may be expected to produce a y between 13 and 18 tonnes ha for seasons 2015 16 and 2020 21 and 14 20 tonnes ha for season 2011 2012 y max and q y max total also display substantial uncertainty ranging between 14 and 27 tonnes ha and 4 7 ml ha respectively across all seasons the uncertainty about absolute simulated water production relations arises due to the sensitivity of both q total and y to static model parameters representing factors such as soil hydraulic properties and conditions e g soil conductivity and moisture at start of growing season and genetic coefficients e g controlling water demand of different organs at specific times the ensemble of model realizations encompasses expected q total and y values for the case study section 3 2 this further corroborates the model and its suitability to evaluate water production relations however expected q total and y values for the case study remain within the neighborhood of insensitivity further suggesting the possibility of non productive water application practices fig 6 shows how water production relations expressed in relative terms are influenced by genetic and environmental factors as well as non linearity in the relation a larger variance in dy dq total values is apparent compared to that when accounting for non linearity from a deterministic stance despite small sample size of deterministic dy dq total values fig 4 this suggests that genetic and environmental factors influence relative water production relations with uncertainty in dy dq total values due to its sensitivity to e g static model parameters that govern water use efficiency such as soil hydraulic conductivity however the influence of genetic and environmental factors appears to be reduced when expressing water production relations in relative i e the slope of absolute relation as opposed to absolute terms for example when applying 3 ml ha irrigation for season 2020 21 y ranges from 8 5 to 14 tonnes ha depending on genetic and environmental factors whereas dy dq total ranges from 2 5 to 5 tonnes ml again there is consistency between seasons further suggesting generalizability of water production relations it should be noted that dy dq total values presented here are strongly influenced by insensitivity at low and high q total values this reflects the whole of season nature of water production relations as well as that perturbations to irrigation decision levers operate over the entire season a higher temporal resolution is considered below 4 4 influence of irrigation timing water production relations display sensitivity to phenological stage i e the growth stage in which a perturbation to irrigation is being applied fig 7 there exists significant overlap between dy dq total distributions for individual phenological stages meaning that reliable ranking of these stages in terms of their water productivity is not straightforward and needs to account for uncertainty dy dq total values are generally similar between flowering and veraison e g the mean of dy dq total value across all three seasons for phenological stages flowering to fruit set and fruit set to veraison is 3 1 and 2 9 tonnes ml respectively however considerably smaller dy dq total values are apparent between bud burst and flowering e g mean dy dq total of 2 3 tonnes ha whereas considerably larger dy dq total values are apparent between veraison and harvest e g mean dy dq total values of 3 5 tonnes ha as well as a significant portion of the distribution exceeding 5 tonnes ml this generally indicates that the sensitivity of production to changes in water application is greater later in the growing season overall the mean and variance of dy dq total values for individual phenological stages display consistency between different growing seasons supporting the notion that the influence of irrigation timing on water production relations between seasons can be generalized to some degree 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of case study findings with previous literature our analysis reveals several findings that align with viticulture literature as summarized briefly as follows water production relations display a largely linear form up to a threshold where yield is insensitive to water deficit for example tyerman 2015 found linearity in the relationship between irrigation and yield based on water treatment trials on a chardonnay vineyard on ramsey rootstocks located in the riverland region of south australia the region in which our case study is based other examples displaying linear dependence between yield and water application include stevens et al 1995 and githui and goodwin 2020 relative water productivity values of approximately 3 tonnes ml for example stevens et al 2010 found a dy dq total value of 3 2 tonnes ml for shiraz vines grafted to various rootstocks also within the riverland region similar values have been also reported for a range of cultivars for other regions around the world e g payan et al 2011 a non trivial dependency of water production sensitivity on phenological stage while some works report generally similar water productivity across phenological stages e g williams 2010 williams et al 2010 others demonstrate the differences in water production relations between these stages for example water deficit on berry growth and yield between veraison and harvest has been reported to be comparatively relatively high due to cell expansion and lack of berry transpired water replenishment mccarthy 1997 mccarthy et al 2002 several findings however are considered to be either somewhat in contrast to previous literature or previously unreported for example keller et al 2006 did not report a lower sensitivity of grape berry volume to water application for the period between flowering and veraison compared to veraison to harvest despite the lower water demand for berry growth between flowering and veraison sebastian et al 2015 it is suggested that this finding be further investigated it is also recommended that future work consider introducing simulation of water deficit effects on berry growth beyond those taking place through carbohydrate supply demand fig 1 as well as field data trials be designed to corroborate or otherwise findings through the coordination of field and modeling efforts 5 2 implications and recommendations for future work 5 2 1 utility of water production relations for irrigation decisions this study provides a useful benchmark for better understanding the cause and effect of water application decisions in terms of vineyard yield examples are discussed in the following subsections a better understanding of water production relations ultimately enables improved water management decision making insights regarding water production relations for grapevines reported herein should complement heuristic approaches based on experience often adopted by growers to make operational water decisions in the face of uncertainty us department of agriculture 2013 dayde et al 2014 how generalized water production relations provide actionable information and create value will inevitably vary from grower to grower rossi et al 2014 zhai et al 2020 our case study findings are expected to be of particular relevance to grape growers in high production regions where cost of water is an issue and or if subject to water restrictions during a drought such regions include the san joaquin valley usa riverland australia castilla la mancha spain and languedoc roussillon france in these regions water production relations capture the key drivers of a grower s bottom line revenue is determined primarily by yield and cost is determined primarily by variable water costs e g purchase from market delivery while yield is often considered an indicator of crop value in these regions fruit composition attributes that can impact product e g wine quality such as sugar and anthocyanin concentrations also constitute production constraints it is suggested that the complex trade off between fruit quantity and quality attributes and their respective responses to water deficit guilpart et al 2014 poni et al 2018 gambetta et al 2020 should be factored into future process based modeling studies that aim to evaluate water production relations in viticulture knowling et al 2021 5 2 2 generalizability of water production relations water production relations are shown to display some level of generalizability with respect to several factors for example generalizability of water production relations is apparent especially when expressed in relative terms between three different growing seasons of highly variable seasonal rainfall totals across genetic and environmental factors and across irrigation timing decisions while the demonstrated potential for generalization of water production relations in some cases is a promising result the extent to which generalizability exists for other more diverse cultivars e g gibberd et al 2001 and climates requires further investigation through process based modeling generalizability to other horticultural and perennial crops also remains an open question and warrants investigation more generally the complementary role that process based modeling can play to help generalize empirically rich datasets obtained from controlled field experiments geerts and raes 2009 jones et al 2017 knowling et al 2021 5 2 3 influence of genetic and environmental factors genetic and environmental factors such as climate weather variables and model parameters relating to cultivar and soil properties are shown to have a substantial influence on water production relations when expressed in absolute terms for example the yield displays a range of 13 18 tonnes ha for a given total irrigation volume of 4 ml ha for the case study considered such a level of uncertainty in end of season yield is considered to be significant and would likely not be of much utility in terms of informing irrigation decisions the high variance in yield obtained for our case study perhaps also reflects that a priori parameter distributions require refinement table 2 expressing uncertainty associated with water production relations is nevertheless important to enhance robustness and avoid over confidence doherty and simmons 2013 knowling et al 2019 notwithstanding the added need to consider probabilities while it is an important finding that genetic and environmental factors play an important role in characterizing absolute water production relations the contribution of individual factors remains unknown it is therefore recommended that future work identify critical genetic and environmental factors through approaches such as global sensitivity analyses saltelli et al 2008 by doing so future data collection efforts can also be designed in a more targeted manner to benefit decision making i e discriminatory data ferré 2017 water production relations when expressed in relative terms display less sensitivity to genetic and environmental factors for example the derivative of yield with respect to total irrigation varies by approximately 2 tonnes ml on average e g 2 4 tonnes ml with some of that variability attributable to non linearity in water production relations rather than the influence of genetic and environmental factors whereas yield itself varies by approximately 5 tonnes ha on average for a given water application volume e g e g 13 18 tonnes ha when applying 4 ml this suggests that the statistical moments of water production relations are characterized by static model parameters that are fixed or model structural aspects i e governing equations similar results in terms of a dampened influence of uncertainty on relative model outputs have been found in other fields such as hydrology e g knowling et al 2020 white et al 2020a 2020b this finding indicates that water production relations when expressed in relative terms are more robust constituting an important finding since growers and their advisors are often interested in relative quantities such as return on water per megalitre chalmers 2012 edwards and clingeleffer 2013 skewes and meissner 2015 5 2 4 influence of irrigation timing water production relations are also shown to be sensitive to within season irrigation timing decisions for example the derivative of yield with respect to total irrigation is on average 2 3 tonnes ml prior to flowering compared to 3 0 tonnes ml between flowering and veraison and 3 5 tonnes ml between veraison and harvest despite overlap between the distributions of sensitivity between phenological stages these aggregated outputs suggest that greater production sensitivity to water application occurs during the latter stages of the growing season when berry development is the primary system sink which is consistent with several reports in the literature section 5 1 such insights pertaining to production per unit of water applied during each growth stage are expected to be of particular utility to a grower e g chalmers 2012 skewes and meissner 2015 this is because insights pertaining to an individual growth stage timescale strike a practical balance between daily and whole of season insights water productivity insights when perturbing irrigation across whole season are of low utility given their coarseness i e zero resolution within growing season whereas daily insights are too detailed to allow for generalizability between seasons etc 5 2 5 beyond within season dynamics while water production relations operate on a seasonal timescale basis it is important to understand the effect of irrigation decisions on outcomes from not only the current growing season but also subsequent growing seasons inter seasonal dynamics are particularly important for grapevines this is because one of the main yield components bunch number is formed during the penultimate season clingeleffer 2001 2010 and displays more complicated responses to water stress guilpart et al 2014 pagay and collins 2017 inter seasonal dynamics are also important because of the potential for water deficits between harvest and leaf fall to reduce carbohydrate reserves and therefore productivity in the following season pellegrino et al 2014 future studies should employ process based models to investigate the effect of inter seasonal factors on water production relations in grapevines as well as other perennial crops to account for productivity trade offs between seasons we note however that such an investigation may require extension of process based model capabilities 5 2 6 opportunities for optimization of irrigation strategies this study serves as an enabler of formal optimization of vineyard irrigation decisions formal optimization of seasonal irrigation volumes and or daily schedules can be achieved using water production relations as an objective function gradient as demonstrated extensively for other crops e g zhang and oweis 1999 shang and mao 2006 schütze and schmitz 2010 garcía vila and fereres 2012 linker et al 2016 linker and sylaios 2016 foster and brozović 2018 li et al 2018a 2018b mwiya et al 2020 by putting meaningful bounds on water production relations and their important attributes e g the total irrigation at which maximum yield is realized a range of optimal irrigation scenarios can also be established we recommend that future work realize this opportunity 6 conclusions this paper evaluates water production relations for grapevines as well as their sensitivity to genetic and environmental factors and irrigation timing decisions by conducting numerical experiments these experiments are undertaken using a process based model specifically designed to simulate grapevine growth and development a commercial vineyard case study in south australia is considered simulated water production relations for grapevines are shown to display largely consistent characteristics across different growing seasons this is despite the significant uncertainty associated with water production relations when expressed in absolute terms i e yield as a function of water applied posing a challenge to water management decision making however when considering water production relations in relative terms i e change in yield with respect to changes in water applied the influence of genetic and environmental factors is reduced allowing for more robust insights for example across the three growing seasons considered it is shown that for every 1 ml ha change in water application the mean change in yield is approximately 3 tonnes ha with variability in sensitivity e g up to 8 tonnes ml arising due to water production non linearity genetic and environmental factors and irrigation timing the greatest sensitivity in production to water applied occurred during veraison e g mean of 3 5 tonnes ml whereas the least sensitivity occurred prior to flowering e g mean of 2 3 tonnes ml this study enables the viticulture industry to better realize the potential of digital agriculture to support on farm water management decisions by addressing the sole reliance on empirical field data to derive water production relations our viticulture case study findings provide a useful benchmark for improved understanding of the likely return on water application decisions in terms of vineyard productivity such an enhanced understanding of the cause and effect of water application decisions in terms of production will ultimately enable improved water management decisions this study also highlights the potential for process based models to establish generalized cause and effect relations that account for a wide range of factors that cannot practically be achieved via other means these generalized cause and effect relationships are likely to play an important role in ensuring that digital agriculture leads to better on farm decisions through for example their adoption within easy to use decision support tools to undertake what if scenario assessments better on farm decisions are required to address significant challenges such as the need to increase water use efficiency globally declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9041,the potential of digital agriculture to support on farm decision making is predicated on the assumption that cause and effect relationships can be encoded in a mathematical form one particularly important application area is irrigation decision making which is informed by the relationship between applied water and end of season crop yield water production relations yet this relationship is often partial owing to its many determining factors especially for woody perennial crops such as grapevines process based models are a way in which to represent these relationships in a manner that is both interpretable and generalizable here we conduct numerical experiments using a process based crop model to evaluate water production relations for grapevines and how these relations are influenced by genetic and environmental factors as well as irrigation timing decisions a real world case study representing a shiraz vineyard in south australia is considered results show a largely linear relation between total irrigation applied and yield across all numerical experiments notwithstanding significant uncertainty due to genetic and environmental factors however when considering water production relations in relative terms e g change in tonnes per megalitre the influence of these factors between seasons is reduced allowing for more robust insights exploration of water productivity as a function of phenological stage shows that the average production sensitivity is greatest during veraison 3 5 tonnes per megalitre and least between bud burst and flowering 2 3 tonnes per megalitre despite considerable overlap in productivity range between stages by putting meaningful bounds on water production relations through process based modeling growers and their advisors can achieve improved farm outcomes by better informed water application decisions keywords decision agriculture water production function crop model viticulture irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction for digital agriculture to support on farm decision making cause and effect relationships are required to be expressed mathematically no more important relationship exists in the context of irrigated agriculture than the relationship between water application and yield this relationship both enables improved water use efficiency a global priority given expected increases in water scarcity and demand mancosu et al 2015 and represents one of the primary controls to enable prediction of end of season outcomes yet whilst these relationships have been investigated extensively through field trials representing specific contexts with few exceptions there have been limited attempts at generalizing these relationships to new environments where for example different climate and management strategies exist to make effective decisions regarding efficient water application a rigorous understanding of how crops respond to water limitation or stress is essential such an understanding is often encapsulated via crop water production functions or relations which express mathematically the response of a crop to irrigation applied over the growing season in terms of end of season yield helweg 1991 crop water production relations have been used extensively as decision support tools across the agriculture domain serving as a basis for predicting and sometimes optimizing likely crop yield for different irrigation scenarios and for identifying irrigation requirements e g brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 schütze and schmitz 2010 garcía vila and fereres 2012 linker et al 2016 they are also commonly employed within socio econometric analyses e g cai et al 2008 maneta et al 2009 dozier et al 2017 we refer the reader to foster and brozović 2018 for a review of crop water production relations traditionally crop water production relations are derived empirically from field experiments hexem and heady 1978 vaux and pruitt 1983 experimental derivation of this relation requires an extensive dataset that spans both multiple growing seasons to sample the influence of environmental factors such as inter annual rainfall variability as well as irrigation treatments to sample the influence of decisions such as irrigation timing zhang and oweis 1999 geerts and raes 2009 as such the time and cost investment associated with this approach is significant in addition experimentally derived water production relations are not considered to be geographically portable meaning that generalization between different field sites and cultivars is problematic clumpner and solomon 1987 brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 there is increasing interest in complementing empirically rich datasets obtained from controlled field experiments with the capacity to generalize across application contexts using process based crop modeling geerts and raes 2009 dejonge et al 2012 cuddington et al 2013 saseendran et al 2015 knowling et al 2021 in particular process based crop models can be used to characterize water production relations this involves simulation of crop growth and development typically at a daily time resolution under different irrigation scenarios that induce different severity and or timing of water stress these models are particularly powerful in that they are designed to account for the effects of myriad factors on water production relations including genetic environmental and management g x e x m factors despite their significant potential crop models have seldom been used to derive water production relations while accounting for the effect of management decisions and uncertain e g environmental factors an exception includes the study of foster and brozović 2018 who simulated water production relations that account for the effect of irrigation timing decisions and climate factors for maize using aquacrop steduto et al 2009 foster et al 2017 however to date crop models have not been applied to simulate water production relations for crops that are more complex in their formation of yield components and their sensitivity to stress factors including woody perennial crops such as fruit trees and grapevines laurent et al 2021 while this reflects the fact that more sophisticated models are required to adequately simulate the complex behavior of these crops moriondo et al 2015 existing crop models are capable of mapping water application decisions to grapevine yield knowling et al 2021 to address this gap this study addresses evaluates water production relations for grapevines while accounting for the effect of management decisions as well as genetic and environmental factors through process based modeling we focus on viticulture because the relationship between water application and yield is a key factor determining vineyard performance in many regions miras avalos and araujo 2021 while noting that grape composition at harvest also represents an important vineyard performance

their dependence on genetic and environmental factors as well as within season decisions a viticulture case study with several properties is required including significant irrigation application and high volume production such that the focus is on yield rather than grape quality attributes our case study a 0 94 hectare ha vineyard block part of a vineyard located in loxton within the riverland

methodology this study conducts a series of numerical experiments to evaluate grapevine water production relations and their determining factors using a process based crop model the process based crop model employed herein is specifically designed to simulate grapevine growth and development section 3 1 through application of the model to a real world vineyard case study section 3 2 we first evaluate the crop model s ability to reasonably simulate key variables that underpin water production relations and their sensitivity to different irrigation scenarios section 3 3 following model evaluation numerical experiments are undertaken to simulate grapevine water production relations for the case study section 3 4 and quantify the extent to which these relations depend on uncertain factors and irrigation timing sections 3 5 and 3 6 3 1 process based crop model following a recent review of process based crop models for simulating grapevine growth and development in the context of decision support by knowling et al 2021 vinelogic walker et al 2005 2020a 2020b 2020c was chosen for its relatively detailed representation of soil water dynamics and the influence of water deficit on grapevine growth including berry development vinelogic was recently made open source which enhances reproducibility and further comparative studies 3 1 1 overview of vinelogic vinelogic simulates on a daily basis state and flux variables associated with the following key processes across the soil water atmosphere continuum fig 1 soil water dynamics thermal time used to control phenological transitions light interception biomass accumulation i e carbon assimilation and partitioning to different organs leaf shoot fruit and root depending on phenological stage six grapevine phenological stage transitions are simulated dormancy to bud burst bud burst to start of flowering start of flowering to fruit set fruit set to veraison veraison to harvest and harvest to leaf fall vinelogic simulates the effect of several stress factors including water deficit discussed below temperature salinity nutrient and aeration on grapevine growth and development input variables requiring specification in vinelogic can be categorized as forcing variables static parameters and decision levers knowling et al 2021 forcing variables include daily climate weather variables such as solar radiation minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall climate weather data are required not only for the growing season under investigation but also the penultimate growing season to account for important factors affecting fruitfulness clingeleffer 2010 guilpart et al 2014 static parameters include cultivar variables such as genetic coefficients responsible for biomass partitioning and thermal time thresholds rootstock variables such as vigor and aeration sensitivity indices soil variables as a function of depth such as moisture content at the start of the season and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity hydrology variables such as depth to water table and vineyard attributes such as row and inter vine spacing and trellis height decision levers include those relating to irrigation and canopy management practices daily irrigation rates can be specified by directly inputting a time series of irrigation rates or be simulated based on simulated soil moisture deficit and deficit related irrigation rules e g steduto et al 2009 comas et al 2019 canopy management e g trimming can be specified by reducing the leaf area index lai state variable when it reaches a threshold e g 2 0 m2 m2 by some extent e g 0 5 m2 m2 vinelogic simulates the effect of water deficit caused by rainfall or irrigation shortfall through water stress indices fig 1 water stress indices are model output quantities normalized between zero and unity that are used to represent the plant water status e g plant water potential these water stress indices serve to limit the predicted rate of growth in various grapevine organs including fruit by reducing the simulated available carbon assimilate store biomass pool via two means fig 1 i reducing the canopy area and therefore the amount of light intercepted and ii reducing the photosynthetic activity and therefore the amount of carbon assimilate produced by light interception simulated canopy area and photosynthetic activity are also a function of climate and weather variables water stress indices are computed based on simulated rates of root water uptake and potential vine transpiration smith et al 1997 shaw and meyer 2015 simulated root water uptake rate is a function of simulated soil moisture content and a soil hospitality index representing factors affecting root growth such as ph nutrient availability etc apart from soil physical characteristics soil moisture content is a function of rainfall and irrigation rates which affect soil moisture directly as well as other climate weather variables e g temperature solar radiation that indirectly affect soil moisture through altered vine water demands fig 1 vinelogic can simulate potential evapotranspiration by different means depending on daily weather data availability for example if wind run and dew point temperature data are available a modified penman monteith procedure can be used which has been found to be the most useful model for most though not all situations valipour 2017 however if only solar radiation and maximum and minimum temperature are available as is the case here the priestly taylor procedure is suitable ritchie 1985 here potential vine transpiration rate is simulated as a function of potential evapotranspiration via the priestly taylor method and simulated lai knowling et al under review it should be noted that vinelogic may be less reliable when simulating the impact of extreme water stress conditions on grapevine growth and development e g to the point of non production 3 1 2 representation of seasonal irrigation and yield vinelogic simulates irrigation rate and fruit weight on a daily basis to derive water production relations these variables need to be aggregated in time to produce total seasonal irrigation and end of season yield total seasonal irrigation q total is given by 1 q total bb lf q i dt where q i is the irrigation rate for day i and bb and lf are the day indices of bud burst initiation and leaf fall initiation respectively both of which are controlled by simulated thermal time fig 1 q total is integrated only over the period between bud burst and leaf fall because water balance components including irrigation are not simulated during dormancy end of season yield y is given by 2 y fs h p i dw i fdt where dw i is the simulated change monotonic increase in total crop dry mass including fruit shoot leaf plus stem and root for day i p i is the proportion of dry mass partitioned to fruit for day i f is the dry to fresh weight conversion factor 4 garcia de cortazar atauri et al 2009 fs is the day index at which fruit set is initiated which is controlled by simulated thermal time and h is the day index at which harvest is initiated which occurs when simulated fruit sugar concentrations in brix reach a desired threshold critbrix table 3 3 2 parameterization of baseline model the first step to addressing the study objectives is to apply vinelogic to the case study conditions section 2 this involves specifying model forcing variables static parameters and decision levers such that they reflect the main attributes of the vineyard e g grape variety soil type observation data e g climate weather data and typical management practices e g frequent irrigation application mechanical pruning and trimming that collectively reflect case study conditions we refer to this as the baseline model and it serves as a basis for subsequently comparing the outcome of different hypothetical irrigation scenarios and irrigation perturbations 3 2 1 forcing variables daily climate weather data from a weather station located 100 m from the vineyard loxton research centre station 024024 bureau of meteorology 2021 are used to force the baseline model climate weather data spanning the 2020 21 and 2019 20 growing seasons are used for the baseline model 3 2 2 static parameters table 2 lists model static parameters specified for the baseline model parameter values and bounds are specified in accordance with available site specific data and viticultural expert knowledge 3 2 3 decision levers we simulate daily irrigation rates using the soil moisture deficit approach section 3 1 this is appropriate since actual daily irrigation data are not available for our case study table 3 lists irrigation related decision levers specified for the baseline model these decision levers are specified to give rise to total seasonal irrigation and irrigation frequencies that are typical in the case study region 3 3 methodology for baseline model evaluation before simulating grapevine water production relations we evaluate the baseline model growing season 2020 21 in terms of its ability to appropriately simulate key state and flux variables that underpin water production relations such an evaluation is necessary because water production relations are time integrated in nature and therefore consideration of intermediate vineyard state and flux variables particularly those that are observable in the field allows for determination of whether water production relations are being appropriately simulated i e the right answers for the right reasons kirchner 2006 simulated state and flux variables that are involved in mapping irrigation decisions to yield and evaluated herein are as follows irrigation mm day soil moisture cm3 cm3 water stress index dimensionless lai m2 m2 available carbohydrates carbpool g and carbohydrate demand for fruit development fruitsink g how these intermediate variables respond to a varying degree of water deficit due to changes in irrigation is also assessed this is achieved by comparing these variables from the baseline model with a reduced irrigation model which represents a hypothetical reduced irrigation scenario decision levers for the reduced irrigation model are specified such that q total is approximately 40 lower than the baseline model table 3 the model is also evaluated in terms of how well simulated values from the baseline model correspond to available data while actual irrigation data are not available for the case study vineyard average seasonal irrigation volumes for the region 7 6 ml ha wheeler et al 2022 are used to ensure the model is simulating appropriately in a first order sense irrigation actual yield data are also not available for the case study vineyard we therefore compare simulated yield values to averages from the region for vineyards of red varietals 23 tonnes ha wheeler et al 2022 3 4 numerical experiments for simulating water production relations the simulation of water production relations for the case study vineyard involves numerical experiments within vinelogic whereby q total and y are simulated under a series of irrigation perturbations simulated water production relations are expressed in absolute i e y as a function of q total and relative terms i e change in y as a function of change in q total 3 4 1 absolute water production relations to simulate y as a function of q total requires that q total be perturbed and the associated y for each q total be recorded the resulting set of q total y pairs can be used to plot water production relations in this study we perturb q total by adjusting trig swt section 3 2 3 perturbations of trig swt ranged from 10 to 90 ignoring extreme conditions at 1 increments table 3 this generates 80 model evaluations per water production relation other decision levers associated with irrigation simulation such as soil deficit re fill percentage were held constant 3 4 2 relative water production relations we also express water production relations in a relative sense expressing water production relation in a relative sense facilitates an understanding of the return per unit of water applied e g tonnes of yield per ml we quantify changes in y with respect to changes in q total i e the derivative dy dq total the change in q total and y is computed between successive perturbations that is 3 dy dq total i y i 1 y i q i 1 total q i total where i is the perturbation index associated with trig swt values e g the 1st 2nd and 3rd perturbations correspond to trig swt values of 10 11 and 12 3 5 influence of genetic and environmental factors since q total and y are both sensitive to climate weather forcing variables and static model parameters representing genetic and environmental factors simulated water production relations are expected to display uncertainty zhang et al 2020 here we express uncertainty associated with both climate weather variables and static parameters and quantify their influence on simulated water production relations to quantify the uncertainty associated with water production relations attributable to static parameters we employ monte carlo simulation this involves propagating samples of static parameters through vinelogic to produce samples of quantities of interest including q total y and dy dq total gaussian probability distributions are assumed for static parameters with ranges given in table 2 representing approximately 95 confidence intervals these parameter distributions represent an unconditional a priori uncertainty stance parameters are also assumed to be uncorrelated an ensemble containing 20 samples or realizations is drawn using the pest suite white et al 2020a 2020b each realization is propagated through vinelogic using pest and its built in parallel run manager white et al 2020a 2020b to explore the uncertainty associated with water production relations attributable to climate weather variables we simulate water production relations for different years with substantial differences in total rainfall occurring during the growing season specifically we consider the growing seasons 2011 12 and 2015 16 in addition to the baseline 2020 21 season with rainfall during the growing season october march inclusive of 198 103 and 83 mm respectively 3 6 influence of irrigation timing irrigation timing is also expected to influence water production relations shani et al 2004 foster and brozović 2018 this is because q total is non unique i e different irrigation schedules can give rise to equal q total values and y depends on both the severity and timing of water stress saseendran et al 2015 jha et al 2018 to quantify the influence of within season irrigation timing on water production relations trig swt is perturbed for each phenological stage individually excluding harvest to leaf fall stage due to insensitivity of current season yield to post harvest changes in irrigation perturbations are again conducted from 10 to 90 however at increments of 10 because resolution beyond this is excessive in terms of characterizing water production relations perturbations are applied to each individual phenological stage while maintaining trig swt for other stages at each of the perturbation levels this gives rise to a total of 6561 94 model evaluations for each water production relation for each realization of genetic and environmental model parameters and for each growing season 4 results 4 1 model evaluation simulated state and flux variables display physically reasonable values as well as variability in time fig 2 first consider the baseline model trig swt 50 simulated irrigation occurs only when necessary to maintain soil moisture levels as expected for example the relatively low irrigation during november is due to significant rainfall during this period causing increased soil moisture simulated irrigation rates and total seasonal irrigation of 7 6 ml ha reflect what is typical irrigation practice in the case study vineyard and in the region more generally section 3 3 soil moisture varies within a relatively consistent range largely due to frequent daily irrigation application to reduce or maintain soil moisture deficit while also responding strongly to large rainfall events as expected the water stress index is strongly related inversely to the simulated soil moisture simulated lai displays a familiar evolution over the course of the season with distinct periods of canopy growth stabilization and senescence as well as the influence of canopy management mechanical trimming is simulated by instantaneously lowering lai when a specified threshold is encountered the available store of carbon assimilate carbpool generally exceeds its demand for fruit development until mid january after which carbohydrate demand for fruit development fruitsink exceeds supply causing depletion this is followed by a period of carbon accumulation for subsequent seasons once canopy and fruit mass accumulation have ceased and prior to leaf fall the simulated yield is in agreement with the average yield across the region 23 tonnes ha state and flux variables display substantial differences between the baseline trig swt 50 and reduced irrigation model trig swt 80 an expected divergence between the two simulated irrigation time series is apparent throughout the season with considerably more irrigation events for the baseline model this causes simulated soil moisture from the reduced irrigation model to be less than that of the baseline model throughout the season except in response to high rainfall events for the reduced irrigation model canopy growth rate is similar to the baseline model until october when it begins to lag due to water stress effects on vegetative growth the smaller canopy for the reduced irrigation model causes a considerable reduction in carbohydrate accumulation before berry development accelerates in mid january as a result the demand for carbohydrates exceeds the carbohydrate pool in the early stages of veraison this results in a considerable portion of the remaining demand for berry development to be unsatisfied ultimately serving to reduce yield in the reduced irrigation model the accumulation rate of carbohydrate reserves is also compromised compared to the baseline model potentially effecting subsequent growing seasons 4 2 simulated water production relations 4 2 1 absolute water production relations simulated water production relations display consistent attributes across the different growing seasons fig 3 approximately linear increases in y with respect to q total are apparent up to the point at which water demand for fruit development is satisfied where a maximum y value y max is encountered at a threshold q total value q y max total y displays insensitivity to q total increases above q y max total this insensitivity does not necessarily reflect an absence of water deficit but more specifically that fruit development is not being limited by water deficit that is caused by a shortfall in irrigation i e the available carbohydrate store is able to meet demand for fruit development simulated water production relations for all seasons converge on an approximately equal y max value 22 9 tonnes ha this is because zero water stress occurs where q total is sufficiently large meaning that the difference in y max is only a function of carbohydrate demand for fruit development driven by thermal time during fruit set and veraison which is similar between the three seasons moreover y values of between 4 and 7 tonnes ha are apparent with zero q total i e rainfall only despite relatively high water stress occurring during periods of vegetative growth and fruit development the q y max total ranges between 4 and 5 ml ha the only considerable difference in water production relations between seasons is the vertical offset in the sensitive portion of the relations with the y for the 2011 12 season being on average approximately 3 tonnes ha larger than that for the 2020 21 and 2015 16 seasons this reflects the substantially higher rainfall during the 2011 12 season section 3 5 it should be noted that q total and y values that are typical of the case study region are within the neighborhood of insensitivity while this suggests non productive water application e g losses to evaporation soil drainage the influence of genetic and environmental factors and irrigation timing also need to be accounted for to explore this in a more rigorous fashion sections 4 3 and 4 4 4 2 2 relative water production relations when expressing water production relations in relative terms section 3 4 a greater level of consistency is apparent between growing seasons as more systematic differences when expressing relations in absolute terms are no longer evident fig 4 over the sensitive portion of the relation dy dq total values range between approximately 1 6 tonnes ml with a mean of approximately 3 tonnes ml in other words for every 1 ml ha change in q total a change in y of 3 tonnes ha is expected on average providing q total is below q y max total 4 3 influence of genetic and environmental factors genetic and environmental factors table 2 display a substantial influence on water production relations in an absolute sense as evidenced by systematic differences between realizations fig 5 for example a q total of 4 ml ha may be expected to produce a y between 13 and 18 tonnes ha for seasons 2015 16 and 2020 21 and 14 20 tonnes ha for season 2011 2012 y max and q y max total also display substantial uncertainty ranging between 14 and 27 tonnes ha and 4 7 ml ha respectively across all seasons the uncertainty about absolute simulated water production relations arises due to the sensitivity of both q total and y to static model parameters representing factors such as soil hydraulic properties and conditions e g soil conductivity and moisture at start of growing season and genetic coefficients e g controlling water demand of different organs at specific times the ensemble of model realizations encompasses expected q total and y values for the case study section 3 2 this further corroborates the model and its suitability to evaluate water production relations however expected q total and y values for the case study remain within the neighborhood of insensitivity further suggesting the possibility of non productive water application practices fig 6 shows how water production relations expressed in relative terms are influenced by genetic and environmental factors as well as non linearity in the relation a larger variance in dy dq total values is apparent compared to that when accounting for non linearity from a deterministic stance despite small sample size of deterministic dy dq total values fig 4 this suggests that genetic and environmental factors influence relative water production relations with uncertainty in dy dq total values due to its sensitivity to e g static model parameters that govern water use efficiency such as soil hydraulic conductivity however the influence of genetic and environmental factors appears to be reduced when expressing water production relations in relative i e the slope of absolute relation as opposed to absolute terms for example when applying 3 ml ha irrigation for season 2020 21 y ranges from 8 5 to 14 tonnes ha depending on genetic and environmental factors whereas dy dq total ranges from 2 5 to 5 tonnes ml again there is consistency between seasons further suggesting generalizability of water production relations it should be noted that dy dq total values presented here are strongly influenced by insensitivity at low and high q total values this reflects the whole of season nature of water production relations as well as that perturbations to irrigation decision levers operate over the entire season a higher temporal resolution is considered below 4 4 influence of irrigation timing water production relations display sensitivity to phenological stage i e the growth stage in which a perturbation to irrigation is being applied fig 7 there exists significant overlap between dy dq total distributions for individual phenological stages meaning that reliable ranking of these stages in terms of their water productivity is not straightforward and needs to account for uncertainty dy dq total values are generally similar between flowering and veraison e g the mean of dy dq total value across all three seasons for phenological stages flowering to fruit set and fruit set to veraison is 3 1 and 2 9 tonnes ml respectively however considerably smaller dy dq total values are apparent between bud burst and flowering e g mean dy dq total of 2 3 tonnes ha whereas considerably larger dy dq total values are apparent between veraison and harvest e g mean dy dq total values of 3 5 tonnes ha as well as a significant portion of the distribution exceeding 5 tonnes ml this generally indicates that the sensitivity of production to changes in water application is greater later in the growing season overall the mean and variance of dy dq total values for individual phenological stages display consistency between different growing seasons supporting the notion that the influence of irrigation timing on water production relations between seasons can be generalized to some degree 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of case study findings with previous literature our analysis reveals several findings that align with viticulture literature as summarized briefly as follows water production relations display a largely linear form up to a threshold where yield is insensitive to water deficit for example tyerman 2015 found linearity in the relationship between irrigation and yield based on water treatment trials on a chardonnay vineyard on ramsey rootstocks located in the riverland region of south australia the region in which our case study is based other examples displaying linear dependence between yield and water application include stevens et al 1995 and githui and goodwin 2020 relative water productivity values of approximately 3 tonnes ml for example stevens et al 2010 found a dy dq total value of 3 2 tonnes ml for shiraz vines grafted to various rootstocks also within the riverland region similar values have been also reported for a range of cultivars for other regions around the world e g payan et al 2011 a non trivial dependency of water production sensitivity on phenological stage while some works report generally similar water productivity across phenological stages e g williams 2010 williams et al 2010 others demonstrate the differences in water production relations between these stages for example water deficit on berry growth and yield between veraison and harvest has been reported to be comparatively relatively high due to cell expansion and lack of berry transpired water replenishment mccarthy 1997 mccarthy et al 2002 several findings however are considered to be either somewhat in contrast to previous literature or previously unreported for example keller et al 2006 did not report a lower sensitivity of grape berry volume to water application for the period between flowering and veraison compared to veraison to harvest despite the lower water demand for berry growth between flowering and veraison sebastian et al 2015 it is suggested that this finding be further investigated it is also recommended that future work consider introducing simulation of water deficit effects on berry growth beyond those taking place through carbohydrate supply demand fig 1 as well as field data trials be designed to corroborate or otherwise findings through the coordination of field and modeling efforts 5 2 implications and recommendations for future work 5 2 1 utility of water production relations for irrigation decisions this study provides a useful benchmark for better understanding the cause and effect of water application decisions in terms of vineyard yield examples are discussed in the following subsections a better understanding of water production relations ultimately enables improved water management decision making insights regarding water production relations for grapevines reported herein should complement heuristic approaches based on experience often adopted by growers to make operational water decisions in the face of uncertainty us department of agriculture 2013 dayde et al 2014 how generalized water production relations provide actionable information and create value will inevitably vary from grower to grower rossi et al 2014 zhai et al 2020 our case study findings are expected to be of particular relevance to grape growers in high production regions where cost of water is an issue and or if subject to water restrictions during a drought such regions include the san joaquin valley usa riverland australia castilla la mancha spain and languedoc roussillon france in these regions water production relations capture the key drivers of a grower s bottom line revenue is determined primarily by yield and cost is determined primarily by variable water costs e g purchase from market delivery while yield is often considered an indicator of crop value in these regions fruit composition attributes that can impact product e g wine quality such as sugar and anthocyanin concentrations also constitute production constraints it is suggested that the complex trade off between fruit quantity and quality attributes and their respective responses to water deficit guilpart et al 2014 poni et al 2018 gambetta et al 2020 should be factored into future process based modeling studies that aim to evaluate water production relations in viticulture knowling et al 2021 5 2 2 generalizability of water production relations water production relations are shown to display some level of generalizability with respect to several factors for example generalizability of water production relations is apparent especially when expressed in relative terms between three different growing seasons of highly variable seasonal rainfall totals across genetic and environmental factors and across irrigation timing decisions while the demonstrated potential for generalization of water production relations in some cases is a promising result the extent to which generalizability exists for other more diverse cultivars e g gibberd et al 2001 and climates requires further investigation through process based modeling generalizability to other horticultural and perennial crops also remains an open question and warrants investigation more generally the complementary role that process based modeling can play to help generalize empirically rich datasets obtained from controlled field experiments geerts and raes 2009 jones et al 2017 knowling et al 2021 5 2 3 influence of genetic and environmental factors genetic and environmental factors such as climate weather variables and model parameters relating to cultivar and soil properties are shown to have a substantial influence on water production relations when expressed in absolute terms for example the yield displays a range of 13 18 tonnes ha for a given total irrigation volume of 4 ml ha for the case study considered such a level of uncertainty in end of season yield is considered to be significant and would likely not be of much utility in terms of informing irrigation decisions the high variance in yield obtained for our case study perhaps also reflects that a priori parameter distributions require refinement table 2 expressing uncertainty associated with water production relations is nevertheless important to enhance robustness and avoid over confidence doherty and simmons 2013 knowling et al 2019 notwithstanding the added need to consider probabilities while it is an important finding that genetic and environmental factors play an important role in characterizing absolute water production relations the contribution of individual factors remains unknown it is therefore recommended that future work identify critical genetic and environmental factors through approaches such as global sensitivity analyses saltelli et al 2008 by doing so future data collection efforts can also be designed in a more targeted manner to benefit decision making i e discriminatory data ferré 2017 water production relations when expressed in relative terms display less sensitivity to genetic and environmental factors for example the derivative of yield with respect to total irrigation varies by approximately 2 tonnes ml on average e g 2 4 tonnes ml with some of that variability attributable to non linearity in water production relations rather than the influence of genetic and environmental factors whereas yield itself varies by approximately 5 tonnes ha on average for a given water application volume e g e g 13 18 tonnes ha when applying 4 ml this suggests that the statistical moments of water production relations are characterized by static model parameters that are fixed or model structural aspects i e governing equations similar results in terms of a dampened influence of uncertainty on relative model outputs have been found in other fields such as hydrology e g knowling et al 2020 white et al 2020a 2020b this finding indicates that water production relations when expressed in relative terms are more robust constituting an important finding since growers and their advisors are often interested in relative quantities such as return on water per megalitre chalmers 2012 edwards and clingeleffer 2013 skewes and meissner 2015 5 2 4 influence of irrigation timing water production relations are also shown to be sensitive to within season irrigation timing decisions for example the derivative of yield with respect to total irrigation is on average 2 3 tonnes ml prior to flowering compared to 3 0 tonnes ml between flowering and veraison and 3 5 tonnes ml between veraison and harvest despite overlap between the distributions of sensitivity between phenological stages these aggregated outputs suggest that greater production sensitivity to water application occurs during the latter stages of the growing season when berry development is the primary system sink which is consistent with several reports in the literature section 5 1 such insights pertaining to production per unit of water applied during each growth stage are expected to be of particular utility to a grower e g chalmers 2012 skewes and meissner 2015 this is because insights pertaining to an individual growth stage timescale strike a practical balance between daily and whole of season insights water productivity insights when perturbing irrigation across whole season are of low utility given their coarseness i e zero resolution within growing season whereas daily insights are too detailed to allow for generalizability between seasons etc 5 2 5 beyond within season dynamics while water production relations operate on a seasonal timescale basis it is important to understand the effect of irrigation decisions on outcomes from not only the current growing season but also subsequent growing seasons inter seasonal dynamics are particularly important for grapevines this is because one of the main yield components bunch number is formed during the penultimate season clingeleffer 2001 2010 and displays more complicated responses to water stress guilpart et al 2014 pagay and collins 2017 inter seasonal dynamics are also important because of the potential for water deficits between harvest and leaf fall to reduce carbohydrate reserves and therefore productivity in the following season pellegrino et al 2014 future studies should employ process based models to investigate the effect of inter seasonal factors on water production relations in grapevines as well as other perennial crops to account for productivity trade offs between seasons we note however that such an investigation may require extension of process based model capabilities 5 2 6 opportunities for optimization of irrigation strategies this study serves as an enabler of formal optimization of vineyard irrigation decisions formal optimization of seasonal irrigation volumes and or daily schedules can be achieved using water production relations as an objective function gradient as demonstrated extensively for other crops e g zhang and oweis 1999 shang and mao 2006 schütze and schmitz 2010 garcía vila and fereres 2012 linker et al 2016 linker and sylaios 2016 foster and brozović 2018 li et al 2018a 2018b mwiya et al 2020 by putting meaningful bounds on water production relations and their important attributes e g the total irrigation at which maximum yield is realized a range of optimal irrigation scenarios can also be established we recommend that future work realize this opportunity 6 conclusions this paper evaluates water production relations for grapevines as well as their sensitivity to genetic and environmental factors and irrigation timing decisions by conducting numerical experiments these experiments are undertaken using a process based model specifically designed to simulate grapevine growth and development a commercial vineyard case study in south australia is considered simulated water production relations for grapevines are shown to display largely consistent characteristics across different growing seasons this is despite the significant uncertainty associated with water production relations when expressed in absolute terms i e yield as a function of water applied posing a challenge to water management decision making however when considering water production relations in relative terms i e change in yield with respect to changes in water applied the influence of genetic and environmental factors is reduced allowing for more robust insights for example across the three growing seasons considered it is shown that for every 1 ml ha change in water application the mean change in yield is approximately 3 tonnes ha with variability in sensitivity e g up to 8 tonnes ml arising due to water production non linearity genetic and environmental factors and irrigation timing the greatest sensitivity in production to water applied occurred during veraison e g mean of 3 5 tonnes ml whereas the least sensitivity occurred prior to flowering e g mean of 2 3 tonnes ml this study enables the viticulture industry to better realize the potential of digital agriculture to support on farm water management decisions by addressing the sole reliance on empirical field data to derive water production relations our viticulture case study findings provide a useful benchmark for improved understanding of the likely return on water application decisions in terms of vineyard productivity such an enhanced understanding of the cause and effect of water application decisions in terms of production will ultimately enable improved water management decisions this study also highlights the potential for process based models to establish generalized cause and effect relations that account for a wide range of factors that cannot practically be achieved via other means these generalized cause and effect relationships are likely to play an important role in ensuring that digital agriculture leads to better on farm decisions through for example their adoption within easy to use decision support tools to undertake what if scenario

9042,agriculture is the world s largest consumer of freshwater resources particularly in semi arid regions where crop production is reliant on both irrigation and rainfall therefore proper irrigation management is critical in achieving sustainable agriculture by increasing crop yield while conserving water resources remote sensing has demonstrated a great promise in monitoring crop status including crop water status based on the spectral vegetation index vi therefore the vegetation growth normalized difference vegetation index ndvi vegetation water status shortwave crop reflectance index scri and vegetation drought stress moisture stress index msi indices were calculated to assess the impact of irrigation management on canopy water status in a cluster of winter wheat fields in a semi arid area in three non consecutive growing seasons with different seasonal rainfall amounts and distributions the winter wheat fields were typically irrigated six times in each growing season according to a fixed phenological based irrigation scheduling results showed that ndvi scri and msi had a high correlation with the remotely sensed locally calibrated leaf area index lai among which ndvi had the strongest correlation r 0 9 the analysis revealed that the combined use of vis succeeded in detecting spatial and temporal crop drought stress levels during the growing seasons furthermore the normalized difference water index ndwi was interpreted to quantitatively classify the level and extent of drought stress in the winter wheat fields the results of the ndwi analysis revealed that 62 100 and 72 of the irrigated winter wheat fields have experienced some levels of drought stress during the normal growing season with wet spring normal growing season with wet autumn and dry growing season respectively the drought stress was basically due to the lack of effective rainfall during spring in march and april when crops have the highest vegetative growth irrespective of the rainfall amount during autumn and winter this revealed the importance of timely irrigation management during spring time in addition paired anomaly analysis of the ndvi msi and scri with the wheat grain yields could identify good and poor wheat fields and recognize proper management zones of the wheat fields in terms of potential grain production the findings of this study demonstrated that remote sensing is a strong and reliable tool in irrigation management to help sustain food production in arid or semi arid areas with limited water resources keywords irrigation management drought stress anomaly analysis spectral vegetation indices wheat grain yield leaf area index data availability all data used during the study appear in the article 1 introduction water is the crucial component in agricultural productivity and food production globally 70 of freshwater withdrawals are used in agriculture foley et al 2011 water shortages are however becoming more widespread due to global population expansion and climate change induced increases in crop water requirements choi et al 2012 thus on farm irrigation management and water resource conservation are essential particularly in areas where irrigation management significantly impacts crop productivity farid et al 2022 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 drought stress has a significant impact on both irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems even mild drought stress especially during critical phenological growth stages may reduce crop growth and yield fahad et al 2017 accurate irrigation planning and management apply an exact amount of water at the right time to meet crop water demands proper and timely irrigation management supports crop production saves water and protects the environment burton 2010 however because of 1 phenological and growth stage based crop water requirement 2 water resource limitations 3 labor availability 4 limited access to technical equipment 5 difficulties in frequent measurement of soil and crop water status and 6 capacity of the water delivery system the farm managers or farmers may adopt and follow a fixed irrigation schedule however since part of the crop water requirement in the semi arid regions is supplied by effective rainfall a fixed irrigation schedule and management fixed irrigation days and amounts may fail to address the required crop water requirement due to inter annual variations in rainfall and atmospheric demand monitoring irrigation management over several years can therefore help to improve water management and irrigation planning for efficient water use and sustainable crop production kharrou et al 2021 timely and precise estimation of canopy water status has high practical importance for monitoring the vegetation growth status and predicting crop yield as canopy water status is one of the main controlling factors of photosynthesis and biomass jones and tardieu 1998 datt 1999 große stoltenberg et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 since introducing the concept of vegetation index vi in 1969 jordan 1969 diverse spectral vis have been developed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of crop growth status bannari et al 1995 anderegg et al 2020 ferchichi et al 2022 in this approach the vegetation status could be easily and effectively assessed by measuring the vegetation reflectance in visible to near infrared wavelengths hunt et al 2016 remotely sensed data could be used to calculate the vis of vegetation water status on the ground chen et al 2016 kumar et al 2022 the vis have been used for several purposes including but not limited to yield prediction hunt et al 2019 drought monitoring and assessment west et al 2019 mapping crop evapotranspiration consoli and vanella 2014 vegetation health and water content jackson 2004 and monitoring plant drought stress thapa et al 2019 however vis would change spatially and temporally particularly in large areas therefore monitoring vis as the indicators of plant growth health and drought stress is important in irrigated agriculture and precision irrigation management qiao et al 2022 to this end remote sensing rs has facilitated the study of canopy water status which could be affected by irrigation regimes and management nilsson 1995 xue and su 2017 zhao et al 2020 sun et al 2019 the interest in monitoring and accurate retrieval of crop water status by rs has widely increased in the scientific community peñuelas et al 1997 hunt et al 2016 elsherbiny et al 2021 the reason is that rs is an easy fast inexpensive and non destructive tool for timely monitoring of crop water status before reaching a critical stress level mulla 2013 elsherbiny et al 2021 the vis differ in establishing a mathematical relationship between the different spectral wavelengths plants absorb transmit and reflect electromagnetic waves differently depending on their wavelength for example drought stressed plants reflect less near infrared nir waves than healthy plants braga et al 2021 in addition the reflectance of shortwave infrared swir is highly sensitive to water content and is widely used for estimating and assessing the vegetation and soil water content wang and qu 2007 tian and philpot 2015 zhang et al 2019 braga et al 2021 crusiol et al 2023 therefore various spectral bands and vis can provide different information about the plant s growth state and characteristics in addition the performance of the vis in tracking the effects of drought stress is different ballester et al 2019 a vi may show the impact of long term stress on plants while the other vi might be invariant to track the long term effects and show the stress immediately de jong et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhang and zhou 2015 2019 wong et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to understand better the seasonal performance of the vis in monitoring irrigation management on canopy water status and drought stress level some plant based studies have focused on examining only one vi hansen and schjoerring 2003 benincasa et al 2018 while others have used multiple vis sharifi 2020 mokhtari et al 2019 as previously reported by berger et al 2022 relying upon only a single vi may not be sufficient for a comprehensive analysis of vegetation status holzman et al 2014 some of the vis are useful in agriculture and water management as they can indicate the canopy water content and crop growth status the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is one of the most widely used vi the ndvi indicates plant health and greenness and is sensitive to changes in chlorophyll zhong et al 2019 xiaoyan et al 2020 the leaf area index lai is the ratio of plant leaf area to the occupied land area and plays an important role in characterizing the plant canopy breda 2003 lai measures the physical and structural status of the plant leaf size area number and is an ecophysiological index of plant canopy transpiration and photosynthetic surface area chen et al 1997 the shortwave crop reflectance index scri could be explicitly used to identify crop water status as it is solely derived from the swir1 and swir2 shahrokhnia and ahmadi 2019 in previous studies the scri has been used for various purposes such as tillage practices plant residue cover and soil salinity van deventer et al 1997 dehni and lounis 2012 sonmez et al 2016 the moisture stress index msi assesses water content and stress in vegetation canopy and soil davidson et al 2006 benabdelouahab et al 2015 likewise the normalized difference water index ndwi provides helpful information about plant and soil water content jackson et al 2004 benabdelouahab et al 2015 wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 although many studies have used rs for agricultural and environmental purposes hunt et al 2019 west et al 2019 jackson 2004 no study has evaluated different types of vis on irrigation water management of multiple winter wheat fields within and between growing seasons the goals of this study were to assess the impacts of irrigation water management on canopy water status in a cluster of irrigated winter wheat fields using different remotely sensed vis over three growing seasons in terms of i assessing the ability of vis to delineate crop health and drought stress at spatial and temporal scales in response to seasonal irrigation and rainfall ii simple modeling of wheat grain yield using the within season calculated vis iii developing a new vi approach for classifying wheat field areas under drought stress iv performing a paired anomaly analysis of the vis and grain yield to determine the high and low potential yield production fields the lai ndvi scri and msi were selected to evaluate crop growth and canopy water status and ndwi was employed to classify the wheat fields concerning the level of drought stress and grain yield production this analysis would enable farm managers to investigate the wheat field zones prone to poor and improper irrigation management and drought stress and determine appropriate and timely irrigation management to ensure sustainable wheat production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area soil properties and crop management this research was carried out in the agricultural fields of the school of agriculture shiraz university shiraz in the southwest of iran 29 36 n 52 32 e the mean elevation of the area is 1810 m above sea level the study area consists of 28 fields with an overall area of 400 ha fig 1 shows the location of the study area irrigation water pumps field identification numbers and the spatial locations of the studied fields supplementary table 1 shows the size of each field the climate of the study area is warm and semi arid with an average long term annual rainfall of 275 mm falling primarily between november and march table 1 displays the physical properties of the soil in the study area no studies have been conducted to provide and describe detailed data information on spatial soil heterogeneity in the study area nor the spatial map of the variations of soil physical properties for each field has been produced information on the conventional farming practices irrigation management and scheduling and grain yields of the harvested winter wheat of each field for different growing seasons were provided by the office of field management school of agriculture based on this information the pishtaz wheat cultivar was sown at a rate of 200 250 kg ha 1 at the end of october each year and harvested at the end of june of the following year variations in sowing and harvest dates depended on rainfall occurrence in autumn machinery availability and the preceding crop harvest conditions before each growing season winter wheat crops received 300 kg ha 1 of urea 46 n no3 fertilization during two broadcasting events after sowing and starting the stem elongation stage table 2 supplementary table 2 shows the final grain yields for each field during the studied growing seasons border irrigation was the dominant irrigation system to irrigate wheat fields wheat rows were 30 cm apart and the length of the borders was equal to the length of the field depending on the field size supplementary table 1 winter wheat crops are typically irrigated six times per growing season by three irrigation technicians following a fixed phenological based irrigation schedule according to official information from the office of farm management table 2 because of the limited personnel and irrigation system capacity each irrigation event took 7 10 days to irrigate all of the fields there has not been any exact order for irrigating the wheat fields in different growing seasons in addition there was no detailed record of irrigation depth and schedule for each field due to a lack of knowledge of irrigation technicians about irrigation and crop water requirement and no intention and plan to record the details of irrigation events by the office of farm management however despite the lack of such information on irrigation practices for evaluating irrigation management in the study area this study aimed to get the benefits of the vis to detect and assess the impact of irrigation management on wheat crops furthermore due to such a lack of information we did not have any observed data and records of drought events and water stress such as the time and duration of drought events 2 2 growing seasons and meteorological data wheat fields in the study area were in rotation with corn and canola as part of the cropping system over several years therefore the studied growing seasons were chosen to be as non consecutive as possible to assess irrigation management in the same fields three non consecutive wheat growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 were chosen to evaluate irrigation management over several years using the remotely sensed vis meteorological data were obtained from the weather station at the school of agriculture as shown in fig 1 fig 2 depicts cumulative rainfall average daily temperature relative humidity and penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 the 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 were normal years with mean annual rainfalls of 280 mm and 290 mm respectively during the wheat growing season in contrast 2017 2018 was a dry growing season with a mean annual rainfall of 165 mm rainfall events in 2013 2014 were delayed when compared to 2015 2016 thus the 2013 2014 growing season was normal with a wet spring the 2015 2016 growing season was normal with a wet autumn and the 2017 2018 growing season was dry 2 3 spectral vegetation indices four different vis as lai ndvi scri and msi were selected to evaluate vegetation health and canopy cover vegetation water status and vegetation drought stress therefore the vis were divided into three categories 1 vegetation growth index ndvi 2 vegetation water status index scri and 3 vegetation drought stress index msi the lai was calculated based on a locally adjusted equation table 4 and it was used as a valid reference to drive relationships and correlations with the other vis for robust spatial and temporal analysis the soil adjusted vegetation index savi introduced by bastiaanssen 1998 was used in calculating the lai table 4 the variations of the vis across fields and dates over the growing seasons were analyzed as the proxies for irrigation management performance on assessing plant growth and canopy water status of the irrigated winter wheat fields 2 4 remote sensing and satellite data the images recorded by the landsat 8 operational land imager oli were used to calculate the vis landsat 8 satellite has spatial and temporal resolutions of 30 m and 16 days respectively and is suitable for monitoring irrigation management at small and large scales xie et al 2021 bretreger et al 2020 corbari et al 2019 supplementary table 3 lists the wavelengths of the spectral bands used in calculating the vis in the study area the vegetative and reproductive winter wheat growth stages start from mid march to early june that covers stem elongation bbch code 30 until grain filling bbch code 71 table 2 since landsat 8 flies over the study area on different dates and paths path 162 row 39 path 162 row 40 and path 163 row 39 the study area could be captured in three images consequently while landsat 8 images are acquired every 16 days the image acquisition period over the study was 7 9 days table 3 satellite images were not analyzed during the autumn and winter due to minimal vegetation cover and low growth furthermore an image would have been excluded from the analysis if the clouds in the image covered the wheat fields or the cloud shadows cast the fields in total images from 18 dates 5 dates in 2013 2014 7 dates in 2015 2016 and 6 dates in 2016 2017 were analyzed the google earth engine gee https earthengine google com was used for image processing the vis of each pixel within each wheat field were calculated using the landsat 8 surface reflectance images landsat lc08 c01 t1 sr a boundary was defined for each wheat field and the gee calculated the vis of all pixels within the field boundary there were also roads and tree rows used as windbreaks between fields which would impact vis because the width of these roads and trees is less than 30 m landsat 8 spatial resolution the pixels that contained the field borders were excluded from further analyses 2 5 heat maps of lai because lai was calibrated locally based on ground observations the variations in lai help assess vegetation growth and irrigation management as a result lai heat maps were created for all wheat fields to demonstrate spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover the gis technique was used to generate heat maps of the lai for the three representative dates 2014 05 21 2016 05 28 and 2018 05 18 grain filling stage compared to the other dates in each growing season these selected dates show the greatest spatial variation of lai in one image however due to the lack of accessible information on field management practices during the three growing seasons we have assumed that variations of lai are primarily affected by irrigation though other sources of uncertainty could affect lai nevertheless according to the spatial resolution of landsat 8 images the lai of each pixel represents a pixel size of 30 m 30 m which may prorate the influence of the other field management factors on lai 2 6 ndwi based interpretation of vegetation indices the normalized difference water index ndwi is a reliable and robust remote sensing vegetation index of plant water content gao 1996 wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 romero et al 2021 the ndwi is calculated as 1 ndwi nir swir 1 nir swir 1 ndwi values help us to classify the water status of field crops and immediately recognize drought stressed areas as it is related to plant water content or drought stress conditions regardless of plant type ceccato et al 2002 chen et al 2003 gu et al 2007 2008 wang et al 2015 antognelli 2018 ji et al 2023 table 5 shows the interpreted values of ndwi proposed by antognelli 2018 and fernández poulussen et al 2021 interpreted values were divided into three classes representing the state of the plant with respect to canopy and drought stress in a field where the crops are at the same phenological stage the areas where the ndvi is lower than average could normally present vegetative development problems associated with drought stress therefore it is clear that ndwi could be correlated with ndvi because it is influenced by both vegetation health and drought stress guidotti et al 2019 so first the correlations between ndwi and the other three vis ndvi scri and msi were derived then we used the interpreted values of the ndwi to define corresponding values for the other three vis in other words interpreting ndwi values would allow us to correlate ndwi values with the other vis to interpret the values of the other vis accordingly 2 7 anomaly of the vegetation indices and grain yield we calculated the anomaly of the vis to assess the spatial and temporal variability of the vis with grain yield anomaly in wheat fields during different growing seasons calculating the vi anomaly is a simple accurate and widely used approach to monitoring changes in vi over time relative to the average over the study period in general anomaly allows us to compare the current crop conditions and yields to the averages over a certain period in this study the vis and grain yield anomalies will enable us to compare different fields agronomic crop and irrigation management in different years the vis anomalies were used for drought detection and mapping anyamba and tucker 2012 vaani and porchelvan 2017 nanzad et al 2019 a positive vi anomaly indicates that the value of the vi e g ndvi is higher than the long term average which may imply a wet year timely irrigation and proper crop growth the negative vi anomaly values demonstrate the inverse eqs 2 4 were used to calculate the anomalies of the vis in all three growing seasons from march to june the anomaly of grain yield was calculated likewise 2 vi mean i vi i 1 v i i 2 v i i n n 3 vi i 1 m vi mean i m 4 vi anomaly i n vi i n vi vi 100 where vi mean i is the average of vis in all fields in i th growing season n is the number of wheat fields in each growing season vi i n is the vegetation index of field n in i th growing season averaged over march to june vi is the overall average of all vi averages of m growing seasons m 3 and vi anomaly i n is the vegetation index anomaly of field n within m growing season 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal and spatial analysis of leaf area index fig 3 shows the heat maps of lai during the grain filling stage of the three growing seasons having in mind that the other field managements such as fertilizer management sowing dates wheat cultivars germination rate tillage herbicide application and irrigation water quality were likely similar in all fields during the growing seasons therefore spatial variations of lai in each field could mostly indicate non uniform irrigation water management for example in fields 15 18 19 and 27 c in 2013 2014 the lai varied between 3 and 5 indicating that some field zones had better vegetation growth than others in addition there was a large difference in lai among the fields implying that the irrigation management of adjacent fields 3 4 and 10 was inadequate in the adjacent fields lai varied between 1 and 5 in 2013 2014 and 0 3 in 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 fig 3 implies poor and irregular irrigation management in the wheat fields in the southern part of the region fields 3 4 and 10 irrigation management constantly remained poor throughout the three growing seasons 3 2 correlation between the spectral vegetation indices fig 4 depicts the linear correlation between lai as the ground based reference index and the other three vis over the three growing seasons lai correlated with ndvi with the correlation coefficient r ranging between 0 52 and 0 90 lai was strongly correlated with ndvi r 0 9 in 2017 2018 however the correlation between lai and ndvi decreased sharply in 2015 2016 r 0 52 lai also correlated well with scri and msi with high correlation coefficients ranging from 0 79 0 85 in 2013 2014 and 2017 2018 nonetheless the correlation coefficients for lai scri and lai msi reduced to 0 4 and 0 5 respectively in 2015 2016 the highly correlated regressions in fig 4 show that the vis can be used interchangeably with relatively high precision to track the drought stress these correlations provide comprehensive information and inferences about plant health such as plant growth water content and drought stress panda et al 2010 ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 wang et al 2019 moisa et al 2022 lai and ndvi have a higher correlation compared to scri and msi because they use the same spectral bands table 4 both ndvi and lai use the red and nir bands ndvi is sufficiently sensitive to chlorophyll which can indicate wheat plants health and growth status wu et al 2009 therefore lai showed the highest correlation with ndvi in contrast the spectral bands in lai and scri are not similar scri uses only swir1 and swir2 wavelengths table 4 that are highly sensitive to water content and are commonly used to estimate vegetation and soil water content tian and philpot 2015 zhang et al 2019 crusiol et al 2023 despite the independence of the lai and scri spectral bands a satisfactory correlation between the two vis fig 4 indicated the potential robustness in monitoring plant water status shahrokhnia and ahmadi 2019 moreover both msi and lai use nir but msi also uses swir1 the good linear correlations observed between lai and msi demonstrate the reliable application of msi in detecting drought stress in wheat fields based on the lai this finding clearly shows that the vegetation growth index lai can be accurately used and linked to assess the vegetation water stress level i e the higher lai the lower the water stress these results confirm that using the dependent and independent vis that cover a wide range of spectral bands is crucial for accurate irrigation management and precise assessing of crop water status the lower correlation in 2015 2016 compared with the other growing seasons indicates that lai did not synchronize well to ndvi scri and msi variations even though lai and ndvi have common spectral bands this finding may suggest the differences between the vis in detecting stress severity and duration short long term that have also been argued by zhang and zhou 2019 and wong et al 2022 drought related immediate changes such as plant water content and temporal changes such as physical traits are sensitive to different spectral bands magney et al 2016 berger et al 2022 in contrast to the lai and ndvi as the canopy structure indices water stress responses are generally linked to more physiological mechanisms such as stomatal closure which limits transpiration chaves et al 2009 therefore the vis that exploit the physiological responses to water stress would perform better as a proxy and an indicator of short and long term stress events garbulsky et al 2011 wong and gamon 2015 in this regard wang et al 2015 reported that canopy water content is generally an immediate response to soil water at the crop canopy level and recommended spectral bands that have short term responses to water stress however this topic of the sensitivity of the vis to short and long term abiotic stresses requires further fieldworks and ground truthing validation under different plant species and stress levels during an entire growing season hmimina et al 2015 wong et al 2022 even though previous studies used scri for plant residue cover sonmez and slater 2016 tillage methods zheng et al 2014 and soil moisture estimation yue et al 2019 fig 4 demonstrated that scri correlated well with lai showing that it could be used to track drought stress events this result is in agreement with shahrokhnia and ahmadi 2019 and faurtyot and baret 1997 who reported that swir1 and swir2 are the best wavelengths for assessing vegetation water content because they respond differently to moisture content yue et al 2019 tian and philpot 2015 in their study on wheat wang et al 2015 abuwasit et al 2008 and tian et al 2001 also recommended that the swir region is the most stable and sensitive to water stress in their measurements in different growth stages it is noteworthy that from an irrigation water management and irrigation scheduling perspective using the vis that provide near real time information on the canopy water status is critical along with short term forecasting of the atmospheric demand wong et al 2022 irrigation is typically planned in 7 10 day intervals however daily information is required for drought stress detection thus the fusion of several satellite images is essential to obtain near real time daily or latest weekly information therefore the images of landsat 8 over an irrigated area should be analyzed as shortly as possible to track the canopy water content and drought water status precisely for achieving the best results it is recommended to collect data from ground based observation of drought events and stresses time duration and level in different growth stages and correlate and synchronize them with the remotely sensed vis this information will provide a strong tool for irrigation water management and scheduling nevertheless we did not have any historical data on the water stress or drought events in this study and we thus focused on making inferences about drought stress using the vis 3 3 seasonal analysis of the spectral vegetation indices fig 5 depicts the temporal variations of vis in various fields and dates table 3 in each growing season it is observed that all vis synchronized on most of the dates however between march 25 and april 3 of 2016 the vis variations were irregular all vis except the lai showed reduced vegetation growth and canopy water content during this period during this period ndvi decreased from 0 60 to 0 53 scri reduced from 0 24 to 0 18 and msi increased from 0 61 to 0 63 in contrast the lai increased from 4 48 to 4 83 with no obvious effect of drought stress this exception in the vis discrepancy relates to plant responses to the duration and severity of drought stress wong et al 2022 berger et al 2022 mild and short term drought stress usually has minor short term effects on plants including changing the photosynthetic and transpiration fluxes but phenotypic changes such as leaf size do not occur damm et al 2018 in contrast severe and prolonged drought stress severely halts plant growth and reduces aboveground biomass and crop yields haboudane et al 2002 flexas et al 2004 because lai is related to plant structural and physical characteristics such as leaf size and number it does not show an immediate response to drought stress and usually declines sometimes after the onset of mild or prolonged drought stress gitelson et al 2014 wong et al 2022 indeed lai has a time lag in responding to drought stress and short term or transient drought stresses do not affect lai thus it could be concluded that the drought stress from march 25 to april 3 of 2016 was a short term drought that resulted in an immediate plant response such as a decrease in vegetation water content and was sensed by the vis sensitive to water content thus fig 5 shows that using vis associated with plant physical and structural traits such as lai together with vis related to physiological and hydraulic traits such as scri helps to detect and recognize short or long term drought stresses berger et al 2022 furthermore the consistency of various vis indicative of immediate long term stress effects indicates that the vis values on most dates table 4 were unaffected by previous irrigation therefore the vis are fully effective for evaluating irrigation management 3 4 ndwi based classification of the spectral vegetation indices fig 6 shows the strong correlation between ndwi and the other vis ndvi scri and msi in all growing seasons the strongest correlation was observed between ndwi and msi r 0 93 followed by ndvi r 0 91 and scri 0 84 the strong correlation between ndwi and msi is due to the common spectral bands of nir and swir1 this strong relationship has been previously reported benabdelouahab et al 2015 the strong correlation between the ndwi and other vis msi ndvi and scri is helpful for the detailed classification of the other vis attributed to the plant canopy water status fig 6 shows the three classes of ndwi values based on table 5 the regression lines and vertical dashed lines were used to classify the plant water status level according to the interpretations of ndwi table 6 summarizes the descriptions of the three classes attributed to each vi according to fig 6 most wheat fields were in class 2 during the three growing seasons indicating that the crops experienced some levels of drought stress in 2015 2016 however there were no fields in class 3 no drought stress and nearly all fields were in class 2 this finding means that all fields were under low to high drought stress at different times during the growing period in contrast there were no fields in class 1 in 2013 2014 furthermore the most considerable variations in the vis were observed in 2017 2018 indicating that the wheat fields experienced no drought stress to high drought stress on different dates table 6 is beneficial for the farm managers and irrigation engineers for field management and classification of crop water conditions using various vis in irrigated areas for improving irrigation water management 3 5 irrigation scheduling analysis in different growing seasons in arid and semi arid areas where fixed irrigation scheduling supplies a part of the crop water requirement erratic rainfall distribution during different growing seasons can affect crop growth and water content therefore analyzing the possible role of rainfall events on vis could help assess fixed irrigation management in different growing seasons in figs 4 and 5 vis changed differently during each growing season in fig 5 the variations in ndvi and lai during the dry growing season 2017 2018 are related to the effects of the rainfall distribution during 2017 2018 rainfall was as low as 105 mm from sowing to march 30 stem elongation table 2 which resulted in reduced plant growth mean lai 4 46 mean scri 0 2 on march 31 2018 fig 5 however 48 mm of rainfall from april 1 to april 30 end of booting stage provided part of the crop water requirement this rainfall event increased canopy water content and growth mean lai 6 20 mean scri 0 26 on april 9 2018 fig 5 although in 2013 2014 with wet spring and in 2015 2016 with wet autumn the cumulative rainfall was nearly the same fig 2 the lai ndvi msi and scri in 2013 2014 exhibited higher values than in 2015 2016 figs 4 and 5 rainfall totaled 58 mm and 34 mm in march and april stem elongation and booting stages of 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively fig 2 however 34 mm of rainfall had no positive effect on vegetation growth or water content due to low effective rainfall fig 2 in this regard solgi et al 2022 evaluated soil moisture content in wheat fields under different climatic scenarios using the calibrated and validated aquacrop model for the study region under the same irrigation management the simulated soil water content of the wheat root zone under different climatic conditions rainfall patterns is shown in fig 7 in general fig 7 illustrates how soil water content is affected by rainfall patterns under fixed irrigation management figs 7b and 7c show that the fixed irrigation scheduling could not address crop water requirements whenever spring is dry starting from late march to early april this finding highlights the impact of march and april rainfall during stem elongation and booting stages table 2 on crop growth and yield previous research in this area has shown either by field measurements or dynamic crop growth modeling that low rainfall deficit irrigation during the stem elongation stage of winter wheat reduces wheat lai and grain yield significantly mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 solgi et al 2022 the relationship between ndwi and its cumulative frequency distributions for all wheat fields in each growing season is shown in fig 8 to assess the effect of the fixed irrigation management on vegetation cover and water content under different growing seasons according to table 5 2017 2018 was the only growing season that ndwi varied among class 1 and class 3 such that 5 and 28 of ndwi values are observed in classes 1 and 3 respectively in 2013 2014 there was no ndwi value in class 1 but 38 of ndwi values were in class 3 however in 2015 2016 ndwi values were only allocated in class 2 these findings indicate that 62 100 and 72 of irrigated winter wheat fields were subjected to drought stress during 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 respectively this result suggests that the fixed irrigation management was ineffective in improving crop growth and canopy water content especially during dry springs fig 2 therefore irrespective of the rainfall amount in the autumn and winter more frequent irrigation events should be applied to address crop water requirement during the sensitive growth stages in spring in this regard irrigation scheduling should be adjusted based on rainfall patterns thus it is necessary to monitor soil water content and provide adequate irrigation in situations where rainfall may occur but is insufficient fig 7 in conclusion although monitoring soil water content dynamics helps in better assessment of irrigation planning multispectral satellite remote sensing vis is an immediate and cost effective way to assess plant growth and canopy water content under diverse irrigation managements despite the lack and limitation of detailed information on irrigation scheduling in this study the vis demonstrated satisfactory results for evaluating and improving irrigation management in the future as a result remote sensing shall be used in future research and in the areas where a lack of detailed irrigation and water management data affects farm management in irrigated areas in the absence of historical data on irrigation events and their details the proposed vis and ndwi based classification is a useful and reliable tool for farm managers and irrigation practitioners in adapting the best irrigation management practices for maximum crop production 3 6 paired anomaly of the spectral vegetation indices and grain yields fig 9 shows the correlations between the average value of the vis of each field during a growing season and the observed grain yield it is seen that grain yield variations could be explained by the vis such that ndvi msi and scri have almost identical correlation coefficients with grain yield previous studies have also confirmed that vegetation growth and water content indices are related and positively correlated with yield chandel et al 2019 these results show that the progression of the drought stress during a growing season could have a negative contribution and impact on the final grain yield and field productivity therefore preventing drought stress at any time during the main growth stages would prevent yield loss it is required to avoid drought events during the sensitive growth stages that have detrimental effects on final grain yield davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 so as drought stress at certain growth stages e g stem elongation and flowering has a negative impact on grain yield there are some other growth stages e g grain filling and dough that drought stress might not contribute to final grain loss zhang and oweis 1999 solgi et al 2022 therefore to improve the grain yield prediction skill based on the vis it is necessary to include the vi of those growth stages in the regression analysis that impacts the final grain yield following this approach further field experiments and observations are needed of course having enough field based knowledge of the sensitive growth stages will help in the optimal irrigation scheduling of wheat zhang and oweis 1999 and implementing water saving strategies without yield loss solgi et al 2022 although many studies have found a strong relationship between lai and yield zhou et al 2017 peng et al 2019 our study found either a weak or a negative correlation between lai and grain yield because the correlations in fig 9 are calculated using mean vis in each field over a growing season the weak correlations could reflect the diversity of fields in crop growth and yield production in other words higher vegetation growth and water content did not necessarily result in higher grain yield in some fields and vice versa alternatively some fields had lower vegetation growth and water content but a relatively higher grain yield furthermore detecting the fields that produce higher grain yield with lower canopy water content could be advantageous in precision agriculture for higher resource use efficiency hernández ochoa et al 2022 because grain yield varied across different wheat fields during the three growing seasons anomalies of the observed grain yields were calculated to identify good and poor management zones attributed to high and low grain production respectively fig 10 illustrates the field grain yield anomaly x axis versus the vis anomaly y axis in each growing season negative values of ndvi and scri anomaly of a field indicate lower vegetation growth and canopy water content compared to the average of the ndvi and scri values across all fields likewise positive msi anomaly values in a field indicate greater drought stress compared to the average msi values across all fields thus the paired anomaly analysis would show the potential of grain productivity of a field over time compared to the other fields in terms of experienced drought stress according to fig 10 the vis and grain yield anomalies varied significantly across fields and growing seasons confirming wheat field differences in vegetation growth canopy water content and grain production regardless of the vis anomaly some fields consistently had either positive higher or negative lower grain yield anomalies over the three growing seasons for this reason all wheat fields were divided into two categories to identify the fields with high wheat grain production regardless of vis anomalies fields with positive and negative grain yield anomalies were labeled grade a and grade b representing good and poor fields respectively to this end fields 4 9 19 and 25 fig 1 had positive grain yield anomalies which means that their grain yield productions were greater than the average grain yield of all fields over the three growing seasons therefore these fields are labeled grade a due to their high potential for wheat production similarly fields 10 14 15 24 26 27 a and 27 c fig 1 are labeled grade b due to negative grain yield anomalies positive ndvi anomalies and negative grain yield anomalies in grade b fields for example field 14 in 2015 2016 are however noteworthy because they may indicate poor weed management in these fields resulting in higher green vegetation cover but lower grain yield as a result such anomaly analysis could help in elucidating areas in the fields that may require further investigations for other biotic factors weed control that would suppress grain production fig 10 demonstrated that the grade a fields were more adapted to the fixed irrigation management over the three growing seasons and could be identified as proper management zones or fields with high potential in wheat production the fixed irrigation management in the study area is practiced regardless of the soil properties however there is no detailed and reliable data on the spatial variations of soil properties in the study area soil physical properties determine soil available water content which influences crop transpiration and irrigation intervals that are critical in precise irrigation management luxmoore and sharma 1984 mahmood and hubbard 2003 although solhi 1988 reported that the entire study area has uniform soil texture table 1 some studies have reported spatial variations of the soil s physical properties in this area ahmadi et al 2015 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 as a result variations in vis and grain yield in the area could also be attributed to spatial variations of soil properties therefor soil heterogeneity could be a source of variation in vis and grain yield future studies should look into the effects of soil heterogeneity and soil moisture variation on spectral indices variations yue et al 2019 accurate spatially measured soil properties is recommended for each field for precise and timely irrigation management moreover variable rate irrigation is recommended to spatially vary irrigation water application across different farm zones to address specific soil and crop conditions evans et al 2013 proper irrigation methods that allow for varying irrigation depth such as center pivot irrigation should be investigated to deal with spatial soil and crop variability while increasing water application uniformity burt et al 1997 despite the lack of detailed data and information on irrigation events timing amount and spatial soil physical properties in our study the vis could reflect the effect of fixed irrigation management on crop growth and wheat canopy water content in agreement with our findings zappa et al 2022 stated that rs demonstrated its ability to fill the gap in detailed irrigation data furthermore our findings and analyses could help farm managers compare crop growth and water content across multiple fields using multispectral remotely sensed vis anomalies in conjunction with grain yield anomalies is useful in detecting management zones in agricultural crop production consequently rs can assist farmers and decision makers in prioritizing fields and detecting proper management zones with high potential crop production to efficiently use water resources particularly during drought events in the irrigated cropping systems 4 conclusion the vegetation growth index ndvi vegetation water status index scri and vegetation drought stress index msi were used in this study to evaluate the fixed phenological based irrigation management of winter wheat fields during three growing seasons with different climatic conditions and rainfall amounts and distribution primary analysis revealed strong correlations between the vis and the locally calibrated leaf area index lai implying that a combination of these vis can be used to spatially and temporally assess the water status of irrigated winter wheat crops the analyses revealed that the vis are beneficial in detecting the duration and severity of drought stress in the wheat fields the normalized difference water index ndwi was interpreted successfully to classify and assess the fields in terms of drought stress and crop growth as well as define the corresponding classification of the other vis attributed to canopy water status levels the paired anomaly analysis of the ndvi msi and scri with wheat grain yield was highly effective in recognizing the production potential of the wheat fields and defining proper management zones during different growing seasons with varying climatic conditions overall our findings showed that remote sensing is a cost effective and immediate tool for detecting poorly and well managed fields regarding irrigation water management which is critical in increasing crop production in sustainable agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9042,agriculture is the world s largest consumer of freshwater resources particularly in semi arid regions where crop production is reliant on both irrigation and rainfall therefore proper irrigation management is critical in achieving sustainable agriculture by increasing crop yield while conserving water resources remote sensing has demonstrated a great promise in monitoring crop status including crop water status based on the spectral vegetation index vi therefore the vegetation growth normalized difference vegetation index ndvi vegetation water status shortwave crop reflectance index scri and vegetation drought stress moisture stress index msi indices were calculated to assess the impact of irrigation management on canopy water status in a cluster of winter wheat fields in a semi arid area in three non consecutive growing seasons with different seasonal rainfall amounts and distributions the winter wheat fields were typically irrigated six times in each growing season according to a fixed phenological based irrigation scheduling results showed that ndvi scri and msi had a high correlation with the remotely sensed locally calibrated leaf area index lai among which ndvi had the strongest correlation r 0 9 the analysis revealed that the combined use of vis succeeded in detecting spatial and temporal crop drought stress levels during the growing seasons furthermore the normalized difference water index ndwi was interpreted to quantitatively classify the level and extent of drought stress in the winter wheat fields the results of the ndwi analysis revealed that 62 100 and 72 of the irrigated winter wheat fields have experienced some levels of drought stress during the normal growing season with wet spring normal growing season with wet autumn and dry growing season respectively the drought stress was basically due to the lack of effective rainfall during spring in march and april when crops have the highest vegetative growth irrespective of the rainfall amount during autumn and winter this revealed the importance of timely irrigation management during spring time in addition paired anomaly analysis of the ndvi msi and scri with the wheat grain yields could identify good and poor wheat fields and recognize proper management zones of the wheat fields in terms of potential grain production the findings of this study demonstrated that remote sensing is a strong and reliable tool in irrigation management to help sustain food production in arid or semi arid areas with limited water resources keywords irrigation management drought stress anomaly analysis spectral vegetation indices wheat grain yield leaf area index data availability all data used during the study appear in the article 1 introduction water is the crucial component in agricultural productivity and food production globally 70 of freshwater withdrawals are used in agriculture foley et al 2011 water shortages are however becoming more widespread due to global population expansion and climate change induced increases in crop water requirements choi et al 2012 thus on farm irrigation management and water resource conservation are essential particularly in areas where irrigation management significantly impacts crop productivity farid et al 2022 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 drought stress has a significant impact on both irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems even mild drought stress especially during critical phenological growth stages may reduce crop growth and yield fahad et al 2017 accurate irrigation planning and management apply an exact amount of water at the right time to meet crop water demands proper and timely irrigation management supports crop production saves water and protects the environment burton 2010 however because of 1 phenological and growth stage based crop water requirement 2 water resource limitations 3 labor availability 4 limited access to technical equipment 5 difficulties in frequent measurement of soil and crop water status and 6 capacity of the water delivery system the farm managers or farmers may adopt and follow a fixed irrigation schedule however since part of the crop water requirement in the semi arid regions is supplied by effective rainfall a fixed irrigation schedule and management fixed irrigation days and amounts may fail to address the required crop water requirement due to inter annual variations in rainfall and atmospheric demand monitoring irrigation management over several years can therefore help to improve water management and irrigation planning for efficient water use and sustainable crop production kharrou et al 2021 timely and precise estimation of canopy water status has high practical importance for monitoring the vegetation growth status and predicting crop yield as canopy water status is one of the main controlling factors of photosynthesis and biomass jones and tardieu 1998 datt 1999 große stoltenberg et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 since introducing the concept of vegetation index vi in 1969 jordan 1969 diverse spectral vis have been developed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of crop growth status bannari et al 1995 anderegg et al 2020 ferchichi et al 2022 in this approach the vegetation status could be easily and effectively assessed by measuring the vegetation reflectance in visible to near infrared wavelengths hunt et al 2016 remotely sensed data could be used to calculate the vis of vegetation water status on the ground chen et al 2016 kumar et al 2022 the vis have been used for several purposes including but not limited to yield prediction hunt et al 2019 drought monitoring and assessment west et al 2019 mapping crop evapotranspiration consoli and vanella 2014 vegetation health and water content jackson 2004 and monitoring plant drought stress thapa et al 2019 however vis would change spatially and temporally particularly in large areas therefore monitoring vis as the indicators of plant growth health and drought stress is important in irrigated agriculture and precision irrigation management qiao et al 2022 to this end remote sensing rs has facilitated the study of canopy water status which could be affected by irrigation regimes and management nilsson 1995 xue and su 2017 zhao et al 2020 sun et al 2019 the interest in monitoring and accurate retrieval of crop water status by rs has widely increased in the scientific community peñuelas et al 1997 hunt et al 2016 elsherbiny et al 2021 the reason is that rs is an easy fast inexpensive and non destructive tool for timely monitoring of crop water status before reaching a critical stress level mulla 2013 elsherbiny et al 2021 the vis differ in establishing a mathematical relationship between the different spectral wavelengths plants absorb transmit and reflect electromagnetic waves differently depending on their wavelength for example drought stressed plants reflect less near infrared nir waves than healthy plants braga et al 2021 in addition the reflectance of shortwave infrared swir is highly sensitive to water content and is widely used for estimating and assessing the vegetation and soil water content wang and qu 2007 tian and philpot 2015 zhang et al 2019 braga et al 2021 crusiol et al 2023 therefore various spectral bands and vis can provide different information about the plant s growth state and characteristics in addition the performance of the vis in tracking the effects of drought stress is different ballester et al 2019 a vi may show the impact of long term stress on plants while the other vi might be invariant to track the long term effects and show the stress immediately de jong et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhang and zhou 2015 2019 wong et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to understand better the seasonal performance of the vis in monitoring irrigation management on canopy water status and drought stress level some plant based studies have focused on examining only one vi hansen and schjoerring 2003 benincasa et al 2018 while others have used multiple vis sharifi 2020 mokhtari et al 2019 as previously reported by berger et al 2022 relying upon only a single vi may not be sufficient for a comprehensive analysis of vegetation status holzman et al 2014 some of the vis are useful in agriculture and water management as they can indicate the canopy water content and crop growth status the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is one of the most widely used vi the ndvi indicates plant health and greenness and is sensitive to changes in chlorophyll zhong et al 2019 xiaoyan et al 2020 the leaf area index lai is the ratio of plant leaf area to the occupied land area and plays an important role in characterizing the plant canopy breda 2003 lai measures the physical and structural status of the plant leaf size area number and is an ecophysiological index of plant canopy transpiration and photosynthetic surface area chen et al 1997 the shortwave crop reflectance index scri could be explicitly used to identify crop water status as it is solely derived from the swir1 and swir2 shahrokhnia and ahmadi 2019 in previous studies the scri has been used for various purposes such as tillage practices plant residue cover and soil salinity van deventer et al 1997 dehni and lounis 2012 sonmez et al 2016 the moisture stress index msi assesses water content and stress in vegetation canopy and soil davidson et al 2006 benabdelouahab et al 2015 likewise the normalized difference water index ndwi provides helpful information about plant and soil water content jackson et al 2004 benabdelouahab et al 2015 wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 although many studies have used rs for agricultural and environmental purposes hunt et al 2019 west et al 2019 jackson 2004 no study has evaluated different types of vis on irrigation water management of multiple winter wheat fields within and between growing seasons the goals of this study were to assess the impacts of irrigation water management on canopy water status in a cluster of irrigated winter wheat fields using different remotely sensed vis over three growing seasons in terms of i assessing the ability of vis to delineate crop health and drought stress at spatial and temporal scales in response to seasonal irrigation and rainfall ii simple modeling of wheat grain yield using the within season calculated vis iii developing a new vi approach for classifying wheat field areas under drought stress iv performing a paired anomaly analysis of the vis and grain yield to determine the high and low potential yield production fields the lai ndvi scri and msi were selected to evaluate crop growth and canopy water status and ndwi was employed to classify the wheat fields concerning the level of drought stress and grain yield production this analysis would enable farm managers to investigate the wheat field zones prone to poor and improper irrigation management and drought stress and determine appropriate and timely irrigation management to ensure sustainable wheat production 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area soil properties and crop management this research was carried out in the agricultural fields of the school of agriculture shiraz university shiraz in the southwest of iran 29 36 n 52 32 e the mean elevation of the area is 1810 m above sea level the study area consists of 28 fields with an overall area of 400 ha fig 1 shows the location of the study area irrigation water pumps field identification numbers and the spatial locations of the studied fields supplementary table 1 shows the size of each field the climate of the study area is warm and semi arid with an average long term annual rainfall of 275 mm falling primarily between november and march table 1 displays the physical properties of the soil in the study area no studies have been conducted to provide and describe detailed data information on spatial soil heterogeneity in the study area nor the spatial map of the variations of soil physical properties for each field has been produced information on the conventional farming practices irrigation management and scheduling and grain yields of the harvested winter wheat of each field for different growing seasons were provided by the office of field management school of agriculture based on this information the pishtaz wheat cultivar was sown at a rate of 200 250 kg ha 1 at the end of october each year and harvested at the end of june of the following year variations in sowing and harvest dates depended on rainfall occurrence in autumn machinery availability and the preceding crop harvest conditions before each growing season winter wheat crops received 300 kg ha 1 of urea 46 n no3 fertilization during two broadcasting events after sowing and starting the stem elongation stage table 2 supplementary table 2 shows the final grain yields for each field during the studied growing seasons border irrigation was the dominant irrigation system to irrigate wheat fields wheat rows were 30 cm apart and the length of the borders was equal to the length of the field depending on the field size supplementary table 1 winter wheat crops are typically irrigated six times per growing season by three irrigation technicians following a fixed phenological based irrigation schedule according to official information from the office of farm management table 2 because of the limited personnel and irrigation system capacity each irrigation event took 7 10 days to irrigate all of the fields there has not been any exact order for irrigating the wheat fields in different growing seasons in addition there was no detailed record of irrigation depth and schedule for each field due to a lack of knowledge of irrigation technicians about irrigation and crop water requirement and no intention and plan to record the details of irrigation events by the office of farm management however despite the lack of such information on irrigation practices for evaluating irrigation management in the study area this study aimed to get the benefits of the vis to detect and assess the impact of irrigation management on wheat crops furthermore due to such a lack of information we did not have any observed data and records of drought events and water stress such as the time and duration of drought events 2 2 growing seasons and meteorological data wheat fields in the study area were in rotation with corn and canola as part of the cropping system over several years therefore the studied growing seasons were chosen to be as non consecutive as possible to assess irrigation management in the same fields three non consecutive wheat growing seasons of 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 were chosen to evaluate irrigation management over several years using the remotely sensed vis meteorological data were obtained from the weather station at the school of agriculture as shown in fig 1 fig 2 depicts cumulative rainfall average daily temperature relative humidity and penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 the 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 were normal years with mean annual rainfalls of 280 mm and 290 mm respectively during the wheat growing season in contrast 2017 2018 was a dry growing season with a mean annual rainfall of 165 mm rainfall events in 2013 2014 were delayed when compared to 2015 2016 thus the 2013 2014 growing season was normal with a wet spring the 2015 2016 growing season was normal with a wet autumn and the 2017 2018 growing season was dry 2 3 spectral vegetation indices four different vis as lai ndvi scri and msi were selected to evaluate vegetation health and canopy cover vegetation water status and vegetation drought stress therefore the vis were divided into three categories 1 vegetation growth index ndvi 2 vegetation water status index scri and 3 vegetation drought stress index msi the lai was calculated based on a locally adjusted equation table 4 and it was used as a valid reference to drive relationships and correlations with the other vis for robust spatial and temporal analysis the soil adjusted vegetation index savi introduced by bastiaanssen 1998 was used in calculating the lai table 4 the variations of the vis across fields and dates over the growing seasons were analyzed as the proxies for irrigation management performance on assessing plant growth and canopy water status of the irrigated winter wheat fields 2 4 remote sensing and satellite data the images recorded by the landsat 8 operational land imager oli were used to calculate the vis landsat 8 satellite has spatial and temporal resolutions of 30 m and 16 days respectively and is suitable for monitoring irrigation management at small and large scales xie et al 2021 bretreger et al 2020 corbari et al 2019 supplementary table 3 lists the wavelengths of the spectral bands used in calculating the vis in the study area the vegetative and reproductive winter wheat growth stages start from mid march to early june that covers stem elongation bbch code 30 until grain filling bbch code 71 table 2 since landsat 8 flies over the study area on different dates and paths path 162 row 39 path 162 row 40 and path 163 row 39 the study area could be captured in three images consequently while landsat 8 images are acquired every 16 days the image acquisition period over the study was 7 9 days table 3 satellite images were not analyzed during the autumn and winter due to minimal vegetation cover and low growth furthermore an image would have been excluded from the analysis if the clouds in the image covered the wheat fields or the cloud shadows cast the fields in total images from 18 dates 5 dates in 2013 2014 7 dates in 2015 2016 and 6 dates in 2016 2017 were analyzed the google earth engine gee https earthengine google com was used for image processing the vis of each pixel within each wheat field were calculated using the landsat 8 surface reflectance images landsat lc08 c01 t1 sr a boundary was defined for each wheat field and the gee calculated the vis of all pixels within the field boundary there were also roads and tree rows used as windbreaks between fields which would impact vis because the width of these roads and trees is less than 30 m landsat 8 spatial resolution the pixels that contained the field borders were excluded from further analyses 2 5 heat maps of lai because lai was calibrated locally based on ground observations the variations in lai help assess vegetation growth and irrigation management as a result lai heat maps were created for all wheat fields to demonstrate spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover the gis technique was used to generate heat maps of the lai for the three representative dates 2014 05 21 2016 05 28 and 2018 05 18 grain filling stage compared to the other dates in each growing season these selected dates show the greatest spatial variation of lai in one image however due to the lack of accessible information on field management practices during the three growing seasons we have assumed that variations of lai are primarily affected by irrigation though other sources of uncertainty could affect lai nevertheless according to the spatial resolution of landsat 8 images the lai of each pixel represents a pixel size of 30 m 30 m which may prorate the influence of the other field management factors on lai 2 6 ndwi based interpretation of vegetation indices the normalized difference water index ndwi is a reliable and robust remote sensing vegetation index of plant water content gao 1996 wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 romero et al 2021 the ndwi is calculated as 1 ndwi nir swir 1 nir swir 1 ndwi values help us to classify the water status of field crops and immediately recognize drought stressed areas as it is related to plant water content or drought stress conditions regardless of plant type ceccato et al 2002 chen et al 2003 gu et al 2007 2008 wang et al 2015 antognelli 2018 ji et al 2023 table 5 shows the interpreted values of ndwi proposed by antognelli 2018 and fernández poulussen et al 2021 interpreted values were divided into three classes representing the state of the plant with respect to canopy and drought stress in a field where the crops are at the same phenological stage the areas where the ndvi is lower than average could normally present vegetative development problems associated with drought stress therefore it is clear that ndwi could be correlated with ndvi because it is influenced by both vegetation health and drought stress guidotti et al 2019 so first the correlations between ndwi and the other three vis ndvi scri and msi were derived then we used the interpreted values of the ndwi to define corresponding values for the other three vis in other words interpreting ndwi values would allow us to correlate ndwi values with the other vis to interpret the values of the other vis accordingly 2 7 anomaly of the vegetation indices and grain yield we calculated the anomaly of the vis to assess the spatial and temporal variability of the vis with grain yield anomaly in wheat fields during different growing seasons calculating the vi anomaly is a simple accurate and widely used approach to monitoring changes in vi over time relative to the average over the study period in general anomaly allows us to compare the current crop conditions and yields to the averages over a certain period in this study the vis and grain yield anomalies will enable us to compare different fields agronomic crop and irrigation management in different years the vis anomalies were used for drought detection and mapping anyamba and tucker 2012 vaani and porchelvan 2017 nanzad et al 2019 a positive vi anomaly indicates that the value of the vi e g ndvi is higher than the long term average which may imply a wet year timely irrigation and proper crop growth the negative vi anomaly values demonstrate the inverse eqs 2 4 were used to calculate the anomalies of the vis in all three growing seasons from march to june the anomaly of grain yield was calculated likewise 2 vi mean i vi i 1 v i i 2 v i i n n 3 vi i 1 m vi mean i m 4 vi anomaly i n vi i n vi vi 100 where vi mean i is the average of vis in all fields in i th growing season n is the number of wheat fields in each growing season vi i n is the vegetation index of field n in i th growing season averaged over march to june vi is the overall average of all vi averages of m growing seasons m 3 and vi anomaly i n is the vegetation index anomaly of field n within m growing season 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal and spatial analysis of leaf area index fig 3 shows the heat maps of lai during the grain filling stage of the three growing seasons having in mind that the other field managements such as fertilizer management sowing dates wheat cultivars germination rate tillage herbicide application and irrigation water quality were likely similar in all fields during the growing seasons therefore spatial variations of lai in each field could mostly indicate non uniform irrigation water management for example in fields 15 18 19 and 27 c in 2013 2014 the lai varied between 3 and 5 indicating that some field zones had better vegetation growth than others in addition there was a large difference in lai among the fields implying that the irrigation management of adjacent fields 3 4 and 10 was inadequate in the adjacent fields lai varied between 1 and 5 in 2013 2014 and 0 3 in 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 fig 3 implies poor and irregular irrigation management in the wheat fields in the southern part of the region fields 3 4 and 10 irrigation management constantly remained poor throughout the three growing seasons 3 2 correlation between the spectral vegetation indices fig 4 depicts the linear correlation between lai as the ground based reference index and the other three vis over the three growing seasons lai correlated with ndvi with the correlation coefficient r ranging between 0 52 and 0 90 lai was strongly correlated with ndvi r 0 9 in 2017 2018 however the correlation between lai and ndvi decreased sharply in 2015 2016 r 0 52 lai also correlated well with scri and msi with high correlation coefficients ranging from 0 79 0 85 in 2013 2014 and 2017 2018 nonetheless the correlation coefficients for lai scri and lai msi reduced to 0 4 and 0 5 respectively in 2015 2016 the highly correlated regressions in fig 4 show that the vis can be used interchangeably with relatively high precision to track the drought stress these correlations provide comprehensive information and inferences about plant health such as plant growth water content and drought stress panda et al 2010 ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 wang et al 2019 moisa et al 2022 lai and ndvi have a higher correlation compared to scri and msi because they use the same spectral bands table 4 both ndvi and lai use the red and nir bands ndvi is sufficiently sensitive to chlorophyll which can indicate wheat plants health and growth status wu et al 2009 therefore lai showed the highest correlation with ndvi in contrast the spectral bands in lai and scri are not similar scri uses only swir1 and swir2 wavelengths table 4 that are highly sensitive to water content and are commonly used to estimate vegetation and soil water content tian and philpot 2015 zhang et al 2019 crusiol et al 2023 despite the independence of the lai and scri spectral bands a satisfactory correlation between the two vis fig 4 indicated the potential robustness in monitoring plant water status shahrokhnia and ahmadi 2019 moreover both msi and lai use nir but msi also uses swir1 the good linear correlations observed between lai and msi demonstrate the reliable application of msi in detecting drought stress in wheat fields based on the lai this finding clearly shows that the vegetation growth index lai can be accurately used and linked to assess the vegetation water stress level i e the higher lai the lower the water stress these results confirm that using the dependent and independent vis that cover a wide range of spectral bands is crucial for accurate irrigation management and precise assessing of crop water status the lower correlation in 2015 2016 compared with the other growing seasons indicates that lai did not synchronize well to ndvi scri and msi variations even though lai and ndvi have common spectral bands this finding may suggest the differences between the vis in detecting stress severity and duration short long term that have also been argued by zhang and zhou 2019 and wong et al 2022 drought related immediate changes such as plant water content and temporal changes such as physical traits are sensitive to different spectral bands magney et al 2016 berger et al 2022 in contrast to the lai and ndvi as the canopy structure indices water stress responses are generally linked to more physiological mechanisms such as stomatal closure which limits transpiration chaves et al 2009 therefore the vis that exploit the physiological responses to water stress would perform better as a proxy and an indicator of short and long term stress events garbulsky et al 2011 wong and gamon 2015 in this regard wang et al 2015 reported that canopy water content is generally an immediate response to soil water at the crop canopy level and recommended spectral bands that have short term responses to water stress however this topic of the sensitivity of the vis to short and long term abiotic stresses requires further fieldworks and ground truthing validation under different plant species and stress levels during an entire growing season hmimina et al 2015 wong et al 2022 even though previous studies used scri for plant residue cover sonmez and slater 2016 tillage methods zheng et al 2014 and soil moisture estimation yue et al 2019 fig 4 demonstrated that scri correlated well with lai showing that it could be used to track drought stress events this result is in agreement with shahrokhnia and ahmadi 2019 and faurtyot and baret 1997 who reported that swir1 and swir2 are the best wavelengths for assessing vegetation water content because they respond differently to moisture content yue et al 2019 tian and philpot 2015 in their study on wheat wang et al 2015 abuwasit et al 2008 and tian et al 2001 also recommended that the swir region is the most stable and sensitive to water stress in their measurements in different growth stages it is noteworthy that from an irrigation water management and irrigation scheduling perspective using the vis that provide near real time information on the canopy water status is critical along with short term forecasting of the atmospheric demand wong et al 2022 irrigation is typically planned in 7 10 day intervals however daily information is required for drought stress detection thus the fusion of several satellite images is essential to obtain near real time daily or latest weekly information therefore the images of landsat 8 over an irrigated area should be analyzed as shortly as possible to track the canopy water content and drought water status precisely for achieving the best results it is recommended to collect data from ground based observation of drought events and stresses time duration and level in different growth stages and correlate and synchronize them with the remotely sensed vis this information will provide a strong tool for irrigation water management and scheduling nevertheless we did not have any historical data on the water stress or drought events in this study and we thus focused on making inferences about drought stress using the vis 3 3 seasonal analysis of the spectral vegetation indices fig 5 depicts the temporal variations of vis in various fields and dates table 3 in each growing season it is observed that all vis synchronized on most of the dates however between march 25 and april 3 of 2016 the vis variations were irregular all vis except the lai showed reduced vegetation growth and canopy water content during this period during this period ndvi decreased from 0 60 to 0 53 scri reduced from 0 24 to 0 18 and msi increased from 0 61 to 0 63 in contrast the lai increased from 4 48 to 4 83 with no obvious effect of drought stress this exception in the vis discrepancy relates to plant responses to the duration and severity of drought stress wong et al 2022 berger et al 2022 mild and short term drought stress usually has minor short term effects on plants including changing the photosynthetic and transpiration fluxes but phenotypic changes such as leaf size do not occur damm et al 2018 in contrast severe and prolonged drought stress severely halts plant growth and reduces aboveground biomass and crop yields haboudane et al 2002 flexas et al 2004 because lai is related to plant structural and physical characteristics such as leaf size and number it does not show an immediate response to drought stress and usually declines sometimes after the onset of mild or prolonged drought stress gitelson et al 2014 wong et al 2022 indeed lai has a time lag in responding to drought stress and short term or transient drought stresses do not affect lai thus it could be concluded that the drought stress from march 25 to april 3 of 2016 was a short term drought that resulted in an immediate plant response such as a decrease in vegetation water content and was sensed by the vis sensitive to water content thus fig 5 shows that using vis associated with plant physical and structural traits such as lai together with vis related to physiological and hydraulic traits such as scri helps to detect and recognize short or long term drought stresses berger et al 2022 furthermore the consistency of various vis indicative of immediate long term stress effects indicates that the vis values on most dates table 4 were unaffected by previous irrigation therefore the vis are fully effective for evaluating irrigation management 3 4 ndwi based classification of the spectral vegetation indices fig 6 shows the strong correlation between ndwi and the other vis ndvi scri and msi in all growing seasons the strongest correlation was observed between ndwi and msi r 0 93 followed by ndvi r 0 91 and scri 0 84 the strong correlation between ndwi and msi is due to the common spectral bands of nir and swir1 this strong relationship has been previously reported benabdelouahab et al 2015 the strong correlation between the ndwi and other vis msi ndvi and scri is helpful for the detailed classification of the other vis attributed to the plant canopy water status fig 6 shows the three classes of ndwi values based on table 5 the regression lines and vertical dashed lines were used to classify the plant water status level according to the interpretations of ndwi table 6 summarizes the descriptions of the three classes attributed to each vi according to fig 6 most wheat fields were in class 2 during the three growing seasons indicating that the crops experienced some levels of drought stress in 2015 2016 however there were no fields in class 3 no drought stress and nearly all fields were in class 2 this finding means that all fields were under low to high drought stress at different times during the growing period in contrast there were no fields in class 1 in 2013 2014 furthermore the most considerable variations in the vis were observed in 2017 2018 indicating that the wheat fields experienced no drought stress to high drought stress on different dates table 6 is beneficial for the farm managers and irrigation engineers for field management and classification of crop water conditions using various vis in irrigated areas for improving irrigation water management 3 5 irrigation scheduling analysis in different growing seasons in arid and semi arid areas where fixed irrigation scheduling supplies a part of the crop water requirement erratic rainfall distribution during different growing seasons can affect crop growth and water content therefore analyzing the possible role of rainfall events on vis could help assess fixed irrigation management in different growing seasons in figs 4 and 5 vis changed differently during each growing season in fig 5 the variations in ndvi and lai during the dry growing season 2017 2018 are related to the effects of the rainfall distribution during 2017 2018 rainfall was as low as 105 mm from sowing to march 30 stem elongation table 2 which resulted in reduced plant growth mean lai 4 46 mean scri 0 2 on march 31 2018 fig 5 however 48 mm of rainfall from april 1 to april 30 end of booting stage provided part of the crop water requirement this rainfall event increased canopy water content and growth mean lai 6 20 mean scri 0 26 on april 9 2018 fig 5 although in 2013 2014 with wet spring and in 2015 2016 with wet autumn the cumulative rainfall was nearly the same fig 2 the lai ndvi msi and scri in 2013 2014 exhibited higher values than in 2015 2016 figs 4 and 5 rainfall totaled 58 mm and 34 mm in march and april stem elongation and booting stages of 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively fig 2 however 34 mm of rainfall had no positive effect on vegetation growth or water content due to low effective rainfall fig 2 in this regard solgi et al 2022 evaluated soil moisture content in wheat fields under different climatic scenarios using the calibrated and validated aquacrop model for the study region under the same irrigation management the simulated soil water content of the wheat root zone under different climatic conditions rainfall patterns is shown in fig 7 in general fig 7 illustrates how soil water content is affected by rainfall patterns under fixed irrigation management figs 7b and 7c show that the fixed irrigation scheduling could not address crop water requirements whenever spring is dry starting from late march to early april this finding highlights the impact of march and april rainfall during stem elongation and booting stages table 2 on crop growth and yield previous research in this area has shown either by field measurements or dynamic crop growth modeling that low rainfall deficit irrigation during the stem elongation stage of winter wheat reduces wheat lai and grain yield significantly mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 solgi et al 2022 the relationship between ndwi and its cumulative frequency distributions for all wheat fields in each growing season is shown in fig 8 to assess the effect of the fixed irrigation management on vegetation cover and water content under different growing seasons according to table 5 2017 2018 was the only growing season that ndwi varied among class 1 and class 3 such that 5 and 28 of ndwi values are observed in classes 1 and 3 respectively in 2013 2014 there was no ndwi value in class 1 but 38 of ndwi values were in class 3 however in 2015 2016 ndwi values were only allocated in class 2 these findings indicate that 62 100 and 72 of irrigated winter wheat fields were subjected to drought stress during 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 respectively this result suggests that the fixed irrigation management was ineffective in improving crop growth and canopy water content especially during dry springs fig 2 therefore irrespective of the rainfall amount in the autumn and winter more frequent irrigation events should be applied to address crop water requirement during the sensitive growth stages in spring in this regard irrigation scheduling should be adjusted based on rainfall patterns thus it is necessary to monitor soil water content and provide adequate irrigation in situations where rainfall may occur but is insufficient fig 7 in conclusion although monitoring soil water content dynamics helps in better assessment of irrigation planning multispectral satellite remote sensing vis is an immediate and cost effective way to assess plant growth and canopy water content under diverse irrigation managements despite the lack and limitation of detailed information on irrigation scheduling in this study the vis demonstrated satisfactory results for evaluating and improving irrigation management in the future as a result remote sensing shall be used in future research and in the areas where a lack of detailed irrigation and water management data affects farm management in irrigated areas in the absence of historical data on irrigation events and their details the proposed vis and ndwi based classification is a useful and reliable tool for farm managers and irrigation practitioners in adapting the best irrigation management practices for maximum crop production 3 6 paired anomaly of the spectral vegetation indices and grain yields fig 9 shows the correlations between the average value of the vis of each field during a growing season and the observed grain yield it is seen that grain yield variations could be explained by the vis such that ndvi msi and scri have almost identical correlation coefficients with grain yield previous studies have also confirmed that vegetation growth and water content indices are related and positively correlated with yield chandel et al 2019 these results show that the progression of the drought stress during a growing season could have a negative contribution and impact on the final grain yield and field productivity therefore preventing drought stress at any time during the main growth stages would prevent yield loss it is required to avoid drought events during the sensitive growth stages that have detrimental effects on final grain yield davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 so as drought stress at certain growth stages e g stem elongation and flowering has a negative impact on grain yield there are some other growth stages e g grain filling and dough that drought stress might not contribute to final grain loss zhang and oweis 1999 solgi et al 2022 therefore to improve the grain yield prediction skill based on the vis it is necessary to include the vi of those growth stages in the regression analysis that impacts the final grain yield following this approach further field experiments and observations are needed of course having enough field based knowledge of the sensitive growth stages will help in the optimal irrigation scheduling of wheat zhang and oweis 1999 and implementing water saving strategies without yield loss solgi et al 2022 although many studies have found a strong relationship between lai and yield zhou et al 2017 peng et al 2019 our study found either a weak or a negative correlation between lai and grain yield because the correlations in fig 9 are calculated using mean vis in each field over a growing season the weak correlations could reflect the diversity of fields in crop growth and yield production in other words higher vegetation growth and water content did not necessarily result in higher grain yield in some fields and vice versa alternatively some fields had lower vegetation growth and water content but a relatively higher grain yield furthermore detecting the fields that produce higher grain yield with lower canopy water content could be advantageous in precision agriculture for higher resource use efficiency hernández ochoa et al 2022 because grain yield varied across different wheat fields during the three growing seasons anomalies of the observed grain yields were calculated to identify good and poor management zones attributed to high and low grain production respectively fig 10 illustrates the field grain yield anomaly x axis versus the vis anomaly y axis in each growing season negative values of ndvi and scri anomaly of a field indicate lower vegetation growth and canopy water content compared to the average of the ndvi and scri values across all fields likewise positive msi anomaly values in a field indicate greater drought stress compared to the average msi values across all fields thus the paired anomaly analysis would show the potential of grain productivity of a field over time compared to the other fields in terms of experienced drought stress according to fig 10 the vis and grain yield anomalies varied significantly across fields and growing seasons confirming wheat field differences in vegetation growth canopy water content and grain production regardless of the vis anomaly some fields consistently had either positive higher or negative lower grain yield anomalies over the three growing seasons for this reason all wheat fields were divided into two categories to identify the fields with high wheat grain production regardless of vis anomalies fields with positive and negative grain yield anomalies were labeled grade a and grade b representing good and poor fields respectively to this end fields 4 9 19 and 25 fig 1 had positive grain yield anomalies which means that their grain yield productions were greater than the average grain yield of all fields over the three growing seasons therefore these fields are labeled grade a due to their high potential for wheat production similarly fields 10 14 15 24 26 27 a and 27 c fig 1 are labeled grade b due to negative grain yield anomalies positive ndvi anomalies and negative grain yield anomalies in grade b fields for example field 14 in 2015 2016 are however noteworthy because they may indicate poor weed management in these fields resulting in higher green vegetation cover but lower grain yield as a result such anomaly analysis could help in elucidating areas in the fields that may require further investigations for other biotic factors weed control that would suppress grain production fig 10 demonstrated that the grade a fields were more adapted to the fixed irrigation management over the three growing seasons and could be identified as proper management zones or fields with high potential in wheat production the fixed irrigation management in the study area is practiced regardless of the soil properties however there is no detailed and reliable data on the spatial variations of soil properties in the study area soil physical properties determine soil available water content which influences crop transpiration and irrigation intervals that are critical in precise irrigation management luxmoore and sharma 1984 mahmood and hubbard 2003 although solhi 1988 reported that the entire study area has uniform soil texture table 1 some studies have reported spatial variations of the soil s physical properties in this area ahmadi et al 2015 mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 as a result variations in vis and grain yield in the area could also be attributed to spatial variations of soil properties therefor soil heterogeneity could be a source of variation in vis and grain yield future studies should look into the effects of soil heterogeneity and soil moisture variation on spectral indices variations yue et al 2019 accurate spatially measured soil properties is recommended for each field for precise and timely irrigation management moreover variable rate irrigation is recommended to spatially vary irrigation water application across different farm zones to address specific soil and crop conditions evans et al 2013 proper irrigation methods that allow for varying irrigation depth such as center pivot irrigation should be investigated to deal with spatial soil and crop variability while increasing water application uniformity burt et al 1997 despite the lack of detailed data and information on irrigation events timing amount and spatial soil physical properties in our study the vis could reflect the effect of fixed irrigation management on crop growth and wheat canopy water content in agreement with our findings zappa et al 2022 stated that rs demonstrated its ability to fill the gap in detailed irrigation data furthermore our findings and analyses could help farm managers compare crop growth and water content across multiple fields using multispectral remotely sensed vis anomalies in conjunction with grain yield anomalies is useful in detecting management zones in agricultural crop production consequently rs can assist farmers and decision makers in prioritizing fields and detecting proper management zones with high potential crop production to efficiently use water resources particularly during drought events in the irrigated cropping systems 4 conclusion the vegetation growth index ndvi vegetation water status index scri and vegetation drought stress index msi were used in this study to evaluate the fixed phenological based irrigation management of winter wheat fields during three growing seasons with different climatic conditions and rainfall amounts and distribution primary analysis revealed strong correlations between the vis and the locally calibrated leaf area index lai implying that a combination of these vis can be used to spatially and temporally assess the water status of irrigated winter wheat crops the analyses revealed that the vis are beneficial in detecting the duration and severity of drought stress in the wheat fields the normalized difference water index ndwi was interpreted successfully to classify and assess the fields in terms of drought stress and crop growth as well as define the corresponding classification of the other vis attributed to canopy water status levels the paired anomaly analysis of the ndvi msi and scri with wheat grain yield was highly effective in recognizing the production potential of the wheat fields and defining proper management zones during different growing seasons with varying climatic conditions overall our findings showed that remote sensing is a cost effective and immediate tool for detecting poorly and well managed fields regarding irrigation water management which is critical in increasing crop production in sustainable agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9043,in korea estuary reservoirs are one of the main water resources for agriculture generally used for water supply while ensuring an appropriate water level the recent inflow of pollutants from watersheds is aggravating water pollution problems in these reservoirs to address this issue the government has implemented effective measures including the control of water level and basin management measures effective water level management of estuary reservoirs can reduce the environmental impact on freshwater and coastal fishing however the current water management measures mainly focus on securing water and ensuring the feasibility of sea dike construction therefore in this study we evaluated the effect of drainage gate operation on the water quality of the ganwol reservoir we established a watershed estuary linkage model the hydrological simulation program fortran environmental fluid dynamics code and water quality analysis simulation program hspf efdc wasp linkage simulation system to comprehensively consider the watershed and water body characteristics and study the water quality changes for differently managed water level scenarios the effect of water level on the water quality of the estuary reservoir was evaluated by considering differently managed water level scenarios in the linkage model the results indicated that the difference in the water quality for each water level scenario was larger at the lower point gw1 of the estuary reservoir than at the upper point gw3 at gw3 the water quality tended to improve with the increasing water level gw1 was significantly affected by the operation of the drainage gate at gw1 the lower the management level was the higher the water quality improvement effect owing to the improvement in the flow in the estuary caused by the increase in the discharge frequency the study results can be used as basic data to prepare an optimal water resource management plan for estuary reservoirs by estimating the water level impact on their future hydrology and water quality keywords ganwol estuary reservoir water quality drainage gate operation managed water level hspf efdc wasp linkage model estuary reservoir management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an estuary reservoir refers to a reservoir that is created artificially by constructing a seawall in an estuary such reservoirs are economical and an efficient water resource hwang et al 2021 the water storage capacity of the estuary reservoirs in korea is about 2 9 billion tons which is about 18 of the domestic agricultural water use the large scale agricultural estuary reservoirs having a storage capacity of more than 5 million tons account for about 45 of the total agricultural water storage seong 2014 currently as the area of paddy fields irrigated or planned for irrigation from estuary reservoirs reaches 123 000 ha in korea estuary reservoirs have become one of the main water resources for agricultural water supply in the country korea rural community corporation krc 2021 additionally estuary reservoirs prevent flooding in the rural hinterland during the flood season as well as high tides through their gate operation therefore it is crucial to securing the sustainability of these reservoirs in general estuary reservoirs are located at the ends of watersheds therefore various pollutants from upstream areas get introduced into them this can lead to addition of excess nutrients and cause impairment of water quality of the reservoirs edmondson et al 1956 lee et al 2010 in addition gate discharge is possible only when the tidal level is lower than the internal water level of estuary reservoirs this limited discharge condition can decrease water circulation in the reservoirs limited water circulation causes retention of polluted water and water body stratification and can eventually result in oxygen depletion i e hypoxia dai et al 2006 hamilton taylor et al 2005 lamping et al 2005 moreover hypoxia can further lead to harmful algal blooms and eutrophication hindering the sustainability of the reservoirs gooday et al 2009 howarth et al 2011 therefore to reduce the vulnerability of the estuary reservoirs it is important to improve water quality in a short period of time both structural and non structural measures are available to improve the water quality of estuary reservoirs structural measures e g sediment dredging wetland construction diffusers flow pumps submerged contact chambers require more time and cost than non structural measures consequently in order to actively and sustainably manage the water quality in estuary reservoirs it is necessary to adopt non structural measures for accelerating water quality recovery in water bodies lürling et al 2020 in particular hypolimnetic withdrawal is a representative non structural measure that rapidly improves the water quality in stratified reservoirs with anoxic hypolimnia nürnberg 2020 however if there is no hypolimnetic withdrawal system sluice gate operation can reduce the stagnant water area and induce water circulation in estuary reservoirs thus the possibility of improving the water quality of estuary reservoirs using upper layer drainage via the gate operation could constitute an environment friendly and economical water quality management measure in reservoirs where hypolimnetic withdrawal is not possible additionally proper water level management based on the drainage gate operation of estuary reservoirs can minimize the negative environmental impacts on the hinterland and coastal fishing however the existing managed water levels of estuary reservoirs are usually based on securing water supply and ensuring an ease in construction therefore the environmental impact of water level is not sufficiently considered accordingly in response to the changes in the hydrological characteristics of reservoirs such as dredging and the need to prepare fundamental measures to improve water quality it is necessary to understand the effect of managed water level on the hydrology and water quality of estuary reservoirs and derive an optimal water level management scenario while considering the environmental effects of the managed water levels in an estuary the final outlet of a stream converges with the seawater therefore to establish an integrated water resource management plan for the estuary reservoir it is important to consider various water resource factors such as hydrology water quality and salinity based on a comprehensive understanding of the watershed and water body characteristics while analyzing changes in environmental conditions of estuary reservoirs based on water quality management measures actual application of these measures and monitoring of environmental factors are useful ways to minimize the uncertainty of results however monitoring all water resource factors of reservoirs can be an expensive and time consuming task bartram and ballance 1996 consequently it is necessary to establish and operate a water quality prediction model that can reasonably simulate the mechanisms of different watersheds and water bodies recently numerous studies have simulated estuary reservoirs by linking watershed hydrological models with different hydrodynamic and water quality models kim et al 2017 park et al 2010 liu et al 2008 lee et al 2018 hwang 2020 notably three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic and numerical water quality models have been developed extensively enabling the simulation of the spatial distribution of the hydrology and water quality characteristics of estuary reservoirs and it has become possible to simulate the phenomena occurring in a water body in more detail yoon and seo 2013 the aims of this study are ⅰ to analyze the effect of drainage gate operation on the water quality of an estuary reservoir using the hydrological simulation program fortran environmental fluid dynamics code and water quality analysis simulation program hspf efdc wasp linkage model and ⅱ to derive an optimal water level management plan 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we selected the ganwol estuary reservoir located in the midwestern part of south korea 36 38 48 n 126 27 16 e as the study area fig 1 the total watershed and agricultural water supply areas of the ganwol estuary reservoir are 49 240 ha and 6 445 ha respectively there are four stream runoff and water quality measurement points within the study watershed fig 1 and daily data were collected once a month from 2011 to 2020 in the watershed of this reservoir forests and cultivated lands occupy the majority of area notably agricultural land created by land reclamation development is widely distributed around the reservoir the area ratio for each land use type is 38 1 for rice paddies 15 0 for uplands 27 6 for forests 7 0 for built up lands 3 9 for grasslands 1 2 for barrens and 7 2 for water surfaces agricultural water accounts for approximately 90 of the total water usage in this area therefore desalinated water resources in the ganwol estuary reservoir play an important role for agricultural water supply notably the reservoir has difficulties in supplying agricultural water because of eutrophication and water quality deterioration caused by the recent inflow of point and non point water pollutants hwang et al 2021 in addition oxygen depletion in water bodies and harmful algal blooms caused by eutrophication have led to a shift in the biodiversity and ecosystem balance consequently the reservoir has lost its function as a biological habitat therefore more effective water management and appropriate water quality improvement measures are required to rehabilitate the region and mitigate the environmental stress in the area 2 2 hydrological simulation program fortran environmental fluid dynamics code and water quality analysis simulation program hspf efdc wasp linkage model to consider various water resource factors in an estuary reservoir and comprehensively understand the changes in water body characteristics caused by the different water level conditions we established a watershed lake linkage model that is efficient in terms of time and cost in this study we employed the hspf and the efdc wasp linkage model as the watershed and reservoir models respectively the hspf model simulates watershed runoff and water quality over a long period for a wide range of watershed sizes and conditions donigian et al 1995 kim et al 2021 and it is the only comprehensive model that allows the integrated simulation of land and soil contaminant runoff processes with in stream hydraulic and sediment chemical interactions the model was used for estimating the inflow from upstream the wasp model is a well established 3d deterministic model di toro et al 1983 that provides dynamic compartment modeling for aquatic systems burigato costa et al 2019 the model has the ability to specify the time varying processes of advection dispersion point and diffuse mass loading water quality boundary conditions and other parameters burigato costa et al 2019 franceschini and tsai 2010 zhang et al 2008 the wasp model includes a kinematic hydrodynamic model dynhyd however it was not widely used as it is a one dimensional model seo et al 2010 the usepa revised the efdc which is one of the most widely used 3d models for determining flow in surface water systems and issued an efdc hydro version to be used with the wasp water quality model the efdc and wasp combination has been used in several studies for water quality simulations and it has been reported that the linkage model can be used for more accurate water quality predictions franceschini and tsai 2010 jia et al 2011 quijano et al 2017 seo et al 2012 2009 2010 consequently the water quality of the reservoir was simulated by coupling two 3d numerical models efdc and wasp fig 2 portrays the composition and input data of the watershed and the reservoir linkage models applied in this study the runoff and water quality of upstream were simulated using the hspf model model calibration and validation were applied using the runoff and water quality observation values of four upstream channels dodang dundang waryong and chungji to enhance the reproducibility of the model the simulation results of the runoff and water quality of upstream from the hspf model were used as the boundary conditions for the inflow runoff of the efdc model and inflow water quality of the wasp model the efdc model was used to calculate a mathematical numerical solution related to the water flow using the data of the inflow from upstream along with the pumping station supply and drainage gate discharge data from the krc as the input data and was linked to the water quality module of the wasp model the wasp model was used to simulate the water quality of the reservoir using the data of the upstream inflow pollutant concentration simulated by the hspf model and the hydrological characteristics of the reservoir calculated by the efdc model the model calibration and validation were conducted using the observed water quality data of the reservoir 2 2 1 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model setup we considered the streamflow and water quality measurement points of the ganwol estuary watershed and the hspf model created for this study consist of 32 sub basins 32 river channel segments and 172 land segments hrus daily meteorological data from 2011 to 2020 including data of precipitation temperature average wind speed average humidity and sunshine hours were collected from the korea meteorological administration as land use data a land use map as of the year 2015 from the national geographic information institute ngii of the ministry of land infrastructure and transport in korea was obtained a soil map by the national institute of agricultural sciences and technology was used to obtain soil data and a 1 5000 dem with 30 m spatial resolution was obtained from the ngii in addition we used the daily discharge and water quality data of the public sewage treatment works and livestock manure processing facilities of the national institute of environmental research as the input data for point pollution in the model finally once a month from 2011 to 2020 we collected the daily runoff and water quality data of four streams in the watershed dodang dundang waryong and chungji from the province of chungcheongnam do and used them for model calibration and validation to establish a water quality prediction model that could reasonably implement the hydrology and water quality mechanisms of the study area model calibration from 2016 to 2020 and validation from 2011 to 2015 were conducted at the observation points of runoff and water quality and the values of model parameters were adjusted via a trial and error method three main statistical functions proposed by moriasi et al 2015 namely coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were used to verify the accuracy of the runoff simulations pbias was used as the objective function for the water quality simulation moriasi et al 2015 the minimum and maximum values and calibrated ranges of each model parameter analyzed in this study are listed in table 1 2 2 2 environmental fluid dynamics code and water quality analysis simulation program efdc wasp model setup in this study the efdc model was used as a 3d hydrodynamic analysis model of the estuary reservoir and the wasp model which was linked to the hydrodynamic module of the efdc was used as a reservoir water quality simulation model we simulated the total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations of the estuary water which could be used for water quality management the efdc model grid was organized to simulate the water level of the estuary reservoir based on the measured reservoir survey data from the krc the number of valid computational grids was 282 in the horizontal direction and we arranged the grids in eight equidistant intervals in the vertical direction we used a rectangular coordinate system in the horizontal direction and a sigma coordinate system in the vertical direction additionally the ganwol estuary reservoir has levees in the middle of the reservoir this can lead to a difference in the hydrodynamic and water quality characteristics of upper and lower zones of the reservoir and the effect of gate operation could also be different in each zone therefore we constructed the grids while considering the separation by levees notably we simulated the water level of the ganwol estuary reservoir for 2015 2020 using the data of the inflow from upstream supply amount of pumping stations and discharge amount through the drainage gates as the input data to verify the water level simulation results we compared the simulated water levels and measured water levels on the days when discharge was observed from 2015 to 2020 bottom elevation horizontal grid systems and boundary conditions of the estuary reservoir in the efdc model are shown in fig 3 the hydrodynamic simulation results from the efdc hydro model were linked to the hydrodynamic interface input data of the wasp model and the calibration and validation of the water quality were conducted from 2015 to 2020 using the observed water quality data acquired from the ministry of environment we considered temperature dissolved oxygen do tn tp and chl a for model calibration the related parameters of the wasp model were corrected using the manual approach calibrated values of parameters are as shown in table 2 2 3 drainage gate operation scenario the characteristics of the water and tidal levels of the ganwol estuary reservoir are shown in fig 4 the existing managed water level of the ganwol estuary reservoir is based on securing water supply and ensuring an ease in construction in particular the water level at the time of the construction of the ganwol estuary reservoir was at the elevation of 1 00 m higher than the current water level elevation of 1 70 m this is a result of considering the flood control capacity and the effect of inundation in the rural hinterland rather than prioritizing the water quality of the reservoir therefore it is necessary to understand the effects of managed water level on the reservoir environment 2 3 1 water level management scenarios it is advantageous to keep the managed water level of the estuary reservoir as high as possible to secure the anti drought capacity of the reservoir and improve its water quality a high water level also prevents the inundation of agricultural areas managed water levels are generally set in the range of el 1 70 2 50 m depending on the estuary reservoir and the level can be managed differently during the flood and non flood seasons according to the watershed and irrigation conditions of the reservoir the water level management scenarios considered in this study are listed in table 3 ml s1 is the current managed water level condition of the ganwol estuary reservoir which is at el 1 70 m during the non flood season and el 2 10 m during the flood season 6 21 to 8 20 from ml s2 to ml s6 scenarios were set by increasing the water level in the non flood season at 0 50 m intervals to sufficiently simulate the changes in the water flow area in ml s7 the water level in the non flood season was set as el 1 12 m such that it does not exceed the water flood level of the ganwol estuary reservoir 2 3 2 drainage gate operation conditions and discharge calculation to simulate the hydraulic characteristic changes of the estuary reservoir according to the drainage gate operation the discharge for different water level conditions was calculated and considered in the hydrodynamic model we assumed that discharge begins when the internal water level is higher than the managed water level as well as tidal level and stops when the tidal level is 0 5 m lower than the internal water level during high tide the discharge amount was calculated according to the internal water level tidal level and managed water level conditions we calculated the amount of discharge through the gate for different water level management scenarios by dividing the flow into four types submerged orifice drowned orifice submerged weir and free weir fig 5 the flow coefficients c1 c21 c22 c3 and c4 applied to the discharge amount calculation formula were 0 7 0 6 0 9 0 8 and 0 8 respectively kim 2011 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results tables 4 and 5 and fig 6 portray the runoff and water quality calibration 2016 2020 and validation 2011 2015 results of the hspf model for the four inflow streams dodang dundang waryong and chungji based on the recommended statistics of model performance ratings proposed by moriasi et al 2015 we could verify that the model performed satisfactorily in terms of the calibration results for runoff most of the streams met the satisfactory criteria of r2 nse and pbias r2 0 60 nse 0 50 and pbias 45 however in the case of some streams the runoff under low flow conditions was slightly overestimated because of the influence of the weir located upstream of the measured point and the uncertainty of rainfall data additionally in the dundang stream the number of large storm events during the calibration period were considerably less than that during the validation period this might lead to relatively large differences in the accuracy statistics for calibration and validation periods in terms of the calibration results of water quality all streams achieved good or very good levels of model evaluation criteria of pbias for both the tn and tp concentrations according to the time series graph shown in fig 6 the model performed well in simulating the seasonal changes and the ranges of water quality concentrations the results of the comparison of the simulated water level and measured water level values on the days when discharge was observed from 2015 to 2020 are shown in fig 7 to verify the water level simulation results we compared the simulated water level and measured water level values on the days when discharge was observed from 2015 to 2020 the value of r2 between the measured and simulated values was 0 72 indicating the high reproducibility of the hydrology of the estuary reservoir by the model table 6 and fig 8 portray the calibration and validation results of the water quality of the reservoir calculated using the wasp model in terms of the results of the pbias for the calibration 2018 2020 and validation 2015 2017 periods the tn tp and chl a concentrations all achieved good and very good levels of the model evaluation criteria thus we could verify that the model performed satisfactorily in simulating the water quality of the estuary reservoir 3 2 changes in hydrologic conditions table 7 and fig 9 portray the water level of the ganwol estuary reservoir according to the observed and simulated discharges for different managed water level scenarios calculated using the efdc to more clearly understand the effects of managed water level change we compared the monthly average discharge and water level of the reservoir for some scenarios s0 s1 s3 s5 and s7 as shown in fig 10 currently the managed water level of the ganwol estuary reservoir is el 1 70 m during the non flood season and el 2 10 m during the flood season notably the fluctuation range of the water level is large and the operation manager can adjust the level according to the amount and duration of precipitation and the inflow of pollutants during the simulation period the observed maximum water level was el 0 19 m and the average water levels during the flood and non flood periods were el 1 62 m and el 1 34 m respectively fig 9a a comparison of the discharge characteristics for each management level scenario portrayed that the total annual number of days of discharge was 135 days in s1 and 63 days in s7 the average discharge per day was 1221 000 m3 in s1 but 2532 000 m3 in s7 therefore as the managed water level increased from s1 to s7 the frequency of discharge decreased but the amount of discharge of a day increased based on the comparison of the water levels for each scenario we observed that as the managed water level increased the water level of the reservoir during the non flood period increased however in 2015 and 2017 when the inflow was not large the differences in the water level in the s5 s7 scenarios were not significant fig 9b the calculation results of the maximum daily water level for different scenarios table 7 indicated that the maximum water level in scenarios s5 s7 exceeded the historical 2015 2020 maximum daily water level el 0 19 m thus in the future it will be necessary to comprehensively consider the effects of increased managed water levels on agricultural land by conducting an analysis of the flooding effect for more diverse inflow conditions under the water level conditions of el 0 3 m we compared the monthly average water level and total monthly discharge for different managed water level conditions s0 s1 s3 s5 and s7 fig 10 during the flood season june september the higher the managed level the higher was the monthly discharge due to the increase in the unit discharge resulting from the water level difference inside and outside the drainage gate however during the non flood season october may when the upstream inflow was relatively small the monthly discharge amount decreased with increasing managed water levels which may have resulted from a significant decrease in the discharge frequency 3 3 water quality simulation result fig 11 portrays the boxplots of the average concentrations of tn tp and chl a for each management level scenario s1 to s7 at gw3 and gw1 for the ganwol estuary reservoir compared to that at the upstream inflow point gw3 the water quality fluctuation range for each managed water level scenario was larger at the downstream point gw1 adjacent to the gate at gw3 there was little difference in the average pollutant concentration for each scenario but the maximum pollutant concentration decreased slightly as the management level increased notably gw1 was more affected by the operation of the drainage gate than gw3 at this point for scenarios s1 to s4 the average pollutant concentration increased with the managed water level however for s4 s7 the average pollutant concentration decreased with increasing managed water level but the difference was not significant this was because in the low water level conditions in scenarios s1 to s4 the lower the managed water level the higher was the frequency of discharge and diffusion of pollutants however in water level conditions higher than s4 the water quality was greatly affected by the increase in the water volume of the reservoir we compared the difference in the water quality of the reservoir for 2015 2020 the results of the comparison of the monthly average concentration changes in the tn tp and chl a for different management level scenarios s0 to s7 at gw3 and gw1 are shown in fig 12 during the flood season june august there was little difference in the pollutant concentrations for different managed water level scenarios at both gw1 and gw3 which may be due to the small difference in the discharge frequency and water level based on the operation of the same management level el 2 10 m for different scenarios during the non flood season the difference in pollutant concentration for each scenario was greater at gw1 than at gw3 owing to the flow area change in the reservoir and the influence of the gate operation according to the analysis of the change in the water quality for the different scenarios at gw3 we could conclude that in the spring season march may when the concentration of pollutants in the reservoir increased significantly the water quality improved as the managed water level increased this was because the dilution effect of the pollutant concentration increased due to the increase in the water volume of the reservoir with the managed water level at gw1 the concentration of the pollutants in the non flood season was high in the order of s5 s6 s7 s4 s3 s0 s2 and s1 indicating that the water quality improvement effect of the drainage gate operation was significant in scenarios s1 s4 for scenarios s5 s7 although the management level increased significantly to el 0 30 m negligible water quality improvement effect was observed notably the concentrations of pollutants in s5 s7 were higher than those in the observed discharge conditions owing to the decrease in the flow of the water body and the deposition of pollutants the trend of the difference in the concentration of the water quality parameters for each scenario was similar for tn tp and chl a in terms of the comparison of the changes in the water quality at each point and for each scenario the tp simulation results for each scenario at gw3 and gw1 are presented in a time series graph in fig 13 in term of the comparison of the water quality parameters at each point the differences in the pollutant concentration for each managed water level scenario was not significant at gw3 except for some non flood seasons whereas at gw1 the difference in the pollutant concentration for each scenario was significant especially in the non flood season thus we could infer that the difference in the pollutant concentration for each scenario was larger at gw1 adjacent to the gate than at gw3 as gw1 was significantly affected by the flow fluctuations in the reservoir owing to the operation of the gate the analysis results of the changes in the water quality parameters for the different managed water level scenarios are shown in fig 13 at gw3 section a of fig 12 the higher the managed water level the lower the concentration of pollutants owing to the increase in the water volume in the reservoir at gw1 the concentration of pollutants increased even when the managed water level increased during some periods as shown in section b in fig 13 the higher the managed water level the lower the influence of the drainage gate operation owing to the increase in the cross sectional area of the water flow in the reservoir and the lower the water quality recovery capacity of the reservoir fig 14 portrays the tp concentration reservoir water level gate operation status and changes in the flow velocity of the reservoir for each managed water level scenario for period b in fig 13 in scenarios s1 s5 the water volume in the reservoir increased with the managed water level however the diffusion and discharge of the pollutants decreased because of the decrease in the discharge frequency however in scenarios s5 s7 the pollutant concentration decreased owing to the greater dilution effect by the increase in the water level 4 discussion table 8 shows the simulation results of annual average water levels and water quality for different managed water level scenarios a comparison of the changes in water quality for each water level management scenario at gw1 that is the lower zone of the reservoir with those of the observed discharges revealed that the improvement in water quality was the most significant in s1 in this scenario the concentrations of tn tp and chl a showed a reduction of 5 43 4 46 and 7 45 respectively in contrast in s5 the concentrations of tn tp and chl a increased by 7 68 8 81 and 11 27 respectively indicating that the higher the managed water level the worse the water quality accordingly it is crucial to induce water circulation through discharge while maintaining the managed water level low in the lower zone of the estuary reservoirs where stratification and eutrophication tend to occur conversely at gw3 which is hardly affected by gate operation and where pollutant inflow is active the concentrations of tp and chl a were the worst in the s1 scenario and water quality improved as the managed water level increased but the difference was not apparent this result suggests that additional water quality improvement measures other than inducing water circulation through sluice gate operation are needed to improve the water quality in the upper zone of the estuary reservoir additionally at both gw1 and gw3 it is challenging to meet the water quality target desired in korea tn 1 mg l tp 0 1 mg l and chl a 35 mg m3 by managing the water level alone additional restoration measures are required to improve the water quality of the reservoir therefore water quality is effectively improved solely by integrating various approaches and supplementing their advantages gao et al 2019 in addition to the approach used in this study of controlling hydrodynamic conditions physical measures for restoring the water quality of reservoirs or lakes include reducing external and internal loads the external load is reduced by controlling the inflow of effluents from sewage or industrial wastewater treatment facilities james and pollman 2011 hwang et al 2021 and creating wetlands gregoire et al 2009 ham et al 2010 shutes 2001 for point and nonpoint source management respectively reducing internal load measures include artificial destratification antenucci et al 2005 hypolimnetic oxygenation and aeration system bryant et al 2011 hasan et al 2014 ma et al 2015 and sediment dredging björk et al 2010 james and pollman 2011 liu et al 2016 as suggested by liu et al 2014 and nürnberg 2007 the combination of reservoir flow control measures with external load reduction or hypolimnetic withdrawal can be a low cost and sustainable reservoir restoration measure while increasing the efficiency of pollutant removal therefore decision makers need data from scientific predictions and quantitative assessments of the possible effects of these measures to provide appropriate support for restoring water quality moreover the most economical and effective combination of measures for improving water quality must be derived to fulfil the water quality standard of korea in our simulations the watershed and reservoir models were calibrated using available data followed by the verification of the applicability of the models however there were still uncertainties in the simulation results owing to the unavailability of continuous data for the entire simulation period as discharge and water quality data were collected at a frequency of almost once a month there were also substantial uncertainties associated with the water quality simulations including parameter uncertainties and variability of the stochastic components in estuary reservoirs the operation of sluice gates is affected by the tide level such that the discharge time and amount dischargeable in a short time are limited therefore there is a risk that extensive storm events in a short period could cause inundation of the hinterland notably the increased frequency of extreme rainfall events due to the increasing effects of climate change can aggravate flood damage in our study even in the s7 scenario the maximum water level did not exceed the flood level of the ganwol reservoir el 1 12 m nevertheless our simulation period of 2015 2020 was not long and we did not sufficiently consider the flooding effect on agricultural land under relatively more diverse inflow conditions than those simulated therefore for establishing measures for managing estuary reservoirs in the future it is necessary to predict changes in hydrology and water quality changes under different managed water level conditions using continuous extreme storm event data or climate change prediction data 5 conclusions in this study we developed an hspf efdc wasp linkage model to evaluate the effect of drainage gate operation on the water quality of the ganwol estuary reservoir for different managed water level conditions the drainage gate discharge amounts for different managed water level scenarios were calculated by considering the water level difference inside and outside the drainage gate this difference was then applied to the watershed reservoir linkage model the simulation results for the tn tp and chl a concentrations for different reservoir locations and water level scenarios indicated that the closer the point was to the lower part of the reservoir the greater the effect of the drainage gate operation at gw3 upper zone the water quality of the reservoir tended to improve because of the increase in the dilution effect on the pollutants as the managed water level increased but the difference was not significant however at gw1 lower zone the higher the managed water level the lower was the water quality recovery capacity due to the increase in the water flow area and decrease in the flow velocity in the reservoir therefore at gw1 it is important to induce water circulation of the reservoirs by gate operation while maintaining the managed water level low in terms of deriving the optimal water level management scenario for the ganwol estuary reservoir around gw1 where the pollutant concentrations were high and the effect of water level change was significant the s1 scenario was considered to be the most advantageous for preventing flooding and improving the water quality of the reservoir however as it is difficult to meet the target water quality of lake by managing the water level alone additional physical restoration measures are required to improve the water quality of the reservoir in particular as the major factors affecting the water quality of the reservoir include the formation of stagnant sections resulting from salinity stratification and the elution of pollutants from the bottom sediment it is necessary to identify the effect of salinity stratification on water quality and implement additional measures that can improve the water quality of the estuary substantially in addition it is necessary to derive an optimal water level management plan that considers both long term water quality improvement and flooding effects on agricultural land under more diverse inflow conditions by analyzing the effects of hydrology and water quality of estuary reservoirs this study contributes to modeling the changes in environmental conditions using a watershed and reservoir linkage model and confirming the possibility of improving the water quality of estuary reservoirs via gate operation the results of this study can serve as a foundation to establish an optimal water resource management plan for estuary reservoirs

9043,in korea estuary reservoirs are one of the main water resources for agriculture generally used for water supply while ensuring an appropriate water level the recent inflow of pollutants from watersheds is aggravating water pollution problems in these reservoirs to address this issue the government has implemented effective measures including the control of water level and basin management measures effective water level management of estuary reservoirs can reduce the environmental impact on freshwater and coastal fishing however the current water management measures mainly focus on securing water and ensuring the feasibility of sea dike construction therefore in this study we evaluated the effect of drainage gate operation on the water quality of the ganwol reservoir we established a watershed estuary linkage model the hydrological simulation program fortran environmental fluid dynamics code and water quality analysis simulation program hspf efdc wasp linkage simulation system to comprehensively consider the watershed and water body characteristics and study the water quality changes for differently managed water level scenarios the effect of water level on the water quality of the estuary reservoir was evaluated by considering differently managed water level scenarios in the linkage model the results indicated that the difference in the water quality for each water level scenario was larger at the lower point gw1 of the estuary reservoir than at the upper point gw3 at gw3 the water quality tended to improve with the increasing water level gw1 was significantly affected by the operation of the drainage gate at gw1 the lower the management level was the higher the water quality improvement effect owing to the improvement in the flow in the estuary caused by the increase in the discharge frequency the study results can be used as basic data to prepare an optimal water resource management plan for estuary reservoirs by estimating the water level impact on their future hydrology and water quality keywords ganwol estuary reservoir water quality drainage gate operation managed water level hspf efdc wasp linkage model estuary reservoir management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an estuary reservoir refers to a reservoir that is created artificially by constructing a seawall in an estuary such reservoirs are economical and an efficient water resource hwang et al 2021 the water storage capacity of the estuary reservoirs in korea is about 2 9 billion tons which is about 18 of the domestic agricultural water use the large scale agricultural estuary reservoirs having a storage capacity of more than 5 million tons account for about 45 of the total agricultural water storage seong 2014 currently as the area of paddy fields irrigated or planned for irrigation from estuary reservoirs reaches 123 000 ha in korea estuary reservoirs have become one of the main water resources for agricultural water supply in the country korea rural community corporation krc 2021 additionally estuary reservoirs prevent flooding in the rural hinterland during the flood season as well as high tides through their gate operation therefore it is crucial to securing the sustainability of these reservoirs in general estuary reservoirs are located at the ends of watersheds therefore various pollutants from upstream areas get introduced into them this can lead to addition of excess nutrients and cause impairment of water quality of the reservoirs edmondson et al 1956 lee et al 2010 in addition gate discharge is possible only when the tidal level is lower than the internal water level of estuary reservoirs this limited discharge condition can decrease water circulation in the reservoirs limited water circulation causes retention of polluted water and water body stratification and can eventually result in oxygen depletion i e hypoxia dai et al 2006 hamilton taylor et al 2005 lamping et al 2005 moreover hypoxia can further lead to harmful algal blooms and eutrophication hindering the sustainability of the reservoirs gooday et al 2009 howarth et al 2011 therefore to reduce the vulnerability of the estuary reservoirs it is important to improve water quality in a short period of time both structural and non structural measures are available to improve the water quality of estuary reservoirs structural measures e g sediment dredging wetland construction diffusers flow pumps submerged contact chambers require more time and cost than non structural measures consequently in order to actively and sustainably manage the water quality in estuary reservoirs it is necessary to adopt non structural measures for accelerating water quality recovery in water bodies lürling et al 2020 in particular hypolimnetic withdrawal is a representative non structural measure that rapidly improves the water quality in stratified reservoirs with anoxic hypolimnia nürnberg 2020 however if there is no hypolimnetic withdrawal system sluice gate operation can reduce the stagnant water area and induce water circulation in estuary reservoirs thus the possibility of improving the water quality of estuary reservoirs using upper layer drainage via the gate operation could constitute an environment friendly and economical water quality management measure in reservoirs where hypolimnetic withdrawal is not possible additionally proper water level management based on the drainage gate operation of estuary reservoirs can minimize the negative environmental impacts on the hinterland and coastal fishing however the existing managed water levels of estuary reservoirs are usually based on securing water supply and ensuring an ease in construction therefore the environmental impact of water level is not sufficiently considered accordingly in response to the changes in the hydrological characteristics of reservoirs such as dredging and the need to prepare fundamental measures to improve water quality it is necessary to understand the effect of managed water level on the hydrology and water quality of estuary reservoirs and derive an optimal water level management scenario while considering the environmental effects of the managed water levels in an estuary the final outlet of a stream converges with the seawater therefore to establish an integrated water resource management plan for the estuary reservoir it is important to consider various water resource factors such as hydrology water quality and salinity based on a comprehensive understanding of the watershed and water body characteristics while analyzing changes in environmental conditions of estuary reservoirs based on water quality management measures actual application of these measures and monitoring of environmental factors are useful ways to minimize the uncertainty of results however monitoring all water resource factors of reservoirs can be an expensive and time consuming task bartram and ballance 1996 consequently it is necessary to establish and operate a water quality prediction model that can reasonably simulate the mechanisms of different watersheds and water bodies recently numerous studies have simulated estuary reservoirs by linking watershed hydrological models with different hydrodynamic and water quality models kim et al 2017 park et al 2010 liu et al 2008 lee et al 2018 hwang 2020 notably three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic and numerical water quality models have been developed extensively enabling the simulation of the spatial distribution of the hydrology and water quality characteristics of estuary reservoirs and it has become possible to simulate the phenomena occurring in a water body in more detail yoon and seo 2013 the aims of this study are ⅰ to analyze the effect of drainage gate operation on the water quality of an estuary reservoir using the hydrological simulation program fortran environmental fluid dynamics code and water quality analysis simulation program hspf efdc wasp linkage model and ⅱ to derive an optimal water level management plan 2 material and methods 2 1 study area we selected the ganwol estuary reservoir located in the midwestern part of south korea 36 38 48 n 126 27 16 e as the study area fig 1 the total watershed and agricultural water supply areas of the ganwol estuary reservoir are 49 240 ha and 6 445 ha respectively there are four stream runoff and water quality measurement points within the study watershed fig 1 and daily data were collected once a month from 2011 to 2020 in the watershed of this reservoir forests and cultivated lands occupy the majority of area notably agricultural land created by land reclamation development is widely distributed around the reservoir the area ratio for each land use type is 38 1 for rice paddies 15 0 for uplands 27 6 for forests 7 0 for built up lands 3 9 for grasslands 1 2 for barrens and 7 2 for water surfaces agricultural water accounts for approximately 90 of the total water usage in this area therefore desalinated water resources in the ganwol estuary reservoir play an important role for agricultural water supply notably the reservoir has difficulties in supplying agricultural water because of eutrophication and water quality deterioration caused by the recent inflow of point and non point water pollutants hwang et al 2021 in addition oxygen depletion in water bodies and harmful algal blooms caused by eutrophication have led to a shift in the biodiversity and ecosystem balance consequently the reservoir has lost its function as a biological habitat therefore more effective water management and appropriate water quality improvement measures are required to rehabilitate the region and mitigate the environmental stress in the area 2 2 hydrological simulation program fortran environmental fluid dynamics code and water quality analysis simulation program hspf efdc wasp linkage model to consider various water resource factors in an estuary reservoir and comprehensively understand the changes in water body characteristics caused by the different water level conditions we established a watershed lake linkage model that is efficient in terms of time and cost in this study we employed the hspf and the efdc wasp linkage model as the watershed and reservoir models respectively the hspf model simulates watershed runoff and water quality over a long period for a wide range of watershed sizes and conditions donigian et al 1995 kim et al 2021 and it is the only comprehensive model that allows the integrated simulation of land and soil contaminant runoff processes with in stream hydraulic and sediment chemical interactions the model was used for estimating the inflow from upstream the wasp model is a well established 3d deterministic model di toro et al 1983 that provides dynamic compartment modeling for aquatic systems burigato costa et al 2019 the model has the ability to specify the time varying processes of advection dispersion point and diffuse mass loading water quality boundary conditions and other parameters burigato costa et al 2019 franceschini and tsai 2010 zhang et al 2008 the wasp model includes a kinematic hydrodynamic model dynhyd however it was not widely used as it is a one dimensional model seo et al 2010 the usepa revised the efdc which is one of the most widely used 3d models for determining flow in surface water systems and issued an efdc hydro version to be used with the wasp water quality model the efdc and wasp combination has been used in several studies for water quality simulations and it has been reported that the linkage model can be used for more accurate water quality predictions franceschini and tsai 2010 jia et al 2011 quijano et al 2017 seo et al 2012 2009 2010 consequently the water quality of the reservoir was simulated by coupling two 3d numerical models efdc and wasp fig 2 portrays the composition and input data of the watershed and the reservoir linkage models applied in this study the runoff and water quality of upstream were simulated using the hspf model model calibration and validation were applied using the runoff and water quality observation values of four upstream channels dodang dundang waryong and chungji to enhance the reproducibility of the model the simulation results of the runoff and water quality of upstream from the hspf model were used as the boundary conditions for the inflow runoff of the efdc model and inflow water quality of the wasp model the efdc model was used to calculate a mathematical numerical solution related to the water flow using the data of the inflow from upstream along with the pumping station supply and drainage gate discharge data from the krc as the input data and was linked to the water quality module of the wasp model the wasp model was used to simulate the water quality of the reservoir using the data of the upstream inflow pollutant concentration simulated by the hspf model and the hydrological characteristics of the reservoir calculated by the efdc model the model calibration and validation were conducted using the observed water quality data of the reservoir 2 2 1 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model setup we considered the streamflow and water quality measurement points of the ganwol estuary watershed and the hspf model created for this study consist of 32 sub basins 32 river channel segments and 172 land segments hrus daily meteorological data from 2011 to 2020 including data of precipitation temperature average wind speed average humidity and sunshine hours were collected from the korea meteorological administration as land use data a land use map as of the year 2015 from the national geographic information institute ngii of the ministry of land infrastructure and transport in korea was obtained a soil map by the national institute of agricultural sciences and technology was used to obtain soil data and a 1 5000 dem with 30 m spatial resolution was obtained from the ngii in addition we used the daily discharge and water quality data of the public sewage treatment works and livestock manure processing facilities of the national institute of environmental research as the input data for point pollution in the model finally once a month from 2011 to 2020 we collected the daily runoff and water quality data of four streams in the watershed dodang dundang waryong and chungji from the province of chungcheongnam do and used them for model calibration and validation to establish a water quality prediction model that could reasonably implement the hydrology and water quality mechanisms of the study area model calibration from 2016 to 2020 and validation from 2011 to 2015 were conducted at the observation points of runoff and water quality and the values of model parameters were adjusted via a trial and error method three main statistical functions proposed by moriasi et al 2015 namely coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were used to verify the accuracy of the runoff simulations pbias was used as the objective function for the water quality simulation moriasi et al 2015 the minimum and maximum values and calibrated ranges of each model parameter analyzed in this study are listed in table 1 2 2 2 environmental fluid dynamics code and water quality analysis simulation program efdc wasp model setup in this study the efdc model was used as a 3d hydrodynamic analysis model of the estuary reservoir and the wasp model which was linked to the hydrodynamic module of the efdc was used as a reservoir water quality simulation model we simulated the total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations of the estuary water which could be used for water quality management the efdc model grid was organized to simulate the water level of the estuary reservoir based on the measured reservoir survey data from the krc the number of valid computational grids was 282 in the horizontal direction and we arranged the grids in eight equidistant intervals in the vertical direction we used a rectangular coordinate system in the horizontal direction and a sigma coordinate system in the vertical direction additionally the ganwol estuary reservoir has levees in the middle of the reservoir this can lead to a difference in the hydrodynamic and water quality characteristics of upper and lower zones of the reservoir and the effect of gate operation could also be different in each zone therefore we constructed the grids while considering the separation by levees notably we simulated the water level of the ganwol estuary reservoir for 2015 2020 using the data of the inflow from upstream supply amount of pumping stations and discharge amount through the drainage gates as the input data to verify the water level simulation results we compared the simulated water levels and measured water levels on the days when discharge was observed from 2015 to 2020 bottom elevation horizontal grid systems and boundary conditions of the estuary reservoir in the efdc model are shown in fig 3 the hydrodynamic simulation results from the efdc hydro model were linked to the hydrodynamic interface input data of the wasp model and the calibration and validation of the water quality were conducted from 2015 to 2020 using the observed water quality data acquired from the ministry of environment we considered temperature dissolved oxygen do tn tp and chl a for model calibration the related parameters of the wasp model were corrected using the manual approach calibrated values of parameters are as shown in table 2 2 3 drainage gate operation scenario the characteristics of the water and tidal levels of the ganwol estuary reservoir are shown in fig 4 the existing managed water level of the ganwol estuary reservoir is based on securing water supply and ensuring an ease in construction in particular the water level at the time of the construction of the ganwol estuary reservoir was at the elevation of 1 00 m higher than the current water level elevation of 1 70 m this is a result of considering the flood control capacity and the effect of inundation in the rural hinterland rather than prioritizing the water quality of the reservoir therefore it is necessary to understand the effects of managed water level on the reservoir environment 2 3 1 water level management scenarios it is advantageous to keep the managed water level of the estuary reservoir as high as possible to secure the anti drought capacity of the reservoir and improve its water quality a high water level also prevents the inundation of agricultural areas managed water levels are generally set in the range of el 1 70 2 50 m depending on the estuary reservoir and the level can be managed differently during the flood and non flood seasons according to the watershed and irrigation conditions of the reservoir the water level management scenarios considered in this study are listed in table 3 ml s1 is the current managed water level condition of the ganwol estuary reservoir which is at el 1 70 m during the non flood season and el 2 10 m during the flood season 6 21 to 8 20 from ml s2 to ml s6 scenarios were set by increasing the water level in the non flood season at 0 50 m intervals to sufficiently simulate the changes in the water flow area in ml s7 the water level in the non flood season was set as el 1 12 m such that it does not exceed the water flood level of the ganwol estuary reservoir 2 3 2 drainage gate operation conditions and discharge calculation to simulate the hydraulic characteristic changes of the estuary reservoir according to the drainage gate operation the discharge for different water level conditions was calculated and considered in the hydrodynamic model we assumed that discharge begins when the internal water level is higher than the managed water level as well as tidal level and stops when the tidal level is 0 5 m lower than the internal water level during high tide the discharge amount was calculated according to the internal water level tidal level and managed water level conditions we calculated the amount of discharge through the gate for different water level management scenarios by dividing the flow into four types submerged orifice drowned orifice submerged weir and free weir fig 5 the flow coefficients c1 c21 c22 c3 and c4 applied to the discharge amount calculation formula were 0 7 0 6 0 9 0 8 and 0 8 respectively kim 2011 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results tables 4 and 5 and fig 6 portray the runoff and water quality calibration 2016 2020 and validation 2011 2015 results of the hspf model for the four inflow streams dodang dundang waryong and chungji based on the recommended statistics of model performance ratings proposed by moriasi et al 2015 we could verify that the model performed satisfactorily in terms of the calibration results for runoff most of the streams met the satisfactory criteria of r2 nse and pbias r2 0 60 nse 0 50 and pbias 45 however in the case of some streams the runoff under low flow conditions was slightly overestimated because of the influence of the weir located upstream of the measured point and the uncertainty of rainfall data additionally in the dundang stream the number of large storm events during the calibration period were considerably less than that during the validation period this might lead to relatively large differences in the accuracy statistics for calibration and validation periods in terms of the calibration results of water quality all streams achieved good or very good levels of model evaluation criteria of pbias for both the tn and tp concentrations according to the time series graph shown in fig 6 the model performed well in simulating the seasonal changes and the ranges of water quality concentrations the results of the comparison of the simulated water level and measured water level values on the days when discharge was observed from 2015 to 2020 are shown in fig 7 to verify the water level simulation results we compared the simulated water level and measured water level values on the days when discharge was observed from 2015 to 2020 the value of r2 between the measured and simulated values was 0 72 indicating the high reproducibility of the hydrology of the estuary reservoir by the model table 6 and fig 8 portray the calibration and validation results of the water quality of the reservoir calculated using the wasp model in terms of the results of the pbias for the calibration 2018 2020 and validation 2015 2017 periods the tn tp and chl a concentrations all achieved good and very good levels of the model evaluation criteria thus we could verify that the model performed satisfactorily in simulating the water quality of the estuary reservoir 3 2 changes in hydrologic conditions table 7 and fig 9 portray the water level of the ganwol estuary reservoir according to the observed and simulated discharges for different managed water level scenarios calculated using the efdc to more clearly understand the effects of managed water level change we compared the monthly average discharge and water level of the reservoir for some scenarios s0 s1 s3 s5 and s7 as shown in fig 10 currently the managed water level of the ganwol estuary reservoir is el 1 70 m during the non flood season and el 2 10 m during the flood season notably the fluctuation range of the water level is large and the operation manager can adjust the level according to the amount and duration of precipitation and the inflow of pollutants during the simulation period the observed maximum water level was el 0 19 m and the average water levels during the flood and non flood periods were el 1 62 m and el 1 34 m respectively fig 9a a comparison of the discharge characteristics for each management level scenario portrayed that the total annual number of days of discharge was 135 days in s1 and 63 days in s7 the average discharge per day was 1221 000 m3 in s1 but 2532 000 m3 in s7 therefore as the managed water level increased from s1 to s7 the frequency of discharge decreased but the amount of discharge of a day increased based on the comparison of the water levels for each scenario we observed that as the managed water level increased the water level of the reservoir during the non flood period increased however in 2015 and 2017 when the inflow was not large the differences in the water level in the s5 s7 scenarios were not significant fig 9b the calculation results of the maximum daily water level for different scenarios table 7 indicated that the maximum water level in scenarios s5 s7 exceeded the historical 2015 2020 maximum daily water level el 0 19 m thus in the future it will be necessary to comprehensively consider the effects of increased managed water levels on agricultural land by conducting an analysis of the flooding effect for more diverse inflow conditions under the water level conditions of el 0 3 m we compared the monthly average water level and total monthly discharge for different managed water level conditions s0 s1 s3 s5 and s7 fig 10 during the flood season june september the higher the managed level the higher was the monthly discharge due to the increase in the unit discharge resulting from the water level difference inside and outside the drainage gate however during the non flood season october may when the upstream inflow was relatively small the monthly discharge amount decreased with increasing managed water levels which may have resulted from a significant decrease in the discharge frequency 3 3 water quality simulation result fig 11 portrays the boxplots of the average concentrations of tn tp and chl a for each management level scenario s1 to s7 at gw3 and gw1 for the ganwol estuary reservoir compared to that at the upstream inflow point gw3 the water quality fluctuation range for each managed water level scenario was larger at the downstream point gw1 adjacent to the gate at gw3 there was little difference in the average pollutant concentration for each scenario but the maximum pollutant concentration decreased slightly as the management level increased notably gw1 was more affected by the operation of the drainage gate than gw3 at this point for scenarios s1 to s4 the average pollutant concentration increased with the managed water level however for s4 s7 the average pollutant concentration decreased with increasing managed water level but the difference was not significant this was because in the low water level conditions in scenarios s1 to s4 the lower the managed water level the higher was the frequency of discharge and diffusion of pollutants however in water level conditions higher than s4 the water quality was greatly affected by the increase in the water volume of the reservoir we compared the difference in the water quality of the reservoir for 2015 2020 the results of the comparison of the monthly average concentration changes in the tn tp and chl a for different management level scenarios s0 to s7 at gw3 and gw1 are shown in fig 12 during the flood season june august there was little difference in the pollutant concentrations for different managed water level scenarios at both gw1 and gw3 which may be due to the small difference in the discharge frequency and water level based on the operation of the same management level el 2 10 m for different scenarios during the non flood season the difference in pollutant concentration for each scenario was greater at gw1 than at gw3 owing to the flow area change in the reservoir and the influence of the gate operation according to the analysis of the change in the water quality for the different scenarios at gw3 we could conclude that in the spring season march may when the concentration of pollutants in the reservoir increased significantly the water quality improved as the managed water level increased this was because the dilution effect of the pollutant concentration increased due to the increase in the water volume of the reservoir with the managed water level at gw1 the concentration of the pollutants in the non flood season was high in the order of s5 s6 s7 s4 s3 s0 s2 and s1 indicating that the water quality improvement effect of the drainage gate operation was significant in scenarios s1 s4 for scenarios s5 s7 although the management level increased significantly to el 0 30 m negligible water quality improvement effect was observed notably the concentrations of pollutants in s5 s7 were higher than those in the observed discharge conditions owing to the decrease in the flow of the water body and the deposition of pollutants the trend of the difference in the concentration of the water quality parameters for each scenario was similar for tn tp and chl a in terms of the comparison of the changes in the water quality at each point and for each scenario the tp simulation results for each scenario at gw3 and gw1 are presented in a time series graph in fig 13 in term of the comparison of the water quality parameters at each point the differences in the pollutant concentration for each managed water level scenario was not significant at gw3 except for some non flood seasons whereas at gw1 the difference in the pollutant concentration for each scenario was significant especially in the non flood season thus we could infer that the difference in the pollutant concentration for each scenario was larger at gw1 adjacent to the gate than at gw3 as gw1 was significantly affected by the flow fluctuations in the reservoir owing to the operation of the gate the analysis results of the changes in the water quality parameters for the different managed water level scenarios are shown in fig 13 at gw3 section a of fig 12 the higher the managed water level the lower the concentration of pollutants owing to the increase in the water volume in the reservoir at gw1 the concentration of pollutants increased even when the managed water level increased during some periods as shown in section b in fig 13 the higher the managed water level the lower the influence of the drainage gate operation owing to the increase in the cross sectional area of the water flow in the reservoir and the lower the water quality recovery capacity of the reservoir fig 14 portrays the tp concentration reservoir water level gate operation status and changes in the flow velocity of the reservoir for each managed water level scenario for period b in fig 13 in scenarios s1 s5 the water volume in the reservoir increased with the managed water level however the diffusion and discharge of the pollutants decreased because of the decrease in the discharge frequency however in scenarios s5 s7 the pollutant concentration decreased owing to the greater dilution effect by the increase in the water level 4 discussion table 8 shows the simulation results of annual average water levels and water quality for different managed water level scenarios a comparison of the changes in water quality for each water level management scenario at gw1 that is the lower zone of the reservoir with those of the observed discharges revealed that the improvement in water quality was the most significant in s1 in this scenario the concentrations of tn tp and chl a showed a reduction of 5 43 4 46 and 7 45 respectively in contrast in s5 the concentrations of tn tp and chl a increased by 7 68 8 81 and 11 27 respectively indicating that the higher the managed water level the worse the water quality accordingly it is crucial to induce water circulation through discharge while maintaining the managed water level low in the lower zone of the estuary reservoirs where stratification and eutrophication tend to occur conversely at gw3 which is hardly affected by gate operation and where pollutant inflow is active the concentrations of tp and chl a were the worst in the s1 scenario and water quality improved as the managed water level increased but the difference was not apparent this result suggests that additional water quality improvement measures other than inducing water circulation through sluice gate operation are needed to improve the water quality in the upper zone of the estuary reservoir additionally at both gw1 and gw3 it is challenging to meet the water quality target desired in korea tn 1 mg l tp 0 1 mg l and chl a 35 mg m3 by managing the water level alone additional restoration measures are required to improve the water quality of the reservoir therefore water quality is effectively improved solely by integrating various approaches and supplementing their advantages gao et al 2019 in addition to the approach used in this study of controlling hydrodynamic conditions physical measures for restoring the water quality of reservoirs or lakes include reducing external and internal loads the external load is reduced by controlling the inflow of effluents from sewage or industrial wastewater treatment facilities james and pollman 2011 hwang et al 2021 and creating wetlands gregoire et al 2009 ham et al 2010 shutes 2001 for point and nonpoint source management respectively reducing internal load measures include artificial destratification antenucci et al 2005 hypolimnetic oxygenation and aeration system bryant et al 2011 hasan et al 2014 ma et al 2015 and sediment dredging björk et al 2010 james and pollman 2011 liu et al 2016 as suggested by liu et al 2014 and nürnberg 2007 the combination of reservoir flow control measures with external load reduction or hypolimnetic withdrawal can be a low cost and sustainable reservoir restoration measure while increasing the efficiency of pollutant removal therefore decision makers need data from scientific predictions and quantitative assessments of the possible effects of these measures to provide appropriate support for restoring water quality moreover the most economical and effective combination of measures for improving water quality must be derived to fulfil the water quality standard of korea in our simulations the watershed and reservoir models were calibrated using available data followed by the verification of the applicability of the models however there were still uncertainties in the simulation results owing to the unavailability of continuous data for the entire simulation period as discharge and water quality data were collected at a frequency of almost once a month there were also substantial uncertainties associated with the water quality simulations including parameter uncertainties and variability of the stochastic components in estuary reservoirs the operation of sluice gates is affected by the tide level such that the discharge time and amount dischargeable in a short time are limited therefore there is a risk that extensive storm events in a short period could cause inundation of the hinterland notably the increased frequency of extreme rainfall events due to the increasing effects of climate change can aggravate flood damage in our study even in the s7 scenario the maximum water level did not exceed the flood level of the ganwol reservoir el 1 12 m nevertheless our simulation period of 2015 2020 was not long and we did not sufficiently consider the flooding effect on agricultural land under relatively more diverse inflow conditions than those simulated therefore for establishing measures for managing estuary reservoirs in the future it is necessary to predict changes in hydrology and water quality changes under different managed water level conditions using continuous extreme storm event data or climate change prediction data 5 conclusions in this study we developed an hspf efdc wasp linkage model to evaluate the effect of drainage gate operation on the water quality of the ganwol estuary reservoir for different managed water level conditions the drainage gate discharge amounts for different managed water level scenarios were calculated by considering the water level difference inside and outside the drainage gate this difference was then applied to the watershed reservoir linkage model the simulation results for the tn tp and chl a concentrations for different reservoir locations and water level scenarios indicated that the closer the point was to the lower part of the reservoir the greater the effect of the drainage gate operation at gw3 upper zone the water quality of the reservoir tended to improve because of the increase in the dilution effect on the pollutants as the managed water level increased but the difference was not significant however at gw1 lower zone the higher the managed water level the lower was the water quality recovery capacity due to the increase in the water flow area and decrease in the flow velocity in the reservoir therefore at gw1 it is important to induce water circulation of the reservoirs by gate operation while maintaining the managed water level low in terms of deriving the optimal water level management scenario for the ganwol estuary reservoir around gw1 where the pollutant concentrations were high and the effect of water level change was significant the s1 scenario was considered to be the most advantageous for preventing flooding and improving the water quality of the reservoir however as it is difficult to meet the target water quality of lake by managing the water level alone additional physical restoration measures are required to improve the water quality of the reservoir in particular as the major factors affecting the water quality of the reservoir include the formation of stagnant sections resulting from salinity stratification and the elution of pollutants from the bottom sediment it is necessary to identify the effect of salinity stratification on water quality and implement additional measures that can improve the water quality of the estuary substantially in addition it is necessary to derive an optimal water level management plan that considers both long term water quality improvement and flooding effects on agricultural land under more diverse inflow conditions by analyzing the effects of hydrology and water quality of estuary reservoirs this study contributes to modeling the changes in environmental conditions using a watershed and reservoir linkage model and confirming the possibility of improving the water quality of estuary reservoirs via gate operation the results of this study can serve as a foundation to establish an optimal water resource management plan for estuary reservoirs

9044,the photovoltaic pumping systems are useful for irrigation but must ensure that water is applied to the crop as uniformly and efficiently as possible at all points of the irrigation subunit to solve this problem the i selector model was developed it allowed to generate irrigation schedules with the application of quality criteria both for combinations of subunits studied individually with a standard deviation in the applied water sheet 2 8 m3 ha 1 and for combinations of several subunits studied working together depending on among other things the available photovoltaic energy and the extraction capacity of the well allowing to compare and analyze the best irrigation strategy to be used and being a flexible model that can be used in any case of study thus the i selector model has generated irrigation schedules to establish the optimal sequence of opening combinations of subunits distributed by daily time slots thus indicating the convenience of its use at each time of day for the best use of water and energy in a high power solar pumping system located in albacete spain keywords solar pumping system global efficiency quality irrigation irrigation management data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the agriculture is one of the sectors that presents increased vulnerability tingem et al 2009 with rainfed systems being especially fragile when there are changes in weather conditions valverde et al 2015 thus the aquifers are overexploited molina et al 2009 since to a large extent they are the main sources of water supply in irrigation only in castilla la mancha they account for more than 65 of the water consumed moreno et al 2010 this situation suggests a scenario of savings and efficiency in even more restrictive use of water and energy this must necessarily be driven by adequate modernization in irrigation oriented towards increasing the productivity of water and profitability as well as enhancing the reliability and flexibility of the water deliveries considering the existent demands and complying with environmental requirements playán and mateos 2006 furthermore there is a need for the use of tools and simulation models and the performance of appropriate and efficient irrigation practices tarjuelo et al 2015 which must be combined with new accurate technologies that allow information to be gathered from different sources in the decision making processes díaz et al 2020 the modernization processes implemented have achieved a reduction in water use energy consumption however has increased exponentially corominas 2010 as well as the type of crop and the irrigation area other variables related to the design of the irrigation system also influence energy consumption these include the water supply point underground or surface sizing of pressure pipes both the distribution network and the subunits length and diameters and their layout land topography and elevations correct sectorization carrillo cobo et al 2014 the final pressurization of the selected irrigation system sprinkler drip or gravity jackson et al 2010 zehnder et al 2003 and of great importance the pumping system cervera gascó et al 2021a 2021b córcoles et al 2019 singh et al 2002 evidently and after a good design of the irrigation infrastructure it is essential to manage the complete system it has been shown that efficient irrigation scheduling saves water and energy and helps farmers achieve better yields and quality s taghvaeian et al 2020 it is worth noting that the growth of photovoltaic solar energy as a renewable source in particular not only in the domestic and industrial environments but also in the rural and agricultural environment as a sustainable solution bringing environmental benefits todde et al 2019 where solar pumping systems are a clear alternative to other both conventional and renewable energy sources aliyu et al 2018 chandel et al 2015 combining this type of energy has enabled the installation of solar pumping systems in many countries such as the us vick et al 2003 india pande et al 2003 turkey senol 2012 spain reca et al 2016 tarjuelo et al 2015 and algeria bouzidi 2011 however one of the main problems detected in solar pumping systems is the lack of uniform emission in irrigation subunits and the low efficiency of water use in these types of systems which has a direct impact on irrigation quality contreras et al 2020 this is mainly because the activation of the combinations of irrigation subunits occurs without precise knowledge of whether the photovoltaic energy generated is sufficient to achieve quality irrigation with generally speaking seeing water coming out of the drippers being considered sufficient moreover another important aspect when referring to the requirements for irrigation is the need to have precise knowledge of the water needs of each crop lenton 2014 lópez lópez et al 2018a 2018b however it may be the case that these amounts cannot be supplied since the supply depends on the energy generation system the extraction capacity and the availability of water thus the irrigation capacity of a system is a result of the conditions mentioned above appropriate management of the opening of subunit combinations exclusively when quality irrigation is guaranteed requires simulation models that can estimate these conditions there are numerous models for the management of hydraulic systems carrión et al 2016 2013 gonzález perea et al 2014 2019a 2019b rodríguez díaz et al 2011 tarjuelo et al 2015 and for the management of photovoltaic power generation systems aliyu et al 2018 chandel et al 2015 li et al 2017 poompavai and kowsalya 2019 shen et al 2008 zerhouni et al 2010 moreover there are several studies that highlight the benefits and feasibility of using solar irrigation pumps aliyu et al 2018 ledesma et al 2022 reca et al 2016 senthil kumar et al 2020 and control algorithms have been developed that allow for the integrated management of photovoltaic generation systems and hydraulic models calero lara et al 2021 gonzález perea et al 2019a 2019b however no model has been developed that accurately integrates the photovoltaic power generation component the simulation of pumping systems and hydraulic modeling in order to address irrigation management considering highly variable photovoltaic power generation both at the time of the year and throughout the day and in between days of the irrigation campaign moreover no irrigation scheduling algorithms based on accurate simulation of the behavior of the system as a whole have been found the aim of this work is to generate a management model for an irrigation system powered by photovoltaic solar energy applying algorithms that decide in line with different criteria the opening order and irrigation time of the subunits taking into account the available photovoltaic power according to the moment of the day and the extraction potential of the well and with the premise of achieving correct irrigation quality 2 materials and methods the model generated in this work called i selector was developed in matlab mathworks inc massachusetts usa it complements the work developed in the evasor model cervera gascó et al 2020 and uses its results to establish the best optimal opening sequence of subunit combinations to be irrigated in real time in an automated manner applying the model in previous irrigation campaigns helps determine the irrigation potential of each subunit and establish irrigation priorities based on the probability of opening each subunit during each irrigation month that is those subunits that have greater difficulties to irrigate with solar energy that is less irrigation probability due to its high energy demand will be prioritized over those with greater irrigation possibilities with solar energy that is less irrigation difficulty due to its low energy demand so that all subunits receive a similar amount of water per surface area 2 1 case study the management model was applied at an irrigated farm called peruelos which is located in the southeast of albacete spain latitude 38 994 longitude 1 859 the total area is 90 ha distributed in 20 subunits of highly irregular shape and topography with a total difference between the highest and the lowest point of the farm of about 63 m table 1 the crop is almond trees with a planting frame of 7 7 m2 the irrigation system installed is an underground drip irrigation system powered by photovoltaic solar energy the underground water is extracted from a well with a dynamic level of approximately 200 m deep the water level undergoes extreme variations depending on the day of the year and the flow rate of the system the maximum discharge of the well is 7 5 l s 1 an accurate description of the pumping system to obtain the pump characteristic curves appears in cervera gascó et al 2021a 2021b fig 1 shows the description and location of the different elements that make up the solar pumping system studied 2 2 description of the i selector model the simulations in the i selector model are carried out for all the months in this case from march to october 8 months of the 2017 irrigation campaign analyzed in 10 minute time periods which allows highly accurate results to be obtained for this period of time the following are determined the irrigation quality parameters of each subunit the hydraulic performance of the distribution network the performance of the pumping system and the performance of all the photovoltaic production system for a more detailed description two sections with different functionalities can be distinguished in the i selector model as shown in fig 2 the first refers to the implementation of a series of predefined requirements that ensure a defined irrigation quality as well as the determination of the combinations of subunits that comply with these requirements and their potential hourly analysis the second refers to the selection engine that the model uses to establish the best optimal sequence for activating irrigation combinations the real time analysis and water application as well as the generation of irrigation calendars that allow recommendation tables to be obtained for the activation of combinations both individually and in combination with others 2 3 1st section application of irrigation restrictions to ensure suitable quality of the irrigation events in the first section for the correct selection scheduling and operation of all photovoltaic pumping installations a series of limitations or conditions are established that depend according to this case on the components of the study installation value of available photovoltaic power whose value must be sufficient to obtain the minimum power established through the synthetic data obtained with evasor maximum pressure of the distribution pipe to guarantee the integrity of the installation without rupture due to overpressure maximum pressure of the drippers inside the subunit to guarantee the integrity of the installation without overpressure rupture minimum emission uniformity established to determine a minimum quality during the irrigation process minimum irrigation time to avoid short irrigations maximum well capacity which limits the maximum extraction flow rate these restrictions presented in the model and the values considered in the case study of peruelos are explained below taking into account that the model has the sufficient versatility for other values to be established with other criteria 2 3 1 photovoltaic power available the production of power generated in a solar photovoltaic installation depends on the day and the period of time studied during the year consequently the i selector model checks whether the photovoltaic power supplied to the input of the irrigation pump obtained with the i solar model cervera gascó et al 2021a 2021b is located within the operating power limits of each combination of selected subunits and determines whether that combination of subunits can or cannot be irrigated at that particular moment in time throughout the day certain critical moments can be distinguished in relation to the practice of irrigation at dawn the photoelectric effect begins to occur in the photovoltaic generator which allows a certain power to be attained but not sufficient to reach the pressure that guarantees sufficient irrigation uniformity this moment is identified as the start of the daily workday sdw the same happens at the end of the day at sunset which is identified as the end of the daily workday edw after the sdw during the course of the day a certain power is reached that allows irrigation to be carried out with sufficient quality where a minimum irrigation uniformity is guaranteed this moment is referred to as start of the quality irrigation sqi finally end of quality irrigation eqi is defined as the moment after which insufficient power is generated to be able to perform quality irrigation fig 3 depicts a scheme where the critical moments for irrigation are observed as well as the areas where the subunits present more favorable conditions that is low energy demand and which can be irrigated at times of low irradiance corresponding to the morning and afternoon periods respectively the subunits with a high energy demand cannot be irrigated during these periods while the central hours of the day provide high values of power that are effective for operating high energy demanding subunits heds that require high energy and that can only be irrigated during this period of the day however during this period if necessary the low energy demanding subunits leds can also be irrigated 2 3 2 maximum pressures in the installation other checks that the model performs are related to the maximum levels of pressure that the distribution pipes and the dripper pipes are able to withstand the i selector model developed allows any value to be established for these variables however in the specific case of peruelos the manufacturer indicated that the maximum working pressure of the distribution pipe is 60 mca while the maximum working pressure of the dripper is 35 mca in the case of the dripper and depending on the pressure reached at the head of the subunit at each moment the model checks this pressure through the results obtained in the presud irregular module moreno et al 2016 determining whether any dripper has exceeded its maximum pressure established by the manufacturer in this case 35 mca inside of the subunit if so the combination of subunits evaluated at that moment is discarded giving the opportunity to another combination of subunits for its evaluation by this criteria the same occurs with the maximum pressure of the distribution pipe evaluated using the solar net module cervera gascó et al 2020 this restriction ensures the integrity of the irrigation infrastructure 2 3 3 minimum irrigation uniformity to provide the necessary irrigation quality the model checks for emission uniformity eu various sources of information have discussed the minimum acceptable value for application without presenting a clear guideline or concrete value that defines this limit keller and bliesner 1990 this is typically a decision to be taken by the manager and evaluated according to the type of crop water availability and irrigation time availability among many other factors therefore and although any value can be established for this variable in this case study in order to guarantee a good irrigation quality for all subunits a minimum value of 85 is established all the subunits with a value lower than that indicated for each evaluated moment are discarded for irrigation this information can be obtained thanks to the presud irregular module 2 3 4 minimum irrigation time in order to have continuous irrigation periods for efficient use of water by the crop and taking into account that the time periods used are 10 min the minimum irrigation duration for each combination of subunits is set at 1 h this minimum value can also be selected although lower times are not practical especially in case of surface irrigation which would lend too great a weight to the evaporative component in cases of underground irrigation as at peruelos evaporation losses would not be a problem but this limit is established in order to consider minimum times to reach hydraulic equilibrium once the subunit combination is activated 2 3 5 maximum extraction flow rate the last restriction corresponds to the maximum capacity of the well those options that demand a flow rate that exceeds the well capacity are not valid in this case study the capacity of the well has a maximum value of 7 5 l s 1 therefore the model evaluates that in no case can this value be exceeded since the water extraction levels would be compromised as well as the recharge rate 2 4 2nd section open subunit and irrigation time selection algorithm once all the above checks are carried out a data matrix of smaller dimensions than the original one is obtained containing all the combinations of subunits that meet the restrictions described 2 4 1 calculation of opening probabilities of subunit combinations to achieve quality irrigation events the model returns the total useful working hours obtained every 10 min for each day with these total useful irrigation hours per day uiht defined by the time period between the sqi and the eqi and the useful irrigation hours available daily for each combination of subunits uihcs we can determine the probability of the opening of each combination of subunits pocs in the day eq 1 and thus prioritize their opening at each moment 1 pocs uih t uih cs thus the most leds combinations will have a 100 probability while the most heds ones will have a lower value as an example a combination of subunits with a pocs 50 will have half the time to perform a quality irrigation schedule than the most leds combinations that day with a pocs 100 2 4 2 distribution of the applied water sheet in this second section the model studies analyzes and selects combinations of subunits for irrigation both individually and jointly in both cases the priority is to uniformly distribute the applied water sheet according to eq 2 2 l a v s being la applied water sheet m3 ha 1 v the volume applied m3 and s the area of the subunit ha therefore in this case if we wish to supply the same sheet of water to each subunit the activation priority of the combinations of subunits will be defined by the criteria described in the methodology and implemented in the i selector model for a better understanding of how the model works the decision making criteria for irrigation events for each day are now described step by step the frequency of data collection in this work is 10 min and each value at this time constitutes an instant of irrigation so that the model from the first instant of the sqi recognizes the combinations of subunits that present possibilities for the event of quality irrigation based on the restrictions established in section 2 3 the selected subunit combinations are studied according to the irrigation probabilities calculated using eq 1 volume parameters are checked at all moments to ensure that the subunits studied do not exceed the water sheet equilibrium threshold so that they all have an equal chance of being irrigated in case of the subunit or subunits that form the evaluated combination exceeding the equilibrium threshold this combination is discarded and the opportunity is offered to the next one until the requirement is met all selected subunit combinations must have at least one full hour of irrigation if the model proves that this is not the case the subunit is discarded offering the opportunity to the next one until the requirement is met as a last resort if the initial requirement is not met the model evaluates possibilities up to a minimum time of 30 min moreover there are certain difficulties to be taken into account in the eqi of the daily workday in order to optimize the adjustment of subunit combinations the i selector model checks at all moments whether there is a possibility of a full hour of irrigation of the subunit combinations however these conditions may not be satisfied for the eqi of the daily workday and the time distribution may need to be readjusted thus it is considered appropriate that if there is not a full hour of irrigation two options should be used the first option is to check for a minimum of 30 min in case of availability of the time mentioned above or longer it is assigned to a combination of subunits the second one is that if the time available is less than 30 min of irrigation the i selector model checks whether there is a combination of subunits able to undertake the corresponding set time of 1 h plus all the remaining time difference up to the eqi finally once all the checks are carried out the available subunit combinations are selected for this purpose from the group of combinations of subunits obtained the combination with the lowest irrigation probability value is selected the reason for this choice is to prioritize combinations of subunits that despite having certain irrigation probabilities are more restrictive than others with all the information completed daily irrigation schedules are elaborated that allow us to know the moment at which the optimal irrigation sequence of the combinations of subunits irrigation hours applied volumes as well as the average amount of water sheet distributed has been produced 3 results and discussion this model yields the results of the management irrigation for combinations of individual subunits or for combinations with several subunits working together in this work the analysis was carried out for two cases for combinations of individual subunits 20 combinations for combinations of two subunits working together 190 combinations nevertheless the i selector model could also be used to combine three or more subunits because it has been programmed to work with several combinations of subunits however the limitation of opening several simultaneous subunits is conditioned by the energy produced by the pv generator as well as the capacity of the well for its extraction and the pump that must be able to provide the required flow rate in the subunits determining the combinations that should have been opened to optimize the irrigation in previous campaigns is useful to make recommendations on activating them in real time based on the probability of each combination being irrigated with high quality 3 1 1st section determination and analysis of total available hours a common but not greatly recommendable technique in solar irrigation is to irrigate when a flow is discharged from any dripper in the installation even if the flow is low this generates very low irrigation uniformities and therefore an inefficient use of resources to avoid this problem the number of hours available for irrigation is determined applying the conditions described in the methodology related to irrigation quality which ensure an eu greater than or equal to 85 the correct pressure in distribution pipes and dripper the minimum irrigation time of 1 h and a capacity lower than or equal to the maximum of the well these restrictions mean that the available irrigation hours will be even lower but will ensure efficient water use 3 1 1 total number of hours available a number of factors including temperature and wind speed can substantially impact the final photovoltaic production and therefore the total number of hours available for irrigation the presence of clouds must also be considered as it may cause variations in the previous values from one campaign to another table 2 shows the total number of available hours obtained for each month of the 2017 campaign in the different time intervals sdw edw and sqi eqi for the two cases of subunit combinations studied as can be seen the differences in time in hours between the sdw edw and the sqi eqi are noteworthy moreover there are also time differences between the sqi eqi for the 1 subunit combination and for the 2 subunit combination since the activation energy requirements for the 2 subunit combination are higher and thus the potential hours available for activation are lower additionally it can be observed that the average number of available hours of daily operation in this farm in both cases for the months of march april august and september the most restrictive months is lower than the 8 h of reference corresponding to the off peak hours in conventional irrigation tariffs however this effect is more substantial with the activation of 2 subunit combinations where the decrease is more generalized even in the less restrictive months with very close approximations to these reference hours for the case study in which the crop implanted on the peruelos farm is almond trees two periods are very sensitive to water stress spring when the fruits grow rapidly and the end of summer beginning of autumn which is when the fruit load for the following campaign will be determined goldhamer et al 2006 these periods correspond to the months of a lower number of potential hours and therefore to a lower number of daily average hours for irrigation it is consequently essential to optimally manage the combinations that are activated during these periods 3 1 2 average number of daily operating hours with high irrigation quality the average number of hours per day gives an idea of the irrigation possibilities of each combination of subunits thus in fig 4a it can be observed that the average number of hours available per day to carry out high quality irrigation for combinations of 1 subunit is in all cases less than 8 h with it being possible to reach 3 h on average in the irrigation campaign for combination 7 with daily average values of 1 2 h in the month of october for this combination minimizing the possibilities of carrying out post harvest irrigation in some cases the standard deviation of the number of available hours is located between 1 and 1 3 h a high value so the number of quality hours is highly dependent on the irrigation month in fig 4b the number of daily available hours to carry out high quality irrigation for combinations of 2 subunits is even less than 7 h in this case the standard deviation interval is located between 1 and 1 5 h which adds a greater degree of dependence 3 1 3 time slots with high irrigation quality in the daytime some very practical information that can serve as a reference for the irrigation manager to visualize the different possibilities of opening combinations of subunits in their installation are the time slots between the sqi and eqi ranges which is with high irrigation quality as an example we present the time slots for june 2 of the 2017 irrigation campaign for the combination of 1 subunit fig 5a and for the combination of 2 subunits fig 5b it can be observed that the discontinuities that appear in the figures green possibility of opening white no possibility of opening are caused by the absence or decrease of power related to the increased working temperature of the photovoltaic generator passing of clouds etc which make it impossible to open the combinations with quality criteria thus depending on the possible opening times of the subunit combinations an activation priority criterion can be determined in real time 3 2 2nd section optimal selection of irrigation combinations analysis and generation of schedules in this 2nd section of the i selector model and with the information obtained in the 1st section of this model irrigation schedules and recommendation tables are automatically generated which depend on irradiance conditions temperature wind speed and initial water energy in the form of the dynamic well level thus the most suitable combinations of subunits to be opened are selected according to their probability of opening and subject to the conditions of the practical exercise of irrigation as has been described in the methodology 3 2 1 generation of optimized irrigation schedules the i selector model is applied for all the days of the study months of the selected irrigation campaign however as an example in fig 6a the optimized irrigation schedule for the combination of 1 subunit is represented and in fig 6b for the combination of 2 subunits both resulting from the application of the i selector model in the peruelos farm for june 2 of the 2017 irrigation campaign the figures indicate the combination of subunits that should be irrigated at each time of the day in both figures it can be observed that the most heds combinations can only be irrigated during the central hours of the day with high irradiation levels where the photovoltaic power generated is sufficient to provide irrigation with high uniformity such as the example of combination 7 in combination with 1 subunit on the other hand in the initial and final periods of the day the combinations of subunits selected are the most leds that is those that need less irradiation and power to irrigate with quality and which following the example of combinations of 1 subunit would be in this case the combination 20 and 13 moreover it can be seen that the selection of 2 subunit combinations is given by the appropriate balance in the election of subunit combinations adjusted to the photovoltaic power generated both in the central hours of the day when the most leds are combined with the most heds ones as an example combination 19 corresponding to subunits 1 and 20 and in the initial and final periods of the day when the most leds subunits are combined with each other as an example combination 147 corresponding to subunits 11 and 13 3 2 2 number of hours used and monthly water sheet for each subunit in this work the irrigation interval evaluated was monthly hence the daily quantification of each month allowed us to obtain the irrigation schedule for the entire irrigation campaign having calculated for each subunit the accumulated water sheet in the combination of 1 subunit and in the combination of 2 subunits for each month of the irrigation campaign for combinations of 1 subunit fig 7a the distribution of the average applied water sheet for each month was very similar to the maximum value reached in that month which indicates that in all the subunits the water sheet was uniformly distributed and therefore the irrigation management was appropriate since all the points of the plot received the same amount of water however in the case of 2 subunit combinations fig 7b it can be observed that the distribution of the average applied water sheet for each month presents great variability between subunits causing substantial differences in the maximum and average values which indicates that the subunits were not uniformly irrigated moreover it should also be noted that in general the best irrigated subunits and therefore those with the highest number of accumulated irrigation hours correspond to those with the most low energy conditions while the worst irrigated subunits are in the contrasting situation therefore there may exist a lack of available photovoltaic power to allow the activation of subunits under higher energy demand when they work together 3 2 3 water sheet for the entire irrigation campaign in each subunit with the previous values the applied water sheet was plotted for both the combination of 1 subunit and for the combination of 2 subunits fig 8 for each subunit across the entire irrigation campaign thus it can be seen that for the combination of 1 subunit the average applied water sheet was 228 7 m3 ha 1 with a standard deviation between subunits of 2 8 m3 ha 1 indicating the high uniformity of the applied water sheet between subunits these values of average applied water sheet may be low 228 7 m3 ha 1 but they are influenced on the one hand by the possible irrigation hours that the photovoltaic system is capable of supplying and on the other hand by the irrigation strategy defined when programming the model to select combinations of subunits individually therefore taking into account that irrigation planning was carried out for all the subunits that compose the farm under study these amounts would constitute support irrigation to help in the final production of the crop since according to some authors the maximum irrigation volumes applied to almond trees in the climatic conditions of southern spain can be close to 8000 m3 ha 1 gutiérrez gordillo et al 2019 jofre cekalovic et al 2022 lópez lópez et al 2018a 2018b in the case of the use of 2 subunit combinations the applied water sheet distribution significantly increased its value however there are significant inequalities that caused the most leds to achieve values higher than 600 m3 ha 1 while the most heds are in some cases far below 220 m3 ha 1 indeed subunit 7 was not even irrigated this is justified by the fact that a large percentage of the time was used for the most leds which were those most irrigated while the remaining subunits were not used for as much time due to their higher energy demand and were thus poorly irrigated therefore the statistical values conclude with a mean sheet of applied water of 347 m3 ha 1 and a standard deviation of 237 8 m3 ha 1 thus taking into account the evolution in the results obtained previously it does not make sense to combine more than 2 subunits working together and if there were the possibility of making combinations of 3 subunits working together in any case it would only be possible with the subunits with low energy demand leds because it would not be possible to do it with those with high energy demand heds therefore the use of combinations of 3 subunits working together would possibly have worse consequences in irrigation management than those achieved with combinations of 2 subunits working together and therefore this irrigation strategy is not recommended in this case in addition the use of combinations of 3 subunits working together could exceed the extraction capacity of the well as well as the need to have sufficient photovoltaic energy for its activation therefore it is concluded that according to the characteristics presented in this case study this solar pumping system has been designed and works well for the individual management of irrigation subunits 3 2 4 water volumes for each month during the entire irrigation campaign moreover fig 9 shows the volume of water applied for both the combination of 1 subunit and for the combination of 2 subunits for the different months of the irrigation campaign on the peruelos farm for the combination of 1 subunit the total volume applied was 20 610 0 m3 with the use of a total of 1736 5 h for irrigation however for the combination of 2 subunits the total volume applied was 26 463 3 m3 with the use of a total of 1436 3 h for irrigation as with the sheet of water the volume of water supplied as is logical increased although not significantly since the low participation of the most heds which in many cases require higher volumes of water contributed to the lower than expected value 3 2 5 recommendation tables for opening subunit combinations finally using the i selector model it was possible to generate a mapping that indicates the frequency or number of times of opening of the combinations of subunits and the moment in which this occurred for each month studied across the entire irrigation campaign as an example fig 10a represents the mapping for the combination of 1 subunit for the month of june of the 2017 irrigation campaign the color scale goes from 0 no opening up to 6 opening of 6 or more times this figure visually reflects the trend of the combinations of subunits for their opening and operation according to the type of irrigation strategy used showing a greater repetition of combinations of more leds in the extremes of the day and of the most heds ones in the central hours of the day fig 10b shows the mapping for the combination of 2 subunits for the month of june of the 2017 irrigation campaign where 2 clearly differentiated zones can be observed these correspond to the opening of more heds combinations located between 1 and 120 which were poorly used and to the opening of more leds combinations located between 120 and 190 which were predominantly used this reflects a lack of photovoltaic power in the solar pumping system to activate the most heds moreover it can be seen that many combinations of subunits were not irrigated with the information of all the months included in the irrigation campaign recommendation tables were generated for opening subunit combinations table 3 for 1 subunit combination these provide useful hourly information for irrigation managers about the percentage of utilization of the different combinations as well as the average irradiance of operation for the corresponding time period this global information is key and determines in real time the optimal selection of irrigation combinations to make efficient use of the water and energy available table 3 shows all the combinations of 1 subunit while table 4 as an example depicts the 5 best combinations of 2 subunits for each period of time considered due to the high number of combinations formed in this case 4 conclusions this study reveals the need to generate irrigation management models with solar photovoltaic energy given the complexity of the conditions of irradiance temperature wind speed and initial energy of the water in the form of the dynamic level of the well in order to make optimal use of the water and the available energy the i selector model allows us to incorporate different parameters that are determinants of achieving the required irrigation quality for each case being a flexible model that can be used in any case of study using the i selector model optimal irrigation schedules in combinations of 1 and 2 subunits depending on the irrigation strategy used can be generated from climatic data from previous campaigns this information is of great interest because although climatic conditions suffer considerable interannual variations the main conditioning factors and recommendations for the opening of combinations of subunits of a complex irrigation system can be determined thus determining the most heds combinations considering the time available to perform quality irrigation allows subunits with a lower temporal probability of being irrigated to be organized and prioritized so that a uniform sheet of water can be applied in all the farm although these values may undergo variations that on the one hand might be influenced by the analysis of better irrigation strategies or on the other hand by the owner s decisions since in scenarios of water scarcity it is not the same to irrigate the 20 subunits with irrigation deficit than to irrigate specifically with the 10 best subunits and obtain a significant increase in crop productivity in any case it has been demonstrated that the i selector model distributes the water according to the available photovoltaic energy and the extraction capacity of the well gauge and not only by the only the water needs as a contribution of ideas one of the characteristics that can be observed on the farm is the great variability in the characteristics of the soil even in its tonality which affects the water retention of the different subunits this can mean that for the same target some subunits need more time and water than others the implementation of precision technologies would allow us to obtain characteristic coefficients that define the state of the soil in the different subunits these could be used in the i selector model to provide more irrigation time and quantity of water to subunits with poorer soil conditions less irrigation time and a lower quantity of water compared to subunits with better soil conditions another interesting aspect is that the development of predictive models based on artificial intelligence makes it possible to estimate future situations these predictions of weather or of available power could be used by the i selector model to take irrigation scheduling decisions in real time based on climatic conditions in the past and the predicted future funding this research was funded by

9044,the photovoltaic pumping systems are useful for irrigation but must ensure that water is applied to the crop as uniformly and efficiently as possible at all points of the irrigation subunit to solve this problem the i selector model was developed it allowed to generate irrigation schedules with the application of quality criteria both for combinations of subunits studied individually with a standard deviation in the applied water sheet 2 8 m3 ha 1 and for combinations of several subunits studied working together depending on among other things the available photovoltaic energy and the extraction capacity of the well allowing to compare and analyze the best irrigation strategy to be used and being a flexible model that can be used in any case of study thus the i selector model has generated irrigation schedules to establish the optimal sequence of opening combinations of subunits distributed by daily time slots thus indicating the convenience of its use at each time of day for the best use of water and energy in a high power solar pumping system located in albacete spain keywords solar pumping system global efficiency quality irrigation irrigation management data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the agriculture is one of the sectors that presents increased vulnerability tingem et al 2009 with rainfed systems being especially fragile when there are changes in weather conditions valverde et al 2015 thus the aquifers are overexploited molina et al 2009 since to a large extent they are the main sources of water supply in irrigation only in castilla la mancha they account for more than 65 of the water consumed moreno et al 2010 this situation suggests a scenario of savings and efficiency in even more restrictive use of water and energy this must necessarily be driven by adequate modernization in irrigation oriented towards increasing the productivity of water and profitability as well as enhancing the reliability and flexibility of the water deliveries considering the existent demands and complying with environmental requirements playán and mateos 2006 furthermore there is a need for the use of tools and simulation models and the performance of appropriate and efficient irrigation practices tarjuelo et al 2015 which must be combined with new accurate technologies that allow information to be gathered from different sources in the decision making processes díaz et al 2020 the modernization processes implemented have achieved a reduction in water use energy consumption however has increased exponentially corominas 2010 as well as the type of crop and the irrigation area other variables related to the design of the irrigation system also influence energy consumption these include the water supply point underground or surface sizing of pressure pipes both the distribution network and the subunits length and diameters and their layout land topography and elevations correct sectorization carrillo cobo et al 2014 the final pressurization of the selected irrigation system sprinkler drip or gravity jackson et al 2010 zehnder et al 2003 and of great importance the pumping system cervera gascó et al 2021a 2021b córcoles et al 2019 singh et al 2002 evidently and after a good design of the irrigation infrastructure it is essential to manage the complete system it has been shown that efficient irrigation scheduling saves water and energy and helps farmers achieve better yields and quality s taghvaeian et al 2020 it is worth noting that the growth of photovoltaic solar energy as a renewable source in particular not only in the domestic and industrial environments but also in the rural and agricultural environment as a sustainable solution bringing environmental benefits todde et al 2019 where solar pumping systems are a clear alternative to other both conventional and renewable energy sources aliyu et al 2018 chandel et al 2015 combining this type of energy has enabled the installation of solar pumping systems in many countries such as the us vick et al 2003 india pande et al 2003 turkey senol 2012 spain reca et al 2016 tarjuelo et al 2015 and algeria bouzidi 2011 however one of the main problems detected in solar pumping systems is the lack of uniform emission in irrigation subunits and the low efficiency of water use in these types of systems which has a direct impact on irrigation quality contreras et al 2020 this is mainly because the activation of the combinations of irrigation subunits occurs without precise knowledge of whether the photovoltaic energy generated is sufficient to achieve quality irrigation with generally speaking seeing water coming out of the drippers being considered sufficient moreover another important aspect when referring to the requirements for irrigation is the need to have precise knowledge of the water needs of each crop lenton 2014 lópez lópez et al 2018a 2018b however it may be the case that these amounts cannot be supplied since the supply depends on the energy generation system the extraction capacity and the availability of water thus the irrigation capacity of a system is a result of the conditions mentioned above appropriate management of the opening of subunit combinations exclusively when quality irrigation is guaranteed requires simulation models that can estimate these conditions there are numerous models for the management of hydraulic systems carrión et al 2016 2013 gonzález perea et al 2014 2019a 2019b rodríguez díaz et al 2011 tarjuelo et al 2015 and for the management of photovoltaic power generation systems aliyu et al 2018 chandel et al 2015 li et al 2017 poompavai and kowsalya 2019 shen et al 2008 zerhouni et al 2010 moreover there are several studies that highlight the benefits and feasibility of using solar irrigation pumps aliyu et al 2018 ledesma et al 2022 reca et al 2016 senthil kumar et al 2020 and control algorithms have been developed that allow for the integrated management of photovoltaic generation systems and hydraulic models calero lara et al 2021 gonzález perea et al 2019a 2019b however no model has been developed that accurately integrates the photovoltaic power generation component the simulation of pumping systems and hydraulic modeling in order to address irrigation management considering highly variable photovoltaic power generation both at the time of the year and throughout the day and in between days of the irrigation campaign moreover no irrigation scheduling algorithms based on accurate simulation of the behavior of the system as a whole have been found the aim of this work is to generate a management model for an irrigation system powered by photovoltaic solar energy applying algorithms that decide in line with different criteria the opening order and irrigation time of the subunits taking into account the available photovoltaic power according to the moment of the day and the extraction potential of the well and with the premise of achieving correct irrigation quality 2 materials and methods the model generated in this work called i selector was developed in matlab mathworks inc massachusetts usa it complements the work developed in the evasor model cervera gascó et al 2020 and uses its results to establish the best optimal opening sequence of subunit combinations to be irrigated in real time in an automated manner applying the model in previous irrigation campaigns helps determine the irrigation potential of each subunit and establish irrigation priorities based on the probability of opening each subunit during each irrigation month that is those subunits that have greater difficulties to irrigate with solar energy that is less irrigation probability due to its high energy demand will be prioritized over those with greater irrigation possibilities with solar energy that is less irrigation difficulty due to its low energy demand so that all subunits receive a similar amount of water per surface area 2 1 case study the management model was applied at an irrigated farm called peruelos which is located in the southeast of albacete spain latitude 38 994 longitude 1 859 the total area is 90 ha distributed in 20 subunits of highly irregular shape and topography with a total difference between the highest and the lowest point of the farm of about 63 m table 1 the crop is almond trees with a planting frame of 7 7 m2 the irrigation system installed is an underground drip irrigation system powered by photovoltaic solar energy the underground water is extracted from a well with a dynamic level of approximately 200 m deep the water level undergoes extreme variations depending on the day of the year and the flow rate of the system the maximum discharge of the well is 7 5 l s 1 an accurate description of the pumping system to obtain the pump characteristic curves appears in cervera gascó et al 2021a 2021b fig 1 shows the description and location of the different elements that make up the solar pumping system studied 2 2 description of the i selector model the simulations in the i selector model are carried out for all the months in this case from march to october 8 months of the 2017 irrigation campaign analyzed in 10 minute time periods which allows highly accurate results to be obtained for this period of time the following are determined the irrigation quality parameters of each subunit the hydraulic performance of the distribution network the performance of the pumping system and the performance of all the photovoltaic production system for a more detailed description two sections with different functionalities can be distinguished in the i selector model as shown in fig 2 the first refers to the implementation of a series of predefined requirements that ensure a defined irrigation quality as well as the determination of the combinations of subunits that comply with these requirements and their potential hourly analysis the second refers to the selection engine that the model uses to establish the best optimal sequence for activating irrigation combinations the real time analysis and water application as well as the generation of irrigation calendars that allow recommendation tables to be obtained for the activation of combinations both individually and in combination with others 2 3 1st section application of irrigation restrictions to ensure suitable quality of the irrigation events in the first section for the correct selection scheduling and operation of all photovoltaic pumping installations a series of limitations or conditions are established that depend according to this case on the components of the study installation value of available photovoltaic power whose value must be sufficient to obtain the minimum power established through the synthetic data obtained with evasor maximum pressure of the distribution pipe to guarantee the integrity of the installation without rupture due to overpressure maximum pressure of the drippers inside the subunit to guarantee the integrity of the installation without overpressure rupture minimum emission uniformity established to determine a minimum quality during the irrigation process minimum irrigation time to avoid short irrigations maximum well capacity which limits the maximum extraction flow rate these restrictions presented in the model and the values considered in the case study of peruelos are explained below taking into account that the model has the sufficient versatility for other values to be established with other criteria 2 3 1 photovoltaic power available the production of power generated in a solar photovoltaic installation depends on the day and the period of time studied during the year consequently the i selector model checks whether the photovoltaic power supplied to the input of the irrigation pump obtained with the i solar model cervera gascó et al 2021a 2021b is located within the operating power limits of each combination of selected subunits and determines whether that combination of subunits can or cannot be irrigated at that particular moment in time throughout the day certain critical moments can be distinguished in relation to the practice of irrigation at dawn the photoelectric effect begins to occur in the photovoltaic generator which allows a certain power to be attained but not sufficient to reach the pressure that guarantees sufficient irrigation uniformity this moment is identified as the start of the daily workday sdw the same happens at the end of the day at sunset which is identified as the end of the daily workday edw after the sdw during the course of the day a certain power is reached that allows irrigation to be carried out with sufficient quality where a minimum irrigation uniformity is guaranteed this moment is referred to as start of the quality irrigation sqi finally end of quality irrigation eqi is defined as the moment after which insufficient power is generated to be able to perform quality irrigation fig 3 depicts a scheme where the critical moments for irrigation are observed as well as the areas where the subunits present more favorable conditions that is low energy demand and which can be irrigated at times of low irradiance corresponding to the morning and afternoon periods respectively the subunits with a high energy demand cannot be irrigated during these periods while the central hours of the day provide high values of power that are effective for operating high energy demanding subunits heds that require high energy and that can only be irrigated during this period of the day however during this period if necessary the low energy demanding subunits leds can also be irrigated 2 3 2 maximum pressures in the installation other checks that the model performs are related to the maximum levels of pressure that the distribution pipes and the dripper pipes are able to withstand the i selector model developed allows any value to be established for these variables however in the specific case of peruelos the manufacturer indicated that the maximum working pressure of the distribution pipe is 60 mca while the maximum working pressure of the dripper is 35 mca in the case of the dripper and depending on the pressure reached at the head of the subunit at each moment the model checks this pressure through the results obtained in the presud irregular module moreno et al 2016 determining whether any dripper has exceeded its maximum pressure established by the manufacturer in this case 35 mca inside of the subunit if so the combination of subunits evaluated at that moment is discarded giving the opportunity to another combination of subunits for its evaluation by this criteria the same occurs with the maximum pressure of the distribution pipe evaluated using the solar net module cervera gascó et al 2020 this restriction ensures the integrity of the irrigation infrastructure 2 3 3 minimum irrigation uniformity to provide the necessary irrigation quality the model checks for emission uniformity eu various sources of information have discussed the minimum acceptable value for application without presenting a clear guideline or concrete value that defines this limit keller and bliesner 1990 this is typically a decision to be taken by the manager and evaluated according to the type of crop water availability and irrigation time availability among many other factors therefore and although any value can be established for this variable in this case study in order to guarantee a good irrigation quality for all subunits a minimum value of 85 is established all the subunits with a value lower than that indicated for each evaluated moment are discarded for irrigation this information can be obtained thanks to the presud irregular module 2 3 4 minimum irrigation time in order to have continuous irrigation periods for efficient use of water by the crop and taking into account that the time periods used are 10 min the minimum irrigation duration for each combination of subunits is set at 1 h this minimum value can also be selected although lower times are not practical especially in case of surface irrigation which would lend too great a weight to the evaporative component in cases of underground irrigation as at peruelos evaporation losses would not be a problem but this limit is established in order to consider minimum times to reach hydraulic equilibrium once the subunit combination is activated 2 3 5 maximum extraction flow rate the last restriction corresponds to the maximum capacity of the well those options that demand a flow rate that exceeds the well capacity are not valid in this case study the capacity of the well has a maximum value of 7 5 l s 1 therefore the model evaluates that in no case can this value be exceeded since the water extraction levels would be compromised as well as the recharge rate 2 4 2nd section open subunit and irrigation time selection algorithm once all the above checks are carried out a data matrix of smaller dimensions than the original one is obtained containing all the combinations of subunits that meet the restrictions described 2 4 1 calculation of opening probabilities of subunit combinations to achieve quality irrigation events the model returns the total useful working hours obtained every 10 min for each day with these total useful irrigation hours per day uiht defined by the time period between the sqi and the eqi and the useful irrigation hours available daily for each combination of subunits uihcs we can determine the probability of the opening of each combination of subunits pocs in the day eq 1 and thus prioritize their opening at each moment 1 pocs uih t uih cs thus the most leds combinations will have a 100 probability while the most heds ones will have a lower value as an example a combination of subunits with a pocs 50 will have half the time to perform a quality irrigation schedule than the most leds combinations that day with a pocs 100 2 4 2 distribution of the applied water sheet in this second section the model studies analyzes and selects combinations of subunits for irrigation both individually and jointly in both cases the priority is to uniformly distribute the applied water sheet according to eq 2 2 l a v s being la applied water sheet m3 ha 1 v the volume applied m3 and s the area of the subunit ha therefore in this case if we wish to supply the same sheet of water to each subunit the activation priority of the combinations of subunits will be defined by the criteria described in the methodology and implemented in the i selector model for a better understanding of how the model works the decision making criteria for irrigation events for each day are now described step by step the frequency of data collection in this work is 10 min and each value at this time constitutes an instant of irrigation so that the model from the first instant of the sqi recognizes the combinations of subunits that present possibilities for the event of quality irrigation based on the restrictions established in section 2 3 the selected subunit combinations are studied according to the irrigation probabilities calculated using eq 1 volume parameters are checked at all moments to ensure that the subunits studied do not exceed the water sheet equilibrium threshold so that they all have an equal chance of being irrigated in case of the subunit or subunits that form the evaluated combination exceeding the equilibrium threshold this combination is discarded and the opportunity is offered to the next one until the requirement is met all selected subunit combinations must have at least one full hour of irrigation if the model proves that this is not the case the subunit is discarded offering the opportunity to the next one until the requirement is met as a last resort if the initial requirement is not met the model evaluates possibilities up to a minimum time of 30 min moreover there are certain difficulties to be taken into account in the eqi of the daily workday in order to optimize the adjustment of subunit combinations the i selector model checks at all moments whether there is a possibility of a full hour of irrigation of the subunit combinations however these conditions may not be satisfied for the eqi of the daily workday and the time distribution may need to be readjusted thus it is considered appropriate that if there is not a full hour of irrigation two options should be used the first option is to check for a minimum of 30 min in case of availability of the time mentioned above or longer it is assigned to a combination of subunits the second one is that if the time available is less than 30 min of irrigation the i selector model checks whether there is a combination of subunits able to undertake the corresponding set time of 1 h plus all the remaining time difference up to the eqi finally once all the checks are carried out the available subunit combinations are selected for this purpose from the group of combinations of subunits obtained the combination with the lowest irrigation probability value is selected the reason for this choice is to prioritize combinations of subunits that despite having certain irrigation probabilities are more restrictive than others with all the information completed daily irrigation schedules are elaborated that allow us to know the moment at which the optimal irrigation sequence of the combinations of subunits irrigation hours applied volumes as well as the average amount of water sheet distributed has been produced 3 results and discussion this model yields the results of the management irrigation for combinations of individual subunits or for combinations with several subunits working together in this work the analysis was carried out for two cases for combinations of individual subunits 20 combinations for combinations of two subunits working together 190 combinations nevertheless the i selector model could also be used to combine three or more subunits because it has been programmed to work with several combinations of subunits however the limitation of opening several simultaneous subunits is conditioned by the energy produced by the pv generator as well as the capacity of the well for its extraction and the pump that must be able to provide the required flow rate in the subunits determining the combinations that should have been opened to optimize the irrigation in previous campaigns is useful to make recommendations on activating them in real time based on the probability of each combination being irrigated with high quality 3 1 1st section determination and analysis of total available hours a common but not greatly recommendable technique in solar irrigation is to irrigate when a flow is discharged from any dripper in the installation even if the flow is low this generates very low irrigation uniformities and therefore an inefficient use of resources to avoid this problem the number of hours available for irrigation is determined applying the conditions described in the methodology related to irrigation quality which ensure an eu greater than or equal to 85 the correct pressure in distribution pipes and dripper the minimum irrigation time of 1 h and a capacity lower than or equal to the maximum of the well these restrictions mean that the available irrigation hours will be even lower but will ensure efficient water use 3 1 1 total number of hours available a number of factors including temperature and wind speed can substantially impact the final photovoltaic production and therefore the total number of hours available for irrigation the presence of clouds must also be considered as it may cause variations in the previous values from one campaign to another table 2 shows the total number of available hours obtained for each month of the 2017 campaign in the different time intervals sdw edw and sqi eqi for the two cases of subunit combinations studied as can be seen the differences in time in hours between the sdw edw and the sqi eqi are noteworthy moreover there are also time differences between the sqi eqi for the 1 subunit combination and for the 2 subunit combination since the activation energy requirements for the 2 subunit combination are higher and thus the potential hours available for activation are lower additionally it can be observed that the average number of available hours of daily operation in this farm in both cases for the months of march april august and september the most restrictive months is lower than the 8 h of reference corresponding to the off peak hours in conventional irrigation tariffs however this effect is more substantial with the activation of 2 subunit combinations where the decrease is more generalized even in the less restrictive months with very close approximations to these reference hours for the case study in which the crop implanted on the peruelos farm is almond trees two periods are very sensitive to water stress spring when the fruits grow rapidly and the end of summer beginning of autumn which is when the fruit load for the following campaign will be determined goldhamer et al 2006 these periods correspond to the months of a lower number of potential hours and therefore to a lower number of daily average hours for irrigation it is consequently essential to optimally manage the combinations that are activated during these periods 3 1 2 average number of daily operating hours with high irrigation quality the average number of hours per day gives an idea of the irrigation possibilities of each combination of subunits thus in fig 4a it can be observed that the average number of hours available per day to carry out high quality irrigation for combinations of 1 subunit is in all cases less than 8 h with it being possible to reach 3 h on average in the irrigation campaign for combination 7 with daily average values of 1 2 h in the month of october for this combination minimizing the possibilities of carrying out post harvest irrigation in some cases the standard deviation of the number of available hours is located between 1 and 1 3 h a high value so the number of quality hours is highly dependent on the irrigation month in fig 4b the number of daily available hours to carry out high quality irrigation for combinations of 2 subunits is even less than 7 h in this case the standard deviation interval is located between 1 and 1 5 h which adds a greater degree of dependence 3 1 3 time slots with high irrigation quality in the daytime some very practical information that can serve as a reference for the irrigation manager to visualize the different possibilities of opening combinations of subunits in their installation are the time slots between the sqi and eqi ranges which is with high irrigation quality as an example we present the time slots for june 2 of the 2017 irrigation campaign for the combination of 1 subunit fig 5a and for the combination of 2 subunits fig 5b it can be observed that the discontinuities that appear in the figures green possibility of opening white no possibility of opening are caused by the absence or decrease of power related to the increased working temperature of the photovoltaic generator passing of clouds etc which make it impossible to open the combinations with quality criteria thus depending on the possible opening times of the subunit combinations an activation priority criterion can be determined in real time 3 2 2nd section optimal selection of irrigation combinations analysis and generation of schedules in this 2nd section of the i selector model and with the information obtained in the 1st section of this model irrigation schedules and recommendation tables are automatically generated which depend on irradiance conditions temperature wind speed and initial water energy in the form of the dynamic well level thus the most suitable combinations of subunits to be opened are selected according to their probability of opening and subject to the conditions of the practical exercise of irrigation as has been described in the methodology 3 2 1 generation of optimized irrigation schedules the i selector model is applied for all the days of the study months of the selected irrigation campaign however as an example in fig 6a the optimized irrigation schedule for the combination of 1 subunit is represented and in fig 6b for the combination of 2 subunits both resulting from the application of the i selector model in the peruelos farm for june 2 of the 2017 irrigation campaign the figures indicate the combination of subunits that should be irrigated at each time of the day in both figures it can be observed that the most heds combinations can only be irrigated during the central hours of the day with high irradiation levels where the photovoltaic power generated is sufficient to provide irrigation with high uniformity such as the example of combination 7 in combination with 1 subunit on the other hand in the initial and final periods of the day the combinations of subunits selected are the most leds that is those that need less irradiation and power to irrigate with quality and which following the example of combinations of 1 subunit would be in this case the combination 20 and 13 moreover it can be seen that the selection of 2 subunit combinations is given by the appropriate balance in the election of subunit combinations adjusted to the photovoltaic power generated both in the central hours of the day when the most leds are combined with the most heds ones as an example combination 19 corresponding to subunits 1 and 20 and in the initial and final periods of the day when the most leds subunits are combined with each other as an example combination 147 corresponding to subunits 11 and 13 3 2 2 number of hours used and monthly water sheet for each subunit in this work the irrigation interval evaluated was monthly hence the daily quantification of each month allowed us to obtain the irrigation schedule for the entire irrigation campaign having calculated for each subunit the accumulated water sheet in the combination of 1 subunit and in the combination of 2 subunits for each month of the irrigation campaign for combinations of 1 subunit fig 7a the distribution of the average applied water sheet for each month was very similar to the maximum value reached in that month which indicates that in all the subunits the water sheet was uniformly distributed and therefore the irrigation management was appropriate since all the points of the plot received the same amount of water however in the case of 2 subunit combinations fig 7b it can be observed that the distribution of the average applied water sheet for each month presents great variability between subunits causing substantial differences in the maximum and average values which indicates that the subunits were not uniformly irrigated moreover it should also be noted that in general the best irrigated subunits and therefore those with the highest number of accumulated irrigation hours correspond to those with the most low energy conditions while the worst irrigated subunits are in the contrasting situation therefore there may exist a lack of available photovoltaic power to allow the activation of subunits under higher energy demand when they work together 3 2 3 water sheet for the entire irrigation campaign in each subunit with the previous values the applied water sheet was plotted for both the combination of 1 subunit and for the combination of 2 subunits fig 8 for each subunit across the entire irrigation campaign thus it can be seen that for the combination of 1 subunit the average applied water sheet was 228 7 m3 ha 1 with a standard deviation between subunits of 2 8 m3 ha 1 indicating the high uniformity of the applied water sheet between subunits these values of average applied water sheet may be low 228 7 m3 ha 1 but they are influenced on the one hand by the possible irrigation hours that the photovoltaic system is capable of supplying and on the other hand by the irrigation strategy defined when programming the model to select combinations of subunits individually therefore taking into account that irrigation planning was carried out for all the subunits that compose the farm under study these amounts would constitute support irrigation to help in the final production of the crop since according to some authors the maximum irrigation volumes applied to almond trees in the climatic conditions of southern spain can be close to 8000 m3 ha 1 gutiérrez gordillo et al 2019 jofre cekalovic et al 2022 lópez lópez et al 2018a 2018b in the case of the use of 2 subunit combinations the applied water sheet distribution significantly increased its value however there are significant inequalities that caused the most leds to achieve values higher than 600 m3 ha 1 while the most heds are in some cases far below 220 m3 ha 1 indeed subunit 7 was not even irrigated this is justified by the fact that a large percentage of the time was used for the most leds which were those most irrigated while the remaining subunits were not used for as much time due to their higher energy demand and were thus poorly irrigated therefore the statistical values conclude with a mean sheet of applied water of 347 m3 ha 1 and a standard deviation of 237 8 m3 ha 1 thus taking into account the evolution in the results obtained previously it does not make sense to combine more than 2 subunits working together and if there were the possibility of making combinations of 3 subunits working together in any case it would only be possible with the subunits with low energy demand leds because it would not be possible to do it with those with high energy demand heds therefore the use of combinations of 3 subunits working together would possibly have worse consequences in irrigation management than those achieved with combinations of 2 subunits working together and therefore this irrigation strategy is not recommended in this case in addition the use of combinations of 3 subunits working together could exceed the extraction capacity of the well as well as the need to have sufficient photovoltaic energy for its activation therefore it is concluded that according to the characteristics presented in this case study this solar pumping system has been designed and works well for the individual management of irrigation subunits 3 2 4 water volumes for each month during the entire irrigation campaign moreover fig 9 shows the volume of water applied for both the combination of 1 subunit and for the combination of 2 subunits for the different months of the irrigation campaign on the peruelos farm for the combination of 1 subunit the total volume applied was 20 610 0 m3 with the use of a total of 1736 5 h for irrigation however for the combination of 2 subunits the total volume applied was 26 463 3 m3 with the use of a total of 1436 3 h for irrigation as with the sheet of water the volume of water supplied as is logical increased although not significantly since the low participation of the most heds which in many cases require higher volumes of water contributed to the lower than expected value 3 2 5 recommendation tables for opening subunit combinations finally using the i selector model it was possible to generate a mapping that indicates the frequency or number of times of opening of the combinations of subunits and the moment in which this occurred for each month studied across the entire irrigation campaign as an example fig 10a represents the mapping for the combination of 1 subunit for the month of june of the 2017 irrigation campaign the color scale goes from 0 no opening up to 6 opening of 6 or more times this figure visually reflects the trend of the combinations of subunits for their opening and operation according to the type of irrigation strategy used showing a greater repetition of combinations of more leds in the extremes of the day and of the most heds ones in the central hours of the day fig 10b shows the mapping for the combination of 2 subunits for the month of june of the 2017 irrigation campaign where 2 clearly differentiated zones can be observed these correspond to the opening of more heds combinations located between 1 and 120 which were poorly used and to the opening of more leds combinations located between 120 and 190 which were predominantly used this reflects a lack of photovoltaic power in the solar pumping system to activate the most heds moreover it can be seen that many combinations of subunits were not irrigated with the information of all the months included in the irrigation campaign recommendation tables were generated for opening subunit combinations table 3 for 1 subunit combination these provide useful hourly information for irrigation managers about the percentage of utilization of the different combinations as well as the average irradiance of operation for the corresponding time period this global information is key and determines in real time the optimal selection of irrigation combinations to make efficient use of the water and energy available table 3 shows all the combinations of 1 subunit while table 4 as an example depicts the 5 best combinations of 2 subunits for each period of time considered due to the high number of combinations formed in this case 4 conclusions this study reveals the need to generate irrigation management models with solar photovoltaic energy given the complexity of the conditions of irradiance temperature wind speed and initial energy of the water in the form of the dynamic level of the well in order to make optimal use of the water and the available energy the i selector model allows us to incorporate different parameters that are determinants of achieving the required irrigation quality for each case being a flexible model that can be used in any case of study using the i selector model optimal irrigation schedules in combinations of 1 and 2 subunits depending on the irrigation strategy used can be generated from climatic data from previous campaigns this information is of great interest because although climatic conditions suffer considerable interannual variations the main conditioning factors and recommendations for the opening of combinations of subunits of a complex irrigation system can be determined thus determining the most heds combinations considering the time available to perform quality irrigation allows subunits with a lower temporal probability of being irrigated to be organized and prioritized so that a uniform sheet of water can be applied in all the farm although these values may undergo variations that on the one hand might be influenced by the analysis of better irrigation strategies or on the other hand by the owner s decisions since in scenarios of water scarcity it is not the same to irrigate the 20 subunits with irrigation deficit than to irrigate specifically with the 10 best subunits and obtain a significant increase in crop productivity in any case it has been demonstrated that the i selector model distributes the water according to the available photovoltaic energy and the extraction capacity of the well gauge and not only by the only the water needs as a contribution of ideas one of the characteristics that can be observed on the farm is the great variability in the characteristics of the soil even in its tonality which affects the water retention of the different subunits this can mean that for the same target some subunits need more time and water than others the implementation of precision technologies would allow us to obtain characteristic coefficients that define the state of the soil in the different subunits these could be used in the i selector model to provide more irrigation time and quantity of water to subunits with poorer soil conditions less irrigation time and a lower quantity of water compared to subunits with better soil conditions another interesting aspect is that the development of predictive models based on artificial intelligence makes it possible to estimate future situations these predictions of weather or of available power could be used by the i selector model to take irrigation scheduling decisions in real time based on climatic conditions in the past and the predicted future funding this research was funded by
