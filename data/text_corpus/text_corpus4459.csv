22295,this work has numerically studied the effects of the coverage ratio and angular position of a pair of fin shaped strips on the hydrodynamic forces and wake structures of a circular cylinder at both low and medium reynolds numbers re 60 500 using direct numerical simulation dns the coverage ratio varies from 0 11 to 0 22 corresponding to the coverage angle β of a strip from 20 to 40 the angular position θ measured from the forward stagnation point to the front edge of strips ranges from 30 to 120 with increment of 30 the numerical results indicate that the hydrodynamic coefficients are sensitive to the coverage and placement angles of the strips the fluid forces are reduced with the introduction of a couple of 20 fin shaped strips while they are amplified by placing 30 fin shaped strips or 40 fin shaped strips in the front surface of cylinder the amplification suppression is associated with the development of boundary layer and the wake structure embodied in the length of recirculation bubble the wake width the tripping and reattachment of boundary layer as well as the separation point by placing a pair of 40 fin shaped strips at θ 60 the time mean drag and the lift fluctuation at re 180 are increased by 38 7 and 97 7 respectively for the cylinder equipped with 30 fin shaped strips at θ 30 the three dimensional mode a and mode b wake structures are observed at medium re 200 500 keywords wake structure fin shaped strips hydrodynamic coefficient vortex shedding direct numerical simulation 1 introduction flow over a circular cylinder is ubiquitous and of great interest in both daily life and engineering practice wake instability emerges when the reynolds number is larger than 47 henderson 1997 where reynolds number is defined as re u d ν u is the free stream velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity resulting in periodic vortex shedding accompanied by time varying aerodynamic or hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinder surface a great many methods have been proposed to stabilize the flow wake and reduce the fluid forces either actively or passively choi et al 2008 zhu and gao 2017 zhu et al 2019a 2019b compared to the active control passive control is easier to be implemented in practice without the requirement of external energy input the passive techniques could be classified into two categories a attaching additive devices to the cylinder or placing additive devices nearby the cylinder and b modifying the geometrical shape of the cylinder splitter plates fairings control rods and helical strake are some typical additive devices the former two are treated as near wake stabilizers which prevent the interaction of entrainment layers kwon and choi 1996 reported that the vortex shedding can be completely mitigated by attaching a sufficient long splitter plate in the wake of cylinder while the plate length depends on the reynolds number similarly the chord length of fairings is a key parameter influencing the suppression zhu et al 2017 examined the control effect of a triangular fairing and found the fairing with a tip angle within 90 110 possessed a good performance in preventing vortex shedding the same wake control was attained by an elliptic fairing zhu et al 2018a which effectively delayed the separation of boundary layer due to the streamlined profile zhu and yao 2015 numerically evaluated the passive control of multiple rods uniformly around a circular cylinder with the rods number increased from 3 up to 36 although the small control rods disturb the flow boundary layer and attain a significant reduction in lift force the mean drag force acting on the cylinder surface is gradually increased with the rods number the similar features were observed by lee et al 2014 for helical strakes whose performance is mainly determined by the pitch and height of strakes although the wake control effectiveness of the aforementioned additive devices has been confirmed it is difficult and expensive in handling and installing them in practice in contrast surface roughness and protrusion are simpler and cheaper options bearman and harvey 1993 experimentally investigated the drag reduction of a dimpled circular cylinder and reported that the roughened cylinder has a lower drag coefficient over a reynolds number range from 4 104 to 3 105 as compared to a smooth cylinder nevertheless the drag reduction is negligible in the reynolds number range of 2 104 4 104 mainly attributed to the small dimple depth that is 9 10 3 d in their measurements the similar phenomenon was observed in a circular cylinder covered with v and u groove riblets parker and sayers 1999 lee et al 2005 whose performance depends on the groove size and the reynolds number with the ratio of groove depth to the cylinder diameter as large as 0 16 huang 2011 found a drag reduction of up to 25 was achieved in the sub critical reynolds number range thus a sufficiently large size of surface roughness is required to trip the boundary layer especially at low reynolds numbers due to the thicker boundary layer apart from the dimples and grooves wires rods and strips are usually used to trip the boundary layer alam et al 2003 experimentally observed that the fluid forces acting on a circular cylinder was obviously reduced by symmetrically placing a pair of tripping rods at its front surface with angular position of 30 where the angular position is measured from the forward stagnation point to the rod center at the same angular position tripwires also presented a good performance on vortex shedding suppression alam et al 2016 conversely the vortex shedding was enhanced when the tripping rods and wires were placed at 45 60 the effect of the position of control wires was investigated by quadrante and nishi 2014 it was observed that the fluid forces were reduced when the tripping wires were placed at angular position ranging from 20 to 52 5 or greater than 97 5 while the adverse consequence occurred at the placement angle range of 52 5 97 5 whether wires or rods the covered surface of the circular cylinder is limited recently a pair of rectangular strips was employed by bernitsas and his group chang et al 2011 ding et al 2016 kinaci et al 2016 park et al 2013 to adjust the flow wake of a circular cylinder the rectangular strips were symmetrically attached on the cylinder surface as passive turbulence controls ptc and each strip covers 16 surface both the suppression and amplification of vibration were observed through changing the location of strips at high reynolds numbers chang et al 2011 from the perspective of energy utilization the vibration enhancement is beneficial for converting the hydrokinetic energy to electrical energy bernitsas et al 2008 zhu et al 2018b examined the effects of strip shape and location at reynolds number of 30480 304800 a good suppression was attained by placing rectangular strips at placement angle of 120 while more vigorous response was excited at angular position of 20 60 compared to the rectangular strips the wake adjustment of triangular and arc strips is quite smaller fish swims smoothly by means of fins indicating the flow structure around themselves is positively adjusted inspired by fish swimming and the rough strips in previous literature a fin shaped strip is proposed with the intent of altering the vortex shedding to the authors knowledge no research has been done on the effect of coverage angle thus three different coverage angles ranging from 20 to 40 are considered in this study additionally the previous studies were mainly conducted at high reynolds numbers of 103 106 the mechanism of wake adjustment and the associated change in hydrodynamic forces is far from been clarified especially at low and medium reynolds numbers to some extent if the boundary layer could be affected at low reynolds numbers the alteration would be more vigorous for higher reynolds numbers therefore the flow around a circular cylinder with a pair of fin shaped strips at both low and medium reynolds numbers re 60 500 is investigated using direct numerical simulation dns in this work the effects of placement angle coverage angle and reynolds number are discussed in terms of the fluid forces flow structure and vortex shedding 2 problem description fig 1 depicts the circular cylinder symmetrically attached by a pair of fin shaped strips with the cambered surfaces on the windward side a fin shaped strip is composed of a cambered surface with radius of r 3d an arc surface pasted on the cylinder surface and a plane perpendicular to the cylinder surface the angle of the arc surface corresponds to the coverage angle β which varies from 20 to 40 with increment of 10 i e the coverage ratio ranges from 0 11 to 0 22 the placement angle θ of strip is measured from the forward stagnation point to the front edge of cambered surface four angular positions θ 30 60 90 and 120 are considered in this study the projected width d p of the local roughened cylinder varies with the placement and coverage angles of the strips the maximum projected width d p 1 217d occurs at θ 60 and β 40 followed by d p 1 161d at θ 30 and β 40 d p 1 124d at θ 60 and β 30 and then d p 1 037d at θ 60 and β 20 the projected width in other cases is the same as the bare cylinder d p d as reported in williamson 1996a 1996b and jiang et al 2016 the wake transition of a circular cylinder emerges when re is larger than 180 thus the two dimensional 2d simulations were performed in low reynolds number range of 60 180 while the three dimensional 3d simulations were carried out at re 200 350 and 500 the aspect ratio of the circular cylinder is set as 6d in the 3d simulations as shown in fig 1 a rectangle computational domain of 50d 40d and a hexahedral computational domain of 50d 40d 6d are adopted for the 2d and 3d simulations respectively the cylinder center is located at a distance of 20d from the upstream and the two lateral boundaries yielding a blockage ratio around 2 5 a uniform flow with velocity of u u is specified at the inlet boundary where u is the flow velocity in the x direction the zero normal gradient condition is applied for the velocity at the outlet where the pressure is specified as a reference value of zero the slip wall boundary condition u y 0 and v 0 is applied at the top and bottom and the two lateral boundaries a non slip boundary condition is applied on the structure surface 3 numerical method 3 1 numerical scheme both the 2d and 3d simulations were conducted with the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd solver openfoam and the unsteady incompressible navier stokes ns equations were solved directly termed as direct numerical simulation dns the ns equations were discretized by the finite volume method fvm where the convective and diffusion terms were discretized by the fourth order cubic scheme and the second order linear scheme respectively and the time derivative term was discretized by a blended scheme consisting of the second order crank nicolson scheme and a first order euler implicit scheme jiang et al 2017 additionally the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm was employed to solve the pressure velocity coupling jiang et al 2016 3 2 computational mesh as shown in fig 2 the o type structured mesh was adopted in the cross section perpendicular to the spanwise direction with a larger concentric circle around the circular cylinder the perimeter of the cylinder was equally discretized with 218 nodes in order to determine the height of the first layer of mesh next to the cylinder and the cell expansion ratio four different mesh resolutions were examined in the grid convergence test table 1 compares the 2d simulation results for the cylinder with a pair of 30 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 at re 180 it is seen that the percentage changes are reduced as the mesh resolution increases the hydrodynamic coefficients including the time averaged drag coefficient c d and the fluctuation of lift coefficient c l and the strouhal number st converge at m3 where c d c l and st are defined as 1 c d 1 n i 1 n 2 f d t ρ u 2 d p l 2 c l 2 n i 1 n c l i c l 2 3 s t d p f c l u in which 4 c l 2 f l t ρ u 2 d p l 5 c l 1 n i 1 n c l i where n is the number of values in the time history for statistics ρ is the density of fluid f d t and f l t are the drag and lift forces acting on the structure respectively d p is the projected width of the structure perpendicular to the incoming flow l is the spanwise length of the cylinder l is set as 1 for 2d simulations f cl is the fluctuation frequency of lift coefficient therefore the grid size of m3 was adopted in simulation where the height of the first layer of mesh next to the cylinder is 0 003d and the cell expansion ratio is 1 02 in the o ring region additionally the cell size along the spanwise direction is 0 1d for the 3d mesh the non dimensional time step u δt d is kept below 0 0005 meeting the requirement of the courant number below 0 2 in the whole domain 3 3 model validation the numerical model was validated with the reported results for flow over a bare circular cylinder at low re range of 60 180 fig 3 compares the calculated results with the experimental and numerical results reported previously where the base pressure coefficient is defined as 6 c p b p b p ρ u 2 2 where p b is the time mean pressure at the rear stagnation point and p is the reference pressure at the inlet it is clearly observed that the drag and base pressure coefficients and the strouhal number coincide well with the previous literature williamson and roshko 1990 henderson 1995 barkley and henderson 1996 rajani et al 2009 the maximum difference occurring between the calculated results and those in rajani et al 2009 is within 1 8 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic forces and wake adjustment at low re 60 180 4 1 1 hydrodynamic forces fig 4 compares the time histories of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the circular cylinder attached with a pair of fin shaped strips against the bare circular cylinder at re 150 where t is the normalized time t tu d p t is the flow time it is clearly seen that both the drag and lift coefficients oscillate periodically with mono frequency indicating that the flow structure is kept statistically stable with the introduction of fin shaped strips at low re range of 60 180 the hydrodynamic coefficients are sensitive to the coverage and placement angles of the strips the relatively small fin shaped strips with β 20 the maximum thickness is 0 026d generally play a role in the reduction of the time mean drag and the fluctuation of lift which is independent of the placement angle when the circular cylinder is equipped with a pair of 30 fin shaped strips the maximum thickness is 0 062d both the time averaged and fluctuation of drag coefficient are increased with the angular position ranging from 30 to 90 while they are reduced at θ 120 as compared to the bare cylinder the same trend is observed in the fluctuation of lift coefficient it illustrates the influence of 30 fin shaped strips on the cylinder s boundary layer is greater than 20 fin shaped strips resulting in the dependence on the placement angle this phenomenon is more obvious for the 40 fin shaped strips the maximum thickness is 0 118d which increase the time mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift coefficient as they are attached to the windward surface θ 30 and 60 while decrease the corresponding coefficients with the installation on the leeward surface θ 90 and 120 the variation of the time mean drag coefficient with re is plotted in fig 5 although the time mean drag coefficient of the cylinder attached with a couple of 20 fin shaped strips is lower than that of bare cylinder the variation with re shows the same trend as the bare cylinder i e a rapid reduction as re increases from 60 to 120 followed by a relatively stable value as re further increases to 180 the similar trend is found for the 30 fin shaped strips located at θ 30 90 and 120 and the 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 90 and 120 the c d re curves of these cases are almost parallel but the order of the drag coefficient varies with the placement angle when the strips are placed at θ 90 the largest magnitude occurs at β 30 followed by the bare cylinder β 20 and then β 40 at θ 120 in contrast the bare cylinder possesses the maximum time mean drag followed by the equipped cylinder with 20 fin shaped strips 30 fin shaped strips and then 40 fin shaped strips although the cylinder is attached with strips at θ 90 and θ 120 the projected width d p is the same as the bare cylinder indicating that the drag force acting on the cylinder could be altered without the change of structure s projected width as shown in fig 5 the completely different trend occurs when a pair of 30 fin shaped strips is attached to the cylinder at θ 60 or a pair of 40 fin shaped strips is attached at θ 30 or 60 instead of the reduction c d increases with increasing of re and the growth rate is even faster over 120 re 180 as compared to 60 re 120 it implies the growth of pressure drag is larger than the reduction in shear stress with increasing of re henderson 1997 the 40 fin shaped strips with angular position of 60 presents the maximum c d which reaches 1 856 at re 180 38 7 larger than the corresponding value of bare cylinder the second maximum c d occurs when the same strips are located at θ 30 followed by the 30 fin shaped strips at θ 60 this order of the maximum c d coincides with the order of the projected width signaling the larger projected width introduces a greater drag force acting on the structure fig 6 compares the time averaged pressure coefficient around the equipped cylinder in some selected cases the position angle φ is measured from the front stagnation point i e φ 180 represents the rear stagnation point we can see that the pressure distribution around the cylinder surface is more or less altered by the fin shaped strips for the 30 fin shaped strips at re 150 the occurrence of the minimum time averaged pressure moves forward to the corner of the strips when the strips are placed on the front surface of the cylinder θ 30 and 60 as compared to the bare cylinder it illustrates that the boundary layer develops along the cambered surface of the strips and reaches the maximum velocity at the corners nevertheless when the strips are attached on the leeward surface θ 90 and 120 the location of the minimum time averaged pressure does not change it implies that the strips on the front surface trip the boundary layer and hence alter the pressure distribution while the effect is weakened as strips move back compared to the bare cylinder the pressure recovers quickly after the pressure valley especially at θ 30 the recovery rate is gradually reduced to the same level as the bare cylinder as the angular position increases from 30 to 90 the minimum base pressure at φ 180 occurs at θ 60 followed by θ 30 and θ 90 while the base pressure of the cylinder with 30 fin shaped strips attached at θ 120 is higher than that of bare cylinder this order of the base pressure is in consistent with the time mean drag coefficient as the drag force is mainly contributed by the pressure difference between the front and rear surface of the cylinder for the strips located at θ 120 the alteration in pressure distribution is relatively small but it is still distinctly seen that the base pressure follows the order of the time mean drag coefficient the same trend is observed in the dependence of the base pressure on re as depicted in fig 7 the fluctuation of lift coefficient increases gradually with the reynolds number the cylinder with 40 fin shaped strips attached on its front surface θ 30 and 60 possesses the largest growth rate followed by the cylinder with 30 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 for 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 the lift fluctuation at re 180 is almost doubled as compared to the bare cylinder these three cases also present the amplification in drag force signaling the potential application for power harvesting from hydrokinetic energy similar to the drag coefficient the lift fluctuation of the cylinder with 20 fin shaped strips is smaller than that of bare cylinder whether the strips are mounted on the front or the rear surface additionally the strips located at θ 120 contribute to the lift reduction and the larger the coverage angle the greater the impact therefore the equipped cylinder with the largest projected width 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 attains the largest amplification in fluid forces which are 38 7 and 97 7 for the time mean drag and the lift fluctuation respectively as reported in quadrante and nishi 2014 the maximum increases in drag and lift are 44 and 63 by placing tripping wires at θ 75 the employed control wires in their work have a diameter ratio of 0 12d a slight larger than the thickness of 40 fin shaped strips moreover their experiments were performed at higher reynolds number of 3 45 103 2 04 104 as the laminar boundary layer is relatively hard to be tripped due to its larger thickness as compared to a turbulent layer the fin shaped strips have a greater potential than the tripping wires fig 8 plots the strouhal number varying with the reynolds number for the equipped cylinders where the strouhal number is obtained by the application of the fast fourier transform algorithm for the time series of lift coefficient it is seen that the vortex shedding frequency keeps increasing smoothly with re after the installation of fin shaped strips at this low re range of 60 180 which is mainly attributed to the two dimensional flow structure it is interesting to find the st re relationship follows the trend of c l re with the attachment of 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips on the front surface of the cylinder the st is significantly increased as compared to the bare cylinder the largest st occurs at re 180 for the 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 is 0 231 19 6 larger than the corresponding value of bare cylinder followed closely by the 30 fin shaped strips placed at the same angular position with st 0 229 it indicates the vortex shedding is accelerated which is associated with the separation of boundary layer and the formation of vortices the 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 not only attain the largest fluid forces but also gain the highest vortex shedding frequency signaling the good performance as a vibration amplifier in contrast the fin shaped strips located at θ 120 present a lower st as compared to the bare cylinder indicating the suppression of vortex shedding 4 1 2 2d wake structure after sufficient periodic results are obtained the time mean flow field is calculated to quantify the development of boundary layer and vortex formation the separation point of boundary layer can be identified from the contour of u 0 bai and alam 2018 zhu et al 2019b as shown in fig 9 a and fig 10 the region enveloped by the contour of u 0 is called the recirculation region or recirculation bubble where the flow velocity is negative i e the fluid flows back to the upstream the separation point of the equipped cylinder is compared with the bare cylinder in fig 9 b at θ 30 the variation of separation point with re for 20 fin shaped strips and 30 fin shaped strips follows the trend of the bare cylinder where the boundary layer separation point gradually moves forward with the increase of re as a result the length of recirculation region is reduced as shown in fig 9 c nevertheless the separation point for 20 fin shaped strips is in front of bare cylinder and the separation point for 30 fin shaped strips is further ahead of the cylinder attached with 20 fin shaped strips the recirculation region length for 30 fin shaped strips is below that of bare cylinder while the corresponding value for 20 fin shaped strips is slightly larger than the bare cylinder it implies that the length of recirculation region is not only determined by the location of boundary layer separation point it is noted that the separation point is fixed at the corner of strips for the 40 fin shaped strips illustrating that the boundary layer does not reattach the cylinder surface after the trip by strips as depicted in fig 10 the same phenomenon is observed from the 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 where the separation points occur at 90 and 100 respectively compared to the bare cylinder the distinct forward movement of boundary layer separation point contributes to the growth of fluid forces when the strips are located at θ 90 the separation point becomes to be locked on the corners of strips for all the three considered coverage angles as the separation of boundary layer is put backward to 130 the recirculation bubble length behind the cylinder with 40 fin shaped strips is elongated as compared to the bare cylinder and hence the reduction in fluid forces as seen in figs 5 and 7 when the strips are moved further backward to θ 120 the separation of boundary layer occurs ahead of the corners of strips as shown in fig 10 so that the variation of separation point with re returns back to follow the trend of bare cylinder compared to the bare cylinder the separation of boundary layer moves backward with the introduction of fin shaped strips resulting in the prolongation of recirculation bubble and thereby the reduction of hydrodynamic forces as in figs 5 and 7 fig 11 compares the wake width of the equipped cylinder with the bare cylinder the largest vertical distance between the positive and negative vorticity peaks is defined as the wake width d jiang and cheng 2017 where the normalized spanwise vorticity ω z is expressed as 7 ω z v x u y d p u the d d p re relationship of the equipped cylinder follows the trend of bare cylinder presenting the wake narrowing with the increase of re compared to the bare cylinder wider wake is formed behind the cylinder with 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips attached on the front surface θ 30 and θ 60 due to the tripping of boundary layer in contrast the wake width for the 20 fin shaped strips is close to the bare cylinder indicating the tripping of boundary layer by a small protrusion is limited the maximum thickness of 20 fin shaped strips is 0 026d around one third of the thickness of 30 fin shaped strips and one fifth of the thickness of 40 fin shaped strips thus the boundary layer soon reattaches the cylinder surface after the small tripping as shown in fig 10 and subsequently the boundary layer separates from the cylinder surface again with the separation point close to the bare cylinder as in fig 9 this phenomenon consists with the observation in alam et al 2003 and quadrante and nishi 2014 who recommended 0 08 0 12d tripping rods and 0 12d tripping wires respectively when the strips are placed on the leeward surface θ 90 and θ 120 the wake width is not changed obviously as the boundary layer separates at the similar point as the bare cylinder as in fig 9 fig 12 depicts the contours of the root mean square streamwise velocity u rms u rms u for the cylinder attached with a pair of fin shaped strips at re 150 the two peaks of u rms symmetrically distributed about the wake centerline illustrate the roll up positions of the shear layers on both sides the lateral spacing between the two peaks is significantly broadened when 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips are attached at θ 60 and the maximum spacing is attained by the 40 fin shaped strips conversely the spacing is narrowed as the 30 fin shaped strips is placed at θ 120 the variation of lateral spacing consists well with the trend of wake width explaining that alam et al 2018 and younis et al 2016 used this lateral spacing to analyze the flow wake the streamwise distance from the cylinder center to the peaks of u rms is obviously shortened as the coverage angle of strips increases from 20 to 40 while it is prolonged as the strips move from θ 60 120 this changing trend follows the length of recirculation bubble additionally the peak value of u rms increases with the increase of coverage angle from 20 to 40 and decreases as the strips move from θ 60 120 this variation reflects the influence of fin shaped strips on the flow structure among the considered cases with the installation of 40 fin shaped strips at θ 60 the rolling of shear layers grows most strongly resulting in the widest wake and the shortest recirculation bubble as shown in fig 13 only one peak of v rms is observed symmetrically about the wake centerline the streamwise distance from the cylinder center to the peak of v rms decreases and the magnitude of the peak v rms grows correspondingly as β increases from 20 to 40 indicating the enhancement of the tripping of boundary layer by contrast the location of the peak v rms moves backward and the magnitude reduces significantly as the placement angle of strips increases from 60 to 120 illustrating the stabilization of wake fig 14 compares the instantaneous vorticity contours of the equipped cylinder with the bare cylinder at re 150 the classical 2s vortex shedding mode two vortices are shed per cycle the upper vortex clockwise and the lower one counterclockwise is observed at the low re range of 60 180 the streamwise distance between the two adjacent vortices shed from the same side decreases from 5 26d p to 3 94d p as the coverage angle of strips increases from 20 to 40 in consistent with the growth of vortex shedding frequency in contrast as the strips move from θ 60 120 the streamwise distance increases from 4 58d p to 5 32d p illustrating the reduction of shedding frequency 4 2 hydrodynamic forces and wake adjustment at medium re 200 500 4 2 1 hydrodynamic forces the 3d flow past a circular cylinder with 30 fin shaped strips attached at θ 30 is calculated at medium re 200 350 and 500 as plotted in fig 15 the fluctuation of drag and lift coefficients at re 200 still presents the mono frequency while the oscillation characteristics emerge at re 350 and 500 as reported by jiang et al 2016 the mode a wake instability emerges at the critical reynolds number around 194 for a bare circular cylinder and mode b becomes the dominant mode beyond re 253 therefore for the equipped cylinder the flow three dimensionality occurs at re 350 and 500 resulting in more frequencies participating in the fluctuation of hydrodynamic coefficients while the wake at re 200 possibly undergoes the mode transition additionally the growth rate of the time mean drag coefficient is reduced as re increases from 200 to 500 and the fluctuation of lift coefficient decreases slightly due mainly to the transition of wake from 2d to 3d 4 2 2 3d wake structure fig 16 shows the contours of the root mean square velocities along the streamwise and transverse directions in the mid span cross section of the equipped cylinder it is clearly seen that both the lateral spacing between the two peaks of u rms and the streamwise distance from the cylinder center to the peaks of u rms are significantly reduced as the re increases accompanied by the rise of the maximum u rms consequently the recirculation bubble is shortened and the rolling of shear layers becomes closer to the cylinder base surface the occurrence of the peak v rms moves forward gradually and the magnitude increases significantly as re increases from 200 to 500 further confirming the reduction of the recirculation bubble length and the strengthening of flow oscillation in the wake of cylinder as depicted in fig 17 although the 2s vortex shedding is observed in the mid span at re 200 the wake flow isosurfaces of ω x 1 shows a distinct mode a structure with a spanwise wavelength of around 4d coinciding with the observation in williamson 1996b and jiang et al 2016 for the bare circular cylinder it implies the presence of fin shaped strips does not alter the basic structure of mode a in addition the spanwise vortex columns isosurfaces of ω z 2 present a slightly zigzag profile illustrating the wake three dimensionality at re 350 and 500 7 streamwise vortex pairs are observed within the 6d spanwise range indicating a spanwise wavelength of approximately 0 86d this wake characteristic signals the occurrence of mode b jiang et al 2016 although the spanwise wavelength of the equipped cylinder is the same as the bare cylinder the streamwise distance between two adjacent streamwise vortices is shortened and the vortices become more disordered in the far wake region x d 10 as compared to the bare cylinder jiang et al 2016 the spanwise vortices are curled as re increases to 350 and the column profile of vortices disappears as re further increases to 500 thus the structure of spanwise vortices is broken and the wake evolves into a completely three dimensionality the strengthening of wake instability creates a beneficial condition for the hydrodynamic instability for the structure with a non circular cross section once the structure is allowed to oscillate the continuous change in the attack angle between the moving body and incoming flow may give rise to the vigorous response called galloping assi et al 2009 it is reasonable to expect that the fin shape strips attached to the windward surface of cylinder could amplify the vibration response at medium reynolds number 5 conclusions the direct numerical simulation dns of flow past a circular cylinder with a pair of fin shaped strips attached to its surface is carried out at both low and medium reynolds numbers re 60 500 the following major conclusions are drawn 1 in low re range of 60 180 the 20 fin shaped strips with the local protrusion of 0 026d contribute to the reduction of hydrodynamic forces including the time mean drag and the fluctuation of lift which is independent on the angular position ranging from 30 to 120 in contrast the placement angle becomes a critical parameter for 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips when they are attached to the cylinder s windward surface θ 30 and θ 60 the hydrodynamic forces are significantly amplified as compared to the bare cylinder while the contrary consequences are observed at the angular position of 120 at re 180 the time mean drag and the lift fluctuation are increased by 38 7 and 97 7 respectively when a pair of 40 fin shaped strips is placed at θ 60 2 the amplification and alleviation of fluid forces are associated with the development of boundary layer and the formation of vortices at θ 90 the fin shaped strips trip the boundary layer and thereby alter the pressure distribution around the cylinder surface the extent of tripping has positive relation to the strips size the boundary layer reattaches the cylinder surface after the tripping by 20 fin shaped strips and 30 fin shaped strips located at θ 30 while the reattachment disappears behind the 40 fin shaped strips resulting in the forward movement of boundary layer separation point the shortening of recirculation bubble and the widening of wake and hence the increase of hydrodynamic forces this phenomenon becomes more prominent at θ 60 at θ 120 the strips contribute to the backward movement of boundary layer separation point accompanied by the elongation of recirculation bubble and the narrowing of wake explaining the reduction of fluid forces 3 the hydrodynamic coefficients oscillate periodically with mono frequency in re range of 60 200 while more frequencies take part in the fluctuation at re 350 and 500 due to the presence of mode b structure with distinct wake three dimensionality moreover the mode a structure is observed at re 200 in spite of the mono frequency fluctuation of hydrodynamic coefficients the presence of fin shaped strips strengthens the wake instability at medium re indication the potential for vibration amplifier 4 both the amplification and alleviation are achieved by the fin shaped strips depending on the coverage and placement angles the 30 fin shaped strips or 40 fin shaped strips attached to the front surface can be employed as amplifier while the 20 fin shaped strips can be used as suppressor nevertheless further extensive studies are required to examine the combined effects of relevant

22295,this work has numerically studied the effects of the coverage ratio and angular position of a pair of fin shaped strips on the hydrodynamic forces and wake structures of a circular cylinder at both low and medium reynolds numbers re 60 500 using direct numerical simulation dns the coverage ratio varies from 0 11 to 0 22 corresponding to the coverage angle β of a strip from 20 to 40 the angular position θ measured from the forward stagnation point to the front edge of strips ranges from 30 to 120 with increment of 30 the numerical results indicate that the hydrodynamic coefficients are sensitive to the coverage and placement angles of the strips the fluid forces are reduced with the introduction of a couple of 20 fin shaped strips while they are amplified by placing 30 fin shaped strips or 40 fin shaped strips in the front surface of cylinder the amplification suppression is associated with the development of boundary layer and the wake structure embodied in the length of recirculation bubble the wake width the tripping and reattachment of boundary layer as well as the separation point by placing a pair of 40 fin shaped strips at θ 60 the time mean drag and the lift fluctuation at re 180 are increased by 38 7 and 97 7 respectively for the cylinder equipped with 30 fin shaped strips at θ 30 the three dimensional mode a and mode b wake structures are observed at medium re 200 500 keywords wake structure fin shaped strips hydrodynamic coefficient vortex shedding direct numerical simulation 1 introduction flow over a circular cylinder is ubiquitous and of great interest in both daily life and engineering practice wake instability emerges when the reynolds number is larger than 47 henderson 1997 where reynolds number is defined as re u d ν u is the free stream velocity d is the cylinder diameter and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity resulting in periodic vortex shedding accompanied by time varying aerodynamic or hydrodynamic forces acting on the cylinder surface a great many methods have been proposed to stabilize the flow wake and reduce the fluid forces either actively or passively choi et al 2008 zhu and gao 2017 zhu et al 2019a 2019b compared to the active control passive control is easier to be implemented in practice without the requirement of external energy input the passive techniques could be classified into two categories a attaching additive devices to the cylinder or placing additive devices nearby the cylinder and b modifying the geometrical shape of the cylinder splitter plates fairings control rods and helical strake are some typical additive devices the former two are treated as near wake stabilizers which prevent the interaction of entrainment layers kwon and choi 1996 reported that the vortex shedding can be completely mitigated by attaching a sufficient long splitter plate in the wake of cylinder while the plate length depends on the reynolds number similarly the chord length of fairings is a key parameter influencing the suppression zhu et al 2017 examined the control effect of a triangular fairing and found the fairing with a tip angle within 90 110 possessed a good performance in preventing vortex shedding the same wake control was attained by an elliptic fairing zhu et al 2018a which effectively delayed the separation of boundary layer due to the streamlined profile zhu and yao 2015 numerically evaluated the passive control of multiple rods uniformly around a circular cylinder with the rods number increased from 3 up to 36 although the small control rods disturb the flow boundary layer and attain a significant reduction in lift force the mean drag force acting on the cylinder surface is gradually increased with the rods number the similar features were observed by lee et al 2014 for helical strakes whose performance is mainly determined by the pitch and height of strakes although the wake control effectiveness of the aforementioned additive devices has been confirmed it is difficult and expensive in handling and installing them in practice in contrast surface roughness and protrusion are simpler and cheaper options bearman and harvey 1993 experimentally investigated the drag reduction of a dimpled circular cylinder and reported that the roughened cylinder has a lower drag coefficient over a reynolds number range from 4 104 to 3 105 as compared to a smooth cylinder nevertheless the drag reduction is negligible in the reynolds number range of 2 104 4 104 mainly attributed to the small dimple depth that is 9 10 3 d in their measurements the similar phenomenon was observed in a circular cylinder covered with v and u groove riblets parker and sayers 1999 lee et al 2005 whose performance depends on the groove size and the reynolds number with the ratio of groove depth to the cylinder diameter as large as 0 16 huang 2011 found a drag reduction of up to 25 was achieved in the sub critical reynolds number range thus a sufficiently large size of surface roughness is required to trip the boundary layer especially at low reynolds numbers due to the thicker boundary layer apart from the dimples and grooves wires rods and strips are usually used to trip the boundary layer alam et al 2003 experimentally observed that the fluid forces acting on a circular cylinder was obviously reduced by symmetrically placing a pair of tripping rods at its front surface with angular position of 30 where the angular position is measured from the forward stagnation point to the rod center at the same angular position tripwires also presented a good performance on vortex shedding suppression alam et al 2016 conversely the vortex shedding was enhanced when the tripping rods and wires were placed at 45 60 the effect of the position of control wires was investigated by quadrante and nishi 2014 it was observed that the fluid forces were reduced when the tripping wires were placed at angular position ranging from 20 to 52 5 or greater than 97 5 while the adverse consequence occurred at the placement angle range of 52 5 97 5 whether wires or rods the covered surface of the circular cylinder is limited recently a pair of rectangular strips was employed by bernitsas and his group chang et al 2011 ding et al 2016 kinaci et al 2016 park et al 2013 to adjust the flow wake of a circular cylinder the rectangular strips were symmetrically attached on the cylinder surface as passive turbulence controls ptc and each strip covers 16 surface both the suppression and amplification of vibration were observed through changing the location of strips at high reynolds numbers chang et al 2011 from the perspective of energy utilization the vibration enhancement is beneficial for converting the hydrokinetic energy to electrical energy bernitsas et al 2008 zhu et al 2018b examined the effects of strip shape and location at reynolds number of 30480 304800 a good suppression was attained by placing rectangular strips at placement angle of 120 while more vigorous response was excited at angular position of 20 60 compared to the rectangular strips the wake adjustment of triangular and arc strips is quite smaller fish swims smoothly by means of fins indicating the flow structure around themselves is positively adjusted inspired by fish swimming and the rough strips in previous literature a fin shaped strip is proposed with the intent of altering the vortex shedding to the authors knowledge no research has been done on the effect of coverage angle thus three different coverage angles ranging from 20 to 40 are considered in this study additionally the previous studies were mainly conducted at high reynolds numbers of 103 106 the mechanism of wake adjustment and the associated change in hydrodynamic forces is far from been clarified especially at low and medium reynolds numbers to some extent if the boundary layer could be affected at low reynolds numbers the alteration would be more vigorous for higher reynolds numbers therefore the flow around a circular cylinder with a pair of fin shaped strips at both low and medium reynolds numbers re 60 500 is investigated using direct numerical simulation dns in this work the effects of placement angle coverage angle and reynolds number are discussed in terms of the fluid forces flow structure and vortex shedding 2 problem description fig 1 depicts the circular cylinder symmetrically attached by a pair of fin shaped strips with the cambered surfaces on the windward side a fin shaped strip is composed of a cambered surface with radius of r 3d an arc surface pasted on the cylinder surface and a plane perpendicular to the cylinder surface the angle of the arc surface corresponds to the coverage angle β which varies from 20 to 40 with increment of 10 i e the coverage ratio ranges from 0 11 to 0 22 the placement angle θ of strip is measured from the forward stagnation point to the front edge of cambered surface four angular positions θ 30 60 90 and 120 are considered in this study the projected width d p of the local roughened cylinder varies with the placement and coverage angles of the strips the maximum projected width d p 1 217d occurs at θ 60 and β 40 followed by d p 1 161d at θ 30 and β 40 d p 1 124d at θ 60 and β 30 and then d p 1 037d at θ 60 and β 20 the projected width in other cases is the same as the bare cylinder d p d as reported in williamson 1996a 1996b and jiang et al 2016 the wake transition of a circular cylinder emerges when re is larger than 180 thus the two dimensional 2d simulations were performed in low reynolds number range of 60 180 while the three dimensional 3d simulations were carried out at re 200 350 and 500 the aspect ratio of the circular cylinder is set as 6d in the 3d simulations as shown in fig 1 a rectangle computational domain of 50d 40d and a hexahedral computational domain of 50d 40d 6d are adopted for the 2d and 3d simulations respectively the cylinder center is located at a distance of 20d from the upstream and the two lateral boundaries yielding a blockage ratio around 2 5 a uniform flow with velocity of u u is specified at the inlet boundary where u is the flow velocity in the x direction the zero normal gradient condition is applied for the velocity at the outlet where the pressure is specified as a reference value of zero the slip wall boundary condition u y 0 and v 0 is applied at the top and bottom and the two lateral boundaries a non slip boundary condition is applied on the structure surface 3 numerical method 3 1 numerical scheme both the 2d and 3d simulations were conducted with the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd solver openfoam and the unsteady incompressible navier stokes ns equations were solved directly termed as direct numerical simulation dns the ns equations were discretized by the finite volume method fvm where the convective and diffusion terms were discretized by the fourth order cubic scheme and the second order linear scheme respectively and the time derivative term was discretized by a blended scheme consisting of the second order crank nicolson scheme and a first order euler implicit scheme jiang et al 2017 additionally the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm was employed to solve the pressure velocity coupling jiang et al 2016 3 2 computational mesh as shown in fig 2 the o type structured mesh was adopted in the cross section perpendicular to the spanwise direction with a larger concentric circle around the circular cylinder the perimeter of the cylinder was equally discretized with 218 nodes in order to determine the height of the first layer of mesh next to the cylinder and the cell expansion ratio four different mesh resolutions were examined in the grid convergence test table 1 compares the 2d simulation results for the cylinder with a pair of 30 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 at re 180 it is seen that the percentage changes are reduced as the mesh resolution increases the hydrodynamic coefficients including the time averaged drag coefficient c d and the fluctuation of lift coefficient c l and the strouhal number st converge at m3 where c d c l and st are defined as 1 c d 1 n i 1 n 2 f d t ρ u 2 d p l 2 c l 2 n i 1 n c l i c l 2 3 s t d p f c l u in which 4 c l 2 f l t ρ u 2 d p l 5 c l 1 n i 1 n c l i where n is the number of values in the time history for statistics ρ is the density of fluid f d t and f l t are the drag and lift forces acting on the structure respectively d p is the projected width of the structure perpendicular to the incoming flow l is the spanwise length of the cylinder l is set as 1 for 2d simulations f cl is the fluctuation frequency of lift coefficient therefore the grid size of m3 was adopted in simulation where the height of the first layer of mesh next to the cylinder is 0 003d and the cell expansion ratio is 1 02 in the o ring region additionally the cell size along the spanwise direction is 0 1d for the 3d mesh the non dimensional time step u δt d is kept below 0 0005 meeting the requirement of the courant number below 0 2 in the whole domain 3 3 model validation the numerical model was validated with the reported results for flow over a bare circular cylinder at low re range of 60 180 fig 3 compares the calculated results with the experimental and numerical results reported previously where the base pressure coefficient is defined as 6 c p b p b p ρ u 2 2 where p b is the time mean pressure at the rear stagnation point and p is the reference pressure at the inlet it is clearly observed that the drag and base pressure coefficients and the strouhal number coincide well with the previous literature williamson and roshko 1990 henderson 1995 barkley and henderson 1996 rajani et al 2009 the maximum difference occurring between the calculated results and those in rajani et al 2009 is within 1 8 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic forces and wake adjustment at low re 60 180 4 1 1 hydrodynamic forces fig 4 compares the time histories of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the circular cylinder attached with a pair of fin shaped strips against the bare circular cylinder at re 150 where t is the normalized time t tu d p t is the flow time it is clearly seen that both the drag and lift coefficients oscillate periodically with mono frequency indicating that the flow structure is kept statistically stable with the introduction of fin shaped strips at low re range of 60 180 the hydrodynamic coefficients are sensitive to the coverage and placement angles of the strips the relatively small fin shaped strips with β 20 the maximum thickness is 0 026d generally play a role in the reduction of the time mean drag and the fluctuation of lift which is independent of the placement angle when the circular cylinder is equipped with a pair of 30 fin shaped strips the maximum thickness is 0 062d both the time averaged and fluctuation of drag coefficient are increased with the angular position ranging from 30 to 90 while they are reduced at θ 120 as compared to the bare cylinder the same trend is observed in the fluctuation of lift coefficient it illustrates the influence of 30 fin shaped strips on the cylinder s boundary layer is greater than 20 fin shaped strips resulting in the dependence on the placement angle this phenomenon is more obvious for the 40 fin shaped strips the maximum thickness is 0 118d which increase the time mean drag coefficient and the fluctuation of lift coefficient as they are attached to the windward surface θ 30 and 60 while decrease the corresponding coefficients with the installation on the leeward surface θ 90 and 120 the variation of the time mean drag coefficient with re is plotted in fig 5 although the time mean drag coefficient of the cylinder attached with a couple of 20 fin shaped strips is lower than that of bare cylinder the variation with re shows the same trend as the bare cylinder i e a rapid reduction as re increases from 60 to 120 followed by a relatively stable value as re further increases to 180 the similar trend is found for the 30 fin shaped strips located at θ 30 90 and 120 and the 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 90 and 120 the c d re curves of these cases are almost parallel but the order of the drag coefficient varies with the placement angle when the strips are placed at θ 90 the largest magnitude occurs at β 30 followed by the bare cylinder β 20 and then β 40 at θ 120 in contrast the bare cylinder possesses the maximum time mean drag followed by the equipped cylinder with 20 fin shaped strips 30 fin shaped strips and then 40 fin shaped strips although the cylinder is attached with strips at θ 90 and θ 120 the projected width d p is the same as the bare cylinder indicating that the drag force acting on the cylinder could be altered without the change of structure s projected width as shown in fig 5 the completely different trend occurs when a pair of 30 fin shaped strips is attached to the cylinder at θ 60 or a pair of 40 fin shaped strips is attached at θ 30 or 60 instead of the reduction c d increases with increasing of re and the growth rate is even faster over 120 re 180 as compared to 60 re 120 it implies the growth of pressure drag is larger than the reduction in shear stress with increasing of re henderson 1997 the 40 fin shaped strips with angular position of 60 presents the maximum c d which reaches 1 856 at re 180 38 7 larger than the corresponding value of bare cylinder the second maximum c d occurs when the same strips are located at θ 30 followed by the 30 fin shaped strips at θ 60 this order of the maximum c d coincides with the order of the projected width signaling the larger projected width introduces a greater drag force acting on the structure fig 6 compares the time averaged pressure coefficient around the equipped cylinder in some selected cases the position angle φ is measured from the front stagnation point i e φ 180 represents the rear stagnation point we can see that the pressure distribution around the cylinder surface is more or less altered by the fin shaped strips for the 30 fin shaped strips at re 150 the occurrence of the minimum time averaged pressure moves forward to the corner of the strips when the strips are placed on the front surface of the cylinder θ 30 and 60 as compared to the bare cylinder it illustrates that the boundary layer develops along the cambered surface of the strips and reaches the maximum velocity at the corners nevertheless when the strips are attached on the leeward surface θ 90 and 120 the location of the minimum time averaged pressure does not change it implies that the strips on the front surface trip the boundary layer and hence alter the pressure distribution while the effect is weakened as strips move back compared to the bare cylinder the pressure recovers quickly after the pressure valley especially at θ 30 the recovery rate is gradually reduced to the same level as the bare cylinder as the angular position increases from 30 to 90 the minimum base pressure at φ 180 occurs at θ 60 followed by θ 30 and θ 90 while the base pressure of the cylinder with 30 fin shaped strips attached at θ 120 is higher than that of bare cylinder this order of the base pressure is in consistent with the time mean drag coefficient as the drag force is mainly contributed by the pressure difference between the front and rear surface of the cylinder for the strips located at θ 120 the alteration in pressure distribution is relatively small but it is still distinctly seen that the base pressure follows the order of the time mean drag coefficient the same trend is observed in the dependence of the base pressure on re as depicted in fig 7 the fluctuation of lift coefficient increases gradually with the reynolds number the cylinder with 40 fin shaped strips attached on its front surface θ 30 and 60 possesses the largest growth rate followed by the cylinder with 30 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 for 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 the lift fluctuation at re 180 is almost doubled as compared to the bare cylinder these three cases also present the amplification in drag force signaling the potential application for power harvesting from hydrokinetic energy similar to the drag coefficient the lift fluctuation of the cylinder with 20 fin shaped strips is smaller than that of bare cylinder whether the strips are mounted on the front or the rear surface additionally the strips located at θ 120 contribute to the lift reduction and the larger the coverage angle the greater the impact therefore the equipped cylinder with the largest projected width 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 attains the largest amplification in fluid forces which are 38 7 and 97 7 for the time mean drag and the lift fluctuation respectively as reported in quadrante and nishi 2014 the maximum increases in drag and lift are 44 and 63 by placing tripping wires at θ 75 the employed control wires in their work have a diameter ratio of 0 12d a slight larger than the thickness of 40 fin shaped strips moreover their experiments were performed at higher reynolds number of 3 45 103 2 04 104 as the laminar boundary layer is relatively hard to be tripped due to its larger thickness as compared to a turbulent layer the fin shaped strips have a greater potential than the tripping wires fig 8 plots the strouhal number varying with the reynolds number for the equipped cylinders where the strouhal number is obtained by the application of the fast fourier transform algorithm for the time series of lift coefficient it is seen that the vortex shedding frequency keeps increasing smoothly with re after the installation of fin shaped strips at this low re range of 60 180 which is mainly attributed to the two dimensional flow structure it is interesting to find the st re relationship follows the trend of c l re with the attachment of 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips on the front surface of the cylinder the st is significantly increased as compared to the bare cylinder the largest st occurs at re 180 for the 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 is 0 231 19 6 larger than the corresponding value of bare cylinder followed closely by the 30 fin shaped strips placed at the same angular position with st 0 229 it indicates the vortex shedding is accelerated which is associated with the separation of boundary layer and the formation of vortices the 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 not only attain the largest fluid forces but also gain the highest vortex shedding frequency signaling the good performance as a vibration amplifier in contrast the fin shaped strips located at θ 120 present a lower st as compared to the bare cylinder indicating the suppression of vortex shedding 4 1 2 2d wake structure after sufficient periodic results are obtained the time mean flow field is calculated to quantify the development of boundary layer and vortex formation the separation point of boundary layer can be identified from the contour of u 0 bai and alam 2018 zhu et al 2019b as shown in fig 9 a and fig 10 the region enveloped by the contour of u 0 is called the recirculation region or recirculation bubble where the flow velocity is negative i e the fluid flows back to the upstream the separation point of the equipped cylinder is compared with the bare cylinder in fig 9 b at θ 30 the variation of separation point with re for 20 fin shaped strips and 30 fin shaped strips follows the trend of the bare cylinder where the boundary layer separation point gradually moves forward with the increase of re as a result the length of recirculation region is reduced as shown in fig 9 c nevertheless the separation point for 20 fin shaped strips is in front of bare cylinder and the separation point for 30 fin shaped strips is further ahead of the cylinder attached with 20 fin shaped strips the recirculation region length for 30 fin shaped strips is below that of bare cylinder while the corresponding value for 20 fin shaped strips is slightly larger than the bare cylinder it implies that the length of recirculation region is not only determined by the location of boundary layer separation point it is noted that the separation point is fixed at the corner of strips for the 40 fin shaped strips illustrating that the boundary layer does not reattach the cylinder surface after the trip by strips as depicted in fig 10 the same phenomenon is observed from the 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips located at θ 60 where the separation points occur at 90 and 100 respectively compared to the bare cylinder the distinct forward movement of boundary layer separation point contributes to the growth of fluid forces when the strips are located at θ 90 the separation point becomes to be locked on the corners of strips for all the three considered coverage angles as the separation of boundary layer is put backward to 130 the recirculation bubble length behind the cylinder with 40 fin shaped strips is elongated as compared to the bare cylinder and hence the reduction in fluid forces as seen in figs 5 and 7 when the strips are moved further backward to θ 120 the separation of boundary layer occurs ahead of the corners of strips as shown in fig 10 so that the variation of separation point with re returns back to follow the trend of bare cylinder compared to the bare cylinder the separation of boundary layer moves backward with the introduction of fin shaped strips resulting in the prolongation of recirculation bubble and thereby the reduction of hydrodynamic forces as in figs 5 and 7 fig 11 compares the wake width of the equipped cylinder with the bare cylinder the largest vertical distance between the positive and negative vorticity peaks is defined as the wake width d jiang and cheng 2017 where the normalized spanwise vorticity ω z is expressed as 7 ω z v x u y d p u the d d p re relationship of the equipped cylinder follows the trend of bare cylinder presenting the wake narrowing with the increase of re compared to the bare cylinder wider wake is formed behind the cylinder with 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips attached on the front surface θ 30 and θ 60 due to the tripping of boundary layer in contrast the wake width for the 20 fin shaped strips is close to the bare cylinder indicating the tripping of boundary layer by a small protrusion is limited the maximum thickness of 20 fin shaped strips is 0 026d around one third of the thickness of 30 fin shaped strips and one fifth of the thickness of 40 fin shaped strips thus the boundary layer soon reattaches the cylinder surface after the small tripping as shown in fig 10 and subsequently the boundary layer separates from the cylinder surface again with the separation point close to the bare cylinder as in fig 9 this phenomenon consists with the observation in alam et al 2003 and quadrante and nishi 2014 who recommended 0 08 0 12d tripping rods and 0 12d tripping wires respectively when the strips are placed on the leeward surface θ 90 and θ 120 the wake width is not changed obviously as the boundary layer separates at the similar point as the bare cylinder as in fig 9 fig 12 depicts the contours of the root mean square streamwise velocity u rms u rms u for the cylinder attached with a pair of fin shaped strips at re 150 the two peaks of u rms symmetrically distributed about the wake centerline illustrate the roll up positions of the shear layers on both sides the lateral spacing between the two peaks is significantly broadened when 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips are attached at θ 60 and the maximum spacing is attained by the 40 fin shaped strips conversely the spacing is narrowed as the 30 fin shaped strips is placed at θ 120 the variation of lateral spacing consists well with the trend of wake width explaining that alam et al 2018 and younis et al 2016 used this lateral spacing to analyze the flow wake the streamwise distance from the cylinder center to the peaks of u rms is obviously shortened as the coverage angle of strips increases from 20 to 40 while it is prolonged as the strips move from θ 60 120 this changing trend follows the length of recirculation bubble additionally the peak value of u rms increases with the increase of coverage angle from 20 to 40 and decreases as the strips move from θ 60 120 this variation reflects the influence of fin shaped strips on the flow structure among the considered cases with the installation of 40 fin shaped strips at θ 60 the rolling of shear layers grows most strongly resulting in the widest wake and the shortest recirculation bubble as shown in fig 13 only one peak of v rms is observed symmetrically about the wake centerline the streamwise distance from the cylinder center to the peak of v rms decreases and the magnitude of the peak v rms grows correspondingly as β increases from 20 to 40 indicating the enhancement of the tripping of boundary layer by contrast the location of the peak v rms moves backward and the magnitude reduces significantly as the placement angle of strips increases from 60 to 120 illustrating the stabilization of wake fig 14 compares the instantaneous vorticity contours of the equipped cylinder with the bare cylinder at re 150 the classical 2s vortex shedding mode two vortices are shed per cycle the upper vortex clockwise and the lower one counterclockwise is observed at the low re range of 60 180 the streamwise distance between the two adjacent vortices shed from the same side decreases from 5 26d p to 3 94d p as the coverage angle of strips increases from 20 to 40 in consistent with the growth of vortex shedding frequency in contrast as the strips move from θ 60 120 the streamwise distance increases from 4 58d p to 5 32d p illustrating the reduction of shedding frequency 4 2 hydrodynamic forces and wake adjustment at medium re 200 500 4 2 1 hydrodynamic forces the 3d flow past a circular cylinder with 30 fin shaped strips attached at θ 30 is calculated at medium re 200 350 and 500 as plotted in fig 15 the fluctuation of drag and lift coefficients at re 200 still presents the mono frequency while the oscillation characteristics emerge at re 350 and 500 as reported by jiang et al 2016 the mode a wake instability emerges at the critical reynolds number around 194 for a bare circular cylinder and mode b becomes the dominant mode beyond re 253 therefore for the equipped cylinder the flow three dimensionality occurs at re 350 and 500 resulting in more frequencies participating in the fluctuation of hydrodynamic coefficients while the wake at re 200 possibly undergoes the mode transition additionally the growth rate of the time mean drag coefficient is reduced as re increases from 200 to 500 and the fluctuation of lift coefficient decreases slightly due mainly to the transition of wake from 2d to 3d 4 2 2 3d wake structure fig 16 shows the contours of the root mean square velocities along the streamwise and transverse directions in the mid span cross section of the equipped cylinder it is clearly seen that both the lateral spacing between the two peaks of u rms and the streamwise distance from the cylinder center to the peaks of u rms are significantly reduced as the re increases accompanied by the rise of the maximum u rms consequently the recirculation bubble is shortened and the rolling of shear layers becomes closer to the cylinder base surface the occurrence of the peak v rms moves forward gradually and the magnitude increases significantly as re increases from 200 to 500 further confirming the reduction of the recirculation bubble length and the strengthening of flow oscillation in the wake of cylinder as depicted in fig 17 although the 2s vortex shedding is observed in the mid span at re 200 the wake flow isosurfaces of ω x 1 shows a distinct mode a structure with a spanwise wavelength of around 4d coinciding with the observation in williamson 1996b and jiang et al 2016 for the bare circular cylinder it implies the presence of fin shaped strips does not alter the basic structure of mode a in addition the spanwise vortex columns isosurfaces of ω z 2 present a slightly zigzag profile illustrating the wake three dimensionality at re 350 and 500 7 streamwise vortex pairs are observed within the 6d spanwise range indicating a spanwise wavelength of approximately 0 86d this wake characteristic signals the occurrence of mode b jiang et al 2016 although the spanwise wavelength of the equipped cylinder is the same as the bare cylinder the streamwise distance between two adjacent streamwise vortices is shortened and the vortices become more disordered in the far wake region x d 10 as compared to the bare cylinder jiang et al 2016 the spanwise vortices are curled as re increases to 350 and the column profile of vortices disappears as re further increases to 500 thus the structure of spanwise vortices is broken and the wake evolves into a completely three dimensionality the strengthening of wake instability creates a beneficial condition for the hydrodynamic instability for the structure with a non circular cross section once the structure is allowed to oscillate the continuous change in the attack angle between the moving body and incoming flow may give rise to the vigorous response called galloping assi et al 2009 it is reasonable to expect that the fin shape strips attached to the windward surface of cylinder could amplify the vibration response at medium reynolds number 5 conclusions the direct numerical simulation dns of flow past a circular cylinder with a pair of fin shaped strips attached to its surface is carried out at both low and medium reynolds numbers re 60 500 the following major conclusions are drawn 1 in low re range of 60 180 the 20 fin shaped strips with the local protrusion of 0 026d contribute to the reduction of hydrodynamic forces including the time mean drag and the fluctuation of lift which is independent on the angular position ranging from 30 to 120 in contrast the placement angle becomes a critical parameter for 30 fin shaped strips and 40 fin shaped strips when they are attached to the cylinder s windward surface θ 30 and θ 60 the hydrodynamic forces are significantly amplified as compared to the bare cylinder while the contrary consequences are observed at the angular position of 120 at re 180 the time mean drag and the lift fluctuation are increased by 38 7 and 97 7 respectively when a pair of 40 fin shaped strips is placed at θ 60 2 the amplification and alleviation of fluid forces are associated with the development of boundary layer and the formation of vortices at θ 90 the fin shaped strips trip the boundary layer and thereby alter the pressure distribution around the cylinder surface the extent of tripping has positive relation to the strips size the boundary layer reattaches the cylinder surface after the tripping by 20 fin shaped strips and 30 fin shaped strips located at θ 30 while the reattachment disappears behind the 40 fin shaped strips resulting in the forward movement of boundary layer separation point the shortening of recirculation bubble and the widening of wake and hence the increase of hydrodynamic forces this phenomenon becomes more prominent at θ 60 at θ 120 the strips contribute to the backward movement of boundary layer separation point accompanied by the elongation of recirculation bubble and the narrowing of wake explaining the reduction of fluid forces 3 the hydrodynamic coefficients oscillate periodically with mono frequency in re range of 60 200 while more frequencies take part in the fluctuation at re 350 and 500 due to the presence of mode b structure with distinct wake three dimensionality moreover the mode a structure is observed at re 200 in spite of the mono frequency fluctuation of hydrodynamic coefficients the presence of fin shaped strips strengthens the wake instability at medium re indication the potential for vibration amplifier 4 both the amplification and alleviation are achieved by the fin shaped strips depending on the coverage and placement angles the 30 fin shaped strips or 40 fin shaped strips attached to the front surface can be employed as amplifier while the 20 fin shaped strips can be used as suppressor nevertheless further extensive studies are required to examine the combined effects of relevant parameters such as the strips shape size number location and arrangement on the hydrodynamic characteristics and the associated vibration responses acknowledgements the research work was supported by

22296,soft marine clay is susceptible to deformation under cyclic loading controlled by microstructure variations to investigate the microscopic characteristics of soft clay with the progression of deformation under cyclic loading a detailed study has been conducted using consolidated undrained cyclic triaxial tests as well as mercury intrusion porosimetry mip and scanning electron microscopy sem the relationships between the micro parameters and accumulated plastic strain of soft marine clay are discussed cyclic triaxial test results show that low cyclic stress ratio csr induces stable deformation while for greater csr the deformation of soft marine clay presents a closely linear or exponential increase which leads to the destructuration of the soil structure the microanalysis shows that with vibration cycles under 0 15 csr the content of pore obtained by sem decreases from 37 to 25 and large aggregates are visibly crushed into smaller ones leading to a 24 increase in the pore numbers which shows the slow increase of the deformation when the csr is greater than 0 25 large diameter pores generate resulting in divergent development of accumulated plastic strain an empirical model of accumulated plastic strain involving micro parameter is proposed for assessing the deformation of soft marine clay keywords soft marine clay cyclic load triaxial test accumulated plastic

compressibility high rheology low permeability and low shear strength lei et al 2016a 2016b 2018 ren et al 2018 wang et al 2013 2017 in the marine environment offshore facilities are widely constructed e g suction anchors wind turbines gravity platforms harbors dockyards lighthouse and so on ren et al 2018 these structures are suffered from vulnerable foundations with high risky serviceability which are frequently undergoing cyclic loads such as waves vehicle loads vibration of machinery and so on le et al 2018 correspondingly settlement issues have become the primary consideration in foundation designing construction and monitoring though influencing factors of settlement issues are rationally considered unexpected excessive settlement problems still exist karg and haegeman 2009 yang and feng 2013 which needs deep research in understanding of engineering characteristics and the response of dynamic disturbance especially the mechanism of deformation development should be clearly studied intending to provide guidance in predicting the lifetime serviceability of offshore facilities and improve both the risk analysis and the engineering design

al 2014 sun et al 2015 lin et al 2017 the principal stress rotation is a heated topic discussed with hollow cylindrical torsional shear tests gräbe and clayton 2009 cai et al 2018 frequency is a disputed parameter for the dynamic deformation of clay soil lei et al 2016a it could be concluded the deformation of soft marine clay is a susceptible variable which has close relationships to the external factors under complex stratigraphic environment the prediction and monitoring of soft marine clay foundation settlement presents large discrepancy due to limits of laboratory study though uncontrollable external complexity the deformation performance are dominated by microscopic characters which is worthy of detailed investigation cui and jia 2013 zhang and cui 2017 currently microscopic characteristics of soil structures are commonly assessed using scanning electron microscopy sem and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip sem is a digital fractal surface scanning test which produces 2d images of interested areas information about particle or particle aggregates shape size and connections could be obtained for qualitative analysis with the improved technologies partial quantitative data could be calculated based on image processing software with otsu method cui and jia 2013 but with extreme subjectivity fractal dimension values of the quantitatively sem images decreased with the increasing of magnification in measured photos dathe et al 2001 the image magnification was also demonstrated the effect on the relationships between size proportion and quantitative results liu et al 2005 varied grayscale value induced great differences on measured results bird et al 2006 it should be noted that though sem quantitative analysis may suffered from the operator s experience which may not represent the precise conceptual value quantitative work performs valuable assists on contrastive analysis lei et al 2016c conducted a series of consolidated undrained triaxial tests and verified the change in microstructure under accelerated creep conditions of soft clay yang et al 2014 studied the microstructure of hangzhou intact clay under a wave loading condition by sem and pcas quantitative testing technology based on fractal theory bock et al 2006 investigated the micromechanical behavior of opalinus clay and revealed the variation law of microscopic characteristics cuisinier et al 2011 revealed that lime addition to clay soils changed the pore size distributions based on mip test results as a summary of field research many scholars focused much attention on solo considerations i e deformation properties related to related influencing factors microstructure studies under certain physical or mechanical states especially for soils reaching critical state or failure systematic research on the microscopic variation in soft marine clay with the deformation development under cyclic loading has not been clearly assessed therefore the objective of this study is to systematically investigate the change in microfeatures of soft clay subjected to cyclic loading to achieve this consolidated undrained cyclic tests on a batch of remolded cylinder samples were designed that terminated at different loading cycles with a subsequent micro tests by sem and mip the relationships of the microscopic parameters with engineering properties were discussed to obtain a better understanding of the development of cyclic deformation 2 materials and test procedure 2 1 soil properties the samples were obtained underground at a depth of 10 15 m from tianjin binhai new area the plastic index ip is 20 6 and the natural void ratio is greater than 1 0 the hydrometer method with a tm 85 soil densimeter tianjin jin anrui instrument institute china was used to determine the grain size distribution fig 1 clay particles diameter 0 002 mm account for 42 of the total composition and the remaining 58 are silt particles 0 002 mm diameter 0 075 mm table 1 summarizes the physical properties of soft marine clay used in this study the ratio of the natural water content to the liquid limit is approximately 0 8 the liquid limit of the soil sample is 47 7 and the plasticity index pi is 27 1 it can be seen that all the data lie slightly above the a line defined by p i 0 73 ω l 20 but below the u line defined by p i 0 9 ω l 8 in the plasticity chart therefore the soil sample is clay soils according to the unified soil classification system uscs the sample is classified as cl 2 2 sample preparation remodeled cylindrical samples with 38 1 mm in diameter and 80 mm in height were prepared for homogeneity purpose a batch of bulk clay was oven dried at 105 110 c to a constant mass allowed to cool to ambient laboratory temperature 20 c disaggregated and then sieved to obtain the fraction that passes through a 2 mm sieve the powered soil was thoroughly mixed with deionized water to obtain 40 water content with subsequent compaction in a cylinder mold based on the natural density the molds with the soil samples were placed into a vacuum saturator machine where the molds were vacuumed for 2 h and then immersed in distilled water allowed to settle for at least 12h which induced a good saturation level under the pressure difference 2 3 cyclic triaxial tests cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on a british gds triaxial machine stress controlled loads were applied using a digitally controlled system cell pressures were controlled manually with a digital transducer prior to the consolidation the re saturation of samples with back pressure was conducted and the saturability was checked using b value method embedded in the machine system defined as 1 b δ u δ σ 3 where δ u is the induced pore water pressure increment when the cell pressure increment δ σ 3 is applied once b value is upon 97 a series of anisotropic consolidation was carried out at a 50 kpa effective cell pressure and 100 kpa effective vertical pressure during which drainage was permitted at the top and bottom surfaces of the sample with filter paper clinging to both ends of the sample once the rate of deformation was less than 0 001 mm h or a time duration of 48 h of consolidation was reached consolidation was terminated and followed by undrained cyclic testing all tests were performed at the room temperature of 20 2 c sinusoidal waves were applied for cyclic loading and the amplitude of the sinusoidal waves was equal to the deviatoric stress fig 2 the specimens were undrained and subjected to 5000 cycles except for those that failed the cumulative axial strain exceeded 5 before 5000 cycles in this study the dynamic stress was considered using a parameter of the cyclic stress ratio as follows 2 c s r σ d 2 σ 3 where σ d is the amplitude cyclic deviator stress and σ 3 is the effective confining pressure four csrs of 0 1 0 15 0 25 and 0 3 were considered as shown in table 2 2 4 sem analyses scanning electron microscopy sem is a technique that produces images of a sample structure by scanning it with a focused beam of electrons sem has been commonly used to study the microstructures of soil samples all samples were initially trimmed into 1 cm3 cubes and were coated with electrically conductive material to be suitable for testing in this study kong et al 1995 dehydrated bulk samples are required and prepared prior to the test freeze drying is the most appropriate choice for dehydrating soil samples in this study the soil samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen boiling point 196 c for 2 min during which water reserved within the samples sharply transformed into a solid state amorphous ice without enough time to recrystallize leading to the preservation of soil structures without water volume expansion the frozen sample was then placed in a vacuum environment at a temperature of 50 c for at least 24 h where the frozen moisture was sublimated and dried well the samples under the prescribed loading conditions that needed for sem analysis are shown in table 2 2 5 mip analyses mercury intrusion porosimetry mip was conducted gallé 2001 to verify the variations in porosity and pore size distribution the pore size distribution curve can be obtained from the intruded volume of mercury at each pressure step the tests were conducted in the 9510 mercury intrusion machine produced by mac with a measuring range of 0 003 360 μm prior to mip a freeze drying technique similar to the sem analysis preparation was used to remove moisture from the porous structure mip involves the measurement of the volume of mercury injected into the porous medium with increasing applied pressure pressure differences can be converted to pore diameters using the washburn equation washburn 1921 3 p 2 σ cos α r where p is the intrusion pressure r is the pore radius based on the assumption that the pores are cylindrical in shape α is the contact angle between mercury and soil which remains at a constant value of 130 and σ is a surface tension of 0 485 n m during the intrusion test the dehydrated sample was initially surrounded by mercury with a confining pressure of approximately 3 kpa the mercury then intruded into the pores with incremental liquid pressure until the system reached its maximum capacity 406 mpa in this study based on the pressure intrusion data of the test the relationship between the pressure and the intrusion volume of the mercury was obtained and the pore volume and its distribution were determined the equivalent diameter could be transformed and the pore characteristic parameters could be obtained to investigate the microfeature variation with the deformation development the cylinder samples that underwent triaxial cyclic loading were removed from the test apparatus and further tested by mip the detailed testing sets are shown in table 2 3 test results 3 1 accumulated plastic strain development fig 3 shows the accumulated plastic strain variation with the number of loading cycles under different csrs the data demonstrates that csr produces a significant effect on deformation development in clayed soils under cyclic loading the accumulated plastic strain increased rapidly under initial vibration and then continued to increase in a decreasing growth rate when the csr was 0 1 and 0 15 the accumulated plastic strain varied little after 3000 cycles and reached stable values of 1 0 and 2 4 respectively under which situation the samples could not reach the failure state when the csr was 0 25 a decreasing rate of accumulated plastic strain growth was detected before 2000 cycles and the accumulated plastic strain of 3 0 was recorded which increased by 60 compared with that under a csr of 0 15 when the cycles exceeded 2000 the accumulated plastic strain continued to increase linearly up to 4 5 when the target number of 5000 cycles was reached it could be predicted that the samples under a csr of 0 25 would finally fail with further loading when csr increased to 0 3 the accumulated plastic strain increased in exponential manner which resulted in nonconvergent development of deformation and reaching failure fig 3 demonstrates the effects of csr on deformation progression of soft clay when the csr is greater than 0 2 accumulated plastic strain increases at a high rate of growth initially and presented linear or concave grows before reaching the failure previous studies sweere 1990 tang et al 2014 have reported a linear variation of accumulated plastic strain versus number of cycles plotted in double logarithmic coordinates and proposed a predictable model of the accumulated plastic strain of clays under cyclic loading as follows 4 ε a n b where ε is the accumulated plastic strain n is the number of loading cycles and a and b are measurable parameters in this research a model in exponential form of ε with cycles n was advised as follows 5 ε a b c n where a b and c are undetermined parameters and the values obtained by nonlinear curve fitting mathematically were listed in table 3 table 3 reveals that a b increase with the csr and the relationships are plotted in fig 4 a good linear variation was discovered and mathematical relationship a b csr was proposed as follows 6 a o r b 22 3 c s r 1 05 while c was almost a constant value 0 999 based on above results the predicted model of accumulated plastic strain ε was determined as 7 ε 22 3 c s r 1 05 1 0 999 n where ε is accumulated plastic strain csr is cyclic stress ratio and n is vibration cycles it should be pointed out that ε increase of samples under 0 3 csr was not inconstancy with the empirical model in equation 7 the reason was that under 0 3 csr the deformation of soft marine clay was failure problem so that the parameter a b and c are absent in table 3 to conclude the predicted model equation 7 is valid within the limitation of power increase of ε under csr lower than 3 0 and provide reference for settlements measurement and control for tianjin binhai soft clay 3 2 changes in the microscopic characteristics based on sem to clearly investigate the variation of microscopic characteristics in soft marine clay during the deformation progress subjected to cyclic loading sem images were captured and shown in fig 5 the image pro plus software was used to quantify the micro parameters summarized in table 4 sem images were converted to a binary 2d image with the values of 0 white pixels referred to soil aggregates and 1 black pixels referred to pores zhang and cui 2017 the grayscale value of a certain pixel between 0 and 1 was determined and a few quantitative parameters were obtained within its algorithms pore number is the numbers of pore counted pore area ratio is the percentage of pore area to the whole measured area max pore diameter is the longest distance calculated between two points within the pore edge total pore perimeter is the whole length of pore edges roundness is a shape parameter calculated as follows 8 r p 2 4 π s where r is the pore roundness p is the pore perimeter and s is the pore area it could be noted that the roundness of circle is 1 prolate shape has a roundness higher than 1 it could be noted that in the initial micro scanning of remolded samples prior to cyclic loading large pores were observed among the aggregates which were formed by clay slices and occupied a large proportion of the volume composition leading to a large pore area ratio of 37 table 4 for the initial state of micro scanning the pores are extremely internally developed and the max pore diameter of the pores between particles is measured as 9 3 μm the aggregates are connected through face to point and point to point contacts which induces a significant compression potential after 500 loading cycles a remarkable variation is that the large pores are compressed reducing the max pore diameter to 8 9 μm and the pore area ratio to 33 the number of pores and the roundness varied little demonstrating the pore shape stability the void space decreased remarkably leading to a sharp increase in the accumulated plastic strain when the number of cycles increased up to 1000 the number of pores notably increased by 8 and the total pore perimeter increased by 17 compared to that at 500 cycles which implied that some aggregates were broken into smaller aggregates due to continuous pore compaction the pore area ratio decreased from 33 to 23 demonstrating an unstoppable deformation development it could be inferred that the growth rate of accumulated plastic strain decreased because the microstructure was densely compacted to some extent when the number of cycles reached 3000 compared to 1000 cycles the pore area ratio did not differ that much while with the increase of crushed broken particles the number of pores and the total pore perimeter slightly increased which means that the accumulated plastic strain presented a slow growth with proceeding cyclic loading fig 6 shows the micro variation in soft marine clay under different csrs at the same loading cycles of 1000 except for the csr 0 3 which failed at 600 loading cycles it should be noted that compared to fig 5 a different magnification of 10 μm was adopted to attain visible analyses of microscopic observations the parameters of max pore diameter pore area ratio and roundness are independent of the observational scale variation table 4 shows that large pores are compressed with a pore area ratio of 36 and a max pore diameter of 8 8 μm which resulted in the occurrence of accumulated plastic strain but without particle alteration or broken aggregates at 1000 cycles of vibration when the csr was 0 15 the pore area ratio reduced by 5 which led to a larger accumulated plastic strain than that when the csr was 0 1 furthermore the number of pores sharply increased by 56 which implied that some large diameter aggregates were broken into smaller aggregates in contrast for 0 25 csr compaction continued to occur and the pore area ratio reduced to 28 however the max pore diameter was measured at 18 μm twice as much as that for csr 0 15 the data revealed that large shear deformation was produced which induced an unstable increase in accumulated plastic strain when the csr was 0 3 the pore area ratio was measured at 43 and the max pore diameter was 29 μm the roundness was strikingly calculated as 151 which demonstrated the overall irregular shape of the pores this fact implied that a large amount of deformation developed and was not convergent the statistics revealed the influence of the csr on micro variations controlling the deformation development a low csr e g 0 1 or 0 15 would lead to a stable compaction of void spaces particle size arrangement and thus steady deformation progression for a high csr 0 25 and 0 3 the particles were compacted and large pores were re generated inducing divergent accumulated plastic strain 3 3 pore size distribution of mip data the pore diameter classification of soil provides remarkable convenience for analyzing micropore features and has been reported by many scholars lei 1985 conducted a mercury intrusion test on the loess in xi an and classified the pore diameters as extra large pores 250 μm large pores 250 16 μm medium size pores 16 4 μm small pores 4 1 μm and micropores 1 μm based on the statistical self similarity principle method jiang et al 2010 put forward the pore division segments of typical silt clays in tianjin after dynamic loading large pores 0 8 μm medium size pores 0 8 0 01 μm and micro pores 0 01 μm according to the mercury intrusion test data in this study the pore size in this study is classified into the following categories extra large pores 3 μm large pores 3 1 μm medium size pores 1 0 1 μm small pores 0 1 0 01 μm and micro pores 0 01 μm the pore size distribution of the soft marine clay subjected to cyclic loading with varied csr and loading cycles are summarized in table 5 pore size variation in dependent of incremental cycles was analyzed when csr was 0 25 the pore diameters of samples without cyclic loading are mainly distributed in the range of 0 01 3 μm with the volume percentages of small medium size and large pores being 17 2 41 7 and 33 3 respectively when csr was 0 25 after 500 loading cycles the medium size pore and small pore contents increased considerably 17 4 and 2 8 compared with the sample not subjected to cyclic loading while the large pore content decreased 18 9 which implies that the initial sharp increase of accumulated plastic strain is a result of large pore compaction with continuous loading cycles increased up to 1000 the medium size pore content reduced 2 4 compared to 500 cycles this indicates that the structure is kept compacted and the slowing deformation could be predicted the small pore content increased 3 2 which also demonstrated the slow increase of deformation after vibration cycles 3000 the small and medium size pore contents continues to decrease while large and extra large pore contents shows the tendency of increase implying that deformation continues to develop when loading cycles reaches 5000 under 0 25 csr large pore content was 24 1 increased 5 9 compared to that in 3000 loading cycles the increasing tendency in large pore content implies the continuously increase of accumulated plastic strain under higher vibration cycles under which situation the soil structure has become unstable with a predictable failure state with afterward continuous loading the variations of pore size distribution among different csrs were compared with the same loading cycle when the number of cycles is lower than 1000 the pore content under each classification slightly changed with csr varied from 0 1 to 0 25 this implied that under a small number of cycles the effect of the csr was not remarkable for the deformation occurred at early vibration much due to large pore compression when the cycles reach 3000 a remarkable variation in extra large pore content under 0 25 csr was observed as 9 7 while under 0 1 and 0 15 csr it was just 1 4 and 1 9 this indicates that extra large pore occurrence has offered the predictability of unstable deformation development analogous phenomenon was also observed when samples cyclic loaded up to fail under 0 3 csr with astonishing extra large pore content 12 4 the mip data analyses shows the inconsistency with the sem results and deformation progression 4 relationship between the microscopic characteristics and engineering properties mechanical behaviors by their very nature are dominated by the microscopic characteristics and many scholars tried to reveal the macro responses from the perspective of micro investigation chang et al 2009 assumed that clay material can be considered as assemble of clusters the deformation is generated by the mobilizing and compressing of all clusters yin et al 2011 yin and hicher 2013 microstructure modelling is established and verified related to shearing behaviors yin and chang 2009 yin et al 2009 and cyclic behaviors yin et al 2012 for clear insight of the deformation development micro parameter corresponding to the accumulated plastic strain is investigated fig 7 shows the variation of specific surface area with vibration cycles corresponding to the accumulated plastic strain the evolution of deformation could be summarized into three stages stage i initial compression in stage i initial compression stage the sharp increase of accumulated plastic strain is much deduced from the extra large pores compression it could be demonstrated that the specific surface area is almost unchanged which implies that the particle shape is relatively unchanged the particle number is around 1050 in stage ii particle size distribution stage the deformation continuously increases as the result of broken aggregates the specific surface area doubles which demonstrates the smaller diameter particles are generated and the particle number increases to around 1300 in stage iii stable stage or failure state the specific surface area slightly increases to a stable value which may show the continual compaction as the deformation of soft clay is mainly caused by the change in pore size compression which is closely related to the size and size distribution of soil particles based on the mercury intrusion test data median pore diameter was selected for correlation analysis below above which the cumulative pore volume occupies 50 of the total void space fig 8 shows the variation in the median pore diameter with the number of loading cycles for the samples subjected to cyclic loading csr 0 15 frequency 1 hz it can be seen that the median pore diameter decreases inversely with the vibration cycles overall detailed observation reveals that at early stage vibration the median pore diameter linearly decreases by 20 from 0 78 to 0 62 μm which reveals a fast increase in deformation when the number of cycles exceeds 1000 the median pore diameter decreases slowly to 0 54 μm at 3000 cycles and 0 52 μm at 5000 cycles which tends to become constant value the median pore diameter reflects the degree of void compaction and indirectly reveals the particle size distribution which is in good agreement with the deformation progress therefore it may be useful for predicting the accumulated plastic strain for samples with the advantage of convenience in physical index testing while ignoring external complex factors based on this consideration an empirical model of the median pore diameter versus the number of cycles is proposed as follows 9 d 0 53 0 25 0 999 n where d is the median pore diameter μm and n is the number of vibration cycles the relationship between accumulated plastic strain and the number of vibration cycles has been revealed in formula 7 thus the predicted model of accumulated plastic strain related to the median pore diameter can be obtained via mathematical conversion 10 ε 0 78 d 89 2 c s r 4 2 where d is the median pore diameter μm and ε is the accumulated plastic strain it should be noted that this prediction model is based on eq 7 with a same validity limitation of lower csr than 0 3 powerful increase of ε for tianjin binhai soft clay it can be discussed that csrs lower than 0 25 leads to stable deformation high csr values increase the risk of failure and should be avoided and fully considered in the design of a project in practice fig 9 shows the three dimensional variation of accumulated plastic strain of samples in medium pore diameter csr space it can be seen that the accumulated plastic strain was settled in a nonlinear 3d surface and lower csr and high medium pore diameter induced a small accumulated plastic strain with the variation of medium pore diameter striking change could be observed in ε which showed the close relation between these two measurements and the validity of representative of ε using medium pore diameter d fig 10 shows the variation of median pore diameter with accumulated plastic strain of samples under different csrs it can be seen that the median pore diameter reduces with the plastic strain increases from a whole view when csr is 0 1 a linear reduction of median pore diameter is observed in the prophase variation but tends to become a constant at the final phase furthermore under the same vibration cycles the stable plastic strain under csr is about 1 far less than other csrs the variation character of median pore diameter shows a favorable agreement with the deformation development when csr is 0 15 the curve trend is similar to the variation of 0 1 csr with the difference showing that much further deformation progress is observed under 0 15 csr median pore diameter decreases by 60 during cyclic loading under 0 15 csr when csr is 0 25 or 0 3 a notable point different from smaller csrs is that median pore diameter rises in later cyclic load phases rather than becomes stable the likely reason is that under these csrs deformation of samples is not convergent which leads to the severe failure of soil structure thus generating new large pores increasing the median pore diameter it should be noted that the empirical model is displayed in colored dot lines in fig 10 it can be seen that the empirical line is in good consistency with the test line which demonstrates the reliability of the proposed model for practice probability fig 11 shows the variation in the median pore diameter with csr under different vibration cycles an overall reduction in the median pore diameter is observed a linear reduction of median pore diameter with csr increase was observed additionally the data point in 0 3 csr was far deviated from the linear trace the reason was that predictable model was valid with its own limitations csr lower than 0 3 powerful increase of ε this point may be exactly a demonstration of the model accuracy 5 conclusions laboratory work was conducted to investigate the deformation progress of soft marine clay under cyclic loading and scanning electron microscopy sem and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip tests were carried out to reveal the microfeature variations correlation analyses between the microscopic characteristics and the deformation progress were performed to strengthen the understanding of the dynamic deformation of soft marine clay the following conclusions were drawn 1 the cyclic stress ratio csr produced a pronounced effect on the deformation properties of soft clay high csrs than 0 25 induced failure accumulated plastic strains for low csrs such as 0 1 or 0 15 the deformation increased gradually to a constant value while for csrs greater than 0 2 the deformation of soft clay presented a linear or power increase which led to the destruction of the soil structure a predictable model of accumulated plastic strain related to cycles was proposed for evaluation of deformation development 2 large pores with extreme internal widths and depths among the aggregates of clay slices were observed in samples prior to cyclic loading based on sem images under initial vibration the large pores were strongly compressed resulting in a sharp increase in accumulated plastic strain with increasing vibration cycles the pore area ratio obtained by sem decreased from 37 to 25 and the large aggregates were visibly crushed into smaller aggregates leading to a 24 increase in the number of pores which led to the slowly increase of deformation under low csrs when csr was higher than 0 25 large diameter pores were regenerated at later stage load resulting in divergent development of accumulated plastic strain the mip data showed that the content of pores in 1 3 μm diameter decreased by approximately 20 while the pores in 0 01 1 μm diameter increased by approximately 15 which indicates void compression behavior and accumulated plastic strain occurrence at early stage vibration with increasing cycles the pore size distribution tended to be stable under low csrs while for high csrs the large pore content showed a tendency to increase resulting from the continuous progression of deformation 3 the median pore diameter decreased with increasing cycles the empirical model of accumulated plastic strain related to median pore diameter and csr was established for assessing the strain state in subgrade settlement monitoring taking advantage of indoor soil physical testing noted that the proposed model should be valid for csrs lower than 0 3

22296,soft marine clay is susceptible to deformation under cyclic loading controlled by microstructure variations to investigate the microscopic characteristics of soft clay with the progression of deformation under cyclic loading a detailed study has been conducted using consolidated undrained cyclic triaxial tests as well as mercury intrusion porosimetry mip and scanning electron microscopy sem the relationships between the micro parameters and accumulated plastic strain of soft marine clay are discussed cyclic triaxial test results show that low cyclic stress ratio csr induces stable deformation while for greater csr the deformation of soft marine clay presents a closely linear or exponential increase which leads to the destructuration of the soil structure the microanalysis shows that with vibration cycles under 0 15 csr the content of pore obtained by sem decreases from 37 to 25 and large aggregates are visibly crushed into smaller ones leading to a 24 increase in the pore numbers which shows the slow increase of the deformation when the csr is greater than 0 25 large diameter pores generate resulting in divergent development of accumulated plastic strain an empirical

al 2005 gräbe and clayton 2009 li et al 2011 leng et al 2017 wang et al 2019 many influencing factors for the deformation of soft marine clay e g waveform vibration frequency cyclic stress ratio confining pressure principal stress rotation temperature static deviator stress and vibration cycle are investigated cyclic stress level is demonstrated a critical factor in presenting different deformation development and the conception of critical cyclic stress ratio is established below which the accumulated plastic strain gradually becomes stable hyde et al 1993 yang et al 2012 higher cyclic stress ratio over the critical value accelerates the creep behavior of soft marine clay under cyclic loading condition and produces a detrimental response of deformation characteristics lei et al 2016c soil initial state prior to cyclic loading also exhibits peculiar responses of dynamic performance e g water content void ratio confining pressures degree of consolidation and so on tang et al 2014 sun et al 2015 lin et al 2017 the principal stress rotation is a heated topic discussed with hollow cylindrical torsional shear tests gräbe and clayton 2009 cai et al 2018 frequency is a disputed parameter for the dynamic deformation of clay soil lei et al 2016a it could be concluded the deformation of soft marine clay is a susceptible variable which has close relationships to the external factors under complex stratigraphic environment the prediction and monitoring of soft marine clay foundation settlement presents large discrepancy due to limits of laboratory study though uncontrollable external complexity the deformation performance are dominated by microscopic characters which is worthy of detailed investigation cui and jia 2013 zhang and cui 2017 currently microscopic characteristics of soil structures are commonly assessed using scanning electron microscopy sem and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip sem is a digital fractal surface scanning test which produces 2d images of interested areas information about particle or particle aggregates shape size and connections could be obtained for qualitative analysis with the improved technologies partial quantitative data could be calculated based on image processing software with otsu method cui and jia 2013 but with extreme subjectivity fractal dimension values of the quantitatively sem images decreased with the increasing of magnification in measured photos dathe et al 2001 the image magnification was also demonstrated the effect on the relationships between size proportion and quantitative results liu et al 2005 varied grayscale value induced great differences on measured results bird et al 2006 it should be noted that though sem quantitative analysis may suffered from the operator s experience which may not represent the precise conceptual value quantitative work performs valuable assists on contrastive analysis lei et al 2016c conducted a series of consolidated undrained triaxial tests and verified the change in microstructure under accelerated creep conditions of soft clay yang et al 2014 studied the microstructure of hangzhou intact clay under a wave loading condition by sem and pcas quantitative testing technology based on fractal theory bock et al 2006 investigated the micromechanical behavior of opalinus clay and revealed the variation law of microscopic characteristics cuisinier et al 2011 revealed that lime addition to clay soils changed the pore size distributions based on mip test results as a summary of field research many scholars focused much attention on solo considerations i e deformation properties related to related influencing factors microstructure studies under certain physical or mechanical states especially for soils reaching critical state or failure systematic research on the microscopic variation in soft marine clay with the deformation development under cyclic loading has not been clearly assessed therefore the objective of this study is to systematically investigate the change in microfeatures of soft clay subjected to cyclic loading to achieve this consolidated undrained cyclic tests on a batch of remolded cylinder samples were designed that terminated at different loading cycles with a subsequent micro tests by sem and mip the relationships of the microscopic parameters with engineering properties were discussed to obtain a better understanding of the development of cyclic deformation 2 materials and test procedure 2 1 soil properties the samples were obtained underground at a depth of 10 15 m from tianjin binhai new area the plastic index ip is 20 6 and the natural void ratio is greater than 1 0 the hydrometer method with a tm 85 soil densimeter tianjin jin anrui instrument institute china was used to determine the grain size distribution fig 1 clay particles diameter 0 002 mm account for 42 of the total composition and the remaining 58 are silt particles 0 002 mm diameter 0 075 mm table 1 summarizes the physical properties of soft marine clay used in this study the ratio of the natural water content to the liquid limit is approximately 0 8 the liquid limit of the soil sample is 47 7 and the plasticity index pi is 27 1 it can be seen that all the data lie slightly above the a line defined by p i 0 73 ω l 20 but below the u line defined by p i 0 9 ω l 8 in the plasticity chart therefore the soil sample is clay soils according to the unified soil classification system uscs the sample is classified as cl 2 2 sample preparation remodeled cylindrical samples with 38 1 mm in diameter and 80 mm in height were prepared for homogeneity purpose a batch of bulk clay was oven dried at 105 110 c to a constant mass allowed to cool to ambient laboratory temperature 20 c disaggregated and then sieved to obtain the fraction that passes through a 2 mm sieve the powered soil was thoroughly mixed with deionized water to obtain 40 water content with subsequent compaction in a cylinder mold based on the natural density the molds with the soil samples were placed into a vacuum saturator machine where the molds were vacuumed for 2 h and then immersed in distilled water allowed to settle for at least 12h which induced a good saturation level under the pressure difference 2 3 cyclic triaxial tests cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on a british gds triaxial machine stress controlled loads were applied using a digitally controlled system cell pressures were controlled manually with a digital transducer prior to the consolidation the re saturation of samples with back pressure was conducted and the saturability was checked using b value method embedded in the machine system defined as 1 b δ u δ σ 3 where δ u is the induced pore water pressure increment when the cell pressure increment δ σ 3 is applied once b value is upon 97 a series of anisotropic consolidation was carried out at a 50 kpa effective cell pressure and 100 kpa effective vertical pressure during which drainage was permitted at the top and bottom surfaces of the sample with filter paper clinging to both ends of the sample once the rate of deformation was less than 0 001 mm h or a time duration of 48 h of consolidation was reached consolidation was terminated and followed by undrained cyclic testing all tests were performed at the room temperature of 20 2 c sinusoidal waves were applied for cyclic loading and the amplitude of the sinusoidal waves was equal to the deviatoric stress fig 2 the specimens were undrained and subjected to 5000 cycles except for those that failed the cumulative axial strain exceeded 5 before 5000 cycles in this study the dynamic stress was considered using a parameter of the cyclic stress ratio as follows 2 c s r σ d 2 σ 3 where σ d is the amplitude cyclic deviator stress and σ 3 is the effective confining pressure four csrs of 0 1 0 15 0 25 and 0 3 were considered as shown in table 2 2 4 sem analyses scanning electron microscopy sem is a technique that produces images of a sample structure by scanning it with a focused beam of electrons sem has been commonly used to study the microstructures of soil samples all samples were initially trimmed into 1 cm3 cubes and were coated with electrically conductive material to be suitable for testing in this study kong et al 1995 dehydrated bulk samples are required and prepared prior to the test freeze drying is the most appropriate choice for dehydrating soil samples in this study the soil samples were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen boiling point 196 c for 2 min during which water reserved within the samples sharply transformed into a solid state amorphous ice without enough time to recrystallize leading to the preservation of soil structures without water volume expansion the frozen sample was then placed in a vacuum environment at a temperature of 50 c for at least 24 h where the frozen moisture was sublimated and dried well the samples under the prescribed loading conditions that needed for sem analysis are shown in table 2 2 5 mip analyses mercury intrusion porosimetry mip was conducted gallé 2001 to verify the variations in porosity and pore size distribution the pore size distribution curve can be obtained from the intruded volume of mercury at each pressure step the tests were conducted in the 9510 mercury intrusion machine produced by mac with a measuring range of 0 003 360 μm prior to mip a freeze drying technique similar to the sem analysis preparation was used to remove moisture from the porous structure mip involves the measurement of the volume of mercury injected into the porous medium with increasing applied pressure pressure differences can be converted to pore diameters using the washburn equation washburn 1921 3 p 2 σ cos α r where p is the intrusion pressure r is the pore radius based on the assumption that the pores are cylindrical in shape α is the contact angle between mercury and soil which remains at a constant value of 130 and σ is a surface tension of 0 485 n m during the intrusion test the dehydrated sample was initially surrounded by mercury with a confining pressure of approximately 3 kpa the mercury then intruded into the pores with incremental liquid pressure until the system reached its maximum capacity 406 mpa in this study based on the pressure intrusion data of the test the relationship between the pressure and the intrusion volume of the mercury was obtained and the pore volume and its distribution were determined the equivalent diameter could be transformed and the pore characteristic parameters could be obtained to investigate the microfeature variation with the deformation development the cylinder samples that underwent triaxial cyclic loading were removed from the test apparatus and further tested by mip the detailed testing sets are shown in table 2 3 test results 3 1 accumulated plastic strain development fig 3 shows the accumulated plastic strain variation with the number of loading cycles under different csrs the data demonstrates that csr produces a significant effect on deformation development in clayed soils under cyclic loading the accumulated plastic strain increased rapidly under initial vibration and then continued to increase in a decreasing growth rate when the csr was 0 1 and 0 15 the accumulated plastic strain varied little after 3000 cycles and reached stable values of 1 0 and 2 4 respectively under which situation the samples could not reach the failure state when the csr was 0 25 a decreasing rate of accumulated plastic strain growth was detected before 2000 cycles and the accumulated plastic strain of 3 0 was recorded which increased by 60 compared with that under a csr of 0 15 when the cycles exceeded 2000 the accumulated plastic strain continued to increase linearly up to 4 5 when the target number of 5000 cycles was reached it could be predicted that the samples under a csr of 0 25 would finally fail with further loading when csr increased to 0 3 the accumulated plastic strain increased in exponential manner which resulted in nonconvergent development of deformation and reaching failure fig 3 demonstrates the effects of csr on deformation progression of soft clay when the csr is greater than 0 2 accumulated plastic strain increases at a high rate of growth initially and presented linear or concave grows before reaching the failure previous studies sweere 1990 tang et al 2014 have reported a linear variation of accumulated plastic strain versus number of cycles plotted in double logarithmic coordinates and proposed a predictable model of the accumulated plastic strain of clays under cyclic loading as follows 4 ε a n b where ε is the accumulated plastic strain n is the number of loading cycles and a and b are measurable parameters in this research a model in exponential form of ε with cycles n was advised as follows 5 ε a b c n where a b and c are undetermined parameters and the values obtained by nonlinear curve fitting mathematically were listed in table 3 table 3 reveals that a b increase with the csr and the relationships are plotted in fig 4 a good linear variation was discovered and mathematical relationship a b csr was proposed as follows 6 a o r b 22 3 c s r 1 05 while c was almost a constant value 0 999 based on above results the predicted model of accumulated plastic strain ε was determined as 7 ε 22 3 c s r 1 05 1 0 999 n where ε is accumulated plastic strain csr is cyclic stress ratio and n is vibration cycles it should be pointed out that ε increase of samples under 0 3 csr was not inconstancy with the empirical model in equation 7 the reason was that under 0 3 csr the deformation of soft marine clay was failure problem so that the parameter a b and c are absent in table 3 to conclude the predicted model equation 7 is valid within the limitation of power increase of ε under csr lower than 3 0 and provide reference for settlements measurement and control for tianjin binhai soft clay 3 2 changes in the microscopic characteristics based on sem to clearly investigate the variation of microscopic characteristics in soft marine clay during the deformation progress subjected to cyclic loading sem images were captured and shown in fig 5 the image pro plus software was used to quantify the micro parameters summarized in table 4 sem images were converted to a binary 2d image with the values of 0 white pixels referred to soil aggregates and 1 black pixels referred to pores zhang and cui 2017 the grayscale value of a certain pixel between 0 and 1 was determined and a few quantitative parameters were obtained within its algorithms pore number is the numbers of pore counted pore area ratio is the percentage of pore area to the whole measured area max pore diameter is the longest distance calculated between two points within the pore edge total pore perimeter is the whole length of pore edges roundness is a shape parameter calculated as follows 8 r p 2 4 π s where r is the pore roundness p is the pore perimeter and s is the pore area it could be noted that the roundness of circle is 1 prolate shape has a roundness higher than 1 it could be noted that in the initial micro scanning of remolded samples prior to cyclic loading large pores were observed among the aggregates which were formed by clay slices and occupied a large proportion of the volume composition leading to a large pore area ratio of 37 table 4 for the initial state of micro scanning the pores are extremely internally developed and the max pore diameter of the pores between particles is measured as 9 3 μm the aggregates are connected through face to point and point to point contacts which induces a significant compression potential after 500 loading cycles a remarkable variation is that the large pores are compressed reducing the max pore diameter to 8 9 μm and the pore area ratio to 33 the number of pores and the roundness varied little demonstrating the pore shape stability the void space decreased remarkably leading to a sharp increase in the accumulated plastic strain when the number of cycles increased up to 1000 the number of pores notably increased by 8 and the total pore perimeter increased by 17 compared to that at 500 cycles which implied that some aggregates were broken into smaller aggregates due to continuous pore compaction the pore area ratio decreased from 33 to 23 demonstrating an unstoppable deformation development it could be inferred that the growth rate of accumulated plastic strain decreased because the microstructure was densely compacted to some extent when the number of cycles reached 3000 compared to 1000 cycles the pore area ratio did not differ that much while with the increase of crushed broken particles the number of pores and the total pore perimeter slightly increased which means that the accumulated plastic strain presented a slow growth with proceeding cyclic loading fig 6 shows the micro variation in soft marine clay under different csrs at the same loading cycles of 1000 except for the csr 0 3 which failed at 600 loading cycles it should be noted that compared to fig 5 a different magnification of 10 μm was adopted to attain visible analyses of microscopic observations the parameters of max pore diameter pore area ratio and roundness are independent of the observational scale variation table 4 shows that large pores are compressed with a pore area ratio of 36 and a max pore diameter of 8 8 μm which resulted in the occurrence of accumulated plastic strain but without particle alteration or broken aggregates at 1000 cycles of vibration when the csr was 0 15 the pore area ratio reduced by 5 which led to a larger accumulated plastic strain than that when the csr was 0 1 furthermore the number of pores sharply increased by 56 which implied that some large diameter aggregates were broken into smaller aggregates in contrast for 0 25 csr compaction continued to occur and the pore area ratio reduced to 28 however the max pore diameter was measured at 18 μm twice as much as that for csr 0 15 the data revealed that large shear deformation was produced which induced an unstable increase in accumulated plastic strain when the csr was 0 3 the pore area ratio was measured at 43 and the max pore diameter was 29 μm the roundness was strikingly calculated as 151 which demonstrated the overall irregular shape of the pores this fact implied that a large amount of deformation developed and was not convergent the statistics revealed the influence of the csr on micro variations controlling the deformation development a low csr e g 0 1 or 0 15 would lead to a stable compaction of void spaces particle size arrangement and thus steady deformation progression for a high csr 0 25 and 0 3 the particles were compacted and large pores were re generated inducing divergent accumulated plastic strain 3 3 pore size distribution of mip data the pore diameter classification of soil provides remarkable convenience for analyzing micropore features and has been reported by many scholars lei 1985 conducted a mercury intrusion test on the loess in xi an and classified the pore diameters as extra large pores 250 μm large pores 250 16 μm medium size pores 16 4 μm small pores 4 1 μm and micropores 1 μm based on the statistical self similarity principle method jiang et al 2010 put forward the pore division segments of typical silt clays in tianjin after dynamic loading large pores 0 8 μm medium size pores 0 8 0 01 μm and micro pores 0 01 μm according to the mercury intrusion test data in this study the pore size in this study is classified into the following categories extra large pores 3 μm large pores 3 1 μm medium size pores 1 0 1 μm small pores 0 1 0 01 μm and micro pores 0 01 μm the pore size distribution of the soft marine clay subjected to cyclic loading with varied csr and loading cycles are summarized in table 5 pore size variation in dependent of incremental cycles was analyzed when csr was 0 25 the pore diameters of samples without cyclic loading are mainly distributed in the range of 0 01 3 μm with the volume percentages of small medium size and large pores being 17 2 41 7 and 33 3 respectively when csr was 0 25 after 500 loading cycles the medium size pore and small pore contents increased considerably 17 4 and 2 8 compared with the sample not subjected to cyclic loading while the large pore content decreased 18 9 which implies that the initial sharp increase of accumulated plastic strain is a result of large pore compaction with continuous loading cycles increased up to 1000 the medium size pore content reduced 2 4 compared to 500 cycles this indicates that the structure is kept compacted and the slowing deformation could be predicted the small pore content increased 3 2 which also demonstrated the slow increase of deformation after vibration cycles 3000 the small and medium size pore contents continues to decrease while large and extra large pore contents shows the tendency of increase implying that deformation continues to develop when loading cycles reaches 5000 under 0 25 csr large pore content was 24 1 increased 5 9 compared to that in 3000 loading cycles the increasing tendency in large pore content implies the continuously increase of accumulated plastic strain under higher vibration cycles under which situation the soil structure has become unstable with a predictable failure state with afterward continuous loading the variations of pore size distribution among different csrs were compared with the same loading cycle when the number of cycles is lower than 1000 the pore content under each classification slightly changed with csr varied from 0 1 to 0 25 this implied that under a small number of cycles the effect of the csr was not remarkable for the deformation occurred at early vibration much due to large pore compression when the cycles reach 3000 a remarkable variation in extra large pore content under 0 25 csr was observed as 9 7 while under 0 1 and 0 15 csr it was just 1 4 and 1 9 this indicates that extra large pore occurrence has offered the predictability of unstable deformation development analogous phenomenon was also observed when samples cyclic loaded up to fail under 0 3 csr with astonishing extra large pore content 12 4 the mip data analyses shows the inconsistency with the sem results and deformation progression 4 relationship between the microscopic characteristics and engineering properties mechanical behaviors by their very nature are dominated by the microscopic characteristics and many scholars tried to reveal the macro responses from the perspective of micro investigation chang et al 2009 assumed that clay material can be considered as assemble of clusters the deformation is generated by the mobilizing and compressing of all clusters yin et al 2011 yin and hicher 2013 microstructure modelling is established and verified related to shearing behaviors yin and chang 2009 yin et al 2009 and cyclic behaviors yin et al 2012 for clear insight of the deformation development micro parameter corresponding to the accumulated plastic strain is investigated fig 7 shows the variation of specific surface area with vibration cycles corresponding to the accumulated plastic strain the evolution of deformation could be summarized into three stages stage i initial compression in stage i initial compression stage the sharp increase of accumulated plastic strain is much deduced from the extra large pores compression it could be demonstrated that the specific surface area is almost unchanged which implies that the particle shape is relatively unchanged the particle number is around 1050 in stage ii particle size distribution stage the deformation continuously increases as the result of broken aggregates the specific surface area doubles which demonstrates the smaller diameter particles are generated and the particle number increases to around 1300 in stage iii stable stage or failure state the specific surface area slightly increases to a stable value which may show the continual compaction as the deformation of soft clay is mainly caused by the change in pore size compression which is closely related to the size and size distribution of soil particles based on the mercury intrusion test data median pore diameter was selected for correlation analysis below above which the cumulative pore volume occupies 50 of the total void space fig 8 shows the variation in the median pore diameter with the number of loading cycles for the samples subjected to cyclic loading csr 0 15 frequency 1 hz it can be seen that the median pore diameter decreases inversely with the vibration cycles overall detailed observation reveals that at early stage vibration the median pore diameter linearly decreases by 20 from 0 78 to 0 62 μm which reveals a fast increase in deformation when the number of cycles exceeds 1000 the median pore diameter decreases slowly to 0 54 μm at 3000 cycles and 0 52 μm at 5000 cycles which tends to become constant value the median pore diameter reflects the degree of void compaction and indirectly reveals the particle size distribution which is in good agreement with the deformation progress therefore it may be useful for predicting the accumulated plastic strain for samples with the advantage of convenience in physical index testing while ignoring external complex factors based on this consideration an empirical model of the median pore diameter versus the number of cycles is proposed as follows 9 d 0 53 0 25 0 999 n where d is the median pore diameter μm and n is the number of vibration cycles the relationship between accumulated plastic strain and the number of vibration cycles has been revealed in formula 7 thus the predicted model of accumulated plastic strain related to the median pore diameter can be obtained via mathematical conversion 10 ε 0 78 d 89 2 c s r 4 2 where d is the median pore diameter μm and ε is the accumulated plastic strain it should be noted that this prediction model is based on eq 7 with a same validity limitation of lower csr than 0 3 powerful increase of ε for tianjin binhai soft clay it can be discussed that csrs lower than 0 25 leads to stable deformation high csr values increase the risk of failure and should be avoided and fully considered in the design of a project in practice fig 9 shows the three dimensional variation of accumulated plastic strain of samples in medium pore diameter csr space it can be seen that the accumulated plastic strain was settled in a nonlinear 3d surface and lower csr and high medium pore diameter induced a small accumulated plastic strain with the variation of medium pore diameter striking change could be observed in ε which showed the close relation between these two measurements and the validity of representative of ε using medium pore diameter d fig 10 shows the variation of median pore diameter with accumulated plastic strain of samples under different csrs it can be seen that the median pore diameter reduces with the plastic strain increases from a whole view when csr is 0 1 a linear reduction of median pore diameter is observed in the prophase variation but tends to become a constant at the final phase furthermore under the same vibration cycles the stable plastic strain under csr is about 1 far less than other csrs the variation character of median pore diameter shows a favorable agreement with the deformation development when csr is 0 15 the curve trend is similar to the variation of 0 1 csr with the difference showing that much further deformation progress is observed under 0 15 csr median pore diameter decreases by 60 during cyclic loading under 0 15 csr when csr is 0 25 or 0 3 a notable point different from smaller csrs is that median pore diameter rises in later cyclic load phases rather than becomes stable the likely reason is that under these csrs deformation of samples is not convergent which leads to the severe failure of soil structure thus generating new large pores increasing the median pore diameter it should be noted that the empirical model is displayed in colored dot lines in fig 10 it can be seen that the empirical line is in good consistency with the test line which demonstrates the reliability of the proposed model for practice probability fig 11 shows the variation in the median pore diameter with csr under different vibration cycles an overall reduction in the median pore diameter is observed a linear reduction of median pore diameter with csr increase was observed additionally the data point in 0 3 csr was far deviated from the linear trace the reason was that predictable model was valid with its own limitations csr lower than 0 3 powerful increase of ε this point may be exactly a demonstration of the model accuracy 5 conclusions laboratory work was conducted to investigate the deformation progress of soft marine clay under cyclic loading and scanning electron microscopy sem and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip tests were carried out to reveal the microfeature variations correlation analyses between the microscopic characteristics and the deformation progress were performed to strengthen the understanding of the dynamic deformation of soft marine clay the following conclusions were drawn 1 the cyclic stress ratio csr produced a pronounced effect on the deformation properties of soft clay high csrs than 0 25 induced failure accumulated plastic strains for low csrs such as 0 1 or 0 15 the deformation increased gradually to a constant value while for csrs greater than 0 2 the deformation of soft clay presented a linear or power increase which led to the destruction of the soil structure a predictable model of accumulated plastic strain related to cycles was proposed for evaluation of deformation development 2 large pores with extreme internal widths and depths among the aggregates of clay slices were observed in samples prior to cyclic loading based on sem images under initial vibration the large pores were strongly compressed resulting in a sharp increase in accumulated plastic strain with increasing vibration cycles the pore area ratio obtained by sem decreased from 37 to 25 and the large aggregates were visibly crushed into smaller aggregates leading to a 24 increase in the number of pores which led to the slowly increase of deformation under low csrs when csr was higher than 0 25 large diameter pores were regenerated at later stage load resulting in divergent development of accumulated plastic strain the mip data showed that the content of pores in 1 3 μm diameter decreased by approximately 20 while the pores in 0 01 1 μm diameter increased by approximately 15 which indicates void compression behavior and accumulated plastic strain occurrence at early stage vibration with increasing cycles the pore size distribution tended to be stable under low csrs while for high csrs the large pore content showed a tendency to increase resulting from the continuous progression of deformation 3 the median pore diameter decreased with increasing cycles the empirical model of accumulated plastic strain related to median pore diameter and csr was established for assessing the strain state in subgrade settlement monitoring taking advantage of indoor soil physical testing noted that the proposed model should be valid for csrs lower than 0 3

1 introduction optimal design of structures exposed to the fluid flow is the topic of various studies related to fish motion snoring paper processing and ocean energy harvesting in recent years abdollahzadeh jamalabadi et al 2018 turek and hron 2006 breuer et al 2012 datta and gottenberg 1975 langre 2008 wang et al 2018 nayer et al 2014 kalmbach and breuer 2013 eloy et al 2008 farhat et al 1998 a deformable structure submerged in a fluid stream may experience compression twist and vibration induced by the fluid forces on its surface a classical flow structure behind a solid body is the vortex street of von kármán these induced vortices result in vibrations of the solid object and its support this fluid solid interaction phenomenon involves stress and displacement relationship between two fields where the large distortion in the solid affects the laminar fluid flow regime to reduce fluid resistance on structure and noise level usually a splitter plate is installed on the structure which prevents generating a karman vortex jamalabadi et al abdollahzadeh jamalabadi et al 2018 found the optimal design of circular baffles in the fluid motion problem occurred in a rectangular tank which is horizontally coupled with a one story structure as well various numerical studies are proposed for fluid structure interaction by turek and hron 2006 they study the cases of laminar incompressible flow exposed to an elastic object in the turbulent regime breuer et al 2012 simulated the fluid structure interaction using a partitioned semi implicit predictor corrector coupling scheme by large eddy models the problem of instability of an elastic material exposed to the fluid current is another interesting problem studied by researchers datta and gottenberg 1975 the solid also could be varied from the hookean solid cases the effects of wind on non linear solids such as plants are discussed in literature which has not a simple geometry langre 2008 the shape of the object could be simple like a cylinder wang et al 2018 or irregular like plants langre 2008 wang et al 2018 study numerically as well as experimentally the fsi problem of flow past a cylinder where a flexible splitter beam attached behind it for the large scale devices the fast fluid speed high reynolds number region reduces the fluid resistance and decreasing the noise is necessary nayer et al 2014 and kalmbach et al kalmbach and breuer 2013 in an optical contact free flow in a water tunnel showed that the flexible plate deformation in turbulent flow reynolds numbers 30470 could be modeled efficiently using les the limit of the instability of that problem is discussed by eloy et al 2008 for small lateral deflections they assumed the plate motion is driven by the linearized euler bernoulli equation as shown the aeroelastic instability of cantilevered flexible plates in uniform flow started at a reduced velocity of 7 5 u 7 5l 1m 1 2 d 1 2 in numerical modeling of such problem the solution of momentum energy conservations as well as optimal discretization are the milestones to capture fsi phenomena the new numerical method for load and motion transformation between fluid and structure domain is developed by farhat et al 1998 they focused on interaction problems with non matching discrete interfaces with an application to aeroelasticity the other problem arises in fsi is the instability of the structure which is investigated widely by the various authors eloy et al 2008 gomes and lienhart 2013 kornecki et al 1976 lemaitre et al 2005 wüchner and bletzinger 2005 kornecki et al gomes and lienhart 2013 investigate the aeroelastic instability of two dimensional panels in uniform incompressible flow more than four decades before while the problem is studied by lemaitre et al kornecki et al 1976 as well from the instability point of view in expose to the uniform flow but the reynolds number range was limited to the specific values the broader problem of self excited instability is investigated by gomes et al lemaitre et al 2005 they investigated the instability of flexible solid 10 re 1 69 10 5 which presented that the structure motion and the mechanism of excitation instability or movement induced excitation is a function of the flow fluctuation and structure s natural frequencies as well they showed that the instability excitation is a function of the geometry of the front body of the structure while the movement induced excitation is a function of reynolds number wüchner and bletzinger 2005 shown that pre stress has a significant role in the fsi problem and instability of the solid the adequacy of this domain size has been demonstrated in previous studies of uncontrolled and controlled flow past a cylinder at delaunay and kaiktsis 2001 in

optimal design of vibrating beam exposed to the fluid flow for the large and small scale devices addressing instability and ocean engineering shows that the optimization of the length of flexible splitter beam attached to the circular cylinder and for various average velocities is not performed yet in the current investigation the optimal design of the vibrating beam attached to a rigid circular cylinder for von kármán vortex reduction is presented numerically the rest of the paper provides the problem definition and the information of the mathematical modeling it is followed by the numerical validation with the benchmark and the numerical consequences of fsi of vibrating beam attached to the circular cylinder as a final point concluding remarks are presented in the last section 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 geometrical parameters the flow around a circular cylinder plus an elastic bar behind it is the physical domain of this research fig 1 shows the 2d diagram of fluid beam interaction with its cross section geometric parameters are shown in fig 1a as presented in fig 1a the domain with the dimensions given in table 1 where the positions of three points are a 0 6 0 2 b 0 15 0 2 c 0 2 0 2 the black part is a solid domain and the blue part is the fluid domain a parabolic velocity profile is prescribed at the left channel inflow other parameters are in table 1 various cases in table 1 are extracted from table 12 of reference turek and hron 2006 which is parameter settings for the full fsi benchmarks the system is composed of a cylinder mass bluff body with an elastic beam mounted on it in a confined environment with the inlet left channel inflow average velocity of v and a parabolic velocity outline in fig 1b the domain is plotted with the physical quantities of the problem flow direction integration path for the force calculation and sizes given in table 1 the fluid material in case a and c has properties similar to glycerin but the design of such a benchmark turek and hron 2006 most aimed at satisfying the non dimensional parameters such as reynolds number and propose such constants to achieve less numerical error throughout the discretization of governing equations as the reynolds number in this problem is low the laminar regime is suitable for modeling of the fluid motion in literature turek and hron s benchmark is utilized to confirm the fsi models turek and hron 2006 they set the benchmark for the rigorous evaluation of different methods for fluid structure interaction problems similar to these older configurations they consider the fluid to be incompressible and in the laminar regime the setting is intentionally non symmetric to prevent the dependence of the onset of any promising oscillation on the precision of the computation this benchmark aims to develop objective criteria for the evaluation of the different algorithmic approaches the adequacy of this domain size has been demonstrated in previous studies of uncontrolled and controlled flow past a cylinder in delaunay and kaiktsis 2001 2 2 fluid model the fluid is considered to be newtonian incompressible flow fields are computed from the numerical solution of the non dimensional navier stokes equations for two dimensional incompressible viscous flow the continuity equation of the fluid is 1 u f 0 where u f u v is the velocity vector the momentum equation of the fluid is 2 ρ u t η f u f u f t ρ f u f u f p f 0 where p is the static pressure t is time cartesian coordinates x y η is the fluid viscosity and ρ is the fluid density the inflow condition at left channel is parabolic laminar 3 u f 0 y 6 u y h y the outflow condition at right channel outflow same as in the incompressible case is chosen by the prescribed the zero pressure reference value at the right side of the channel 4 p f l y 0 the no slip condition is used at the bottom wall at the top wall and the wall of the cylinder body 5 u f x 0 0 6 u f x h 0 7 u f n 0 where n is the direction normal to the boundary the flow is impulsively started and the beam is perturbed by a small body force 1 n gaussian pulse at point a at the initial time step to break the symmetry 2 3 solid model solid modeling or modeling in this subsection is presented as a set of consistent equations for computer implementation of two dimensional solids the cauchy stress tensor symmetric true stress σ s the kirchhoff stress weighted cauchy stress tensor τ j σ s the nominal stress the first piola kirchhoff stress transpose of the nominal stress fs the second piola kirchhoff stress pk2 the biot stress energy conjugate to the right stretch tensor us and the mandel stress tensor u 2 s f t fs the solid model coupled with the fluid model determines how the solid geometry changes under the influence of the fluid forces with its emphasis on physical fidelity the displacement of the beam is a function of time where the structure is assumed to be elastic and compressible which was used for the rubber like material such as polybutadiene cork polyurethane polypropylene pvc and steel for such materials 2nd piola kirchhoff stress tensor for the material with the poisson ratio of νs and young s modulus of e is defined by 8 s e 1 ν s e ν s e 1 ν s 1 2 ν s tr e i where tr is the trace of the matrix i is the eye tensor the first and second coefficients in eq 8 are lam e coefficients 2 μ s e 1 ν s λ s ν s e 1 ν s 1 2 ν s which are convertible to the poisson ratio and by the young modulus as well the 2nd piola kirchhoff stress tensor is related to the cauchy stress tensor through the geometric transformation of 9 s j f 1 σ s f t where j is the determinant of f j det f the dynamics of the displacement of the solid structure is stated that the divergence of nominal stress is equal to fluid inertia 10 ρ 2 u s t 2 f s where a rayleigh damping factor proportional to the stiffness is used for the beam the deformation gradient tensor is computed from 11 f i u s and for the st venant kirchhoff material the lagrange strain tensor e is calculated by 12 e 1 2 f t f i 1 2 u s u s t u s u s t the initial condition of the system is the stationary condition as well the boundary conditions of the fluid solid boundary are the continuity of the stress fluid forces and cauchy stress tensor forces 13 σ f n σ s n where stress tensor of fluid forces where its divergence is equal to fluid inertia 14 σ f μ u f u f t p ι and the continuity of velocity no slip condition i e 15 u f u s this implies the no slip condition for the flow and that the forces on the interface are in balance the boundary conditions are clamped and free for leading and trailing edges of the beam respectively usually the equivalent tensile stress or equivalent von mises stress is used in the solid analysis as 16 σ v σ x x 2 σ y y 2 σ x x σ y y 3 τ x y 2 2 4 optimization method fsi problem in the 2d domain shown in fig 1 is based on a well known benchmark of incompressible laminar regime flow around cylinder turek and hron 2006 the problem in the first step is optimized for the beam length as the independent variable the optimization objective is to find the beam length that minimizes the total force applying on beam and cylinder although the problem setting is non symmetric it is anticipated by the increase of the beam length more stratification applied to the fluid flow which suppresses the vortex generation behind the cylinder to optimize the problem the method used by jamalabadi 2016 is used as 1 assign an arbitrary beam length 2 solve the fsi problem to obtain the velocity pressure field and the total force on the integral paths shown in fig 1 17 f t o t b e a m c y l i n d e r σ f d γ 3 calculate the new beam length using the gradient of the objective function concerning the design variable 4 return to step 2 to recalculate the velocity and pressure field again until the following converging criterion for the design variable is satisfied 18 l b n 1 l b n 0 001 l b 1 where l b is the beam length and superscript n denotes the iteration step after finding the optimal beam length it is necessary to confirm that vortex induced vibration viv occurs over a narrower range of reduced velocity the optimization problem is to check the velocity range for the beam length is optimum although the beam mass is not considered as a constraint as a cheap rubber like material considered but its maximum length is limited to ten times the diameter of the cylinder because of the installation problem caused by stress at the clamped end 3 validation of the numerical method the validation results for a 2d benchmark problem are presented in this section to validate the current numerical method for the calculation of unsteady solid motion coupled with a viscous fluid flow the well known benchmark with geometry similar to the current problem is used as shown in fig 1 the fsi benchmark problem is the flow induced vibration of a flexible beam that is stream wise connected to the downstream side of a rigid and stationary cylinder the beam material is supposed to be governed by the saint venant kirchhoff model as well the example of a mesh for the fluid and solid domain mesh around the circular cylinder with the attached beam is presented in fig 2 the triangular mesh p1 p1 elements is used for all domains except the fluid boundary layers fluid solid interface where the quadrilateral mesh is used p1 elements which use linear functions a 0 a 1 x a 2 y over triangles lead to the solution with the least cost degree of freedoms while p2 elements lead to higher accuracy by increasing the polynomial order generally pn elements in 2d has n 1 n 2 2 nodes degrees of freedom in this model p2 p2 elements are used for high reynolds numbers for higher accuracy in the solid domain the flexible beam is clamped to the circular cylinder suppressing the effects of von kármán vortices all the nodes at the beam edge in contact with the circular cylinder have zero displacements and rotation on the inverse downstream trailing edge the back mass is allowed to move and all nodes have the full displacement and rotation this is arranged from built in settings of commercial code the hubs on the parallel to channel sides need to fit cfd nodes conditions the displacement and rotation should be the same as fluid nodes in the fluid domain convective boundary condition at the outlet of the domain is fairly far away from the flexible structure and therefore has no great effect on the flexible structure all walls top and the bottom of the channel pipe and beam are no slip at the inlet a parabola velocity profile normal to the inlet is set as inflow condition without tallying any variation the use of zero fluctuation based on the assumption that any small fluctuation forced at the inlet will normally not extend to the circular cylinder because of the grid roughness at the outer borders in this way all inflow vacillations will be soon damped the stream is assumed and the experimental results confirm the low level turbulent flow turek and hron 2006 this assumption is not played an important role in the improvement of the wake and the structural motion the computational grid is consists of a triangular non uniform in both directions with a high resolution in the near wall regions simulations with refined and also coarser grids are performed in the framework of the grid independency study grid independency study is done in table 2 the basic grid comprises 14749 volumes as the results were not changed by refining the basic grid consists of 14148 domain elements and 601 boundary elements this grid is considered as a final solution a more refined grid is applied in the free end of the beam to capture the early wake formation accurately a particularly fine mesh is prescribed near the region of control action cylinder surface as shown in fig 2 resolution tests have shown that a total number of finite volumes close to 15000 accompanied by several finite elements osculating to the cylinder surface of about 100 are sufficient to achieve grid independent solutions the fsi problem was proposed by turek and hron 2006 and has been commonly used as a large displacement benchmark proof for 2d solvers tian et al 2014 bhardwaj and mittal 2012 richter 2012 the convergence criterion for the pressure is 10 4 maximum relative change for the displacement is 10 2 maximum relative change and for the velocity components are 10 4 maximum relative changes to show the numerical accuracy of the results the current work is compared with earlier works in table 3 the amplitude of the free end y displacement a m the strouhal number st for the oscillation frequency and the average drag coefficient c d of the present study are compared to the reference results of tian et al 2014 turek and hron 2006 and bhardwaj and mittal 2012 in table 3 as shown in table 3 good agreement is obtained for all these three parameters and therefore the numerical method is valid to solve fsi with large deformations as well comparison of the current study with various cases of turek and hron bench mark is presented in table 4 fig 3 shows the horizontal displacements for the chosen point a marked in fig 1 which agree very well with the previous work by turek and hron 2006 case c in table 1 and by tian et al 2014 results 4 results and discussion fig 1 shows the diagram of fluid beam interaction with its cross section in this research the circular cylinder geometry and the elastic properties are constant since the strouhal number and cauchy number are fixed the fsi problem is solved by commercial codes and the results are presented in fig 4 the initial condition is found by the solution of the fluid domain and the rigid assumption for the solid part the fluctuation is fully established after 5 s after a small number of von kàrmàn cycles here 5 s from the initial time when the von kàrmàn vortices are formed and a statistical steady state is reached then the beam is released to vibrate under the external force of the fluid flow fig 4 shows the von mises stress and velocity magnitude of the beam attached to the circular cylinder after 6 s from the beginning of the analysis as revealed the maximum stress on the beam has appeared after the midpoint of the beam where it experiences a large rotation two strong flows free shear layers have appeared at both sides of the beam while they altered at the trailing edge by the beam deformations where the flow velocity is not small low velocity zones are observed near the solid boundaries in the proximity of the structure and just after the beam which induce a durable backflow fig 3 demonstrates the velocity field and the von mises stress in the structure on the deformed shape at different times the von kármán vortex street past the structure is significantly affected accompanied by the variables of the flow field the size of the domain distance between the walls h in figs 1 and 2 for the cylinder of this diameter can affect the formation of the vortex street and hence the values of the fluid forces therefore in another run the results are checked for the three times height 3h of case c the investigation revealed that the x disp is changed to the 6 18 5 54 mm the amplitude of y disp is changed to the 0 04 50 99 mm drag is changed to the 542 39 39 36 n and lift is changed to the 4 4547 159 29 n the value of h has to be taken in the way which does not affect the vortex formation contours of the pressure with maximum and minimum point and the velocity vectors have appeared in fig 5 the axis of fig 5 is the x and y component of the cartesian coordinate since they were not shown as shown the contours of pressure distribution passed over the circular cylinder and on walls are perpendicular to the solid boundaries and change dramatically at the trailing edge of the attached beam caused by the von kármán vortex street past the structure the velocity magnitude is plotted in the previous figure while the arrow is just used for the information of flow direction the maximum pressure of the system happens at the free end of the beam while its minimum take occurs at the beginning of the beam from the velocity vector distribution it released that the two strong flows on both sides of the beam have the stagnation points on the beam while a backflow current is seen at the top surface of the beam the components of the magnitude of beam displacement are displayed in fig 6 in this manner the y displacement of the beam at the free end is bigger than the x displacement of the beam the x dislodging is mostly negative and less than 12 mm in the present fsi simulation the reason for negative x displacement is when the beam is bent by fluid forces its free tip is bent backward while the axial force is not enough to stretch the beam the y displacement of the beam has the oscillatory form with the maximum value of 45 mm which slowly increases with time the motion changed its regime from beating to the sinusoidal profile as time passes or moves the reason for this is making the stable von kàrmàn vortex formation by the increase of the length of the beam the structure of the fluid flow is changed fig 7 and fig 8 presents the initial and final velocity flow field and von mises stress for the longer beam length as shown at different times there is no von kàrmàn vortex street behind the beam after 6 s for the whole computational domain the reason is that longer beam helps the parallel flow augmentation which prohibits the wake formation and is not significantly deformed and affects the flow field fig 9 revealed the pressure field in the fluid flow the axis of fig 9 is the x and y component of the cartesian coordinate since they were not shown the symmetry of the iso surfaces of the pressure field prohibits the wake formation fig 10 reveals the effect of beam length on vertical forces applied on the beam and circular cylinder although the optimization method described in the previous section finds the optimal value at 6s iteration for the sake of clarity the figure is plotted by 40 values of the length evenly distributed between 0 and 1 0 l b 20d as revealed in fig 10 the optimal length of the vibrating beam attached to the circular cylinder is found at l b 0 66 which has minimum lift force for the circular cylinder as well as minimum lift force for the circular cylinder and attached beam the other studies on oval and square shaped body the same characteristic length of the body size normal to flow direction show that for ellipse 1 to 1 2 maximum semi axis 0 06 m and minimum semi axis 0 05 the optimal length is l b 0 55 and for square cross section cylinder width height 0 1 the optimal length is l b 0 35 while for ellipse 1 to 2 maximum semi axis 0 1 m and minimum semi axis 0 05 vortex generated with stationary beam is negligible and there is no need to use elastic beam generalization of the current study to other shapes at this reynolds number requires more accuracy and specific detail of the geometry if the results of current optimization which reduce the amplitude of force on the body 2 3 orders of the magnitude are compared with the results of bearman and brankovi c bearman and brankovi c 2004 the efficiency of the current method is more clear fig 8 in bearman and brankovi c 2004 presents the transverse response of a plain straked and bumpy cylinder these passive methods cause maximum one order of magnitude in displacement while the elastic beam used here can absorb most of fluctuating fluid forces and prohibit the vortex induced forces to move the structure as shown in fig 11 a the vertical forces the lift force is oscillating around zero with the amplitude of 100 n m acting on the circular cylinder fig 11b shows a fluctuating profile of the drag force which is 1000 n m on average and the vacillating term is about 400 n m peak to peak the lift force evolution is fluctuating around zero with the amplitude of a maximum of 800 n m in total simulation time for both velocities the maximum amplitude of the lift forces increases by time to investigate the effect of velocity on the circular cylinder lift force results deeply the data is disclosed in fig 12 fig 12 shows the coefficient of vertical force on the circular cylinder relation with the averaged inlet velocity that coefficient is defined by 19 f y f y 0 5 ρ u i n 2 as illustrated there are two important points of 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s by increase of velocity from 0 1 m s to 1 5 m s the normal coefficient of lift is decreased from the value of 5 to zero gradually as a result of the von kàrmàn formation behind the flexible structure at the point of 1 5 m s the lift coefficient is increased suddenly to the value of 5 due to the motion of the structure note that the lift coefficient is approximately constant in the range of velocity flanked by 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s which is around 5 by the increase of the velocity the lift coefficient decreased gradually since from the engineering point of view by comparing the lift coefficient values the maximum velocities of 1 5 m s is recommended for the system based on the numerical data as well the modes shape and natural frequency of the beam are presented in table 5 the first six frequencies of the beam include 5 bending modes and one axial mode as shown the nearest frequency of the beam to the fluid vortex frequency is the first bending mode since the beam vibrates mostly near to its first mode 5 conclusion in this study a two dimensional fluid structure interaction fsi analysis is used to recognize the significance of the flow and geometrical parameters on the vibration induced by the vortex of a circular cylinder due to an attached beam parallel to flow structural optimization in the fluid interacting medium is performed to find the optimal length of the beam while the thickness and material constants and other fluid constraints are unchanged numerical modeling of fsi of the circular cylinder is devoted to computing the vertical forces applied to it along with finding the critical values of fluid domain parameters the resulting model is confirmed by preceding numerical benchmark results in this research the most significant results could be highlighted as the effect of splitter beam on the lift drag and beam tip displacement were investigated the optimal length of the vibrating beam attached to the circular cylinder is found that suppresses the von kármán vortex effects on the lift forces applied to the circular cylinder optimization of splitter beam length was performed to reduce lift and vertical displacement velocity range for optimal suppressing the circular cylinder vibration is found the current paper focused on the low reynolds number regime as discussed in the literature review for the application of low dimensional and low velocity devices further investigation could be performed for the higher reynolds number and turbulent regime as well the usual circular cylindrical geometry which is more practical in ocean engineering pipeline and riser applications is studied hence the study on the other geometries and velocity profiles is recommended optimization of structural material to minimize the von mises stress in the solid domain for the current optimal values could follow in future research work finally the suppression devices of different geometries like helical strakes control rods

1 introduction optimal design of structures exposed to the fluid flow is the topic of various studies related to fish motion snoring paper processing and ocean energy harvesting in recent years abdollahzadeh jamalabadi et al 2018 turek and hron 2006 breuer et al 2012 datta and gottenberg 1975 langre 2008 wang et al 2018 nayer et al 2014 kalmbach and breuer 2013 eloy et al 2008 farhat et al 1998 a deformable structure submerged in a fluid stream may experience compression twist and vibration induced by the fluid forces on its surface a classical flow structure behind a solid body is the vortex street of von kármán these induced vortices result in vibrations of the solid object and its support this fluid solid interaction phenomenon involves stress and displacement relationship between two fields where the large distortion in the solid affects the laminar fluid flow regime to reduce fluid resistance on structure and noise level usually a splitter plate is installed on the structure which prevents generating a karman vortex jamalabadi et al abdollahzadeh jamalabadi et al 2018 found the optimal design of circular baffles in the fluid motion problem occurred in a rectangular tank which is horizontally coupled with a one story structure as well various numerical studies are proposed for fluid structure interaction by turek and hron 2006 they study the cases of laminar incompressible flow exposed to an elastic object in the turbulent regime breuer et al 2012 simulated the fluid structure interaction using a partitioned semi implicit predictor corrector coupling scheme by large eddy models the problem of instability of an elastic material exposed to the fluid current is another interesting problem studied by researchers datta and gottenberg 1975 the solid also could be varied from the hookean solid cases the effects of wind on non linear solids such as plants are discussed in literature which has not a simple geometry langre 2008 the shape of the object could be simple like a cylinder wang et al 2018 or irregular like plants langre 2008 wang et al 2018 study numerically as well as experimentally the fsi problem of flow past a cylinder where a flexible splitter beam attached behind it for the large scale devices the fast fluid speed high reynolds number region reduces the fluid resistance and decreasing the noise is necessary nayer et al 2014 and kalmbach et al kalmbach and breuer 2013 in an optical contact free flow in a water tunnel showed that the flexible plate deformation in turbulent flow reynolds numbers 30470 could be modeled efficiently using les the limit of the instability of that problem is discussed by eloy et al 2008 for small lateral deflections they assumed the plate motion is driven by the linearized euler bernoulli equation as shown the aeroelastic instability of cantilevered flexible plates in uniform flow started at a reduced velocity of 7 5 u 7 5l 1m 1 2 d 1 2 in numerical modeling of such problem the solution of momentum energy conservations as well as optimal discretization are the milestones to capture fsi phenomena the new numerical method for load and motion transformation between fluid and structure domain is developed by farhat et al 1998 they focused on interaction problems with non matching discrete interfaces with an application to aeroelasticity the other problem arises in fsi is the instability of the structure which is investigated widely by the various authors eloy et al 2008 gomes and lienhart 2013 kornecki et al 1976 lemaitre et al 2005 wüchner and bletzinger 2005 kornecki et al gomes and lienhart 2013 investigate the aeroelastic instability of two dimensional panels in uniform incompressible flow more than four decades before while the problem is studied by lemaitre et al kornecki et al 1976 as well from the instability point of view in expose to the uniform flow but the reynolds number range was limited to the specific values the broader problem of self excited instability is investigated by gomes et al lemaitre et al 2005 they investigated the instability of flexible solid 10 re 1 69 10 5 which presented that the structure motion and the mechanism of excitation instability or movement induced excitation is a function of the flow fluctuation and structure s natural frequencies as well they showed that the instability excitation is a function of the geometry of the front body of the structure while the movement induced excitation is a function of reynolds number wüchner and bletzinger 2005 shown that pre stress has a significant role in the fsi problem and instability of the solid the adequacy of this domain size has been demonstrated in previous studies of uncontrolled and controlled flow past a cylinder at delaunay and kaiktsis 2001 in recent years the reduction of the scale and velocity to save energy results in the progress of devices such as pilotless airplanes and micromixers a very important application is to avoid glass tube breaking and loss of efficiency in concentrated solar power csp collectors this is discussed in the work by cachafeiro et al tian et al 2014 as well the benchmarking a coupled immersed boundary finite element solver for large scale flow induced deformation performed by bhardwaj and mittal can be considered as the validation of related study bhardwaj and mittal 2012 the adequacy of the domain size and error estimation for fluid structure interaction problems are discussed by richter 2012 the role of high fidelity simulations in aerodynamics is considered in other researches the high resolution wing naca4412 simulations were performed by vinuesa et al 2017a flow structures play a very important part in aerodynamic designs such as the case of backflow and incipient separation described in vinuesa et al 2017b in the light of vinuesa et al results there is a connection between high re zero pressure gradient and strong adverse pressure gradient conditions vinuesa et al 2017b on the other hand the optimal design of a vibrating beam is a classic problem frithiof 1965 niordson deals with the problem of finding the best possible tapering of a simply supported beam which for a given volume would have the highest possible value of the natural frequency for the lowest mode of lateral vibrations the optimization can be performed for fluid motion coupled with structure motion abdollahzadeh jamalabadi 2018a galloping structure abdollahzadeh jamalabadi 2018b and hydrofoil in the cavitation regime abdollahzadeh jamalabadi 2014 control of flow induced forces on a circular cylinder is considered in many references some of them use a detached splitter plate placed horizontally in the wake region to suppress the vortex shedding hwang et al 2003 ozono 1999 hwang et al find that placing a plate in distance 2 5 times of the cylinder reduces the drag and suction force hwang et al 2003 recently by use of splitter plate karthik et al 2018 achieved optimization with reduction of drag by 34 62 and flow induced sound by 6 41 db compared to the bare cylinder they found that a length to diameter ratio of 1 27 causes a value of 96 57 for the overall sound pressure level and 0 7192 drag coefficient tosi and colonius 2019 developed a closed quasi 1d fluid structure model they studied the effects of parameters mass ratio reduced velocity channel confinement ratio plate placement

numerical validation with the benchmark and the numerical consequences of fsi of vibrating beam attached to the circular cylinder as a final point concluding remarks are presented in the last section 2 mathematical modeling 2 1 geometrical parameters the flow around a circular cylinder plus an elastic bar behind it is the physical domain of this research fig 1 shows the 2d diagram of fluid beam interaction with its cross section geometric parameters are shown in fig 1a as presented in fig 1a the domain with the dimensions given in table 1 where the positions of three points are a 0 6 0 2 b 0 15 0 2 c 0 2 0 2 the black part is a solid domain and the blue part is the fluid domain a parabolic velocity profile is prescribed at the left channel inflow other parameters are in table 1 various cases in table 1 are extracted from table 12 of reference turek and hron 2006 which is parameter settings for the full fsi benchmarks the system is composed of a cylinder mass bluff body with an elastic beam mounted on it in a confined environment with the inlet left channel inflow average velocity of v and a parabolic velocity outline in fig 1b the domain is plotted with the physical quantities of the problem flow direction integration path for the force calculation and sizes given in table 1 the fluid material in case a and c has properties similar to glycerin but the design of such a benchmark turek and hron 2006 most aimed at satisfying the non dimensional parameters such as reynolds number and propose such constants to achieve less numerical error throughout the discretization of governing equations as the reynolds number in this problem is low the laminar regime is suitable for modeling of the fluid motion in literature turek and hron s benchmark is utilized to confirm the fsi models turek and hron 2006 they set the benchmark for the rigorous evaluation of different methods for fluid structure interaction problems similar to these older configurations they consider the fluid to be incompressible and in the laminar regime the setting is intentionally non symmetric to prevent the dependence of the onset of any promising oscillation on the precision of the computation this benchmark aims to develop objective criteria for the evaluation of the different algorithmic approaches the adequacy of this domain size has been demonstrated in previous studies of uncontrolled and controlled flow past a cylinder in delaunay and kaiktsis 2001 2 2 fluid model the fluid is considered to be newtonian incompressible flow fields are computed from the numerical solution of the non dimensional navier stokes equations for two dimensional incompressible viscous flow the continuity equation of the fluid is 1 u f 0 where u f u v is the velocity vector the momentum equation of the fluid is 2 ρ u t η f u f u f t ρ f u f u f p f 0 where p is the static pressure t is time cartesian coordinates x y η is the fluid viscosity and ρ is the fluid density the inflow condition at left channel is parabolic laminar 3 u f 0 y 6 u y h y the outflow condition at right channel outflow same as in the incompressible case is chosen by the prescribed the zero pressure reference value at the right side of the channel 4 p f l y 0 the no slip condition is used at the bottom wall at the top wall and the wall of the cylinder body 5 u f x 0 0 6 u f x h 0 7 u f n 0 where n is the direction normal to the boundary the flow is impulsively started and the beam is perturbed by a small body force 1 n gaussian pulse at point a at the initial time step to break the symmetry 2 3 solid model solid modeling or modeling in this subsection is presented as a set of consistent equations for computer implementation of two dimensional solids the cauchy stress tensor symmetric true stress σ s the kirchhoff stress weighted cauchy stress tensor τ j σ s the nominal stress the first piola kirchhoff stress transpose of the nominal stress fs the second piola kirchhoff stress pk2 the biot stress energy conjugate to the right stretch tensor us and the mandel stress tensor u 2 s f t fs the solid model coupled with the fluid model determines how the solid geometry changes under the influence of the fluid forces with its emphasis on physical fidelity the displacement of the beam is a function of time where the structure is assumed to be elastic and compressible which was used for the rubber like material such as polybutadiene cork polyurethane polypropylene pvc and steel for such materials 2nd piola kirchhoff stress tensor for the material with the poisson ratio of νs and young s modulus of e is defined by 8 s e 1 ν s e ν s e 1 ν s 1 2 ν s tr e i where tr is the trace of the matrix i is the eye tensor the first and second coefficients in eq 8 are lam e coefficients 2 μ s e 1 ν s λ s ν s e 1 ν s 1 2 ν s which are convertible to the poisson ratio and by the young modulus as well the 2nd piola kirchhoff stress tensor is related to the cauchy stress tensor through the geometric transformation of 9 s j f 1 σ s f t where j is the determinant of f j det f the dynamics of the displacement of the solid structure is stated that the divergence of nominal stress is equal to fluid inertia 10 ρ 2 u s t 2 f s where a rayleigh damping factor proportional to the stiffness is used for the beam the deformation gradient tensor is computed from 11 f i u

well the boundary conditions of the fluid solid boundary are the continuity of the stress fluid forces and cauchy stress tensor forces 13 σ f n σ s n where stress tensor of fluid forces where its divergence is equal to fluid inertia 14 σ f μ u f u f t p ι and the continuity of velocity no slip condition i e 15 u f u s this implies the no slip condition for the flow and that the forces on the interface are in balance the boundary conditions are clamped and free for leading and trailing edges of the beam respectively usually the equivalent tensile stress or equivalent von mises stress is used in the solid analysis as 16 σ v σ x x 2 σ y y 2 σ x x σ y y 3 τ x y 2 2 4 optimization method fsi problem in the 2d domain shown in fig 1 is based on a well known benchmark of incompressible laminar regime flow around cylinder turek and hron 2006 the problem in the first step is optimized for the beam length as the independent variable the optimization objective is to find the beam length that minimizes the total force applying on beam and cylinder although the problem setting is non symmetric it is anticipated by the increase of the beam length more stratification applied to the fluid flow which suppresses the vortex generation behind the cylinder to optimize the problem the method used by jamalabadi 2016 is used as 1 assign an arbitrary beam length 2 solve the fsi problem to obtain the velocity pressure field and the total force on the integral paths shown in fig 1 17 f t o t b e a m c y l i n d e r σ f d γ 3 calculate the new beam length using the gradient of the objective function concerning the design variable 4 return to step 2 to recalculate the velocity and pressure field again until the following converging criterion for the design variable is satisfied 18 l b n 1 l b n 0 001 l b 1 where l b is the beam length and superscript n denotes the iteration step after finding the optimal beam length it is necessary to confirm that vortex induced vibration viv occurs over a narrower range of reduced velocity the optimization problem is to check the velocity range for the beam length is optimum although the beam mass is not considered as a constraint as a cheap rubber like material considered but its maximum length is limited to ten times the diameter of the cylinder because of the installation problem caused by stress at the clamped end 3 validation of the numerical method the validation results for a 2d benchmark problem are presented in this section to validate the current numerical method for the calculation of unsteady solid motion coupled with a viscous fluid flow the well known benchmark with geometry similar to the current problem is used as shown in fig 1 the fsi benchmark problem is the flow induced vibration of a flexible beam that is stream wise connected to the downstream side of a rigid and stationary cylinder the beam material is supposed to be governed by the saint venant kirchhoff model as well the example of a mesh for the fluid and solid domain mesh around the circular cylinder with the attached beam is presented in fig 2 the triangular mesh p1 p1 elements is used for all domains except the fluid boundary layers fluid solid interface where the quadrilateral mesh is used p1 elements which use linear functions a 0 a 1 x a 2 y over triangles lead to the solution with the least cost degree of freedoms while p2 elements lead to higher accuracy by increasing the polynomial order generally pn elements in 2d has n 1 n 2 2 nodes degrees of freedom in this model p2 p2 elements are used for high reynolds numbers for higher accuracy in the solid domain the flexible beam is clamped to the circular cylinder suppressing the effects of von kármán vortices all the nodes at the beam edge in contact with the circular cylinder have zero displacements and rotation on the inverse downstream trailing edge the back mass is allowed to move and all nodes have the full displacement and rotation this is arranged from built in settings of commercial code the hubs on the parallel to channel sides need to fit cfd nodes conditions the displacement and rotation should be the same as fluid nodes in the fluid domain convective boundary condition at the outlet of the domain is fairly far away from the flexible structure and therefore has no great effect on the flexible structure all walls top and the bottom of the channel pipe and beam are no slip at the inlet a parabola velocity profile normal to the inlet is set as inflow condition without tallying any variation the use of zero fluctuation based on the assumption that any small fluctuation forced at the inlet will normally not extend to the circular cylinder because of the grid roughness at the outer borders in this way all inflow vacillations will be soon damped the stream is assumed and the experimental results confirm the low level turbulent flow turek and hron 2006 this assumption is not played an important role in the improvement of the wake and the structural motion the computational grid is consists of a triangular non uniform in both directions with a high resolution in the near wall regions simulations with refined and also coarser grids are performed in the framework of the grid independency study grid independency study is done in table 2 the basic grid comprises 14749 volumes as the results were not changed by refining the basic grid consists of 14148 domain elements and 601 boundary elements this grid is considered as a final solution a more refined grid is applied in the free end of the beam to capture the early wake formation accurately a particularly fine mesh is prescribed near the region of control action cylinder surface as shown in fig 2 resolution tests have shown that a total number of finite volumes close to 15000 accompanied by several finite elements osculating to the cylinder surface of about 100 are sufficient to achieve grid independent solutions the fsi problem was proposed by turek and hron 2006 and has been commonly used as a large displacement benchmark proof for 2d solvers tian et al 2014 bhardwaj and mittal 2012 richter 2012 the convergence criterion for the pressure is 10 4 maximum relative change for the displacement is 10 2 maximum relative change and for the velocity components are 10 4 maximum relative changes to show the numerical accuracy of the results the current work is compared with earlier works in table 3 the amplitude of the free end y displacement a m the strouhal number st for the oscillation frequency and the average drag coefficient c d of the present study are compared to the reference results of tian et al 2014 turek and hron 2006 and bhardwaj and mittal 2012 in table 3 as shown in table 3 good agreement is obtained for all these three parameters and therefore the numerical method is valid to solve fsi with large deformations as well comparison of the current study with various cases of turek and hron bench mark is presented in table 4 fig 3 shows the horizontal displacements for the chosen point a marked in fig 1 which agree very well with the previous work by turek and hron 2006 case c in table 1 and by tian et al 2014 results 4 results and discussion fig 1 shows the diagram of fluid beam interaction with its cross section in this research the circular cylinder geometry and the elastic properties are constant since the strouhal number and cauchy number are fixed the fsi problem is solved by commercial codes and the results are presented in fig 4 the initial condition is found by the solution of the fluid domain and the rigid assumption for the solid part the fluctuation is fully established after 5 s after a small number of von kàrmàn cycles here 5 s from the initial time when the von kàrmàn vortices are formed and a statistical steady state is reached then the beam is released to vibrate under the external force of the fluid flow fig 4 shows the von mises stress and velocity magnitude of the beam attached to the circular cylinder after 6 s from the beginning of the analysis as revealed the maximum stress on the beam has appeared after the midpoint of the beam where it experiences a large rotation two strong flows free shear layers have appeared at both sides of the beam while they altered at the trailing edge by the beam deformations where the flow velocity is not small low velocity zones are observed near the solid boundaries in the proximity of the structure and just after the beam which induce a durable backflow fig 3 demonstrates the velocity field and the von mises stress in the structure on the deformed shape at different times the von kármán vortex street past the structure is significantly affected accompanied by the variables of the flow field the size of the domain distance between the walls h in figs 1 and 2 for the cylinder of this diameter can affect the formation of the vortex street and hence the values of the fluid forces therefore in another run the results are checked for the three times height 3h of case c the investigation revealed that the x disp is changed to the 6 18 5 54 mm the amplitude of y disp is changed to the 0 04 50 99 mm drag is changed to the 542 39 39 36 n and lift is changed to the 4 4547 159 29 n the value of h has to be taken in the way which does not affect the vortex formation contours of the pressure with maximum and minimum point and the velocity vectors have appeared in fig 5 the axis of fig 5 is the x and y component of the cartesian coordinate since they were not shown as shown the contours of pressure distribution passed over the circular cylinder and on walls are perpendicular to the solid boundaries and change dramatically at the trailing edge of the attached beam caused by the von kármán vortex street past the structure the velocity magnitude is plotted in the previous figure while the arrow is just used for the information of flow direction the maximum pressure of the system happens at the free end of the beam while its minimum take occurs at the beginning of the beam from the velocity vector distribution it released that the two strong flows on both sides of the beam have the stagnation points on the beam while a backflow current is seen at the top surface of the beam the components of the magnitude of beam displacement are displayed in fig 6 in this manner the y displacement of the beam at the free end is bigger than the x displacement of the beam the x dislodging is mostly negative and less than 12 mm in the present fsi simulation the reason for negative x displacement is when the beam is bent by fluid forces its free tip is bent backward while the axial force is not enough to stretch the beam the y displacement of the beam has the oscillatory form with the maximum value of 45 mm which slowly increases with time the motion changed its regime from beating to the sinusoidal profile as time passes or moves the reason for this is making the stable von kàrmàn vortex formation by the increase of the length of the beam the structure of the fluid flow is changed fig 7 and fig 8 presents the initial and final velocity flow field and von mises stress for the longer beam length as shown at different times there is no von kàrmàn vortex street behind the beam after 6 s for the whole computational domain the reason is that longer beam helps the parallel flow augmentation which prohibits the wake formation and is not significantly deformed and affects the flow field fig 9 revealed the pressure field in the fluid flow the axis of fig 9 is the x and y component of the cartesian coordinate since they were not shown the symmetry of the iso surfaces of the pressure field prohibits the wake formation fig 10 reveals the effect of beam length on vertical forces applied on the beam and circular cylinder although the optimization method described in the previous section finds the optimal value at 6s iteration for the sake of clarity the figure is plotted by 40 values of the length evenly distributed between 0 and 1 0 l b 20d as revealed in fig 10 the optimal length of the vibrating beam attached to the circular cylinder is found at l b 0 66 which has minimum lift force for the circular cylinder as well as minimum lift force for the circular cylinder and attached beam the other studies on oval and square shaped body the same characteristic length of the body size normal to flow direction show that for ellipse 1 to 1 2 maximum semi axis 0 06 m and minimum semi axis 0 05 the optimal length is l b 0 55 and for square cross section cylinder width height 0 1 the optimal length is l b 0 35 while for ellipse 1 to 2 maximum semi axis 0 1 m and minimum semi axis 0 05 vortex generated with stationary beam is negligible and there is no need to use elastic beam generalization of the current study to other shapes at this reynolds number requires more accuracy and specific detail of the geometry if the results of current optimization which reduce the amplitude of force on the body 2 3 orders of the magnitude are compared with the results of bearman and brankovi c bearman and brankovi c 2004 the efficiency of the current method is more clear fig 8 in bearman and brankovi c 2004 presents the transverse response of a plain straked and bumpy cylinder these passive methods cause maximum one order of magnitude in displacement while the elastic beam used here can absorb most of fluctuating fluid forces and prohibit the vortex induced forces to move the structure as shown in fig 11 a the vertical forces the lift force is oscillating around zero with the amplitude of 100 n m acting on the circular cylinder fig 11b shows a fluctuating profile of the drag force which is 1000 n m on average and the vacillating term is about 400 n m peak to peak the lift force evolution is fluctuating around zero with the amplitude of a maximum of 800 n m in total simulation time for both velocities the maximum amplitude of the lift forces increases by time to investigate the effect of velocity on the circular cylinder lift force results deeply the data is disclosed in fig 12 fig 12 shows the coefficient of vertical force on the circular cylinder relation with the averaged inlet velocity that coefficient is defined by 19 f y f y 0 5 ρ u i n 2 as illustrated there are two important points of 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s by increase of velocity from 0 1 m s to 1 5 m s the normal coefficient of lift is decreased from the value of 5 to zero gradually as a result of the von kàrmàn formation behind the flexible structure at the point of 1 5 m s the lift coefficient is increased suddenly to the value of 5 due to the motion of the structure note that the lift coefficient is approximately constant in the range of velocity flanked by 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s which is around 5 by the increase of the velocity the lift coefficient decreased gradually since from the engineering point of view by comparing the lift coefficient values the maximum velocities of 1 5 m s is recommended for the system based on the numerical data as well the modes shape and natural frequency of the beam are presented in table 5 the first six frequencies of the beam include 5 bending modes and one axial mode as shown the nearest frequency of the beam to the fluid vortex frequency is the first bending mode since the beam vibrates mostly near to its first mode 5 conclusion in this study a two dimensional fluid structure interaction fsi analysis is used to recognize the significance of the flow and geometrical parameters on the vibration induced by the vortex of a circular cylinder due to an attached beam parallel to flow structural optimization in the fluid interacting medium is performed to find the optimal length of the beam while the thickness and material constants and other fluid constraints are unchanged numerical modeling of fsi of the circular cylinder is devoted to computing the vertical forces applied to it along with finding the critical values of fluid domain parameters the resulting model is confirmed by preceding numerical benchmark results in this research the most significant results could be highlighted as the effect of splitter beam on the lift drag and beam tip displacement were investigated the optimal length of the vibrating beam attached to the circular cylinder is found that suppresses the von kármán vortex effects on the lift forces applied to the circular cylinder optimization of splitter beam length was performed to reduce lift and vertical displacement velocity range for optimal suppressing the circular cylinder vibration is found the current paper focused on the low reynolds number regime as discussed in the literature review for the application of low dimensional and low velocity devices further investigation could be performed for the higher reynolds number and turbulent regime as well the usual circular cylindrical geometry which is more practical in ocean engineering pipeline and riser applications is studied hence the study on the other geometries and velocity profiles is recommended optimization of structural material to minimize the von mises stress in the solid domain for the current optimal values could follow in future research work finally the suppression devices of different geometries like helical strakes control rods etc all attached as an addition to the regular circular cylinder could be comprehensively studied in another research credit author statement the work is done by myaj and corresponding author is

22298,the corrosion behavior of mg 6gd 3y 0 4zr alloy gw63k mg alloy was investigated by using scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffraction xrd scanning kelvin probe force microscopy skpfm immersion tests raman spectrum analysis and electrochemical measurements the results show the main phases in the alloys were mg matrix phase and the second phases gd y rich phase mg24y5 or mg24 gd y 5 the gd y rich phase in gw63k mg alloy was more active than mg matrix the corrosion of gw63k mg alloy included three stages first the surface of mg alloy generated some corrosion products and the gd y

dissolved second phases even generated some pitting or corrosion along the second phases keywords gw63k mg alloy second phase corrosion 1 introduction magnesium alloy has the advantages of high specific strength high specific stiffness shock resistance low noise good damping performance and excellent casting what s more light weight leleu et al 2018 rossouw et al 2016 sadeghi et al 2018 however magnesium alloy is prone to corrosion which limits its application the addition of rare earth elements to magnesium alloy can enhance the heat resistance flame retardant tensile strength and tensile properties jahedi et al 2017 luo 2013 qin et al 2010 song et al 2010 those advantages make rare earth magnesium alloy have more advantageous than other alloys such as rare earth aluminum alloy in aerospace electronic communication national defense industry automobile industry and other applications jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 rare earth magnesium alloy as a new kind of material has been widely valued by researchers all over the world however magnesium has no isomeric transformation and most alloying elements have low solid solubility and lack the effective strengthening phase which results in poor mechanical properties of magnesium alloys because of the special valence electron structure for rare earth elements rare earth magnesium alloy can form effective strengthening phases homma et al 2009 jung et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 the mechanical properties of magnesium alloy can be greatly improved at room temperature and high temperature therefore the high performance rare earth magnesium alloys has become an important research direction in order to meet the requirements of high strength heat resistant and low density missile cabin gw63k high strength heat resistant magnesium alloy is developed this alloy belongs to mg gd y series recently magnesium alloy with gadolinium and yttrium were found to have the higher strength many researches have been studied on mg gd y rare earth magnesium alloys homma et al 2009 lu et al 2018 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2019 chang et al 2008 studied the corrosion of mg xgd 3y 0 4zr alloy in a peak aged condition the results showed when the gd content was 6 wt the corrosion resistance of mg alloys was best similarly sun et al 2009 studied the effect of zr on corrosion resistance of mg 10gd 3y magnesium alloy the mg 10gd 3y magnesium alloy showed better corrosion resistance when zr content was 0 42 wt ardelean ardelean et al 2013 suggested the rare nd zr and y elements play a positive role in improving corrosion resistance of the we43 alloy compared with pure mg beside adding the rare elements to improve the corrosion of mg alloy wan et al 2018 found that ultrafine grained structure can improve the mg gd y zr corrosion resistance however song et al 2017 found the pitting corrosion of gw93 mg alloy was related to their microstructure and second phases in their study they found the second phases were more active than mg matrix in recently study many researches have studied other rare earth mg alloys for example we43 ardelean et al 2013 mg y zhang et al 2012 and mg 1 2li 1 12ca 1y zeng et al 2014 those mg alloy all have excellent mechanical properties the corrosion of mg re alloys was identified liu et al 2016 the mg matrix was better corrosion resistance than second phases the second phases in rare earth mg alloy acted as micro anode to corrode preferentially regard to mg y alloy the y containing second phases accelerate the micro galvanic corrosion simultaneously so it is of paramount significance to disclose the corrosion mechanism in this paper the gadolinium gd yttrium y and zirconium zr were added into mg to form gw63k mg alloy

the result shows in fig 3 from the xrd pattern mg phase and mg24y5 phase were detected from the sem and edx analysis it can also find the second phases the second phase was mg24y5 from the xrd result and the edx result showed it contained gd element in the second phase some literature explains the similar atom radius and physical properties of gd and y the gd is prone to be placed by y to form mg24y5 flandorfer et al 1997 so the mg24 gd y 5 was not detected from xrd another reason may be that the amount of mg24 gd y 5 phases was very small and it cannot be detected by xrd fig 4 shows ebsd maps of gw63k mg alloy the ebsd maps revealed the size of the equiaxed and twin free grain structures was about 30 μm the microstructure presented polygonal shape which was the same with the results of metallographic structure 3 2 the immersion behavior of gw63k mg alloy fig 5 shows the sem image and eds analysis result of mg alloy after being immersed for 5min 1 h 24 h and 48 h from the results it can be found that the precipitation phase on the grain boundaries were still identified clearly after immersion 5 min and 1 h fig 5 a and b however when immersed more long time it can be different to identify the configuration of the grain boundaries when immersed about 24 h the gw63k mg alloy corroded seriously it can be found the surface presented sags and crests the corrosion degree of the gd rich phase was more serious than mg matrix the remain phase in the surface was mg matrix fig 5c the gd y rich phase was preferential dissolution when the immersion time was longer the pitting was generated near gd y rich phase fig 5d the results illuminated that mg matrix was the cathode and gd rich phase or gd y rich phase was the anode it was the same with the skpfm result the gw63k mg alloy has two phases it was easily formative phase corrosion 3 3 volta potential of gw63k mg alloy the potential level can indicate the corrosion degree however the phase potential is difficult to obtain by the macro electrochemistry so in this paper the afm was used to study the phase potential fig 6 shows the skpfm results of gw63k mg alloy the surface potential map and line profile potential of the various phase were analyzed from fig 6 it can be found that the potential in light color area was higher than the potential in deep color area the light color area was the phase of mg matrix phase and the deep color area was the phase of gd rich phase and gd y rich phase the results state that gd rich and gd y rich phase were prone to corrosion than mg matrix phase the potential in light color area was higher than the potential in deep color area fig 6b the high difference voltage potential implied the phases corrosion can be occurred for the micro galvanic corrosion between the mg matrix phase and the second phase the skpfm results were in agreement with the immersion results fig 5 3 4 corrosion products of gw63k mg alloy raman spectra was used to study the form of corrosion products fig 7 shows the morphology and raman spectra of gw63k mg alloy after immersion 24 h in xisha atmospheric simulation solution in fig 7a the black area was mg gd y rich phase and it corroded preferentially the faint yellow area was mg substrate and it corroded slowly fig 7b shows the raman spectra of gw63k mg alloy after 24 h of immersion the peaks of corrosion products in the raman spectra were analyzed by comparing the peak positions with those reported in the literature of magnesium oxide gadolinium oxide and yttrium oxide fig 7b for magnesium oxide spectra with intense peaks at 576 cm 1 were recorded for gadolinium oxide typical bands at 1089 cm 1 were observed peaks at 809 and 950 cm 1 detected for the yttrium oxide and peaks at 421 5 cm 1 detected for zirconium oxide 3 5 electrochemical behavior of gw63k mg alloy fig 8 shows the eis plots of gw63k mg alloy after being immersed 0 5 1 2 3 6 12 and 24 h respectively two capacitive loops can be observed from the nyquist plot one capacitive loop was found at the high frequency and another capacitive loop was observed at the low frequencies when immersed at the beginning however when immersed at 3 6 and 12 h inductive features could be observed the capacitive reactance radian increased with the immersed time before 12 h at later when immersed time longer than 12 h the capacitive reactance radian was decreased the presence of inductive loops in the eis spectra obtained on gw63k mg alloy was related to adsorptive processes which is a controversial subject srinivasan et al 2013 tomozawa and hiromoto 2011 however in many cases inductive loops have been attributed to not comply with the one or more of the conditions required for eis testing thus all the experimental results were repeated three time in this work the fitting results were showed in fig 8 the fitting results confirmed that the impedance behavior was existed all the time and therefore seemed to be the characteristics of the system the inductive reactance was not the nonstationary effects of the system in order to obtain more detailed analysis of the eis response on the corrosion mechanisms the experiment data was fitted by equivalent circuits through zsimpwin the equivalent circuits showed in fig 9 the fitting of equivalent circuits data was showed in table 1 in the proposed equivalent circuits r represents impedance resistance c represents capacitance reactance and l represents inductive reactance in this study the cpe was chosen for accounting the depression effects from the eis result the nyquist of eis in the high frequency range presented similar spectra with the immersion time the difference of eis was appeared only in the low frequency the equivalent circuits in fig 9a were used to fit the eis results when the immersion time was 0 0 5 1 2 and 24 h when the immersion time was 3 6 and 12 h the equivalent circuits in fig 9b was used the fitting results of eis are presented in table 1 the physical interpretation rf cf was related to the surface film and double layer related processes shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the eis results acquired in this work were agreement with the interpretation however in order to understand the physical interpretation of rf cf better it can be inferred that there was a layer formation of corrosion products the corrosion products layer was not completely protective and presented some defects during the corrosion process in this condition the charge transfer processes can occur in the corrosion products and the impedance would be governed by two cpes in parallel the first cpes constant was account for the film resistance capacitance another constant was account for charge transfer and double layer response the results of rf and rt were related with the corrosion products and corrosion processes which can be analyzed in more detail the rf and rt value can also reflect the corrosion degree the value of rf and rt was highest after being immersed 6 h that is to say the corrosion products were stable when it was immersed at 6 h and the corrosion products was gradually thick after being immersed longer than 6 h the corrosion products had poor protective effect on the mg alloy matrix so the value of rf and rt decreased when it was immersed about 12 h see fig 10 4 discussion from the above results the corrosion process of gw63k mg alloy can be divided into three stage in the first i stage the corrosion products generated and the gd rich or gd y rich phases dissolved preferentially according to the skpfm results fig 6 the corrosion potential of the gd rich and gd y rich phase was more negative than mg matrix phase which indicated that mg matrix acted as micro cathode and the gd y rich phase acted as micro anode the gd y rich phase would corrode preferentially the results of corrosion morphology in fig 5 showed the second phase was easier corrosion from the possible electrochemical corrosion process of gw63k mg alloy can be explained as follows the gd y rich phase occurred anodic dissolution reactions as following 1 3 liu et al 2010 song et al 2009 1 mg mg 2 2 e 2 gd gd 3 3 e 3 y y 3 3 e the hydrogen evolution reaction can occur on gw63k mg alloy surface as following song and atrens 1999 4 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 oh h 2 when mg alloy is dissolution the surface oxide film can be formed at the same time chu et al 2019 5 mg 2 oh mg oh 2 6 gd 3 oh gd oh 3 7 y 3 oh y oh 3 because the hydroxide is unstable some hydroxides of mg gd and y will dehydrate to form oxides in the solution 8 mg oh 2 mgo h 2 o 9 2 gd oh 3 gd 2 o 3 3 h 2 o 10 2 y oh 3 y 2 o 3 3 h 2 o from the electrochemical results fig 8 the eis of nyquist plot consists the second capacitance loop certifying the existence of oxide film from the morphology and raman spectra analysis fig 7 it can be found the surface of mg alloy existed corrosion products at stage ii the corrosion occurred around the second phases and along the second phases in the surface of the second phase it covered with some oxide film because the electrochemical activity is higher than mg alloy matrix figs 7 and 6 as a result the mg matrix area became inerter whereas gd y rich phase was more active the gd y rich phase acted as micro anode and mg matrix acted as micro cathode to be corroded consequently the gd y rich phase dissolved first and it could be observed in fig 5 what s more the mg matrix can be exist defects alloying elements grain boundaries which is nonuniform distribution and formed heterogeneous microstructure in this area the corrosion of mg matrix also can be occurred however the corrosion rate in mg alloy matrix area was lower because of the weaker micro galvanic effect among defects grain boundaries and alloying elements the corrosion was slighter than that in mg matrix around gd y rich phase from fig 5 the surface of mg alloy generated some cracks which due to the internal stress the internal stress was inevitable at the surface of oxide films the cracks generated in the grain boundary of the second phase due to its larger thickness then the microcracks were formed after being dehydrated zhou et al 2008 as stage iii the corrosion developed toward the second phases and along it occurred corrosion once the oxide film fractured in surface cl and some corrosive medium are easily penetrated the oxide film along the cracks then the corrosive medium gets to fresh mg substrate what s more the corrosion products on mg alloy surface are often loose the corrosion media can be transferring in the loose oxide film li et al 2017 and the corrosion medium around the surface of mg alloy can accelerate the dissolution reaction the gd y rich phase continues toward depth direction and mg matrix occurred corrosion again since mg matrix and gd y rich phase were corroded all the time and the corrosion in the two phases were simultaneous when the corrosion of two phases reach the same depth adding that the corrosion products usually are loose the corrosive medium can penetrate the corrosion film and reach the fresh surface of mg alloy to accelerate corrosion all the time the corrosion of the second phase occur toward depth direction in this condition the corrosion or pitting generated along the gd y rich phase and occur inner mg alloy 5 conclusions 1 the microstructure of gw63k mg alloy was mg matrix phase and the second phases of gd y rich phase mg24y5 or mg24 gd y 5 2 the gd y rich phases potential presents a negative value in gw63k mg alloy whereas mg matrix near gd y phases presents a positive value the different potential between gd y rich phase and mg matrix indicates the phase corrosion and gd y phase is more activity 3 the corrosion of gw63k mg alloy can be divided into three stages at stage i the gd y rich phases are preferentially dissolved stage ii corrosion propagates horizontally around the dissolved gd y rich phases stage iii the dissolves gd y rich phases continues and around the gd y rich phase the mg dissolved and generated some pits or corrosion inner mg alloy author contribution hongxia wan and dongdong song conceived and designed the experiments hongxia wan yong cai and

22298,the corrosion behavior of mg 6gd 3y 0 4zr alloy gw63k mg alloy was investigated by using scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffraction xrd scanning kelvin probe force microscopy skpfm immersion tests raman spectrum analysis and electrochemical measurements the results show the main phases in the alloys were mg matrix phase and the second phases gd y rich phase mg24y5 or mg24 gd y 5 the gd y rich phase in gw63k mg alloy was more active than mg matrix the corrosion of gw63k mg alloy included three stages first the surface of mg alloy generated some corrosion products and the gd y rich phases are preferentially dissolved second corrosion propagates horizontally around the dissolved gd y rich phases finally the corrosion of mg matrix was along the depth direction of the dissolved second phases even generated some pitting or corrosion along the second phases keywords gw63k mg alloy second phase corrosion 1 introduction magnesium alloy has the advantages of high specific strength high specific stiffness shock resistance low noise good damping performance and excellent casting what s more light weight leleu et al 2018 rossouw et al 2016 sadeghi et al 2018 however magnesium alloy is prone to corrosion which limits its application the addition of rare earth elements to magnesium alloy can enhance the heat resistance flame retardant tensile strength and tensile properties jahedi et al 2017 luo 2013 qin et al 2010 song et al 2010 those advantages make rare earth magnesium alloy have more advantageous than other alloys such as rare earth aluminum alloy in aerospace electronic communication national defense industry automobile industry and other applications jiang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 rare earth magnesium alloy as a new kind of material has been widely valued by researchers all over the world however magnesium has no isomeric transformation and most alloying elements have low solid solubility and lack the effective strengthening phase which results in poor mechanical properties of magnesium alloys because of the special valence electron structure for rare earth elements rare earth magnesium alloy can form effective strengthening phases homma et al 2009 jung et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 the mechanical properties of magnesium alloy can be greatly improved at room temperature and high temperature therefore the high performance rare earth magnesium alloys has become an important research direction in order to meet the requirements of high strength heat resistant and low density missile cabin gw63k high strength heat resistant magnesium alloy is developed this alloy belongs to mg gd y series recently magnesium alloy with gadolinium and yttrium were found to have the higher strength many researches have been studied on mg gd y rare earth magnesium alloys homma et al 2009 lu et al 2018 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2019 chang et al 2008 studied the corrosion of mg xgd 3y 0 4zr alloy in a peak aged condition the results showed when the gd content was 6 wt the corrosion resistance of mg alloys was best similarly sun et al 2009 studied the effect of zr on corrosion resistance of mg 10gd 3y magnesium alloy the mg 10gd 3y magnesium alloy showed better corrosion resistance when zr content was 0 42 wt ardelean ardelean et al 2013 suggested the rare nd zr and y elements play a positive role in improving corrosion resistance of the we43 alloy compared with pure mg beside adding the rare elements to improve the corrosion of mg alloy wan et al 2018 found that ultrafine grained structure can improve the mg gd y zr corrosion resistance however song et al 2017 found the pitting corrosion of gw93 mg alloy was related to their microstructure and second phases in their study they found the second phases were more active than mg matrix in recently study many researches have studied other rare earth mg alloys for example we43 ardelean et al 2013 mg y zhang et al 2012 and mg 1 2li 1 12ca 1y zeng et al 2014 those mg alloy all have excellent mechanical properties the corrosion of mg re alloys was identified liu et al 2016 the mg matrix was better corrosion resistance than second phases the second phases in rare earth mg alloy acted as micro anode to corrode preferentially regard to mg y alloy the y containing second phases accelerate the micro galvanic corrosion simultaneously so it is of paramount significance to disclose the corrosion mechanism in this paper the gadolinium gd yttrium y and zirconium zr were added into mg to form gw63k mg alloy with better mechanical strength and corrosion resistance such as alloy exhibits the corrosion mechanism under xisha atmospheric environment the aim of this work is to clarify the effect of

precipitates distributed at the grain boundaries in fig 1 high magnification sem both grain boundary precipitated and fine precipitates was showed the precipitates phase was showed in fig 2 fig 2 shows the bsed image from fig 2 a1 it can be seen that gw63k mg alloy has three phase structure the black in the organization chart was mg matrix the gray was the second phase gd y rich phase the white was zr precipitate phase through component analysis the second phase was rich in gd element and also had some y element nowadays no published literature was studied the phases in the gw63k

and the edx result showed it contained gd element in the second phase some literature explains the similar atom radius and physical properties of gd and y the gd is prone to be placed by y to form mg24y5 flandorfer et al 1997 so the mg24 gd y 5 was not detected from xrd another reason may be that the amount of mg24 gd y 5 phases was very small and it cannot be detected by xrd fig 4 shows ebsd

floatover installation suitable to the harsh environment conditions the paper presents the experimental study on the floatover installation with the t shaped barge in which the topsides loads were transferred by the ballast system and the jacking system several phases of the floatover installation including 0 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases were experimentally modeled both motions of the barge and the topsides and loads on the deck support unite dsu and the leg mating unite lmu were investigated at different intermediate load transfer phases results demonstrate that the trim angle of the barge varies significantly as the increase of the load transferred the standard deviation of dsu loads and the significant value of lmu loads at the 70 load transfer phase are much larger the following waves induce larger surge motions and are more dangerous than the heading waves comparisons indicate that the floatover installation is sensitive to the wave periods and the swell waves would threat the feasibility of the floatover installation keywords floatover installation model test barge and topsides motions dsu lmu 1 introduction for the fixed offshore oil and gas platforms the deck topsides installation in the open sea is always a major challenge the module lifting method the heavy lifting method and the floatover method are widely used in the offshore topsides installation for the module lifting operation the individual functional module such as the utility model the electrical model and the drilling model has to be lifted separately and wielded together offshore this kind of offshore hook up and commissioning work is time consuming and extremely uneconomical for the heavy lifting method although the integrated topsides installation by the heavy lift crane vessels generally reduces the duration the limited capacity of the heaving lifting crane and the relative higher mobilization expenditure restrict its application compared the module lifting method and the heavy lifting method the floatover method becomes much more attractive and a competitive alternative in the topsides installation because of its relative fewer costs and larger capacity chu et al 1998 gros and lescurat 1982 o neill et al 2000 wang et al 2010 tian et al 2018 however due to the sensitivity to the weather condition and the complexity interaction of the multi body the mega topsides floatover installation involves various challenges the floatover installation conventionally uses a single hull barge or a catamaran to transport the topsides to the location and then offloads the heavy topsides onto the fixed substructures generally including transportation docking mating and undocking stages in the past decades the floatover installation has been studied by the field measurement physical model tests and numerical simulations tahar et al 2006 analyzed the tension of the lash lines between the semi submersible barge and the jacket in swell conditions during the mating phase using the model tests and the numerical simulations koo et al 2010a b modeled the catamaran floatover installation of the spar and measured the motions and loads in the transportation and mating phases by the experimental tests numerical simulations in both time and frequency domain were carried out by the proprietary software mltsim and fredom which were developed by paulling 1995 choi et al 2014 applied the time domain simulation method to investigate the lmu loads under the different loading conditions and the ballasting operation luo et al 2015 monitored the motions of the barges and the sea environments with the field measurement techniques in the floatover installation in bohai bay china tian et al 2018 presented the design of the monitor system for jacket platform floatover installations and the application of the integrated monitoring system in malaysian floatover installation project sun et al 2012 carried out the numerical modelling to investigate the interaction effects of the barge and the substructure the motions and the constraint forces of a multi body system similar to the configuration of a floatover installation were analyzed xu et al 2014 evaluated the hydrodynamic response of the catamaran floatover installation using high order boundary element methods chen et al 2014 chen et al 2017 2019 firstly proposed the state space method to analyze the dynamic of a wave induced impact model and developed a coupled heave roll pitch impact numerical model to analyze the complex impact behavior associated with the floatover installation in which poincare maps and phase portraits were employed to investigate the motions and the vertical impacts of the barge deck system hu et al 2017 used the state space model to analyze the impact loads at the first contact stage in the form of the impact map and bifurcation diagram geba et al 2017 proposed the floaters floatover method with relatively small water plane area and large mass which could reduce the heave roll and pitch natural frequency and thus avoid the resonance wang et al 2018 introduced an innovative low deck floatover installation method with the strand jack lifting scheme and addressed the advantages and the limitations of the method to improve the efficiency and the control accuracy the dynamic positioning transport vessel was employed for the floatover installation which will be assumed as the trend of the development as the floatover technology matures bai et al 2014 wang et al 2017 yi et al 2018 the limited weather windows and the time consuming operation of the floatover installation are the critical issue for the mating stage during the mating phase of the floatover installation the topsides loads are conventionally transferred on the jackets relying on the tide level and the barge ballast system the mating operation generally takes several hours and is subject to a variety of technical challenges such as the excessive motions and the impact loads on the lmu and the fender which would threat the safety of the jacket and the topsides seij and groot 2007 wang et al 2014 to transfer the topsides loads fast and safely technip described a jacking assisted floatover topsides installation concept that enables the topsides to be installed much more quickly to avoid high dynamic impact load during the mating phase cholley and cahay 2007 yu et al 2018 introduced the rapid load transfer technology with the hydraulic jacking system as well as the ballast system the method using the jacking system and the ballast system could efficiently shorten the initial mating phase and the final separation within several minute and enables the floatover installation suitable to the harsh sea conditions in addition to provide the adequate transverse stability of the transportation barge in the harsher environment and satisfy the breadth limit of the platform slot the t shaped barge was designed and applied for the floatover installation the t shaped barge has sponsons in the aft body and has different breadth at the bow and the stern the t shaped barge which has different characteristics from the conventional barges will have an impact on the jack down and ballasting operation based on the joint use of the jacking system and the ballast system to our knowledge there are few researches on the mating stage of the floatover installation with the t shaped barge by joint use of the jacking system and the ballast systems in present study the experimental tests of the floatover installation with the t shaped barge were carried out by joint use of the ballast system and the jacking system to analyze the complex mating stage the topsides load transfer process was divided into several critical load transfer phases 0 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases the motions of the barge and the topsides in heading and following waves were investigated as well as the loads on dsus and lmus the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the set up of the physical model tests and the experimental conditions in section 3 the dynamic response of the floatover installation and the sensitivity to the wave conditions are analyzed section 4 presents the conclusions 2 description of the experiment 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were carried out in wave basin at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety tianjin university china the wave basin is 45 m long 50 m wide and 1 8 m deep and the water depth was 1 5 m in the tests a piston type wavemaker was installed at one end of the wave basin to generate the desired waves at the end of the basin the absorbing beach was utilized for wave dissipation fig 1 shows the sketch of the floatover installation in the wave basin taking into account the prototype dimensions of the barge and the characteristics of the basin the selected scale to perform the tests was 1 40 the froude scaling laws were applied the t shaped barge whose breadth at the bow was smaller than that at the stern was modeled for the 16000 mt mega topsides installation the principal dimensions and properties of the t shaped barge model and the topsides model are listed as table 1 the mooring line forces were measured using a set of axial load cell located at the fairlead position the layout of the mooring line system is shown in fig 2 the stiffness of the truncated mooring line was calibrated using different sections of appropriate linear springs to match the target elastic properties the simulated tension deformation curve of the mooring line is shown in fig 3 the force displacement relationship of the mooring system is shown in fig 4 the mooring lines were pre tensioned to a specific value of 30ton the fenders were designed to absorb the impact loads between the barge and the jacket legs the fenders included the transverse fenders and the longitudinal fenders where two longitudinal fenders were located on both sides of the barge and four transverse fenders were installed at the inside of the jacket as shown in fig 2 the stiffness of the transverse fenders was 750 ton m the stiffness of the longitudinal fender was 100 ton m the ballast system and the jacking system were utilized to transfer the topsides load onto the jacket legs the properties of the jacking system and the ballast system are listed in table 2 fig 5 shows the photos of the jacking system and the ballast system fig 6 illustrates the vertical view of the floatover installation the jacking system was designed to support the topsides during the transport and docking stages and transfer the topsides loads onto the jacket legs during the load transfer stage four jacks were arranged around the geometric centre of the topsides and mounted at the t shaped barge the ballast system was design to increase the draft of the barge and thus transfer the topsides loads in the physical model test three ballast tanks were installed at the stern mid ship and bow of the t shaped barge respectively in the rapid transfer method using the jacking and ballast systems after the lmu alignment the topsides were jacked down by the jacking system to transfer the 30 loads from the 30 transfer stage to the 70 transfer stage both the ballast system and the jacking system were employed to transfer the topsides loads until 70 loads were transferred onto the jacket during the second jack down operation the remaining 30 loads were transferred by retraction of the jacks after the separation the ballast water was continuously injected into the tanks for enough clearance in this study the separated intermediate phases including 0 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases in waves were experimental simulated in the state steady modelling for each separated stage the positon of the topsides and the draft of the barge were adjusted by the ballast and jacking systems the barge draft and the jacks stroke for each stage are listed as following table 3 the function of the lmu which generally consists of a guide pin and a docking cone is to guide the stabbing of the topsides legs with the jacket legs and to absorb the contact loads during the mating phase the dsu is designed to absorb the contact load between the topsides and the barge in the model test 8 load cells were installed at the stabbing cone to measure the lmu loads and 4 load cells were installed at the docking cones of the dsus which were mounted at the bottom of the topsides to measure the loads on the jacks the arrangement of dsus and lmus is demonstrated in fig 2 to analyze the loads on lmus and dsus at different positions dsus and lmus were marked as row a and row b which were closed to the bow and the stern of the barge respectively the capacity and the vertical stiffness of lmus are listed in table 3 fig 7 shows the prototype and the experimental model of the lmu the stiffness of the lmu was designed with the springs so that the static load applied to 2 2 kg approximately corresponds to a compression of the pad 1 mm the load deflection curve of the lmu elastomer in the vertical direction plotted are shown in fig 8 the stiffness of the dsu was designed large enough to limit the deflection and the relative motions of the barge and the topsides a ndi optical motions tracking system was employed to measure the motions of the barge and the topsides the markers were installed both at the centre of the topsides and at the middle of the barge the 6 dof motions of the barge and the topsides were measured simultaneously with the sample of 100 hz the accuracy is 0 1 mm for translations and 0 01 for rotations the coordinate systems are defined as the local coordinate system of the topsides o 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 and the local coordinate system of the barge o 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 as shown in fig 9 in the following analysis the barge motions and the topsides motions are converted to the corresponded local coordinate systems trimming by the bow is defined as positive trim angle fig 9 also demonstrates the arrangement of the motion capture system 2 2 experimental conditions the jonswap spectrum was employed to simulate the targeted irregular wave the environmental condition considered in the model tests are listed in table 4 different wave directions wave heights and peak periods were simulated in the tests the direction of the incident wave was shown in fig 2 generally the floatover installation was only carried out at a small wave height such as 1 m in the present study the relative larger wave heights of 1 2 m and 1 5 m for the heading waves and the following waves were used to examine the performance characteristic and the workability of the floatover installation method before each test calibration was run to assure that simulated spectra math well with the target spectra the measured and targeted spectrum of the random waves are shown as fig 10 the currents with the velocity of 0 09 m s and the winds with the speed of 1 58 m s were simulated in the tests 3 results and discussion in this section motions of the barge and topsides as well as dsu and lmu loads of the floatover installation in heading waves is firstly presented in greater detail then comparisons of the barge and topsides motions in different wave conditions were performed to analyze the sensitivity of the floatover installation to the wave directions and the wave periods 3 1 dynamic response of the floatover installation in heading waves 3 1 1 motions of the barge and the topsides the motions of the barge and the topsides in heading waves with hs 1 5 m and tp 10 s at different load transfer phases are presented fig 11 shows the motions of the barge and the topsides at the 0 load transfer phase at the 0 load transfer phase the entire topsides loads were supported by the barge to avoid the impact load on the jacket the clearance of 0 5 m and no engagement of the guiding pins into the docking cone were ensured by jacking up the topsides at a relative high position it can be seen clearly that the barge pitch motion was synchronized with the topsides pitch motion in both the amplitude and the phase results reveal the relative surge and heave motions between the barge and the topsides from fig 11 it is found that both the surge and heave motions of the topsides were slightly larger than those of the barge relative surge and heave motions between the topsides and the barge were found which were mainly caused by the elasticity of the dsu the elasticity of the dsu also leads to the phase difference of surge and heave motions between the barge and the topsides the motions of the barge and the topsides were recorded at the 30 load transfer phase as shown in fig 12 after the 30 topsides weight was transferred onto the jacket the topsides were jointly supported by dsus and lmus it can be seen that the motions of the topsides were constrained within a small range the amplitudes of the surge heave and pitch of the barge were greatly reduced as shown in fig 12 the topsides was still largely synchronized with the barge in the pitch direction the surge and the heave of the topsides were dramatically smaller than those of the barge it is clearly seen that there was about the phase difference of 180 between the topsides surge and the barge surge the topsides heave motion approximately reduced to 0 and the barge motions in heave direction were still in large amplitude similar motion characteristic of the topsides and the barge were found at the 70 load transfer phase as shown in fig 13 at the 70 load transfer phase the topsides moved synchronously with the barge in the pitch direction while there were relative surge and heave motions between the topsides and the barge after transferring all the loads from the barge onto the jacket the barge was separated with the topsides fig 14 shows the motions of the barge and the topsides at the 100 load transfer phase the barge moved with larger surge heave and pitch amplitudes in waves with the clearance of about 1 4 m between the topsides and the barge the topsides were supported by the jacket with very small vibrations which were caused by the wind loads on the topsides and the collisions between the jacks and the topsides which will be illustrated in following analysis to describe the motions of the topsides and the t shaped barge at difference load transfer phases the statistical results are analyzed fig 15 plots the mean value and the significant value of the pitch motions of the barge and the topsides at different load transfer phases the variation of the barge trim under different load transfer stages is mainly attributed to the unique shape of the t shaped barge and the lcg of the topsides unequal to the lcg of the barge the mean value of the trim angle of the barge and the topsides varied at different load transfer phases as illustrated in fig 16 a the barge trimmed by the bow about 0 25 at the 0 load transfer phase which was caused by the 100 topsides load at the bow of the barge the topsides trim angle of 0 22 was slightly smaller than the barge due to the elasticity of dsus b the barge trimmed by the stern 0 13 at the 30 load transfer phase in which the 30 loads were transferred onto the jacket and thus the weight of the bow is slightly less than that of the stern the barge trimmed by the stern 0 11 c the trim angles of the barge and the topsides were nearly 0 at the 70 load transfer phase in which the ballast system and the jacking system were jointly used to control the barge d the barge trimmed by the stern 0 47 and the topsides slightly trimmed by the stern 0 05 at the 100 load transfer phase in which the topsides loads completely were transferred onto the jacket and the moored barge moved in waves figs 15 and 17 show the significant value of the surge heave and pitch motions of the barge and the topsides because of the synchronization in the pitch direction the relative pitch motions between the barge and the topsides were limited and thus not plotted in the figures the significant value of the relative surge and heave motions are plotted in fig 17 from the figures the significant value of the topsides pitch motions reduced with the increase of the load transferred from the barge onto the jackets from the 0 load transfer phase to the 30 load transfer phase the significant value of the surge and heave motions of the topsides dramatically decreased after the 30 topsides loads transferred onto the jackets the topsides were constrained by the jacket support unites and thus fluctuates in a limited range both in the surge and heave motions for the barge the significant value of the surge heave and pitch motions decreased with the topsides load transferred and increased after the barge was separated with the topsides for the 0 30 and 70 load transfer phases the significant value of the relative heave motions were generally not larger than those of the barge and the topsides however the relative surge motions were larger than the barge topsides surge motions the elasticity of dsu and lmu could contribute to the larger relative surge motions and phase differences reducing the relative motion between the barge and the barge requires special and careful designs of the jacking system and the stiffness of dsus and lmus as well as the ballast system 3 1 2 dsu and lmu loads beside the motions of the barge and the topsides dsu loads and lmu loads are of interest to analysts in the design of the floatover installation the vertical loads on dsus and lmus at different load transfer phases were measured in the model tests fig 18 shows the time histories of dsu and lmu vertical loads results indicate that dsu loads of row a and row b decreased and lmu loads of row a and row b increased with the increase of the load transferred for the 0 and 30 load transfer phases the mean values of dsu loads of row a were slightly larger than those of row b because the unique shape of the t shaped barge and the barge trimmed by the bow at the 70 load transfer phase the mean value of dsu loads of row a was nearly equal to the mean value of row b due to the 0 degree trim angle of the barge and the topsides at the 30 and 70 load transfer phases it was found that dsu and lmu loads were about 180 degree phase difference between row a and row b the phase difference would be mainly attributed to the pitch motions of the barge and the topsides for the 100 load transfer phase the jacket legs supported the entire topsides loads it can be seen that there were a number of peaks on both dsu loads of row a and lmu loads which were caused by the collisions between the jacks and the topsides although the impact mainly occurred between the row a of dsu and the topsides the lmu loads of both row a and row b were influenced it is of interest to find that the impact resulted in several impulse loads on dsu loads and the dsu loads quickly reduced to zero after the collisions however both the peak loads on lmus caused by the collisions and the decay of the lmu loads after the collisions were founded the vibrations of the topsides which were supported by eight lmus modeled by springs would contribute to the vibration and the decay of the lmu loads the difference load characteristic on dsus and lmus at the 100 load transfer phase were caused by the large stiffness of dsus and relative smaller stiffness of lmus the statistical results of dsu and lmu vertical loads are analyzed as shown in fig 19 and fig 20 including the mean value the standard deviation the maximum value and the significant value the mean value the maximum value and the significant value of dsu vertical loads substantially decreased with the increase of the load transferred on the jackets which was attributed to the amount of the topsides loads transferred however the standard deviation was increased as the transferred loads increased results indicate that the impact induced larger dsu vertical loads for example the maximum loads at the 100 load transfer phase was about 3750ton which is close to the loads of 4080 ton at the 70 load transfer phase see fig 21 for lmu loads both the mean value and the maximum value of lmu loads dramatically increased with the increase of the load transferred on the jackets it can be seen that the standard deviation of lmu loads at the 70 load transfer phase was larger than that at the 30 load transfer phase the significant value of lmu loads at the 70 load transfer phase is even close to that at the 100 load transfer phase special attention should be paid at the 70 load transfer phase in the design of the lmu it can be concluded that dsus were subjected to much larger loads at the 0 load transfer phases and varied significantly at the 70 load transfer phase the 70 and 100 load transfer phases in which lmu loads suffered from the larger significant value and deviation would be assumed as the most dangerous phases for the lmus 3 2 motion response for varying wave excitations for the floatover installation the weather is regarded as the key factor that decides whether and when to install the topsides the performance and the feasibility of the floatover installation under different wave angles wave heights and wave periods are investigated the wave period is an important factor for the topsides installation for the swell waves the feasibility of the floatover installation is questionable to explore the workability of the floatover installation the swell condition with tp 14 s and hs 1 2 m at a fixed wave angle of 180 in heading waves was modeled and analyzed the significant values of the barge and the topsides motions in random wave of hs 1 2 m tp 14 s and random wave of hs 1 5 m tp 10 s were compared as shown in fig 16 and listed in table 5 generally for sea keeping offshore structures the wave forces increase with the increase of the wave height which thus results in large motions however it can be observed in the results that the surge pitch and heave motions of the barge in the long waves were much larger than those in the relative short wave notwithstanding the wave height of the swell wave is quite smaller than the wave with tp 10 s the motions dramatically increased with the increase of the wave period for example for the 30 load transfer phase the surge motion in wave tp 14 s is about 1 8 times the surge motion in wave tp 10 s the same phenomenon is found in the following seas as listed in table 5 from the view of the barge motions the floatover installation is much more sensitive to the waver period and the swell dominant sea should be paid much attention in spite of the relatively small wave height the wave angle is another factor with great influence on the dynamic response of the installations especially for the t shaped barge with the different shape at the bow and the stern the heading seas and the following seas are considered in this section fig 22 demonstrates the significant value of the barge motions in different wave angles results indicate that the surge heave and pitch motions in heading seas were slightly less than those in following seas for 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases however for the 0 load transfer phase the barge surge motion in following seas was much larger than that in heading seas it could be caused by the unique shape of the t shaped barge with the small width of the bow and the large width of the stern the larger non shadow part of the waterplane curve in following seas induces the larger surge motion than heading seas in which the limited non shadow waterplane curve and the shielding effect of jacket legs would result in the relatively small motion the unexpected larger surge motion in following sea which is associated with the pre mating phase and the impact load on the jackets would threaten the workability of the mating operation and should be carefully designed 3 3 load response for varying wave excitation fig 23 shows significant values of dsu loads of row b and lmu loads of row b in different load transfer stages for different wave periods fig 24 shows significant values of dsu loads of row b and lmu loads of row b in different load transfer stages for different wave directions similar to the barge motions results indicate that the swell wave with tp 14 s results in large dsu and lmu loads than the wave with tp 10 s for different wave angles the loads in following seas are slightly larger than the heading seas it can be concluded that the long crested swell wave and the following waves would lead to larger barge motions and loads on dsu and lmu 4 conclusions the joint use of the jacking system and the ballast system could shorten the duration of the mating operation and enable the floatover installation method suitable to the harsh environment to investigate the response of the floatover installations the experimental model of the floatover installation with the t shaped barge based on the jacking system and the ballast system was developed in this paper the complicated load transfer process was simplified by several intermediate load transfer phases in the model tests the motions of the t shaped barge and the topsides as well as dsu and lmu loads were measured during 0 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases in heading seas and following seas motion behaviors and load characteristics of the floatover installation were investigated in detail the experimental results demonstrate that the mean value of the t shaped barge and topsides pitch motions varies with the increase of the load transferred trimming by the bow at the 0 load transfer phase trimming by the stern at the 30 load transfer phase pitching at the water level at the 70 load transfer phase and trimming by the bow at the 100 load transfer phase the topsides pitch motion was largely synchronous with the barge pith motion at all the load transfer phases in contrast the relative surge motions between the barge and the topsides are found as well as the relative heave motions experimental results show the relative surge motions were even larger than the barge surge motions at the 30 and 70 load transfer phases due to the effect of the lmus and the dsus stiffness there is about 180 degree phase difference of the surge motions between the barge and the topsides the standard deviation of dsu vertical loads and the significant value of the lmu vertical loads at the 70 load transfer phase seem be much larger than those at other load transfer phases which should be paid much attention at the design of lmus and dsus the sensitivity analysis of the wave period and the wave directions were carried out by the model tests the experimental results indicate the floatover installation is greatly sensitive to the swell waves and is much more dangerous in the swell conditions in spite of a relatively small wave height comparisons of the barge motion in heading waves and following waves demonstrate the following waves induced much larger surge motion for the t shaped barge than the heading waves which may have a great influence on the pre mating and mating operation of the floatover installation it should be noted however that this study only considers the limited sea conditions and separated load transfer phases further research is needed to be carried out with more extreme operation conditions to explore the workability of the floatover installation especially for the rapid transfer technique in addition the continuous load transfer process using the rapid load transfer technique in which the topsides loads are transferred consecutively should be investigated and examined by the numerical and physical modelling author contribution xiaodong bai

floatover installation suitable to the harsh environment conditions the paper presents the experimental study on the floatover installation with the t shaped barge in which the topsides loads were transferred by the ballast system and the jacking system several phases of the floatover installation including 0 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases were experimentally modeled both motions of the barge and the topsides and loads on the deck support unite dsu and the leg mating unite lmu were investigated at different intermediate load transfer phases results demonstrate that the trim angle of the barge varies significantly as the increase of the load transferred the standard deviation of dsu loads and the significant value of lmu loads at the 70 load transfer phase are much larger the following waves induce larger surge motions and are more dangerous than the heading waves comparisons indicate that the floatover installation is sensitive to the wave periods and the swell waves

the initial mating phase and the final separation within several minute and enables the floatover installation suitable to the harsh sea conditions in addition to provide the adequate transverse stability of the transportation barge in the harsher environment and satisfy the breadth limit of the platform slot the t shaped barge was designed and applied for the floatover installation the t shaped barge has sponsons in the aft body and has different breadth at the bow and the stern the t shaped barge which has different characteristics from the conventional barges will have an impact on the jack down and ballasting operation based on the joint use of the jacking system and the ballast system to our knowledge there are few researches on the mating stage of the floatover installation with the t shaped barge by joint use of the jacking system and the ballast systems in present study the experimental tests of the floatover installation with the t shaped barge were carried out by joint use of the ballast system and the jacking system to analyze the complex mating stage the topsides load transfer process was divided into several critical load transfer phases 0 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases the motions of the barge and the topsides in heading and following waves were investigated as well as the loads on dsus and lmus the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the set up of the physical model tests and the experimental conditions in section 3 the dynamic response of the floatover installation and the sensitivity to the wave conditions are analyzed section 4 presents the conclusions 2 description of the experiment 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were carried out in wave basin at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety tianjin university china the wave basin is 45 m long 50 m wide and 1 8 m deep and the water depth was 1 5 m in the tests a piston type wavemaker was installed at one end of the wave basin to generate the desired waves at the end of the basin the absorbing beach was utilized for wave dissipation fig 1 shows the sketch of the floatover installation in the wave basin taking into account the prototype dimensions of the barge and the characteristics of the basin the selected scale to perform the tests was 1 40 the froude scaling laws were applied the t shaped barge whose breadth at the bow was smaller than that at the stern was modeled for the 16000 mt mega topsides installation the principal dimensions and properties of the t shaped barge model and the topsides model are listed as table 1 the mooring line forces were measured using a set of axial load cell located at the fairlead position the layout of the mooring line system is shown in fig 2 the stiffness of the truncated mooring line was calibrated using different sections of appropriate linear springs to match the target elastic properties the simulated tension deformation curve of the mooring line is shown in fig 3 the force displacement relationship of the mooring system is shown in fig 4 the mooring lines were pre tensioned to a specific value of 30ton the fenders were designed to absorb the impact loads between the barge and the jacket legs the fenders included the transverse fenders and the longitudinal fenders where two longitudinal fenders were located on both sides of the barge and four transverse fenders were installed at the inside of the jacket as shown in fig 2 the stiffness of the transverse fenders was 750 ton m the stiffness of the longitudinal fender was 100 ton m the ballast system and the jacking system were utilized to transfer the topsides load onto the jacket legs the properties of the jacking system and the ballast system are listed in table 2 fig 5 shows the photos of the jacking system and the ballast system fig 6 illustrates the vertical view of the floatover installation the jacking system was designed to support the topsides during the transport and docking stages and transfer the topsides loads onto the jacket legs during the load transfer stage four jacks were arranged around the geometric centre of the topsides and mounted at the t shaped barge the ballast system was design to increase the draft of the barge and thus transfer the topsides loads in the physical model test three ballast tanks were installed at the stern mid ship and bow of the t shaped barge respectively in the rapid transfer method using the jacking and ballast systems after the lmu alignment the topsides were jacked down by the jacking system to transfer the 30 loads from the 30 transfer stage to the 70 transfer stage both the ballast system and the jacking system were employed to transfer the topsides loads until 70 loads were transferred onto the jacket during the second jack down operation the remaining 30 loads were transferred by retraction of the jacks after the separation the ballast water was continuously injected into the tanks for enough clearance in this study the separated intermediate phases including 0 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases in waves were experimental simulated in the state steady modelling for each separated stage the positon of the topsides and the draft of the barge were adjusted by the ballast and jacking systems the barge draft and the jacks stroke for each stage are listed as following table 3 the function of the lmu which generally consists of a guide pin and a docking cone is to guide the stabbing of the topsides legs with the jacket legs and to absorb the contact loads during the mating phase the dsu is designed to absorb the contact load between the topsides and the barge in the model test 8 load cells were installed at the stabbing cone to measure the lmu loads and 4 load cells were installed at the docking cones of the dsus which were mounted at the bottom of the topsides to measure the loads on the jacks the arrangement of dsus and lmus is demonstrated in fig 2 to analyze the loads on lmus and dsus at different positions dsus and lmus were marked as row a and row b which were closed to the bow and the stern of the barge respectively the capacity and the vertical stiffness of lmus are listed in table 3 fig 7 shows the prototype and the experimental model of the lmu the stiffness of the lmu was designed with the springs so that the static load applied to 2 2 kg approximately corresponds to a compression of the pad 1 mm the load deflection curve of the lmu elastomer in the vertical direction plotted are shown in fig 8 the stiffness of the dsu was designed large enough to limit the deflection and the relative motions of the barge and the topsides a ndi optical motions tracking system was employed to measure the motions of the barge and the topsides the markers were installed both at the centre of the topsides and at the middle of the barge the 6 dof motions of the barge and the topsides were measured simultaneously with the sample of 100 hz the accuracy is 0 1 mm for translations and 0 01 for rotations the coordinate systems are defined as the local coordinate system of the topsides o 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 and the local coordinate system of the barge o 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 as shown in fig 9 in the following analysis the barge motions and the topsides motions are converted to the corresponded local coordinate systems trimming by the bow is defined as positive trim angle fig 9 also demonstrates the arrangement of the motion capture system 2 2 experimental conditions the jonswap spectrum was employed to simulate the targeted irregular wave the environmental condition considered in the model tests are listed in table 4 different wave directions wave heights and peak periods were simulated in the tests the direction of the incident wave was shown in fig 2 generally the floatover installation was only carried out at a small wave height such as 1 m in the present study the relative larger wave heights of 1 2 m and 1 5 m for the heading waves and the following waves were used to examine the performance characteristic and the workability of the floatover installation method before each test calibration was run to assure that simulated spectra math well with the target spectra the measured and targeted spectrum of the random waves are shown as fig 10 the currents with the velocity of 0 09 m s and the winds with the speed of 1 58 m s were simulated in the tests 3 results and discussion in this section motions of the barge and topsides as well as dsu and lmu loads of the floatover installation in heading waves is firstly presented in greater detail then comparisons of the barge and topsides motions in different wave conditions were performed to analyze the sensitivity of the floatover installation to the wave directions and the wave periods 3 1 dynamic response of the floatover installation in heading waves 3 1 1 motions of the barge and the topsides the motions of the barge and the topsides in heading waves with hs 1 5 m and tp 10 s at different load transfer phases are presented fig 11 shows the motions of the barge and the topsides at the 0 load transfer phase at the 0 load transfer phase the entire topsides loads were supported by the barge to avoid the impact load on the jacket the clearance of 0 5 m and no engagement of the guiding pins into the docking cone were ensured by jacking up the topsides at a relative high position it can be seen clearly that the barge pitch motion was synchronized with the topsides pitch motion in both the amplitude and the phase results reveal the relative surge and heave motions between the barge and the topsides from fig 11 it is found that both the surge and heave motions of the topsides were slightly larger than those of the barge relative surge and heave motions between the topsides and the barge were found which were mainly caused by the elasticity of the dsu the elasticity of the dsu also leads to the phase difference of surge and heave motions between the barge and the topsides the motions of the barge and the topsides were recorded at the 30 load transfer phase as shown in fig 12 after the 30 topsides weight was transferred onto the jacket the topsides were jointly supported by dsus and lmus it can be seen that the motions of the topsides were constrained within a small range the amplitudes of the surge heave and pitch of the barge were greatly reduced as shown in fig 12 the topsides was still largely synchronized with the barge in the pitch direction the surge and the heave of the topsides were dramatically smaller than those of the barge it is clearly seen that there was about the phase difference of 180 between the topsides surge and the barge surge the topsides heave motion approximately reduced to 0 and the barge motions in heave direction were still in large amplitude similar motion characteristic of the topsides and the barge were found at the 70 load transfer phase as shown in fig 13 at the 70 load transfer phase the topsides moved synchronously with the barge in the pitch direction while there were relative surge and heave motions between the topsides and the barge after transferring all the loads from the barge onto the jacket the barge was separated with the topsides fig 14 shows the motions of the barge and the topsides at the 100 load transfer phase the barge moved with larger surge heave and pitch amplitudes in waves with the clearance of about 1 4 m between the topsides and the barge the topsides were supported by the jacket with very small vibrations which were caused by the wind loads on the topsides and the collisions between the jacks and the topsides which will be illustrated in following analysis to describe the motions of the topsides and the t shaped barge at difference load transfer phases the statistical results are analyzed fig 15 plots the mean value and the significant value of the pitch motions of the barge and the topsides at different load transfer phases the variation of the barge trim under different load transfer stages is mainly attributed to the unique shape of the t shaped barge and the lcg of the topsides unequal to the lcg of the barge the mean value of the trim angle of the barge and the topsides varied at different load transfer phases as illustrated in fig 16 a the barge trimmed by the bow about 0 25 at the 0 load transfer phase which was caused by the 100 topsides load at the bow of the barge the topsides trim angle of 0 22 was slightly smaller than the barge due to the elasticity of dsus b the barge trimmed by the stern 0 13 at the 30 load transfer phase in which the 30 loads were transferred onto the jacket and thus the weight of the bow is slightly less than that of the stern the barge trimmed by the stern 0 11 c the trim angles of the barge and the topsides were nearly 0 at the 70 load transfer phase in which the ballast system and the jacking system were jointly used to control the barge d the barge trimmed by the stern 0 47 and the topsides slightly trimmed by the stern 0 05 at the 100 load transfer phase in which the topsides loads completely were transferred onto the jacket and the moored barge moved in waves figs 15 and 17 show the significant value of the surge heave and pitch motions of the barge and the topsides because of the synchronization in the pitch direction the relative pitch motions between the barge and the topsides were limited and thus not plotted in the figures the significant value of the relative surge and heave motions are plotted in fig 17 from the figures the significant value of the topsides pitch motions reduced with the increase of the load transferred from the barge onto the jackets from the 0 load transfer phase to the 30 load transfer phase the significant value of the surge and heave motions of the topsides dramatically decreased after the 30 topsides loads transferred onto the jackets the topsides were constrained by the jacket support unites and thus fluctuates in a limited range both in the surge and heave motions for the barge the significant value of the surge heave and pitch motions decreased with the topsides load transferred and increased after the barge was separated with the topsides for the 0 30 and 70 load transfer phases the significant value of the relative heave motions were generally not larger than those of the barge and the topsides however the relative surge motions were larger than the barge topsides surge motions the elasticity of dsu and lmu could contribute to the larger relative surge motions and phase differences reducing the relative motion between the barge and the barge requires special and careful designs of the jacking system and the stiffness of dsus and lmus as well as the ballast system 3 1 2 dsu and lmu loads beside the motions of the barge and the topsides dsu loads and lmu loads are of interest to analysts in the design of the floatover installation the vertical loads on dsus and lmus at different load transfer phases were measured in the model tests fig 18 shows the time histories of dsu and lmu vertical loads results indicate that dsu loads of row a and row b decreased and lmu loads of row a and row b increased with the increase of the load transferred for the 0 and 30 load transfer phases the mean values of dsu loads of row a were slightly larger than those of row b because the unique shape of the t shaped barge and the barge trimmed by the bow at the 70 load transfer phase the mean value of dsu loads of row a was nearly equal to the mean value of row b due to the 0 degree trim angle of the barge and the topsides at the 30 and 70 load transfer phases it was found that dsu and lmu loads were about 180 degree phase difference between row a and row b the phase difference would be mainly attributed to the pitch motions of the barge and the topsides for the 100 load transfer phase the jacket legs supported the entire topsides loads it can be seen that there were a number of peaks on both dsu loads of row a and lmu loads which were caused by the collisions between the jacks and the topsides although the impact mainly occurred between the row a of dsu and the topsides the lmu loads of both row a and row b were influenced it is of interest to find that the impact resulted in several impulse loads on dsu loads and the dsu loads quickly reduced to zero after the collisions however both the peak loads on lmus caused by the collisions and the decay of the lmu loads after the collisions were founded the vibrations of the topsides which were supported by eight lmus modeled by springs would contribute to the vibration and the decay of the lmu loads the difference load characteristic on dsus and lmus at the 100 load transfer phase were caused by the large stiffness of dsus and relative smaller stiffness of lmus the statistical results of dsu and lmu vertical loads are analyzed as shown in fig 19 and fig 20 including the mean value the standard deviation the maximum value and the significant value the mean value the maximum value and the significant value of dsu vertical loads substantially decreased with the increase of the load transferred on the jackets which was attributed to the amount of the topsides loads transferred however the standard deviation was increased as the transferred loads increased results indicate that the impact induced larger dsu vertical loads for example the maximum loads at the 100 load transfer phase was about 3750ton which is close to the loads of 4080 ton at the 70 load transfer phase see fig 21 for lmu loads both the mean value and the maximum value of lmu loads dramatically increased with the increase of the load transferred on the jackets it can be seen that the standard deviation of lmu loads at the 70 load transfer phase was larger than that at the 30 load transfer phase the significant value of lmu loads at the 70 load transfer phase is even close to that at the 100 load transfer phase special attention should be paid at the 70 load transfer phase in the design of the lmu it can be concluded that dsus were subjected to much larger loads at the 0 load transfer phases and varied significantly at the 70 load transfer phase the 70 and 100 load transfer phases in which lmu loads suffered from the larger significant value and deviation would be assumed as the most dangerous phases for the lmus 3 2 motion response for varying wave excitations for the floatover installation the weather is regarded as the key factor that decides whether and when to install the topsides the performance and the feasibility of the floatover installation under different wave angles wave heights and wave periods are investigated the wave period is an important factor for the topsides installation for the swell waves the feasibility of the floatover installation is questionable to explore the workability of the floatover installation the swell condition with tp 14 s and hs 1 2 m at a fixed wave angle of 180 in heading waves was modeled and analyzed the significant values of the barge and the topsides motions in random wave of hs 1 2 m tp 14 s and random wave of hs 1 5 m tp 10 s were compared as shown in fig 16 and listed in table 5 generally for sea keeping offshore structures the wave forces increase with the increase of the wave height which thus results in large motions however it can be observed in the results that the surge pitch and heave motions of the barge in the long waves were much larger than those in the relative short wave notwithstanding the wave height of the swell wave is quite smaller than the wave with tp 10 s the motions dramatically increased with the increase of the wave period for example for the 30 load transfer phase the surge motion in wave tp 14 s is about 1 8 times the surge motion in wave tp 10 s the same phenomenon is found in the following seas as listed in table 5 from the view of the barge motions the floatover installation is much more sensitive to the waver period and the swell dominant sea should be paid much attention in spite of the relatively small wave height the wave angle is another factor with great influence on the dynamic response of the installations especially for the t shaped barge with the different shape at the bow and the stern the heading seas and the following seas are considered in this section fig 22 demonstrates the significant value of the barge motions in different wave angles results indicate that the surge heave and pitch motions in heading seas were slightly less than those in following seas for 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases however for the 0 load transfer phase the barge surge motion in following seas was much larger than that in heading seas it could be caused by the unique shape of the t shaped barge with the small width of the bow and the large width of the stern the larger non shadow part of the waterplane curve in following seas induces the larger surge motion than heading seas in which the limited non shadow waterplane curve and the shielding effect of jacket legs would result in the relatively small motion the unexpected larger surge motion in following sea which is associated with the pre mating phase and the impact load on the jackets would threaten the workability of the mating operation and should be carefully designed 3 3 load response for varying wave excitation fig 23 shows significant values of dsu loads of row b and lmu loads of row b in different load transfer stages for different wave periods fig 24 shows significant values of dsu loads of row b and lmu loads of row b in different load transfer stages for different wave directions similar to the barge motions results indicate that the swell wave with tp 14 s results in large dsu and lmu loads than the wave with tp 10 s for different wave angles the loads in following seas are slightly larger than the heading seas it can be concluded that the long crested swell wave and the following waves would lead to larger barge motions and loads on dsu and lmu 4 conclusions the joint use of the jacking system and the ballast system could shorten the duration of the mating operation and enable the floatover installation method suitable to the harsh environment to investigate the response of the floatover installations the experimental model of the floatover installation with the t shaped barge based on the jacking system and the ballast system was developed in this paper the complicated load transfer process was simplified by several intermediate load transfer phases in the model tests the motions of the t shaped barge and the topsides as well as dsu and lmu loads were measured during 0 30 70 and 100 load transfer phases in heading seas and following seas motion behaviors and load characteristics of the floatover installation were investigated in detail the experimental results demonstrate that the mean value of the t shaped barge and topsides pitch motions varies with the increase of the load transferred trimming by the bow at the 0 load transfer phase trimming by the stern at the 30 load transfer phase pitching at the water level at the 70 load transfer phase and trimming by the bow at the 100 load transfer phase the topsides pitch motion was largely synchronous with the barge pith motion at all the load transfer phases in contrast the relative surge motions between the barge and the topsides are found as well as the relative heave motions experimental results show the relative surge motions were even larger than the barge surge motions at the 30 and 70 load transfer phases due to the effect of the lmus and the dsus stiffness there is about 180 degree phase difference of the surge motions between the barge and the topsides the standard deviation of dsu vertical loads and the significant value of the lmu vertical loads at the 70 load transfer phase seem be much larger than those at other load transfer phases which should be paid much attention at the design of lmus and dsus the sensitivity analysis of the wave period and the wave directions were carried out by the model tests the experimental results indicate the floatover installation is greatly sensitive to the swell waves and is much more dangerous in the swell conditions in spite of a relatively small wave height comparisons of the barge motion in heading waves and following waves demonstrate the following waves induced much larger surge motion for the t shaped barge than the heading waves which may have a great influence on the pre mating and mating operation of the floatover installation it should be noted however that this study only considers the limited sea conditions and separated load transfer phases further research is needed to be carried out with more extreme operation conditions to explore the workability of the floatover installation especially for the rapid transfer technique in addition the continuous load transfer process using the rapid load transfer technique in which the topsides loads are transferred consecutively should be investigated and examined by the numerical and physical modelling author contribution xiaodong bai
