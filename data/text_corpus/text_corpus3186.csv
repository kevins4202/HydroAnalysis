15930,post anaerobic aerobic digestion paad is a promising strategy to further reduce the volume and improve the quality of anaerobically digested sludge ads however the effect of paad process on the fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas remains largely unknown in this study fourteen ppcps and fifteen pfas were detected in ads and evaluated regarding their fate and transformation in a laboratory aerobic digester operated with a hydraulic retention time of 13 days under 22 twelve ppcps demonstrated significant p 0 05 decrease in their total concentrations dissolved and adsorbed fractions combined with six compounds presenting substantial transformation 80 after aerobic digestion on the contrary pfas were not removed and their concentrations were either increased increasing ratio 91 571 or consistent in the sludge during paad process suggesting their recalcitrance to post aerobic digestion more than half of ppcps and pfas demonstrated medium to strong sorption onto solids with their solid fraction higher than 50 in the ads after paad process sorption of four ppcps and three pfaas to solids was enhanced in sludge

originating from sources such as surface runoff and discharges from industries commercial premises and residential areas amongst others the significant improvement of analytical techniques has facilitated the broader detection of emps at trace levels in wwtps amongst the numerous anthropogenic pollutants two groups of emps have attracted increasing scientific interest namely pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas due to their ubiquity in the aquatic environment large consumption worldwide and potential risks posed to human health and ecosystems desbiolles et al 2018 lenka et al 2021 nakayama et al 2019 sui et al 2015 ppcps are an assortment of chemical substances such as human and veterinary drugs disinfectants and fragrances and household chemicals bu et al 2013 pfas are fluorinated aliphatic compounds that contain the alkyl backbone with all perfluoro or partial polyfluoro hydrogens substituted by fluorine and can have functional end groups cnf2n 1 r r represents the functional group head the hydrophobic and lipophobic properties of fluorinated moieties together with the hydrophilic nature of the functional group induce the enhanced surface properties of pfas and thus the assorted applications such as food packaging firefighting foams coatings carpets and cosmetics buck et al 2012 whitehead et al 2021 perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas such as perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas cnf2n 1coo and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas cnf2n 1so3 constitute the most abundant class of pfas and can also be formed from various polyfluorinated compounds i e pfaa precursors via transformation processes lenka et al 2021 ppcps and pfaas are resistant to conventional wastewater treatment processes resulting in high concentrations in the treated effluent arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 luo et al 2014 on the other hand waste activated sludge was contains an important portion of these pollutants with hydrophobic compounds adsorbed onto solids and hydrophilic ones in the liquid phase of was jelic et al 2011 ppcps and pfas have been detected in sewage sludge at concentrations in the range of µg g 1 dried weight dw and ng g 1 dw respectively arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 as such their presence in biosolids is of concern given the potential release and accumulation in the environment during reuse practices especially the land application in european union eu five pharmaceuticals diclofenac 17 alpha ethinylestradiol azithromycin clarithromycin and erythromycin and a uv filter were included in a watch list for consideration of monitoring in the aquatic environment barbosa et al 2016 nguyen et al 2021 seven eu countries have set limit values for some groups of organic micropollutants for sludge disposal on soil kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 moreover regulatory trends are expected for ppcps in biosolids for land application gonzalez gil et al 2016 guideline values for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in biosolids were established in the united kingdom 46 ng g 1 dw for pfos germany and austria 100 ng g 1 dw for pfos and pfoa combined doee 2016 the queensland end of waste code biosolids also specifies trigger values of several pfas individually and combined in soil after application of biosolids department of environment and science des 2019 the need for high quality biosolids satisfying class a guidelines for land application drives the development of multistage sludge stabilisation processes amongst which post anaerobic aerobic digestion paad is extensively investigated at lab and pilot scale parravicini et al 2008 tomei et al 2011b wang et al 2021 enhancing sludge stabilisation level from class b to class a and nitrogen removal are the main advantages of paad process an additional benefit of paad is the enhanced removal of micropollutants from sludge aerobic digestion is a stabilisation process in which microorganisms consume the biodegradable organic matter and convert it into carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen endogenous respiration occurs when microorganisms start to oxidise cell tissue to obtain energy for cell maintenance with the depletion of available organic substances tchobanoglous et al 2003 bacteria are the major contributors to aerobic digestion process with the phyla dominated by proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and chloroflexi wei et al 2021 a few studies have reported an increase in removal efficiency for several pharmaceuticals such as oxazepam propranolol ofloxacine diclofenac and ibuprofen by sequential digestion anaerobic digestion followed by aerobic or aerobic anoxic digestion abbott et al 2021 gonzalez salgado et al 2020 tomei et al 2019 the complementary degradation conditions provided by paad could promote the degradation of compounds resistant to single stage digestion the fate of pfas has been investigated during aerobic and anaerobic digestion separately abril et al 2020 lakshminarasimman et al 2021 li et al 2021 however to our knowledge the effect of sequential digestion on the fate of pfas has not been documented to date the objective of the study was to investigate the effect of aerobic digestion on the fate of ppcps and pfas in the ads without addition of these compounds to the sludge a better understanding of the effect could support managing the potential risks of ppcps and pfas in biosolids land application in detail the mass loadings of each compound in sludge before and after aerobic digestion were compared in addition the concentrations of investigated compounds in the liquid and solid phases of sludge were quantified and the partitioning behaviour was investigated during aerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1

higher than 0 993 the detailed information on the limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq and recoveries of is and native standards are listed in table s3 2 6 data analysis the solid liquid partition coefficient k d l kg 1 of target compounds in sludge was calculated as 1 k d c s c l c t c l ts c l 1000 where ct is the total concentration of the compound measured in the sludge ng l 1 sludge cl is the concentration measured in the liquid phase of sludge ng l 1 cs is the concentration of the compound adsorbed in the solid phase of sludge ng g 1 ts which is derived from ct and cl direct measurement of ppcps and pfas in the solid phase is not feasible since sludge is a complex colloidal system where the solid particles form a stable suspension in water and are difficult to be separated from the liquid phase therefore the mass of ppcps and pfas in the solid phase was calculated by subtracting the mass in the liquid phase from that in the sludge li et al 2021 ts is the total solids concentration in sludge g l 1 the liquid fraction of each compound rl can be assessed as 2 r l c l c t 100 the statistical significance was tested with unpaired t test at a 5 significance level using graph pad prism 9 version 9 0 0 graphpad software san diego california usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of aerobic digester the ts concentration in the sludge decreased from 26 6 0 9 g l 1 to 24 9 0 5 g l 1 fig s1 with a destruction ratio of approximately 6 after aerobic digestion the vs concentration of ads and aeds were 19 2 0 8 g l 1 and 17 6 0 5 g l 1 respectively giving a vs destruction of 8 fig s1 the tcod concentration in the sludge decreased from 32 8 5 2 g l 1 to 29 3 0 9 g l 1 corresponding to a tcod removal of approximately 11 the total nitrogen tn concentration decreased from 1640 126 mg n l 1 in the ads to 468 26 mg n l 1 in the aeds giving an average tn removal efficiency of 72 table s4 meanwhile the ph decreased from 8 0 0 1 in the ads to 7 1 0 3 in the aeds the vs destruction and cod removal efficiency are comparable to the literature values ranging from 10 25 and 15 25 respectively kim and novak 2011 tomei et al 2011a b the relatively low destruction efficiency of vs and cod in our study could be due to the poor ads digestibility by the high srt hrt 25 30 days in the full scale anaerobic digester 3 2 transformation of ppcps and pfas fourteen ppcps and fifteen pfas were detected above loq in the ads and aeds as illustrated in fig 1 concentrations of ppcps in the ads were in the range of 0 12 63 5 µg l 1 sludge or 5 2442 ng g 1 ts two orders of magnitude higher than pfas 2 266 ng l 1 sludge or 0 08 10 ng g 1 ts table s5 the levels of ppcps and pfas in the ads were of the same order of magnitude as previously reported values up to 8743 and 53 ng g 1 dw for ppcps and pfas respectively lakshminarasimman et al 2021 mailler et al 2017 the dominant compounds amongst ppcps were citalopram ibuprofen and venlafaxine at the concentration of 58 8 4 1 19 9 0 6 and 16 3 0 3 µg l 1 sludge respectively table s5 the three compounds were frequently detected at high levels up to 657 citalopram 833 venlafaxine and 5096 ibuprofen ng g 1 dw in anaerobically digested sludge lajeunesse et al 2012 mejías et al 2021 petrie et al 2016 the high concentrations of these compounds in the ads are likely to be associated with the high consumption low degradability and or strong sorption tendency to solids citalopram and venlafaxine are amongst the most prescribed antidepressants in australia eek et al 2021 ibuprofen is known to be the most widely used anti inflammatory drug over the counter drug after aerobic digestion ppcps showed significant p 0 05 decrease in their total concentrations in the sludge except for tramadol and hydrochlorothiazide the loss of target compounds in the sludge is referred to as the transformation carbamazepine and venlafaxine were poorly transformed with an average transformation ratio of 26 in accordance with previous studies tables 1 s5 falås et al 2016 tomei et al 2019 it is noteworthy that carbamazepine was demonstrated to be resistant to anaerobic digestion jelic et al 2012 malmborg and magnér 2015 indicating its persistence during both anaerobic and aerobic conditions on the other hand venlafaxine is more susceptible to anaerobic degradation with the reported removal efficiency higher than 60 falås et al 2016 demethylation was demonstrated to be the main pathway of anaerobic degradation of venlafaxine and predominately ascribed to o demethylation instead of n and n o demethylation falås et al 2016 medium reduction in temazepam 37 and citalopram 35 was observed after aerobic digestion transformation of temazepam is scarcely investigated in sludge digestion systems citalopram was reported to be moderately degraded under aerobic and anoxic conditions in wastewater with degradation ratio in the range of 25 60 suarez et al 2010 suárez et al 2012 vasskog et al 2006 in agreement with our results oxidative reactions including oxidation n oxidation n demethylation and hydroxylation were observed as the primary transformation pathway of citalopram under aerobic conditions beretsou et al 2016 regarding the anaerobic conditions the transformation ratio of citalopram during anaerobic digestion varied from 23 to 85 and the discrepancies are possibly due to different hrt temperature and or the use of spiked or unspiked sludge gonzalez gil et al 2016 malmborg and magnér 2015 anaerobic demethylation is likely involved in the anaerobic transformation of citalopram nicotine 55 and iopromide 62 were moderately transformed during aerobic digestion tables 1 s5 the transformation ratio of iopromide is in accordance with the study by pérez et al 2006 who demonstrated that fast degradation of iopromide occurred in batch reactors with mixed liquor from conventional and nitrifying activated sludge reaching 50 after 2 days and 93 after 24 h respectively the ammonia oxidising bacteria aob were considered to play a key role in the fast degradation of iopromide in the nitrifying activated sludge in contrast other studies reported lower 20 or no transformation of iopromide during anaerobic digestion carballa et al 2007 gonzalez gil et al 2019b six compounds cotinine deet n n diethyl m toluamide hydroxycotinine codeine acesulfame and ibuprofen presented substantial transformation 80 amongst which deet and ibuprofen showed no or low transformation during anaerobic digestion in previous studies phan et al 2018 yang et al 2017 transformation of deet was demonstrated to be dependant on the redox condition lakshminarasimman et al 2018 and inyang et al 2016 both observed biotransformation of deet in aerobic activated sludge but not in anaerobic conditions ibuprofen is more easily transformed by aerobes with several pathways proposed including hydroxylation carboxylation methylation and ring opening reactions huang et al 2020 jia et al 2020 the laboratory study by abbott et al 2021 demonstrated near complete transformation of ibuprofen in single stage aerobic anoxic digesters and significant increase up to 23 2 in anaerobic digesters aerobic heterotrophic bacteria rather than aob were suggested to be responsible for the biotransformation of ibuprofen in biological sludge systems jia et al 2020 in contrast to compounds showing significant transformation during aerobic digestion tramadol exhibited significant increase of 87 p 0 05 table s5 increased concentrations of ppcps have been observed in multiple cases of biological wastewater treatment processes petrie et al 2015 styszko et al 2021 and several cases of anaerobic digestion narumiya et al 2013 tomei et al 2019 one possible explanation is the back transformation from phase i and or ii human metabolites to their parent compounds during biological processes nguyen et al 2021 as for tramadol substantial transformation 70 during anaerobic digestion was reported in other studies gallardo altamirano et al 2021 patureau et al 2021 the increase in tramadol concentration in our study may suggest the reversible transformation of tramadol metabolites that were formed during anaerobic digestion preceding paad treatment reversible biotransformation of bisphenol a citalopram clarithromycin and erythromycin by anaerobic sludge enzymes has been documented gonzalez gil et al 2019a 2019b moreover two carbamazepine metabolites i e dihydro dihydroxy carbamazepine and dihydro hydroxy carbamazepine have been shown to decrease in the first stage anaerobic digestion but increase in the second stage aerobic anoxic digestion tomei et al 2019 further studies are needed for deciphering mechanisms of the biotransformation of micropollutants across sequential digestion under different redox conditions regarding pfas nine pfcas three pfsas and three polyfluorinated compounds were detected loqs concentrations of perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs and pfos significantly p 0 05 increased by 571 253 340 and 91 respectively table s5 formation of pfaas from aerobic transformation of various precursors has been investigated in different matrices such as activated sludge soil and microbial isolates ruan et al 2015 fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs fluorotelomer sulfonates fts and polyfluoroalkyl phosphates paps have been demonstrated to degrade into pfcas when undergoing aerobic biological treatment hamid et al 2020 lewis et al 2016 wang et al 2011 the aerobic transformation of n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido ethanol n etfose in activated sludge systems can produce several intermediate products including n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid n etfosaa ultimately leading to the formation of pfos rhoads et al 2008 n methyl fose n mefose is considered to undergo similar aerobic degradation pathway as n etfose with n methyl fosaa n mefosaa formed as the major intermediate product schultz et al 2006 the three pfaa precursors namely 6 2 fts n etfosaa and n mefosaa were detected at levels lower than 100 ng l 1 in the ads and showed no significant reduction p 0 05 after aerobic digestion therefore they are not likely the major sources of formation of the four pfaas paps may contribute substantially to the pfaa formation since they were detected at concentrations up to 600 ng l 1 in the ads in our pervious study li et al 2021 moreover the intermediate products generated from transformation of pfaa precursors during anaerobic digestion can be further transformed and ultimately lead to the formation of pfaas as the end products in the sequential aerobic digestion for instance the transformation of ftohs during anaerobic conditions mainly generates polyfluorinated acids such as fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftucas zhang et al 2013b which are able to degrade into pfaas under aerobic conditions in summary majority of investigated ppcps in the ads were reduced after aerobic digestion however pfas were not removed and their concentrations either increased or stayed consistent in the sludge after paad process application of treated sludge in soil can provide an important source of organic matter and nutrients for agricultural purposes paad can significantly reduce the concentrations of ppcps in sludge and may lower the burden of ppcps in biosolids amended soils further studies are needed to investigate the transformation products of ppcps during paad process and assess their ecotoxicological effects and risks in biosolids amended soils on the other hand the significant increase in concentrations of certain pfaas in the aeds may trigger the guideline values in biosolids or biosolids amended soils despite the lower concentrations of pfaas in the ads pfaa precursors are also considered environmentally significant and can become a source of pfaas in soil after application of biosolids bolan et al 2021 therefore other strategies should be adopted to destruct pfas in sludge eg thermal treatment or remove pfas in biosolids amended soils e g soil washing phytoremediation blaine et al 2014 kabiri et al 2022 longendyke et al 2022 3 3 partitioning behaviour of ppcps and pfas understanding of partitioning behaviour of emps between the liquid and solid phases of sludge during different treatment stages could assist in the prediction of concentrations in sludge and residue amount in solids of dewatered or dried sludge therefore the mass percentage of individual compounds in the two phases of sludge were calculated and illustrated in fig 2 as shown by eq 2 the liquid fraction of the target compound is correlated with the k d value and ts concentration for ppcps in the ads nicotine citalopram and venlafaxine showed the highest sorption 90 with log k d values greater than 2 5 followed by codeine 87 and hydrochlorothiazide 81 fig 2 table 2 other studies reported log k d values of citalopram and venlafaxine in the range of 1 9 4 and 2 3 2 7 respectively which is similar to the values reported herein carballa et al 2008 gonzalez gil et al 2016 lajeunesse et al 2012 narumiya et al 2013 hydroxycotinine carbamazepine and temazepam showed moderate sorption in the range of 55 75 corresponding to a log k d value of 1 55 1 93 carbamazepine has been classified as moderately sorptive with a log k d value ranging from 1 2 2 5 narumiya et al 2013 cotinine deet acesulfame and ibuprofen had lower log k d values close to 1 subsequently leading to the low mass ratio in the solid phase of ads 20 40 narumiya et al 2013 reported higher log k d value for deet ranging from 1 6 2 3 tramadol and iopromide entirely partitioned in the liquid phase of ads while suárez et al 2008 reported relatively higher sorption distribution of iopromide in digested sludge log k d 1 0 1 2 the liquid fraction of pfas demonstrated correlation with the perfluoroalkyl chain length as the longer the chain length the lower the concentration in the liquid fraction fig 2 in agreement with previous studies arvaniti et al 2014 zhang et al 2013a pfas with fluorinated carbon chain length greater than 8 c9 c12 pfcas pfos n mefosaa and n etfosaa demonstrated a mass ratio in the solid phase of ads higher than 50 and their log k d values were in the range of 2 1 3 6 fig 2 table 2 consistent with previous studies arvaniti et al 2014 li et al 2021 for shorter chained pfas the obtained log k d values were relatively lower than previously reported results table 2 the discrepancy might result from different operating conditions of anaerobic digesters meanwhile the pfsas exhibited higher tendency towards solids than pfcas with the same number of cf2 moieties for instance the solid fraction of pfos was 93 in the ads and 96 in the aeds whereas that of pfna was 76 ads and 86 aeds the sorption of organic compounds onto solids is normally attributed to 1 absorption governed by hydrophobic interactions between aliphatic and aromatic groups of compounds and organic matters of sludge and 2 adsorption involving electrostatic interactions between negatively charged sludge and positively charged groups of compounds luo et al 2014 yan et al 2021 citalopram is a cationic species at environmentally relevant ph with a high octanol water partition coefficient log kow 3 74 therefore the electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interactions may together contribute to its high log k d value however there was no direct correlation found between the k d value and charge status or kow amongst different ppcps as shown in fig s2 a and b hörsing et al 2011 investigated the sorption of 75 pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge and found no correlation between k d and kow with respect to pka acid ionisation constant it is likely that different structures and properties of ppcps also affect the sorption behaviour in the sludge the partitioning behaviour of some compounds changed during aerobic digestion fig 3 likely due to the change in the ambient environment and sludge characteristics ph of the sludge decreased from 8 to 7 after aerobic digestion subsequently leading to changes in the compound species neutral cationic anionic and zwitterionic and the decrease in negative surface charge of the sludge for instance the positive charge species of nicotine citalopram venlafaxine tramadol and codeine could increase by 18 2 7 4 and 6 respectively as the ph decreases from 8 to 7 table s6 in favour of the attractive electrostatic interactions however the extent to which changes in the speciation fraction of compounds and sludge surface charge impact the sorption of organic compounds remains unknow and requires further investigation furthermore the particle size of sludge decreased due to disintegration after aerobic digestion wang et al 2021 alvarino et al 2015 demonstrated the sorption of ppcps was enhanced with the decrease in the sludge granular size extracellular polymeric substances eps of sludge a mixture of high molecular weight polymers play a critical role in the sorption of organic micropollutants proteinaceous components in eps provide binding sites such as amine hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and hydrophobic regions for the adsorption of organic micropollutants zhang et al 2018 some eps bounded metal cations are also responsible for the adsorption of anionic compounds by bridging action cao et al 2019 however aerobic digestion of sewage sludge is normally accompanied by the release of eps bound protein and divalent cations into solution novak et al 2003 which would negatively affect the sorption of organic micropollutants interestingly some compounds demonstrated significant increase p 0 05 in k d values including tramadol temazepam cotinine acesulfame perfluorononanoic acid pfna perfluorodecanoic acid pfda and pfos fig 3 symbols above the dashed line however no obvious pattern was observed for these compounds the reason for the enhanced sorption is unclear but likely related to the structural and compositional changes of eps after aerobic digestion treatment which specifically improve the sorption of certain compounds 4 conclusions the fate of fourteen ppcps and fifteen pfas during aerobic digestion of anaerobically digested sludge was investigated and the main conclusions are as follow post aerobic digestion can significantly reduce the concentrations of ppcps in the anaerobically digested sludge however the risk of transformation products of ppcps needs to be assessed in future studies pfaas are recalcitrant to and can be formed during the post aerobic digestion destruction or remediation strategies should be considered for removing total pfas in sludge or biosolids amended soils more than half of investigated ppcps and pfas showed medium to strong sorption to solids of sludge the residues of these compounds in dewatered sludge could be of special concern after the land application of biosolids the sorption of four ppcps and three pfaas was enhanced after aerobic digestion it is worthwhile to further investigate the mechanisms attributed to the enhanced sorption which may contribute to the process control strategies related to activated sludge for achieving high removal of micropollutants from wastewater declaration of competing interest the

15930,post anaerobic aerobic digestion paad is a promising strategy to further reduce the volume and improve the quality of anaerobically digested sludge ads however the effect of paad process on the fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas remains largely unknown in this study fourteen ppcps and fifteen pfas were detected in ads and evaluated regarding their fate and transformation in a laboratory aerobic digester operated with a hydraulic retention time of 13 days under 22 twelve ppcps demonstrated significant p 0 05 decrease in their total concentrations dissolved and adsorbed fractions combined with six compounds presenting substantial transformation 80 after aerobic digestion on the contrary pfas were not removed and their concentrations were either increased increasing ratio 91 571 or consistent in the sludge during paad process suggesting their recalcitrance to post aerobic digestion more than half of ppcps and pfas demonstrated medium to strong sorption onto solids with their solid fraction higher than 50 in the ads after paad process sorption of four ppcps and three pfaas to solids was enhanced in sludge

originating from sources such as surface runoff and discharges from industries commercial premises and residential areas amongst others the significant improvement of analytical techniques has facilitated the broader detection of emps at trace levels in wwtps amongst the numerous anthropogenic pollutants two groups of emps have attracted increasing scientific interest namely pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas due to their ubiquity in the aquatic environment large consumption worldwide and potential risks posed to human health and ecosystems desbiolles et al 2018 lenka et al 2021 nakayama et al 2019 sui et al 2015 ppcps are an assortment of chemical substances such as human and veterinary drugs disinfectants and fragrances and household chemicals bu et al 2013 pfas are fluorinated aliphatic compounds that contain the alkyl backbone with all perfluoro or partial polyfluoro hydrogens substituted by fluorine and can have functional end groups cnf2n 1 r r represents the functional group head the hydrophobic and lipophobic properties of fluorinated moieties together with the hydrophilic nature of the functional group induce the enhanced surface properties of pfas and thus the assorted applications such as food packaging firefighting foams coatings carpets and cosmetics buck et al 2012 whitehead et al 2021 perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas such as perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas cnf2n 1coo and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas cnf2n 1so3 constitute the most abundant class of pfas and can also be formed from various polyfluorinated compounds i e pfaa precursors via transformation processes lenka et al 2021 ppcps and pfaas are resistant to conventional wastewater treatment processes resulting in high concentrations in the treated effluent arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 luo et al 2014 on the other hand waste activated sludge was contains an important portion of these pollutants with hydrophobic compounds adsorbed onto solids and hydrophilic ones in the liquid phase of was jelic et al 2011 ppcps and pfas have been detected in sewage sludge at concentrations in the range of µg g 1 dried weight dw and ng g 1 dw respectively arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 as such their presence in biosolids is of concern given the potential release and accumulation in the environment during reuse practices especially the land application in european union eu five pharmaceuticals diclofenac 17 alpha ethinylestradiol azithromycin clarithromycin and erythromycin and a uv filter were included in a watch list for consideration of monitoring in the aquatic environment barbosa et al 2016 nguyen et al 2021 seven eu countries have set limit values for some groups of organic micropollutants for sludge disposal on soil kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 moreover regulatory trends are expected for ppcps in biosolids for land application gonzalez gil et al 2016 guideline values for perfluorooctane

queensland end of waste code biosolids also specifies trigger values of several pfas individually and combined in soil after application of biosolids department of environment and science des 2019 the need for high quality biosolids satisfying class a guidelines for land application drives the development of multistage sludge stabilisation processes amongst which post anaerobic aerobic digestion paad is extensively investigated at lab and pilot scale parravicini et al 2008 tomei et al 2011b wang et al 2021 enhancing sludge stabilisation level from class b to class a and nitrogen removal are the main advantages of paad process an additional benefit of paad is the enhanced removal of micropollutants from sludge aerobic digestion is a stabilisation process in which microorganisms consume the biodegradable organic matter and convert it into carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen endogenous respiration occurs when microorganisms start to oxidise cell tissue to obtain energy for cell maintenance with the depletion of available organic substances tchobanoglous et al 2003 bacteria are the major contributors to aerobic digestion process with the phyla dominated by proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and chloroflexi wei et al 2021 a few studies have reported an increase in removal efficiency for several pharmaceuticals such as oxazepam propranolol ofloxacine diclofenac and ibuprofen by sequential digestion anaerobic digestion followed by aerobic or aerobic anoxic digestion abbott et al 2021 gonzalez salgado et al 2020 tomei et al 2019 the complementary degradation conditions provided by paad could promote the degradation of compounds resistant to single stage digestion the fate of pfas has been investigated during aerobic and anaerobic digestion separately abril et al 2020 lakshminarasimman et al 2021 li et al 2021 however to our knowledge the effect of sequential digestion on the fate of pfas has not been documented to date the objective of the study was to investigate the effect of aerobic digestion on the fate of ppcps and pfas in the ads without addition of these compounds to the sludge a better understanding of the effect could support managing the potential risks of ppcps and pfas in biosolids land application in detail the mass loadings of each compound in sludge before and after aerobic digestion were compared in addition the concentrations of investigated compounds in the liquid and solid phases of sludge were quantified and the partitioning behaviour was investigated during aerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1

higher than 0 993 the detailed information on the limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq and recoveries of is and native standards are listed in table s3 2 6 data analysis the solid liquid partition coefficient k d l kg 1 of target compounds in sludge was calculated as 1 k d c s c l c t c l ts c l 1000 where ct is the total concentration of the compound measured in the sludge ng l 1 sludge cl is the concentration measured in the liquid phase of sludge ng l 1 cs is the concentration of the compound adsorbed in the solid phase of sludge ng g 1 ts which is derived from ct and cl direct measurement of ppcps and pfas in the solid phase is not feasible since sludge is a complex colloidal system where the solid particles form a stable suspension in water and are difficult to be separated from the liquid phase therefore the mass of ppcps and pfas in the solid phase was calculated by subtracting the mass in the liquid phase from that in the sludge li et al 2021 ts is the total solids concentration in sludge g l 1 the liquid fraction of each compound rl can be assessed as 2 r l c l c t 100 the statistical significance was tested with unpaired t test at a 5 significance level

g l 1 to 24 9 0 5 g l 1 fig s1 with a destruction ratio of approximately 6 after aerobic digestion the vs concentration of ads and aeds were 19 2 0 8 g l 1 and 17 6 0 5 g l 1 respectively giving a vs destruction of 8 fig s1 the tcod concentration in the sludge decreased from 32 8 5 2 g l 1 to 29 3 0 9 g l 1 corresponding to a tcod removal of approximately 11 the total nitrogen tn concentration decreased from 1640 126 mg n l 1 in the ads to 468 26 mg n l 1 in the aeds giving an average tn removal efficiency of 72 table s4 meanwhile the ph decreased from 8 0 0 1 in the ads to 7 1 0 3 in the aeds the vs destruction and cod removal efficiency are comparable to the literature values ranging from 10 25 and 15 25 respectively kim and novak 2011 tomei et al 2011a b the relatively low destruction efficiency of vs and cod in our study could be due to the poor ads digestibility by the high srt hrt 25 30 days in the full scale anaerobic digester 3 2 transformation of ppcps and pfas fourteen ppcps and fifteen pfas were detected above loq in the ads and aeds as illustrated in fig 1 concentrations of ppcps in the ads were in the range of 0 12 63 5 µg l 1 sludge or 5 2442 ng g 1 ts two orders of magnitude higher than pfas 2 266 ng l 1 sludge or 0 08 10 ng g 1 ts table s5 the levels of ppcps and pfas in the ads were of the same order of magnitude as previously reported values up to 8743 and 53 ng g 1 dw for ppcps and pfas respectively lakshminarasimman et al 2021 mailler et al 2017 the dominant compounds amongst ppcps were citalopram ibuprofen and venlafaxine at the concentration of 58 8 4 1 19 9 0 6 and 16 3 0 3 µg l 1 sludge respectively table s5 the three compounds were frequently detected at high levels up to 657 citalopram 833 venlafaxine and 5096 ibuprofen ng g 1 dw in anaerobically digested sludge lajeunesse et al 2012 mejías et al 2021 petrie et al 2016 the high concentrations of these compounds in the ads are likely to be associated with the high consumption low degradability and or strong sorption tendency to solids citalopram and venlafaxine are amongst the most prescribed antidepressants in australia eek et al 2021 ibuprofen is known to be the most widely used anti inflammatory drug over the counter drug after aerobic digestion ppcps showed significant p 0 05 decrease in their total concentrations in the sludge except for tramadol and hydrochlorothiazide the loss of target compounds in the sludge is referred to as the transformation carbamazepine and venlafaxine were poorly transformed with an average transformation ratio of 26 in accordance with previous studies tables 1 s5 falås et al 2016 tomei et al 2019 it is noteworthy that carbamazepine was demonstrated to be resistant to anaerobic digestion jelic et al 2012 malmborg and magnér 2015 indicating its persistence during both anaerobic and aerobic conditions on the other hand venlafaxine is more susceptible to anaerobic degradation with the reported removal efficiency higher than 60 falås et al 2016 demethylation was demonstrated to be the main pathway of anaerobic degradation of venlafaxine and predominately ascribed to o demethylation instead of n and n o demethylation falås et al 2016 medium reduction in temazepam 37 and citalopram 35 was observed after aerobic digestion transformation of temazepam is scarcely investigated in sludge digestion systems citalopram was reported to be moderately degraded under aerobic and anoxic conditions in wastewater with degradation ratio in the range of 25 60 suarez et al 2010 suárez et al 2012 vasskog et al 2006 in agreement with our results oxidative reactions including oxidation n oxidation n demethylation and hydroxylation were observed as the primary transformation pathway of citalopram under aerobic conditions beretsou et al 2016 regarding the anaerobic conditions the transformation ratio of citalopram during anaerobic digestion varied from 23 to 85 and the discrepancies are possibly due to different hrt temperature and or the use of spiked or unspiked sludge gonzalez gil et al 2016 malmborg and magnér 2015 anaerobic demethylation is likely involved in the anaerobic transformation of citalopram nicotine 55 and iopromide 62 were moderately transformed during aerobic digestion tables 1 s5 the transformation ratio of iopromide is in accordance with the study by pérez et al 2006 who demonstrated that fast degradation of iopromide occurred in batch reactors with mixed liquor from conventional and nitrifying activated sludge reaching 50 after 2 days and 93 after 24 h respectively the ammonia oxidising bacteria aob were considered to play a key role in the fast degradation of iopromide in the nitrifying activated sludge in contrast other studies reported lower 20 or no transformation of iopromide during anaerobic digestion carballa et al 2007 gonzalez gil et al 2019b six compounds cotinine deet n n diethyl m toluamide hydroxycotinine codeine acesulfame and ibuprofen presented substantial transformation 80 amongst which deet and ibuprofen showed no or low transformation during anaerobic digestion in previous studies phan et al 2018 yang et al 2017 transformation of deet was demonstrated to be dependant on the redox condition lakshminarasimman et al 2018 and inyang et al 2016 both observed biotransformation of deet in aerobic activated sludge but not in anaerobic conditions ibuprofen is more easily transformed by aerobes with several pathways proposed including hydroxylation carboxylation methylation and ring opening reactions huang et al 2020 jia et al 2020 the laboratory study by abbott et al 2021 demonstrated near complete transformation of ibuprofen in single stage aerobic anoxic digesters and significant increase up to 23 2 in anaerobic digesters aerobic heterotrophic bacteria rather than aob were suggested to be responsible for the biotransformation of ibuprofen in biological sludge systems jia et al 2020 in contrast to compounds showing significant transformation during aerobic digestion tramadol exhibited significant increase of 87 p 0 05 table s5 increased concentrations of ppcps have been observed in multiple cases of biological wastewater treatment processes petrie et al 2015 styszko et al 2021 and several cases of anaerobic digestion narumiya et al 2013 tomei et al 2019 one possible explanation is the back transformation from phase i and or ii human metabolites to their parent compounds during biological processes nguyen et al 2021 as for tramadol substantial transformation 70 during anaerobic digestion was reported in other studies gallardo altamirano et al 2021 patureau et al 2021 the increase in tramadol concentration in our study may suggest the reversible transformation of tramadol metabolites that were formed during anaerobic digestion preceding paad treatment reversible biotransformation of bisphenol a citalopram clarithromycin and erythromycin by anaerobic sludge enzymes has been documented gonzalez gil et al 2019a 2019b moreover two carbamazepine metabolites i e dihydro dihydroxy carbamazepine and dihydro hydroxy carbamazepine have been shown to decrease in the first stage anaerobic digestion but increase in the second stage aerobic anoxic digestion tomei et al 2019 further studies are needed for deciphering mechanisms of the biotransformation of micropollutants across sequential digestion under different redox conditions regarding pfas nine pfcas three pfsas and three polyfluorinated compounds were detected loqs concentrations of perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluorobutane sulfonate pfbs and pfos significantly p 0 05 increased by 571 253 340 and 91 respectively table s5 formation of pfaas from aerobic transformation of various precursors has been investigated in different matrices such as activated sludge soil and microbial isolates ruan et al 2015 fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs fluorotelomer sulfonates fts and polyfluoroalkyl phosphates paps have been demonstrated to degrade into pfcas when undergoing aerobic biological treatment hamid et al 2020 lewis et al 2016 wang et al 2011 the aerobic transformation of n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido ethanol n etfose in activated sludge systems can produce several intermediate products including n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid n etfosaa ultimately leading to the formation of pfos rhoads et al 2008 n methyl fose n mefose is considered to undergo similar aerobic degradation pathway as n etfose with n methyl fosaa n mefosaa formed as the major intermediate product schultz et al 2006 the three pfaa precursors namely 6 2 fts n etfosaa and n mefosaa were detected at levels lower than 100 ng l 1 in the ads and showed no significant reduction p 0 05 after aerobic digestion therefore they are not likely the major sources of formation of the four pfaas paps may contribute substantially to the pfaa formation since they were detected at concentrations up to 600 ng l 1 in the ads in our pervious study li et al 2021 moreover the intermediate products generated from transformation of pfaa precursors during anaerobic digestion can be further transformed and ultimately lead to the formation of pfaas as the end products in the sequential aerobic digestion for instance the transformation of ftohs during anaerobic conditions mainly generates polyfluorinated acids such as fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftucas zhang et al 2013b which are able to degrade into pfaas under aerobic conditions in summary majority of investigated ppcps in the ads were reduced after aerobic digestion however pfas were not removed and their concentrations either increased or stayed consistent in the sludge after paad process application of treated sludge in soil can provide an important source of organic matter and nutrients for agricultural purposes paad can significantly reduce the concentrations of ppcps in sludge and may lower the burden of ppcps in biosolids amended soils further studies are needed to investigate the transformation products of ppcps during paad process and assess their ecotoxicological effects and risks in biosolids amended soils on the other hand the significant increase in concentrations of certain pfaas in the aeds may trigger the guideline values in biosolids or biosolids amended soils despite the lower concentrations of pfaas in the ads pfaa precursors are also considered environmentally significant and can become a source of pfaas in soil after application of biosolids bolan et al 2021 therefore other strategies should be adopted to destruct pfas in sludge eg thermal treatment or remove pfas in biosolids amended soils e g soil washing phytoremediation blaine et al 2014 kabiri et al 2022 longendyke et al 2022 3 3 partitioning behaviour of ppcps and pfas understanding of partitioning behaviour of emps between the liquid and solid phases of sludge during different treatment stages could assist in the prediction of concentrations in sludge and residue amount in solids of dewatered or dried sludge therefore the mass percentage of individual compounds in the two phases of sludge were calculated and illustrated in fig 2 as shown by eq 2 the liquid fraction of the target compound is correlated with the k d value and ts concentration for ppcps in the ads nicotine citalopram and venlafaxine showed the highest sorption 90 with log k d values greater than 2 5 followed by codeine 87 and hydrochlorothiazide 81 fig 2 table 2 other studies reported log k d values of citalopram and venlafaxine in the range of 1 9 4 and 2 3 2 7 respectively which is similar to the values reported herein carballa et al 2008 gonzalez gil et al 2016 lajeunesse et al 2012 narumiya et al 2013 hydroxycotinine carbamazepine and temazepam showed moderate sorption in the range of 55 75 corresponding to a log k d value of 1 55 1 93 carbamazepine has been classified as moderately sorptive with a log k d value ranging from 1 2 2 5 narumiya et al 2013 cotinine deet acesulfame and ibuprofen had lower log k d values close to 1 subsequently leading to the low mass ratio in the solid phase of ads 20 40 narumiya et al 2013 reported higher log k d value for deet ranging from 1 6 2 3 tramadol and iopromide entirely partitioned in the liquid phase of ads while suárez et al 2008 reported relatively higher sorption distribution of iopromide in digested sludge log k d 1 0 1 2 the liquid fraction of pfas demonstrated correlation with the perfluoroalkyl chain length as the longer the chain length the lower the concentration in the liquid fraction fig 2 in agreement with previous studies arvaniti et al 2014 zhang et al 2013a pfas with fluorinated carbon chain length greater than 8 c9 c12 pfcas pfos n mefosaa and n etfosaa demonstrated a mass ratio in the solid phase of ads higher than 50 and their log k d values were in the range of 2 1 3 6 fig 2 table 2 consistent with previous studies arvaniti et al 2014 li et al 2021 for shorter chained pfas the obtained log k d values were relatively lower than previously reported results table 2 the discrepancy might result from different operating conditions of anaerobic digesters meanwhile the pfsas exhibited higher tendency towards solids than pfcas with the same number of cf2 moieties for instance the solid fraction of pfos was 93 in the ads and 96 in the aeds whereas that of pfna was 76 ads and 86 aeds the sorption of organic compounds onto solids is normally attributed to 1 absorption governed by hydrophobic interactions between aliphatic and aromatic groups of compounds and organic matters of sludge and 2 adsorption involving electrostatic interactions between negatively charged sludge and positively charged groups of compounds luo et al 2014 yan et al 2021 citalopram is a cationic species at environmentally relevant ph with a high octanol water partition coefficient log kow 3 74 therefore the electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interactions may together contribute to its high log k d value however there was no direct correlation found between the k d value and charge status or kow amongst different ppcps as shown in fig s2 a and b hörsing et al 2011 investigated the sorption of 75 pharmaceuticals in sewage sludge and found no correlation between k d and kow with respect to pka acid ionisation constant it is likely that different structures and properties of ppcps also affect the sorption behaviour in the sludge the partitioning behaviour of some compounds changed during aerobic digestion fig 3 likely due to the change in the ambient environment and sludge characteristics ph of the sludge decreased from 8 to 7 after aerobic digestion subsequently leading to changes in the compound species neutral cationic anionic and zwitterionic and the decrease in negative surface charge of the sludge for instance the positive charge species of nicotine citalopram venlafaxine tramadol and codeine could increase by 18 2 7 4 and 6 respectively as the ph decreases from 8 to 7 table s6 in favour of the attractive electrostatic interactions however the extent to which changes in the speciation fraction of compounds and sludge surface charge impact the sorption of organic compounds remains unknow and requires further investigation furthermore the particle size of sludge decreased due to disintegration after aerobic digestion wang et al 2021 alvarino et al 2015 demonstrated the sorption of ppcps was enhanced with the decrease in the sludge granular size extracellular polymeric substances eps of sludge a mixture of high molecular weight polymers play a critical role in the sorption of organic micropollutants proteinaceous components in eps provide binding sites such as amine hydroxyl and carboxyl groups and hydrophobic regions for the adsorption of organic micropollutants zhang et al 2018 some eps bounded metal cations are also responsible for the adsorption of anionic compounds by bridging action cao et al 2019 however aerobic digestion of sewage sludge is normally accompanied by the release of eps bound protein and divalent cations into solution novak et al 2003 which would negatively affect the sorption of organic micropollutants interestingly some compounds demonstrated significant increase p 0 05 in k d values including tramadol temazepam cotinine acesulfame perfluorononanoic acid pfna perfluorodecanoic acid pfda and pfos fig 3 symbols above the dashed line however no obvious pattern was observed for these compounds the reason for the enhanced sorption is unclear but likely related to the structural and compositional changes of eps after aerobic digestion treatment which specifically improve the sorption of certain compounds 4 conclusions the fate of fourteen ppcps and fifteen pfas during aerobic digestion of anaerobically digested sludge was investigated and the main conclusions are as follow post aerobic digestion can significantly reduce the concentrations of ppcps in the anaerobically digested sludge however the risk of transformation products of ppcps needs to be assessed in future studies pfaas are recalcitrant to and can be formed during the post aerobic digestion destruction or remediation strategies should be considered for removing total pfas in sludge or biosolids amended soils more than half of investigated ppcps and pfas showed medium to strong sorption to solids of sludge the residues of these compounds in dewatered sludge could be of special concern after the land application of biosolids the sorption of four ppcps and three pfaas was enhanced after aerobic digestion it is worthwhile to further investigate the mechanisms attributed to the enhanced sorption which may contribute to the process control strategies related to activated sludge for achieving high removal of micropollutants from wastewater declaration of competing interest the

15931,the aperiodic changes in the quantity and community of planktonic and particle associated bacteria have hampered the understanding and management of microbiological water quality in drinking water distribution systems in this study online sampling was combined with the microbial fingerprint based sourcetracker2 to capture and trace the spatiotemporal variations in planktonic and particle associated bacteria in an unchlorinated distribution system the results showed that spatially the particle load significantly increased while in contrast the quantity of particle associated bacteria decreased sharply from the treatment plant to the distribution network similar to the trend of particle associated bacterial diversity the number of observed otus first slightly decreased from the treatment plant to the transportation network and then sharply increased from the transportation network to the distribution network the sourcetracker2 results revealed that the contribution of particle associated bacteria from the treatment plant decreased along the distribution distance the spatial results indicate the dominant role of sedimentation of particles from the treatment plant while the observed increases in particles and the associated bacteria mainly originated from the distribution network which were confirmed directly by the increased contributions of loose deposits and biofilm temporally the daily peaks of particle associated bacterial quantity observed otu number and contributions of loose deposits and biofilms were captured during water demand peaks e g 18 21 h the temporal results reveal clear linkages between the distribution system harboring bacteria e g within loose deposits and biofilms and the planktonic and particle associated bacteria flowing through the distribution system which are dynamically connected and interact this study highlights that the spatiotemporal variations in planktonic and particle associated bacteria are valuable and

drinking water distribution system dwds online monitoring sampling system omss sourcetracker2 spatiotemporal variations planktonic and particle associated bacteria 1 introduction there is a consensus that the microbiological quality of drinking water changes during distribution prest et al 2014 which could be caused by the growth of planktonic bacteria in the water and or the release of attached bacteria from established biofilms and loose deposits in drinking water distribution systems dwds chen et al 2020 kooij 1992 liu et al 2017 2018 studies have found that stagnation time and water demand are important factors influencing both the quantity and community of bacteria in dwdss ling et al 2018 for example high bacterial concentrations and the growth of opportunistic pathogens in drinking water supply systems have been observed after long term stagnation chan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zlatanovic et al 2017 hydraulic disturbances may cause water quality deterioration such as increases in particle counts water turbidity and the concentrations of heavy metals and or bacteria lehtola et al 2006 all of the abovementioned water quality deteriorations pose public health concerns especially regarding the biosafety of drinking water worldwide grab sampling is commonly used for regular assessments and statutory monitoring of drinking water quality in the dwds however such low resolution and labor intensive sampling strategies can neither capture the aperiodic changes nor reveal the origination of physiochemical and microbiological contamination events banna et al 2014 online monitoring of particulate matter in the dwds has been introduced since the early 2000 s hargesheimer et al 2002 studies by online particle counting sampling and pairwise monitoring of hydraulic parameters and turbidity have clearly illustrated the daily variations in particulate profiles but their application has been preliminarily limited to physiochemical aspects matsui et al 2007 verberk et al 2006 such as discolorations mounce et al 2015 vreeburg et al 2008 recently online flow cytometry was developed for counting total and intact bacterial cells hammes et al 2012 and applied in dwds prest et al 2021 by combining online particle counts intact cell counts iccs and adenosine triphosphate atp measurements prest et al 2021 observed a weak correlation between atp and flow velocity which was attributed to the release of particle associated bacteria from biofilms or loose deposits however assessing only quantitative data on water samples could neither explain the source of contamination nor offer enlightenments on effective solutions the understanding of the microbial ecology in dwds has been substantially expanded by the rapid development and application of high throughput sequencing zhang and liu 2019 this is especially true when the generated high throughput sequencing data are combined with microbial ecology theory and mathematic modeling for example using an island biogeography model ling et al found that pipe diameter drove the changes in the tap water bacterial community in building plumbing ling et al 2018 by using the bacterial community fingerprint based bayesian sourcetracker we quantified the contribution of biofilm and loose deposits to the bacteria present in tap in unchlorinated dwds liu et al 2018 however in the study we only collected three sets of samples in the distribution system and capturing and tracing the aperiodic daily variations remains a critical knowledge gap therefore the objective of this study is to capture and trace the aperiodic spatiotemporal variations in planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab in drinking water distribution systems more specifically based on the investigations of the spatial and temporal variations in the distribution system the critical questions of what the local dominant processes are when the peaks would occur and why the changes may occur and where the changes may come from will be addressed as an approach to this goal an online sampling and monitoring system was developed which was used and combined with the bacterial community fingerprint based bayesian sourcetracker the findings obtained from this study advance the current understanding of the dynamics of aperiodic planktonic and particle associated bacteria in drinking water distribution systems which will be a powerful tool for water utilities to diagnose water quality problems and develop effective strategies for managing biological water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water treatment plant and sampling locations the study was conducted in one of the drinking water supply systems of oasen the netherlands the drinking water treatment plant produces drinking water from anaerobic groundwater 340 m3 h through conventional treatment processes in short the water was treated by spray aeration rapid sand filtration pellet softening carry over submerged rapid sand filtration granular activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection the drinking water is distributed to customers without chlorine as illustrated in fig 1a the sampling locations were selected at the treatment plant before the water entered the distribution system referred to as dwtp at the transportation network before the water was distributed into communities referred to as tn and at distribution network locations referred to as dn 1 and dn 2 more specifically dn 1 and dn 2 were located at the distal part of the secondary distribution network dn while tn was located at the proximal part of the secondary distribution network that is connected to the transportation network tn the distribution pipe material is pvc u in the study area in total 147 samples were collected from the four locations including 62 water samples planktonic bacteria pb 63 suspended solids particle associated bacteria pab 10 biofilms bf and 12 loose deposits ld 2 2 online monitoring and sampling of water and suspended particles a novel online monitoring and sampling system omss was developed to conduct online monitoring of water quality and continuous sampling of water and particles in dwdss fig 1b briefly the system integrated water quality monitoring sensors data loggers water sampling bottles and particle sampling filters whatman 1822 047 1 2 µm which were controlled and run by a preprogramed plc for 24 h for planktonic bacteria the bottle sampled drinking water was used for atp measurements and filtrated by 0 22 µm filters for dna extraction for particle associated bacteria the filter pore size of 1 2 µm was selected based on the results of our previous study liu et al 2013 the online monitored physicochemical parameters included temperature conductivity and ph water and suspended particles were sampled every 3 h suspended particles were sampled by filtrating tap water for 3 h with particle sampling filters samples were collected in triplicate 8 times a day automatically n 3 8 24 samples at sampling time periods of 0 3 h 3 6 h 6 9 h 9 12 h 12 15 h 15 18 h 18 21 h and 21 24 h the transmembrane pressure was monitored and recorded online and the pressure differences per volume of water pressure volume p v were used as an index of particle load in water the filters and water bottles were kept in refrigerator to guarantee the sample quality for the downstream microbiological analysis samples were collected and transported on ice and processed in the lab immediately after the 24 h sampling was performed the omss was operated at a flow of 2 l min for a total of 120 l per filter for suspended particle sampling the flow was measured and recorded online by a digital flow meter all data were logged every 5 min and visualized on a screen at each location the omss ran for two consecutive working days to obtain reliable and representative samples 2 3 biofilm and loose deposit sampling at each location the loose deposits and biofilm were sampled after the two days of running the omss as previously described vreeburg et al 2008 in short loose deposits were sampled at corresponding hydrants by flushing the pipeline with a velocity of 1 5 m s afterward sections of the flushed pipes with biofilm were cut in duplicate from the network pvc u d 110 mm length 30 cm the pipe section was closed with sterile caps and filled with dna free water to keep the inner surface wet all samples were stored in sterile plastic containers on ice and transported to the lab within 2 h to detach the bacteria and materials from suspended solids filters loose deposits suspensions and pipe surfaces pipe section the samples were pretreated by ultrasonication for 3 2 min at 42 khz in a water bath liu et al 2017 the obtained suspensions were used for downstream physicochemical and microbiological analyses 2 4 physicochemical analysis the concentrations of metal elements in all samples including iron fe manganese mn calcium ca aluminum al and arsenic as were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms quality control samples including laboratory fortified blanks and laboratory fortified samples were performed for every 10 samples 2 5 atp measurement atp content measurements were used to determine the active biomass across all samples the atp content was measured using the luciferene luciferase method magic knezev and kooij 2004 in brief the atp released from cells by nucleotide releasing buffer nrb celsis was measured by the intensity of the emitted light in a luminometer celsis advancetm calibrated with solutions of free atp celsis in autoclaved tap water following the procedure given by the manufacturer 2 6 dna extraction and sequencing the dna was extracted from all samples using the fastdna spin kit for soil q biogene mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna was amplified with a primer set 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 785r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 targeting the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of sequences from both bacterial and archaeal domains the primer set was modified for the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa by appending the illumina sequencing adaptors on the 5 end paired end sequencing of the amplicons 2 300 bp was performed by baseclear leiden the netherlands the sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi database accession number prjna715925 2 7 sequence data processing the sequences generated from the illumina miseq analysis of the 16s rrna gene amplicons were processed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime2 v2020 11 pipeline with the default settings bolyen et al 2019 caporaso et al 2010 raw sequences were first processed using dada2 callahan et al

ssu database release 132 quast et al 2012 multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction were performed using the qiime 2 plugin q2 phylogeny alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed using the qiime 2 plugin q2 diversity principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted based on weighted unifrac distance matrices liu et al 2014 the major otus are defined as otus with a defined cutoff of relative abundance 1 within each sample category the statistical analysis was performed in past and qiime2 statical significant differences were identified when the p value was lower than 0 05 p 0 05 2 8 sourcetracker analysis the bayesian based sourcetracker method was performed to quantify the contribution of potential sources to the sinks henry et al 2016 in the present study the planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab at each location in the network tn dn 1 dn 2 were identified as sinks while the pb and pab at dwtp and the biofilm and loose deposits at corresponding locations in the network were defined as potential sources sourcetracker analysis was conducted using default settings with a rarefaction depth of 1000 burn in 100 restart 10 alpha 0 001 and beta 0 01 the analysis was performed three times and the average was calculated as previously described henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 3 results in general clear spatial and temporal variations in the physiochemical and microbiological parameters in the dwds were captured by the online monitoring and sampling system omss spatially the particle load p v increased significantly from 1 98 0 93 mbar l in the dwtp to 3 15 2 49 mbar l in the primary transportation network tn and 21 36 5 25 and 24 79 7 24 mbar l in the secondary distribution networks dn 1 and dn 2 respectively p 0 001 fig s1a temporally peaks in particles and microbes were observed corresponding to the water demand peaks in the morning 06 09 00 and or in the evening 18 21 00 fig s2 in this section the results will be presented with an emphasis on capturing and tracing the dynamics of quantity and community of the planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab 3 1 spatial variations in pb and pab quantity considering the active biomass the atp concentrations in water were stable 8 1 0 9 ng l among the sampling times and locations while the particle associated atp p atp decreased from 1 10 0 40 ng l at dwtp to 0 09 0 03 ng l at tn and then slightly increased to 0 23 0 15 ng l and 0 13 0 06 ng l at dn 1 and dn 2 respectively p 0 001 fig 2a a weak negative correlation was observed between particle load and particle associated atp r2 0 17 p 0 001 fig 2b community in total 2655 227 sequences were obtained for 147 samples including 62 water pb 63 suspended solids pab 10 biofilms bf and 12 loose deposits ld which were assigned as 18 308 otus the rarefication curves reached a plateau after 3000 sequences indicating that enough sample coverage was obtained in the present study fig s3 alpha and beta diversity scores were generated after verification to an even sampling depth of 5670 for pb the number of observed otus followed the same changes as p atp which decreased first from dwtp 457 171 otus to tn 331 50 otus and increased in dn 636 205 at dn1 646 251 otus at dn2 p 0 001 fig 3a similarly for pab the number of observed otus decreased from dwtp 456 59 otus to tn 381 38 otus and then increased in dn 803 101 otus at dn 1 939 152 otus at dn 2 p 0 001 fig 3b a strong positive correlation was observed between the number of observed otus in pab and particle load r2 0 69 p 0 001 fig 3c regarding beta diversity the pcoa plot showed that the pb community was highly similar among all locations for the pab community tn clustered together with dwtp which was different from dn 1 and dn 2 fig s4 at the phylum level both pb and pab were dominated by proteobacteria and patescibacteria across all locations fig s5a and b the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from the dwtp to locations in the distribution system while the relative abundance of patescibacteria showed the reverse trend at the genus level the relative abundance of otu1525 assigned as polaromonas spp decreased dramatically from dwtp to distribution sites for both pb and pab fig s6a and b in contrast the relative abundances of otu903 assigned as the order candidatus kaiserbacteria and otu1540 assigned as the family burkholderiaceae increased from dwtp to dwds for pb and the relative abundances of otu1137 assigned as caulobacter spp and 1657 assigned as the family methylomonaceae increased from dwtp to dwds for pab compared to pb and pab higher otu numbers were observed in loose deposits ld 980 96 and biofilms bf 806 302 table s1 according to the beta diversity shown as the pcoa plot in fig s4 the bacterial communities of ld and bf were highly similar regardless of phase and location for the bacterial community composition proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in both ld 41 6 4 0 and bf 54 9 10 4 followed by planctomycetes acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae patescibacteria bacteroidetes and gemmatimonadetes fig s5c the taxonomic profile at the otu level is shown in fig s6c and table s2 3 2 daily variations in pb and pab at the dwtp the particle load was relatively stable 1 98 0 93 mbar l while clear daily patterns were observed in the dwds with peak hours occurring at different times e g 8 82 mbar l between 6 and 9 h at tn 25 34 mbar l between 18 and 21 h at dn 1 and double peaks at dn 2 between 6 and 9 h 31 57 mbar l and between 18 and 21 h 30 64 mbar l fig s2a the peaks of particle load were positively correlated with the concentrations of five selected elements but not with the concentrations of pb atp or pab p atp indicating that the particles might have mainly consisted of nonbiomass figs 2b and s7 considering the bacterial community no clear peak in otu number was found for pb at either dwtp or tn remarkably the peak numbers were observed between 18 and 21 h at dn 1 804 otus and dn 2 813 otus which was exactly the time of peak particle loads at the location figs 4 a and s2a although it was not reflected in the beta diversity analysis results significant daily variations in bacterial community composition were observed at the otu level at dn 1 and dn 2 for example the relative abundance of otu903 reached its peak between 18 and 21 h at dn 2 fig 4c for pab there were no significant daily variations in alpha and beta diversity analysis figs 4b and s4 whereas differences in bacterial community composition were observed over the course of the day at each location fig 4d for example peaks of certain otus were observed during the particle load peaks at tn otu1526 assigned as polynucleobacter spp and dn 2 otu1498 assigned as aquabacterium spp fig 4d in particular taking location tn as an example when comparing the peak hour 6 9 h with other sampling hours many otus i e otu1526 otu899 otu892 were significantly enriched fig s8 3 3 microbial source tracking of the pb and pab variations spatially the pb at the dwtp was the major contributor to the pb in water in the dwds 47 3 14 0 the contribution of which increased slightly from 42 2 10 6 at tn to 46 9 15 2 at dn 1 and 52 7 16 2 at dn 2 fig 5a similarly the pab at dwtp was the main contributor to the pab in the distribution system 40 2 4 4 but the exact contribution decreased from 50 7 1 2 at tn to 40 0 3 6 at dn 1 and 29 9 8 5 at dn 2 fig 5f noticeably the contributions of bf and ld to the pb and pab in dwds increased along the distance from tn pb 1 8 0 5 pab 2 8 3 4 to dn 1 pb 2 3 1 3 pab 3 8 1 9 and further increased to dn 2 pb 5 3 4 2 pab 4 7 1 4 fig 5c d g and h in addition a large fraction of the contribution was from unknown sources which may be because some possible sources were not covered in the sampling campaign temporally significant peak contributions of bf and ld to pb and pab in dwds were captured the contributions from bf and ld were well correlated with the trend of the daily particle loads fig s9 r2 0 22 and p 0 001 for pb r2 0 34 and p 0 001 for pab suggesting the potential sporadic release of bf and ld harbored microbes and contaminants during regular water demand fluctuations this is especially true after the secondary distribution at dn 1 and dn 2 where multiple peaks of bf and ld contributions were observed for example peak contributions of bf and ld to pab at dn 1 were captured at 6 9 h bf 1 8 1 0 ld 3 1 1 3 18 21 h bf 1 9 0 1 ld 3 3 1 5 and 21 24 h bf 1 9 0 6 ld 5 0 0 3 fig s10 while peak contributions of bf and ld to pb at dn 2 were captured at 3 6 h bf 6 7 1 5 ld 0 2 0 1 6 9 h bf 4 5 3 0 ld 0 3 0 1 and 18 21 h bf 5 3 2 7 ld 0 2 0 2 fig s11 4 discussion an online monitoring and sampling system omss was combined with sourcetracker to assess the spatial and temporal variations in the quantity and community of planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab in a drinking water distribution system dwds the spatial variations revealed a dominant process during distribution which allowed for the understanding of general biological water quality changes in addition online sampling and monitoring at certain locations makes it possible to have reliable comparisons among different locations which also uncovers the local circumstances and contributions of the dwds to daily water quality variations 4 1 spatial variations in pb and pab reveal the dominant process in the dwds water quality is determined by complicated physiochemical and biological processes in dwdss such as the sedimentation and resuspension of particles with the associated bacteria vreeburg and boxall 2007 and the attachment and detachment of bacteria to from pipe wall biofilms liu et al 2018 there will be an improvement or deterioration of water quality from the treatment plant to the dwds depending on the dominant processes however conventional sampling methods e g a single collection time point and analysis parameters e g heterotrophic plate count with insufficient sensitivity can hardly reveal the dominant processes banna et al 2014 in the present study the results obtained from different locations by the combination of online monitoring and sampling integral analysis and bacterial community fingerprint based source tracking make it possible to explore the detailed processes that occur during water distribution for all parameters analyzed the newly developed online monitoring and sampling outlined the ranges of variation at each location based on which a rational spatial comparison could be made with high resolution in this manner the mismatched comparison of randomly single time point grabbed samples and any potential misunderstanding on distribution processes could be avoided such as comparing a valley value from one location with a peak value of another location the newly introduced parameter δp v captured particle load variations not revealed by turbidity results not shown which increased significantly from dwtp to dwds especially after the secondary network at dn 1 and dn 2 the observed increase in particle load in dwds complied with a previous study in chlorinated filtration quantified offline by tss matsui et al 2007 and unchlorinated systems online particle counting verberk et al 2009 considering other newly introduced measures the decrease in active pab p atp the decrease of pab dwtp s contributions to pab dwds and the increase in pab dwds s diversity observed otu numbers it is reasonable to argue that particles supplied by dwtp were dominated by the sedimentation process while new particles were released from loose deposits ld and biofilms bf in the secondary network this was directly confirmed by the increases in ld and bf contributions to pb and pab from tn to dn 1 and dn 2 which also agree with the findings of our previous study assessing the origins of pb and pab in unchlorinated dwds liu et al 2018 4 2 daily dynamics of pb and pab uncover the local circumstances of dwds there were no significant daily variations for any parameters measured at the dwtp suggesting a stable input from the treatment plant into the dwds in the dwds clear daily variations were observed which were captured as peaks of particle loads observed otu numbers pb and certain members of the pb and pab communities similar morning evening peaks of turbidity and cell numbers in dwdss were reported previously besmer and hammes 2016 matsui et al 2007 in addition another study found daily patterns of pb community richness in chlorinated systems but the peak periods varied among locations e g 8 12 h and 0 4 h bautista de los santos et al 2016 in the same study the authors also reported significant differences in pb community structure and composition between 8 and 12 h and 16 20 h however no significant difference in the bacterial community was observed among the different periods for either pb or pab in the present study this might be because the present study was conducted in unchlorinated dwds where the flocculation of chlorine decay associated with water demand and usage shaping the bacterial community would not occur ling et al 2018 considering that the feed from the dwtp is stable it is reasonable to hypothesize that the captured daily peaks at each site were contributed by local dwds circumstances e g level of harbored contaminants and hydraulic turbulences which can be well illustrated by characterizing pb and pab this is especially true for the increase in pb otu numbers between 18 and 21 h at dn 1 from 636 otus on average to 804 otus and at dn 2 from 646 otus on average to 813 otus such increases in otu number were positively correlated with the increase in particle load which may be because local water demand peaks lead to variable hydraulic regimes in pipes and cause different levels of bf and ld release carragher et al 2012 douterelo et al 2013 lucas et al 2010 previous studies also found that the increased flow rate accompanied by increases of shear stress and scouring forces caused the release of particles and cells into water from biofilm and loose deposits choi and morgenroth 2003 husband et al 2008 paul et al 2012 in the present study the peaks of loose deposits and biofilm contributions to pb and pab in the dwds calculated by sourcetracker during the evening and morning hours offered direct and solid evidence to for this hypothesis interestingly the increase in pb otu numbers did not lead to significant changes in pb community structure because the contributions of ld and bf to pb were 5 3 which were lower than our previously reported threshold 20 in the same dwds liu et al 2017 4 3 practical implications the present study sensitively captured the spatial and temporal variations in pb and pab in a dwds which is important to consider for both routine sampling campaigns required by the water quality regulations and the widely conducted random collection sampling campaigns for research purposes ignoring such aperiodic variations would lead to mismatched comparisons of spatiotemporal series data and misunderstandings of dwds microbial ecology in addition we demonstrated that the quantitative and qualitative characterizations of pb and pab could be valuable messengers for determining local dominant processes within dwds however to understand the origin of captured variations and develop an effective management strategy accordingly high resolution integral sampling campaigns are required to cover all potential sources it would be even more powerful if other online microbiological analyses could be used together with omss such as the commercially available automated atp de vera and wert 2019 and the online flow cytometers besmer et al 2014 this study was conducted in an unchlorinated distribution system under regular water supply conditions for chlorinated distribution systems subjected to supply water changes and or hydrological disturbances the proposed methodology of combining omss with sourcetracker based on microbial community fingerprints would also be valuable for investigating water quality dynamics and transition effects in chlorinated systems the dynamic changes in pb and pab because of water demand stagnation and chlorine decay could be investigated with high resolution for example critical questions such as daily spatiotemporal variations of chlorine residual its correlation with pb and pab changes and the local interactions among water biofilm and loose deposits could be answered moreover the methodology involves continuous online monitoring and sampling as well as large volume preconcentration these advantages allow it to overcome the challenges of transition effect studies e g its contingency and the dilution of released bacteria when it takes place therefore as we suggested previously using omss will significantly increase the success rate of capturing the release events and transition effects compared to offline sampling chen et al 2020 future application of such a method is highly recommended both for studying the mechanism of water quality deterioration during water distribution and for preventing esthetic and health risks at customers ends especially if the distribution system is subject to supply water quality changes e g switching source water upgrading treatments and or hydraulic disturbances e g ultralong stagnation during the pandemic postrepair flushing firefighting 5 conclusions in the present study an online monitoring and sampling system omss was developed to investigate the daily variations in planktonic and particle associated bacteria in an unchlorinated drinking water distribution system the microbial fingerprint based sourcetracker was used for capturing and source tracking the daily bacterial peaks using planktonic and particle associated bacteria in treated water and the biofilm and loose deposits in the distribution system as potential sources the following conclusions can be drawn from this study regarding the daily variations in particle and bacterial load changes in the diversity and composition of bacterial communities and the sources of increased particles and cells during hydraulic peaks spatially the particle load slightly increased from the treatment plant to the transportation network and then sharply increased in the distribution network in contrast the quantity of particle associated bacteria decreased from the treatment plant to the transportation network and the distribution network for both planktonic and particle associated bacteria the number of observed otus first slightly decreased from the treatment plant to the transportation network and then sharply increased in the distribution network according to the sourcetracker results the planktonic and particle associated bacteria in the produced water are the main contributors to bacteria in the distribution system along the distribution distance the contribution of planktonic bacteria from the treatment plant increased while the contribution of particle associated bacteria from the treatment plant decreased temporally clear daily patterns were observed especially at the two locations in the distribution network dn 1 dn 2 more specifically the quantitative peaks of particle associated bacteria were captured in water usage peaks during the day according to the sourcetracker results the contributions of biofilm and loose deposits to the planktonic and particle associated bacteria in the drinking water distribution system dn 1 and dn 2 spiked during the water demand peaks accounting for 5 3 2 7 and 6 7 1 5 respectively methodologically we demonstrated that the combination of an online monitoring and sampling system omss and the microbial fingerprint based sourcetracker is a powerful tool for studying spatiotemporal water quality variations in an unchlorinated drinking water distribution system the particles and bacteria can be valuable messengers revealing physicochemical and microbiological processes occurring in distribution systems to better understand and manage the microbiological quality of drinking water during distribution future investigations are recommended to apply such a method in chlorinated systems and or transition effect studies declaration of

drinking water supply systems have been observed after long term stagnation chan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zlatanovic et al 2017 hydraulic disturbances may cause water quality deterioration such as increases in particle counts water turbidity and the concentrations of heavy metals and or bacteria lehtola et al 2006 all of the abovementioned water quality deteriorations pose public health concerns especially regarding the biosafety of drinking water worldwide grab sampling is commonly used for regular assessments and statutory monitoring of drinking water quality in the dwds however such low resolution and labor intensive sampling strategies can neither capture the aperiodic changes nor reveal the origination of physiochemical and microbiological contamination events banna et al 2014 online monitoring of particulate matter in the dwds has been introduced since the early 2000 s hargesheimer et al 2002 studies by online particle counting sampling and pairwise monitoring of hydraulic parameters and turbidity have clearly illustrated the daily variations in particulate profiles but their application has been preliminarily limited to physiochemical aspects matsui et al 2007 verberk et al 2006 such as discolorations mounce et al 2015 vreeburg et al 2008 recently online flow cytometry was developed for counting total and intact bacterial cells hammes et al 2012 and applied in dwds prest et al 2021 by combining online particle counts intact cell counts iccs and adenosine triphosphate atp measurements prest et al 2021 observed a weak correlation between atp and flow velocity which was attributed to the release of particle associated bacteria from biofilms or loose deposits however assessing only quantitative data on water samples could neither explain the source of contamination nor offer enlightenments on effective solutions the understanding of the microbial ecology in dwds has been substantially expanded by the rapid development and application of high throughput sequencing zhang and liu 2019 this is especially true when the generated high throughput sequencing data are combined with microbial ecology theory and mathematic modeling for example using an island biogeography model ling et al found that pipe diameter drove the changes in the tap water bacterial community in building plumbing ling et al 2018 by using the bacterial community fingerprint based bayesian sourcetracker we quantified the contribution of biofilm and loose deposits to the bacteria present in tap in unchlorinated dwds liu et al 2018 however in the study we only collected three sets of samples in the distribution system and capturing and tracing the aperiodic daily variations remains a critical knowledge gap therefore the objective of this study is to capture and trace the aperiodic spatiotemporal variations in planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab in drinking water distribution systems more specifically based on the investigations of the spatial and temporal variations in the distribution system the critical questions of what the local dominant processes are when the peaks would occur and why the changes may occur and where the changes may come from will be addressed as an approach to this goal an online sampling and monitoring system was developed which was used and combined with the bacterial community fingerprint based bayesian sourcetracker the findings obtained from this study advance the current understanding of the dynamics of aperiodic planktonic and particle associated bacteria in drinking water distribution systems which will be a powerful tool for water utilities to diagnose water quality problems and develop effective strategies for managing biological water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water treatment plant and sampling locations the study was conducted in one of the drinking water supply systems of oasen the netherlands the drinking water treatment plant produces drinking water from anaerobic groundwater 340 m3 h through conventional treatment processes in short the water was treated by spray aeration rapid sand filtration pellet softening carry over submerged rapid sand filtration granular activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection the drinking water is distributed to customers without chlorine as illustrated in fig 1a the sampling locations were selected at the treatment plant before the water entered the distribution system referred to as dwtp at the transportation network before the water was distributed into communities referred to as tn and at distribution network locations referred to as dn 1 and dn 2 more specifically dn 1 and dn 2 were located at the distal part of the secondary distribution network dn while tn was located at the proximal part of the secondary distribution network that is connected to the transportation network tn the distribution pipe material is pvc u in the study area in total 147 samples were collected from the four locations including 62 water samples planktonic bacteria pb 63 suspended solids particle associated bacteria pab 10 biofilms bf and 12 loose deposits ld 2 2 online monitoring and sampling of water and suspended particles a novel online monitoring and sampling system omss was developed to conduct online monitoring of water quality and continuous sampling of water and particles in dwdss fig 1b briefly the system integrated water quality monitoring sensors data loggers water sampling bottles and particle sampling filters whatman 1822 047 1 2 µm which were controlled and run by a preprogramed plc for 24 h for planktonic bacteria the bottle sampled drinking water was used for atp measurements and filtrated by 0 22 µm filters for dna extraction for particle associated bacteria the filter pore size of 1 2 µm was selected based on the results of our previous study liu et al 2013 the online monitored physicochemical parameters included temperature conductivity and ph water and suspended particles were sampled every 3 h suspended particles were sampled by filtrating tap water for 3 h with particle sampling filters samples were collected in triplicate 8 times a day automatically n 3 8 24 samples at sampling time periods of 0 3 h 3 6 h 6 9 h 9 12 h 12 15 h 15 18 h 18 21 h and 21 24 h the transmembrane pressure was monitored and recorded online and the pressure differences per volume of water pressure volume p v were used as an index of particle load in water the filters and water bottles were kept in refrigerator to guarantee the sample quality for the downstream microbiological analysis samples were collected and transported on ice and processed in the lab immediately after the 24 h sampling was performed the omss was operated at a flow of 2 l min for a total of 120 l per filter for suspended particle sampling the flow was measured and recorded online by a digital flow meter all data were logged every 5 min and visualized on a screen at each location the omss ran for two consecutive working days to obtain reliable and representative samples 2 3 biofilm and loose deposit sampling at each location the loose deposits and biofilm were sampled after the two days of running the omss as previously described vreeburg et al 2008 in short loose deposits were sampled at corresponding hydrants by flushing the pipeline with a velocity of 1 5 m s afterward sections of the flushed pipes with biofilm were cut in duplicate from the network pvc u d 110 mm length 30 cm the pipe section was closed with sterile caps and filled with dna free water to keep the inner surface wet all samples were stored in sterile plastic containers on ice and transported to the lab within 2 h to detach the bacteria and materials from suspended solids filters loose deposits suspensions and pipe surfaces pipe section the samples were pretreated by ultrasonication for 3 2 min at 42 khz in a water bath liu et al 2017 the obtained suspensions were used for downstream physicochemical and microbiological analyses 2 4 physicochemical analysis the concentrations of metal elements in all samples including iron fe manganese mn calcium ca aluminum al and arsenic as were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms quality control samples including laboratory fortified blanks and laboratory fortified samples were performed for every 10 samples 2 5 atp measurement atp content measurements were used to determine the active biomass across all samples the atp content was measured using the luciferene luciferase method magic knezev and kooij 2004 in brief the atp released from cells by nucleotide releasing buffer nrb celsis was measured by the intensity of the emitted light in a luminometer celsis advancetm calibrated with solutions of free atp celsis in autoclaved tap water following the procedure given by the manufacturer 2 6 dna extraction and sequencing the dna was extracted from all samples using the fastdna spin kit for soil q biogene mp biomedicals solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the extracted dna was amplified with a primer set 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 785r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 targeting the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of sequences from both bacterial and archaeal domains the primer set was modified for the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa by appending the illumina sequencing adaptors on the 5 end paired end sequencing of the amplicons 2 300 bp was performed by baseclear leiden the netherlands the sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi database accession number prjna715925 2 7 sequence data processing the sequences generated from the illumina miseq analysis of the 16s rrna gene amplicons were processed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime2 v2020 11 pipeline with the default settings bolyen et al 2019 caporaso et al 2010 raw sequences were first processed using dada2 callahan et al

ssu database release 132 quast et al 2012 multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction were performed using the qiime 2 plugin q2 phylogeny alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed using the qiime 2 plugin q2 diversity principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted based on weighted unifrac distance matrices liu et al 2014 the major otus are defined as otus with a defined cutoff of relative abundance 1 within each sample category the statistical analysis was performed in past and qiime2 statical significant differences were identified when the p value was lower than 0 05 p 0 05 2 8 sourcetracker analysis the bayesian based sourcetracker method was performed to quantify the contribution of potential sources to the sinks henry et al 2016 in the present study the planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab at each location in the network tn dn 1 dn 2 were identified as sinks while the pb and pab at dwtp and the biofilm and loose deposits at corresponding locations in the network were defined as potential sources sourcetracker analysis was conducted using default settings with a rarefaction depth of 1000 burn in 100 restart 10 alpha 0 001 and beta 0 01 the analysis was performed three times and the average was calculated as previously described henry et al 2016 mccarthy et al 2017 3 results in general clear spatial and temporal variations in the physiochemical and microbiological parameters in the dwds were captured by the online monitoring and sampling system omss spatially the particle load p v increased significantly from 1 98 0 93 mbar l in the dwtp to 3 15 2 49 mbar l in the primary transportation network tn and 21 36 5 25 and 24 79 7 24 mbar l in the secondary distribution networks dn 1 and dn 2 respectively p 0 001 fig s1a temporally peaks in particles and microbes were observed corresponding to the water demand peaks in the morning 06 09 00 and or in the evening 18 21 00 fig s2 in this section the results will be presented with an emphasis on capturing and tracing the dynamics of quantity and community of the planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab 3 1 spatial variations in pb and pab quantity considering the active biomass the atp concentrations in water were stable 8 1 0 9 ng l among the sampling times and locations while the particle associated atp p atp decreased from 1 10 0 40 ng l at dwtp to 0 09 0 03 ng l at tn and then slightly increased to 0 23 0 15 ng l and 0 13 0 06 ng l at dn 1 and dn 2 respectively p 0 001 fig 2a a weak negative correlation was observed between particle load and particle associated atp r2 0 17 p 0 001 fig 2b community in total 2655 227 sequences were obtained for 147 samples including 62 water pb 63 suspended solids pab 10 biofilms bf and 12 loose deposits ld which were assigned as 18 308 otus the rarefication curves reached a plateau after 3000 sequences indicating that enough sample coverage was obtained in the present study fig s3 alpha and beta diversity scores were generated after verification to an even sampling depth of 5670 for pb the number of observed otus followed the same changes as p atp which decreased first from dwtp 457 171 otus to tn 331 50 otus and increased in dn 636 205 at dn1 646 251 otus at dn2 p 0 001 fig 3a similarly for pab the number of observed otus decreased from dwtp 456 59 otus to tn 381 38 otus and then increased in dn 803 101 otus at dn 1 939 152 otus at dn 2 p 0 001 fig 3b a strong positive correlation was observed between the number of observed otus in pab and particle load r2 0 69 p 0 001 fig 3c regarding beta diversity the pcoa plot showed that the pb community was highly similar among all locations for the pab community tn clustered together with dwtp which was different from dn 1 and dn 2 fig s4 at the phylum level both pb and pab were dominated by proteobacteria and patescibacteria across all locations fig s5a and b the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased from the dwtp to locations in the distribution system while the relative abundance of patescibacteria showed the reverse trend at the genus level the relative abundance of otu1525 assigned as polaromonas spp decreased dramatically from dwtp to distribution sites for both pb and pab fig s6a and b in contrast the relative abundances of otu903 assigned as the order candidatus kaiserbacteria and otu1540 assigned as the family burkholderiaceae increased from dwtp to dwds for pb and the relative abundances of otu1137 assigned as caulobacter spp and 1657 assigned as the family methylomonaceae increased from dwtp to dwds for pab compared to pb and pab higher otu numbers were observed in loose deposits ld 980 96 and biofilms bf 806 302 table s1 according to the beta diversity shown as the pcoa plot in fig s4 the bacterial communities of ld and bf were highly similar regardless of phase and location for the bacterial community composition proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in both ld 41 6 4 0 and bf 54 9 10 4 followed by planctomycetes acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae patescibacteria bacteroidetes and gemmatimonadetes fig s5c the taxonomic profile at the otu level is shown in fig s6c and table s2 3 2 daily variations in pb and pab at the dwtp the particle load was relatively stable 1 98 0 93 mbar l while clear daily patterns were observed in the dwds with peak hours occurring at different times e g 8 82 mbar l between 6 and 9 h at tn 25 34 mbar l between 18 and 21 h at dn 1 and double peaks at dn 2 between 6 and 9 h 31 57 mbar l and between 18 and 21 h 30 64 mbar l fig s2a the peaks of particle load were positively correlated with the concentrations of five selected elements but not with the concentrations of pb atp or pab p atp indicating that the particles might have mainly consisted of nonbiomass figs 2b and s7 considering the bacterial community no clear peak in otu number was found for pb at either dwtp or tn remarkably the peak numbers were observed between 18 and 21 h at dn 1 804 otus and dn 2 813 otus which was exactly the time of peak particle loads at the location figs 4 a and s2a although it was not reflected in the beta diversity analysis results significant daily variations in bacterial community composition were observed at the otu level at dn 1 and dn 2 for example the relative abundance of otu903 reached its peak between 18 and 21 h at dn 2 fig 4c for pab there were no significant daily variations in alpha and beta diversity analysis figs 4b and s4 whereas differences in bacterial community composition were observed over the course of the day at each location fig 4d for example peaks of certain otus were observed during the particle load peaks at tn otu1526 assigned as polynucleobacter spp and dn 2 otu1498 assigned as aquabacterium spp fig 4d in particular taking location tn as an example when comparing the peak hour 6 9 h with other sampling hours many otus i e otu1526 otu899 otu892 were significantly enriched fig s8 3 3 microbial source tracking of the pb and pab variations spatially the pb at the dwtp was the major contributor to the pb in water in the dwds 47 3 14 0 the contribution of which increased slightly from 42 2 10 6 at tn to 46 9 15 2 at dn 1 and 52 7 16 2 at dn 2 fig 5a similarly the pab at dwtp was the main contributor to the pab in the distribution system 40 2 4 4 but the exact contribution decreased from 50 7 1 2 at tn to 40 0 3 6 at dn 1 and 29 9 8 5 at dn 2 fig 5f noticeably the contributions of bf and ld to the pb and pab in dwds increased along the distance from tn pb 1 8 0 5 pab 2 8 3 4 to dn 1 pb 2 3 1 3 pab 3 8 1 9 and further increased to dn 2 pb 5 3 4 2 pab 4 7 1 4 fig 5c d g and h in addition a large fraction of the contribution was from unknown sources which may be because some possible sources were not covered in the sampling campaign temporally significant peak contributions of bf and ld to pb and pab in dwds were captured the contributions from bf and ld were well correlated with the trend of the daily particle loads fig s9 r2 0 22 and p 0 001 for pb r2 0 34 and p 0 001 for pab suggesting the potential sporadic release of bf and ld harbored microbes and contaminants during regular water demand fluctuations this is especially true after the secondary distribution at dn 1 and dn 2 where multiple peaks of bf and ld contributions were observed for example peak contributions of bf and ld to pab at dn 1 were captured at 6 9 h bf 1 8 1 0 ld 3 1 1 3 18 21 h bf 1 9 0 1 ld 3 3 1 5 and 21 24 h bf 1 9 0 6 ld 5 0 0 3 fig s10 while peak contributions of bf and ld to pb at dn 2 were captured at 3 6 h bf 6 7 1 5 ld 0 2 0 1 6 9 h bf 4 5 3 0 ld 0 3 0 1 and 18 21 h bf 5 3 2 7 ld 0 2 0 2 fig s11 4 discussion an online monitoring and sampling system omss was combined with sourcetracker to assess the spatial and temporal variations in the quantity and community of planktonic bacteria pb and particle associated bacteria pab in a drinking water distribution system dwds the spatial variations revealed a dominant process during distribution which allowed for the understanding of general biological water quality changes in addition online sampling and monitoring at certain locations makes it possible to have reliable comparisons among different locations which also uncovers the local circumstances and contributions of the dwds to daily water quality variations 4 1 spatial variations in pb and pab reveal the dominant process in the dwds water quality is determined by complicated physiochemical and biological processes in dwdss such as the sedimentation and resuspension of particles with the associated bacteria vreeburg and boxall 2007 and the attachment and detachment of bacteria to from pipe wall biofilms liu et al 2018 there will be an improvement or deterioration of water quality from the treatment plant to the dwds depending on the dominant processes however conventional sampling methods e g a single collection time point and analysis parameters e g heterotrophic plate count with insufficient sensitivity can hardly reveal the dominant processes banna et al 2014 in the present study the results obtained from different locations by the combination of online monitoring and sampling integral analysis and bacterial community fingerprint based source tracking make it possible to explore the detailed processes that occur during water distribution for all parameters analyzed the newly developed online monitoring and sampling outlined the ranges of variation at each location based on which a rational spatial comparison could be made with high resolution in this manner the mismatched comparison of randomly single time point grabbed samples and any potential misunderstanding on distribution processes could be avoided such as comparing a valley value from one location with a peak value of another location the newly introduced parameter δp v captured particle load variations not revealed by turbidity results not shown which increased significantly from dwtp to dwds especially after the secondary network at dn 1 and dn 2 the observed increase in particle load in dwds complied with a previous study in chlorinated filtration quantified offline by tss matsui et al 2007 and unchlorinated systems online particle counting verberk et al 2009 considering other newly introduced measures the decrease in active pab p atp the decrease of pab dwtp s contributions to pab dwds and the increase in pab dwds s diversity observed otu numbers it is reasonable to argue that particles supplied by dwtp were dominated by the sedimentation process while new particles were released from loose deposits ld and biofilms bf in the secondary network this was directly confirmed by the increases in ld and bf contributions to pb and pab from tn to dn 1 and dn 2 which also agree with the findings of our previous study assessing the origins of pb and pab in unchlorinated dwds liu et al 2018 4 2 daily dynamics of pb and pab uncover the local circumstances of dwds there were no significant daily variations for any parameters measured at the dwtp suggesting a stable input from the treatment plant into the dwds in the dwds clear daily variations were observed which were captured as peaks of particle loads observed otu numbers pb and certain members of the pb and pab communities similar morning evening peaks of turbidity and cell numbers in dwdss were reported previously besmer and hammes 2016 matsui et al 2007 in addition another study found daily patterns of pb community richness in chlorinated systems but the peak periods varied among locations e g 8 12 h and 0 4 h bautista de los santos et al 2016 in the same study the authors also reported significant differences in pb community structure and composition between 8 and 12 h and 16 20 h however no significant difference in the bacterial community was observed among the different periods for either pb or pab in the present study this might be because the present study was conducted in unchlorinated dwds where the flocculation of chlorine decay associated with water demand and usage shaping the bacterial community would not occur ling et al 2018 considering that the feed from the dwtp is stable it is reasonable to hypothesize that the captured daily peaks at each site were contributed by local dwds circumstances e g level of harbored contaminants and hydraulic turbulences which can be well illustrated by characterizing pb and pab this is especially true for the increase in pb otu numbers between 18 and 21 h at dn 1 from 636 otus on average to 804 otus and at dn 2 from 646 otus on average to 813 otus such increases in otu number were positively correlated with the increase in particle load which may be because local water demand peaks lead to variable hydraulic regimes in pipes and cause different levels of bf and ld release carragher et al 2012 douterelo et al 2013 lucas et al 2010 previous studies also found that the increased flow rate accompanied by increases of shear stress and scouring forces caused the release of particles and cells into water from biofilm and loose deposits choi and morgenroth 2003 husband et al 2008 paul et al 2012 in the present study the peaks of loose deposits and biofilm contributions to pb and pab in the dwds calculated by sourcetracker during the evening and morning hours offered direct and solid evidence to for this hypothesis interestingly the increase in pb otu numbers did not lead to significant changes in pb community structure because the contributions of ld and bf to pb were 5 3 which were lower than our previously reported threshold 20 in the same dwds liu et al 2017 4 3 practical implications the present study sensitively captured the spatial and temporal variations in pb and pab in a dwds which is important to consider for both routine sampling campaigns required by the water quality regulations and the widely conducted random collection sampling campaigns for research purposes ignoring such aperiodic variations would lead to mismatched comparisons of spatiotemporal series data and misunderstandings of dwds microbial ecology in addition we demonstrated that the quantitative and qualitative characterizations of pb and pab could be valuable messengers for determining local dominant processes within dwds however to understand the origin of captured variations and develop an effective management strategy accordingly high resolution integral sampling campaigns are required to cover all potential sources it would be even more powerful if other online microbiological analyses could be used together with omss such as the commercially available automated atp de vera and wert 2019 and the online flow cytometers besmer et al 2014 this study was conducted in an unchlorinated distribution system under regular water supply conditions for chlorinated distribution systems subjected to supply water changes and or hydrological disturbances the proposed methodology of combining omss with sourcetracker based on microbial community fingerprints would also be valuable for investigating water quality dynamics and transition effects in chlorinated systems the dynamic changes in pb and pab because of water demand stagnation and chlorine decay could be investigated with high resolution for example critical questions such as daily spatiotemporal variations of chlorine residual its correlation with pb and pab changes and the local interactions among water biofilm and loose deposits could be answered moreover the methodology involves continuous online monitoring and sampling as well as large volume preconcentration these advantages allow it to overcome the challenges of transition effect studies e g its contingency and the dilution of released bacteria when it takes place therefore as we suggested previously using omss will significantly increase the success rate of capturing the release events and transition effects compared to offline sampling chen et al 2020 future application of such a method is highly recommended both for studying the mechanism of water quality deterioration during water distribution and for preventing esthetic and health risks at customers ends especially if the distribution system is subject to supply water quality changes e g switching source water upgrading treatments and or hydraulic disturbances e g ultralong stagnation during the pandemic postrepair flushing firefighting 5 conclusions in the present study an online monitoring and sampling system omss was developed to investigate the daily variations in planktonic and particle associated bacteria in an unchlorinated drinking water distribution system the microbial fingerprint based sourcetracker was used for capturing and source tracking the daily bacterial peaks using planktonic and particle associated bacteria in treated water and the biofilm and loose deposits in the distribution system as potential sources the following conclusions can be drawn from this study regarding the daily variations in particle and bacterial load changes in the diversity and composition of bacterial communities and the sources of increased particles and cells during hydraulic peaks spatially the particle load slightly increased from the treatment plant to the transportation network and then sharply increased in the distribution network in contrast the quantity of particle associated bacteria decreased from the treatment plant to the transportation network and the distribution network for both planktonic and particle associated bacteria the number of observed otus first slightly decreased from the treatment plant to the transportation network and then sharply increased in the distribution network according to the sourcetracker results the planktonic and particle associated bacteria in the produced water are the main contributors to bacteria in the distribution system along the distribution distance the contribution of planktonic bacteria from the treatment plant increased while the contribution of particle associated bacteria from the treatment plant decreased temporally clear daily patterns were observed especially at the two locations in the distribution network dn 1 dn 2 more specifically the quantitative peaks of particle associated bacteria were captured in water usage peaks during the day according to the sourcetracker results the contributions of biofilm and loose deposits to the planktonic and particle associated bacteria in the drinking water distribution system dn 1 and dn 2 spiked during the water demand peaks accounting for 5 3 2 7 and 6 7 1 5 respectively methodologically we demonstrated that the combination of an online monitoring and sampling system omss and the microbial fingerprint based sourcetracker is a powerful tool for studying spatiotemporal water quality variations in an unchlorinated drinking water distribution system the particles and bacteria can be valuable messengers revealing physicochemical and microbiological processes occurring in distribution systems to better understand and manage the microbiological quality of drinking water during distribution future investigations are recommended to apply such a method in chlorinated systems and or transition effect studies declaration of

crucial for further understanding the effect of nps and mps on the catabolism of pivotal microbial communities bhattacharya et al 2010 lim 2021 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b as an inevitable

and chemical compositions and the tiny specks of plastic used in many studies have distinct features from those found in environmental samples lim 2021 the size dependent toxicity of mps to microalgae and caenorhabditis elegans has been reported and nps have adversely affected cellular internalization of microalgae and the food availability of caenorhabditis elegans chen et al 2020b mueller et al 2020 the response of microbial communities to size dependent mps must be further studied several studies have shown that the exposure of polystyrene ps nps was detrimental to the methane production of was and yet there is limited information about how nps and mps imposed selection pressure on the microbial community and function during sludge ad fu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a the toxicological effect of nps on microorganisms during ad of was remains obscure overcoming the knowledge gap will provide a theoretical foundation for mitigating and preventing the potential impacts of nps on human health and ecosystems the main purpose of this work was to evaluate the impacts of ps nano microbeads on ad and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of toxicity of nps on microbes in was the effect of ps nano microbeads exposure on was anaerobic fermentation was explored by a biochemical methane potential bmp test coupled with a modeling analysis toxicity leaching experiments of styrene monomers as well as additives reactive oxygen species ros and cell viability were measured to reveal the potential toxic mechanisms additionally the responses in microbiomes and key functional genes to ps nps were investigated on the basis of illumina novaseq sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and a high throughput quantitative pcr based chip of functional genes involved in carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycles 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge and polystyrene nano microbeads sources the feedstock was and anaerobically digested sludge ads were obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank at wenchang wwtp harbin china and a long term running up flow anaerobic sludge bed anaerobic digester respectively wang et al 2022 raw was was thickened by gravity and stored in a temperature controlled room at 4 before use the basic parameters of was and ads were shown in the supporting information si table s1 ps nano microbeads with particle sizes of 50 nm 1 μm and 10 μm were purchased from ruige technology co ltd wuxi china the dispersion of ps nps 50 nm and mps 1 and 10 μm were sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and ultrapure water respectively the average size and composition of ps nano microspheres were confirmed by a s 3000 n scanning electron microscope sem hitachi japan and raman spectroscopy labram hr evolution horiba france respectively the corresponding images are shown in fig 1 a c and 1 g 2 2 toxicity test of polystyrene nano microbead leachates on methane production the leaching solution was configured after short term exposure of ps nano and microbeads as reported before to verify the toxicity of ps nps and mps leachates on was digestion li et al 2016 zhang et al 2020b briefly 100 ml of simulated wastewater and experimental levels of ps nps and mps were added into 250 ml anaerobic bottles incubated at 35 2 anaerobically for 15 days once the anaerobic leaching process was completed the leachates were prepared by filtering ps nano microbeads using the whatman membrane filter with 0 02 µm pore size cat no 6809 5002 cytivia usa the influence of ps nps and mps leachates on ads methane production was assessed under two laboratory conditions one condition was performed with ps nano microbeads in contrast the other condition used the corresponding ps nps and mps leachates an equal amount of ads 2 6 g l ts was inoculated into each 250 ml bottle before the experiment started the cumulative methane production under these two ps nps and mps exposure patterns was monitored 2 3 biochemical methane potential test with different polystyrene particle sizes and model based analysis the bmp test investigated the effect of ps nano microbeads exposure on methane production during ad the batch experiment comprised five conditions 1 control without ps ultrapure water 2 dispersion solution sds 3 ps 50 nm 4 ps 1 μm 5 ps 10 μm the ad process was conducted via a series of anaerobic bottles the effective volume of each bottle was 220 ml comprising 200 ml of was and 20 ml of inoculated ads the concentration of ps nps and mps in was was artificially set at 50 mg g ts fu et al 2018 mu and chen 2011 ultra pure nitrogen 99 999 was used for 20 min of aeration before sealing the entire fermentation process was carried out in a constant temperature incubating shaker at 35 2 for 30 days gas and sludge samples were periodically withdrawn to determine the biogas composition and basic parameters the first order kinetic model was used to fit the methane production data and apparent volatile solids vs destruction y0 was calculated using the si equations 2 4 impacts of polystyrene nano microbeads on each step of anaerobic digestion individual experiments of solubilization hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis were conducted with the same bmp test procedure to elucidate the influence of ps nano microbeads 50 nm 1 μm and 10 μm on each ad step moreover the activities of protease cellulase acetate kinase ack and coenzyme f420 were determined in each corresponding process 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa was added to the ad system to eliminate interference from methanogens a sequential ad process experiment was performed at 35 2 and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod bovine serum albumin bsa and dextran volatile fatty acids vfas and methane production were detected before and after the test respectively more detailed information was shown in the si 2 5 chemical and microbial analyses total solids ts volatile solids vs and scod were measured in the light of apha standard methods apha 1998 the ph was detected using a pb 10 ph meter sartorius germany vfas concentration and gas composition were analyzed by 6890a and 7890a gas chromatographs gc agilent america respectively the assessment of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros was referred to in a previous report limbach et al 2007 cell viability was measured via the cck 8 assay wörle knirsch et al 2006 more detailed information about ros and cell viability measurements were demonstrated in the si the samples were centrifuged and filtered through 0 45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene membranes before the determination of solubility parameters 2 6 illumina novaseq sequencing analysis and network construction 10 ml of each digested sludge sample following bmp was obtained for dna extraction using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad usa partial fragments of the 16s rrna gene were amplified using universal primer sets 338f and 806r for the v3 v4 region of bacteria and 519f and 915r for the v4 v5 region of archaea chen et al 2021 liu et al 2019 the illumina novaseq 6000 platform was used to sequence 16s rrna gene amplicons network construction and analysis were performed to investigate the microbial interactions under different experimental conditions via the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline means deng et al 2012 more detailed sequencing procedures were presented in the si 2 7 functional genes of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycling we quantified 71 functional genes involved in carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p sulfur s and methane cycles using high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr based chips table s7 chen et al 2020a zheng et al 2018 the detection and quantitative calculation of target genes in multiple samples were performed based on the smartchip real time quantitative pcr system takara bio inc shiga japan canco software v5 0 was used to obtain the cycle threshold ct value of each gene and the 16s rrna gene was used as an internal reference to standardize the data and obtain the relative quantitative information the absolute quantitative information of the 16s rrna gene was determined by the lightcycler 96 real time pcr system roche germany more details were shown in the si 2 8 statistical analysis all tests were conducted in triplicate one way analysis of variance anova was utilized to evaluate the significant difference between multiple parameters in different tests the welch s t test analyzed pairwise comparisons of absolute gene concentration in different tests p 0 05 or 0 01 was widely perceived as the threshold for statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 polystyrene nanobeads inhibited the methane production the bmp test showed that the presence of 50 nm ps nps inhibited methane production of was and the methane yield 80 7 3 5 l ch4 kg vs in the ps 50 nm test was 15 5 lower than that in the control test 95 5 2 4 l ch4 kg vs fig 1h likewise ps 50 nm exhibited a significant negative effect on b0 based on one substrate model analysis which was about 84 1 of the control 96 5 3 8 l ch4 kg vs p 0 05 and y0 correspondingly reduced from 20 4 0 4 in the control to 17 1 0 5 in the ps 50 nm table s2 instead the slightly decreased b0 and y0 in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm tests demonstrated that ps microbeads 1 and 10 μm had no obvious toxic effect on was methane production our finding that ps nps were more toxic to was methane production than mps was consistent with previous studies showing that ps toxicity increased with the decrease in particle size sjollema et al 2016 the increased k value in experimental tests could be translated into an increase in hydrolysis rate compared to the control the highest k was observed in ps 50 nm 0 171 0 002 d 1 which yielded a 15 5 increase in hydrolysis rate than the control without ps addition 3 2 little effect of chemical leachates on the observed toxicity the results of leaching experiments showed that ps nps 50 nm significantly reduced the cumulative methane production compared with the control assay p 0 05 fig 1i at the same time no significant difference was detected between the corresponding ps nps leachate assay and the control p 0 05 these discoveries suggested that the leached styrene monomers and chemicals were not responsible for the observed toxicity of ps nanobeads exposed to methane production fig 1h and i a previous study showed that the toxic effects of pvc mps on sludge ad might be caused by the chemical leachates wei et al 2019b styrene monomer is the chemical most likely to be leached from commercial ps beads at relatively low levels and is toxic to aquatic invertebrates mueller et al 2020 styrene can damage the dna in hemolymph cells mamaca et al 2005 and styrene dimers and trimers can affect the reproductive capacity of daphnia tatarazako et al 2002 besides styrene monomers other leached additives relevant to the surface area of ps beads may also be an additional reason for toxicity in the sludge ad process nobu et al 2016 however only a small amount of styrene has been reported to be released from ps microspheres stock solution into the liquid phase mueller et al 2020 the toxic effect on methane production in this work were not resulted from the chemical leachates of ps nps because the leaching concentrations might be lower than their toxic levels nps mps has been reported to inhibit the growth and reproduction of microalgae and the toxic mechanisms of nps mps vary with particle size chen et al 2020b liu et al 2020 large size mps might block the light transport and thus to affect the photosynthesis of microalgae whilst small size nps could attach to the surface of microalgae and thus to induce mechanical damage of cell well liu et al 2020 in addition nps mps may adsorb on the surface of microbial cells or even enter the cell interior by penetrating the cell membrane thus triggering ros production oxidative stress jeong et al 2016 for instance ps nps could be adsorbed on the surface of acetobacteroides hydrogenigenes and resulted in the formation of many nanopores fu et al 2018 in general cells are capable of secreting antioxidant enzymes to maintain the redox balance and defend the oxidative stress wei et al 2021 whereas once oxidative stress is beyond the level of the self regulation of cells it can induce cell peroxidation and result in inhibition of cell viability xia et al 2008 thus the unbalanced oxidative stress induced by particle size of nps mps might be the primary reason for explaining the adverse effects in this study which was further supported by the results of ros and cell viability table s4 3 3 oxidative stress caused the loss of cell viability the intracellular ros production showed a significant size related increase the exposure to 50 nm ps nanobeads significantly increased the ros level during ad of was compared to the control group p 0 05 table s4 consistent with the ros result we observed the corresponding reduction in cell viability in the ps 50 nm test 85 95 0 27 of the control sem images provide hard evidence that those tiny specks of ps plastic were in direct contact with microbial cells and eps matrix after the ad process and ps nps were more easily entrapped in eps matrix than ps mps accompanied by closer binding fig 1d f as such the strong oxidative stress induced by 50 nm ps nps might account for the inhibited methane production in the ps 50 nm assay fig 1h tables s2 and s4 the 1 μm and 10 μm ps microbeads exerted little effect on the induction of oxidative stress and cell viability in activated sludge flocs 3 4 nanoplastics restrained the acidogenesis of anaerobic digestion there was no significant difference in scod concentration among the cases set after 3 days of fermentation indicating that the ps particles barely affected the solubilization process at the studied levels p 0 05 fig 2 a it could be interpreted that the solubilization of the was matrix was a nonmicrobially induced process or the ps nano microbeads were innoxious to key microbes involved in sludge solubilization mu and chen 2011 wei et al 2019a pvc mps was reported to promot sludge solubilization because of the leaching of bisphenol a thus accelerating cell lysis and eps decomposition into more soluble organics wei et al 2019b accordingly we inferred that the ps leachate had no distinct effect on the rupture of the cell wall and eps matrix ps 50 nm contributed to a 12 6 increase in the bsa degradation efficiency compared to the control test 39 6 1 8 fig 2b however the bsa degradation efficiency in the dispersion test 39 7 1 1 was comparable to that in the control in addition the significantly decreased dextran degradation in the dispersion test 64 6 5 1 p 0 05 and the slightly increased dextran degradation in the ps 50 nm test 85 2 1 9 implied that 50 nm ps nps were conducive to the hydrolysis of was the bsa degradation efficiency was slightly decreased in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm with values of 35 5 0 9 and 35 4 2 2 respectively the degradation efficiency of dextran was inhibited in the presence of 1 μm ps mps 72 0 6 7 compared to the control 82 4 4 4 while there was a quite slight difference in dextran degradation between the control and the ps 10 μm these results demonstrated that 1 μm ps microbeads slightly restrained was hydrolysis during the ad process while the effect of 10 μm ps mps on was hydrolysis was negligible acidification test results illustrated that compared with the control test the concentration of total vfas decreased in the presence of ps nano microbeads at the studied levels i e 50 nm 1 μm and 10 μm indicating that ps nps and mps suppressed was acidification fig 2c the lowest vfas concentration of 150 2 31 1 mg cod l was observed in the ps 50 nm assay followed by 263 9 30 6 and 256 2 5 7 mg cod l in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm assays respectively it was speculated that the 50 nm ps nanobeads processed had the most severe inhibiting effect on acidogenesis this inference was supported by the previous evidences that the higher concentration levels of pvc and pe mps could inhibit the acidogenesis process of sludge wei et al 2019a 2019b ps nano microbeads contributed to an increase in cumulative methane production as compared with the control which was 21 1 0 8 24 6 2 1 and 26 8 4 6 ml in ps 50 nm ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm tests respectively fig 2d given these observations we could conclude that the repressed acidification process might account for the suppression in methane production observed in ps 50 nm during the 30 day bmp test mentioned above instead of the hydrolysis and methanogenesis processes figs 1h and 2 3 5 activity of key enzymes under polystyrene nano microbeads exposure the 50 nm ps nanobeads increased the activities of protease and cellulase showing that the ps nps enhanced the hydrolysis of was which agreed with the results of bsa and dextran degradation figs 2b 3 b and c likewise the activities of protease and cellulase were improved in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm as compared to the control which could be interpreted as enhanced sludge hydrolysis significantly such an inference was inconsistent with the observation in the hydrolysis test in the ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm assays fig 2b one possible reason was that the was hydrolysis efficiency was determined not only by enzyme activity but also by the distribution of active sites on the enzyme surface chen et al 2021 eps resistance can reduce interactions between enzymes and between enzymes and substrates thereby directly reducing enzyme efficiency tang et al 2020 the ack activity decreased from 632 5 85 1 nmol min ml in the control test to 575 3 61 0 and 496 7 40 6 nmol min ml in the sds dispersion and ps 50 nm tests respectively fig 3d no significant difference in ack activity was noted between ps 50 nm ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm assays p 0 05 these results revealed that the ps nps and mps suppressed the acidification process by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of ack the f420 activity was respectively 120 0 145 0 173 8 and 177 5 of the control in the groups sorted above fig 3e this result was consistent with the observation described above during the methanogenesis process which demonstrated that ps nps and mps exposure favored methanogenesis by intensifying the activity of f420 it was concluded that the inhibitory effect of was acidification and the enhancement of methanogenesis caused by ps exposure were interdependent and mutually restrained consequently they jointly resulted in the overall declining trend of methane production in the ps 50 nm test during the 30 day ad process in contrast the methane production in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm assays was similar to that in the control group figs 1h 3 3 6 response of bacterial community structure to plastics the predominant bacterial populations of digested sludge samples were distinguishable from those of the raw was and inoculum ads fig 4 a and b bacteroidetes proteobacteria epsilonbacteraeota chloroflexi and firmicutes were the foremost predominant phyla in digested sludge samples fig 4c and g the digested sludge samples shared the same predominant genera comprising sulfurovum mariniphaga brevefilum perlabentimonas and candidatus microthrix fig 4h the predominant genera of dispersion test were affiliated with sulfurovum mariniphaga and brevefilum with relative abundance of 32 0 3 8 3 7 0 9 and 3 7 0 4 respectively compared to the dispersion test ps nanobeads of 50 nm yielded a 36 6 decrease in the relative abundance of sulfurovum 20 3 12 7 and increased the relative abundance of mariniphaga 7 4 2 8 and brevefilum 4 6 1 3 by 97 1 and 26 1 respectively in addition nps significantly contributed to the enrichment of candidatus microthrix and perlabentimonas as compared with the dispersion p 0 05 sulfurovum as the most abundant population is an important member of the thiosulfate oxidizing and nitrate reducing chemolithoautotrophy capable of oxidizing hydrogen sulfide from biogas systems with nitrate as an electron acceptor giovannelli et al 2016 meier et al 2017 mariniphaga is an interspecific electron transporter known in anoxic environments iino et al 2014 genera brevefilum and perlabentimonas can ferment carbohydrates and proteins khomyakova et al 2021 mcilroy et al 2017 candidatus microthrix is a hydrolytic microbe commonly found in activated sludge mcilroy et al 2013 the enrichment of mariniphaga candidatus microthrix brevefilum and perlabentimonas in 50 nm ps nanobeads was behind the enhancement of was hydrolysis figs 2b and 4h the relative abundance of sulfurovum was increased from 22 0 2 7 in the control to 27 8 2 3 in the ps 1 μm assay however the composition of dominant populations in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm tests was similar to that in the control indicating that the ps mps tested did not substantially shape the core microbiome of digested sludge this result might explain the observation of similar methane production in these tests during 30 day ad 3 7 nanoplastics shaped archaeal core microbiome the archaeal communities of digested sludge were distinctly different from was and ads fig 4d and e euryarchaeota crenarchaeota and nanoarchaeaeota were the predominant phyla in digested samples fig 4f and i the dominating genera in digested samples comprised candidatus methanofastidiosum methanobacterium methanomassiliicoccus and methanobrevibacter among which candidatus methanofastidiosum presented a vastly superior fig 4j candidatus methanofastidiosum as a fastidious methyl reducing methanogen dominated the methanogenesis pathway in this work nobu et al 2016 the prominent microbiomes in the sds dispersion test belonged to candidatus methanofastidiosum 72 4 4 5 and methanobacterium 10 4 2 9 in comparison the presence of ps nps significantly reduced the relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum 61 0 4 6 p 0 05 exposure of 1 μm ps microbeads reduced the relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum 44 7 6 7 and methanobacterium 5 7 0 7 compared to that in the control whereas no significant difference in cumulative methane production was observed between the control and ps 1 μm tests fig 1h and table s2 p 0 05 the abundance of methanogens is not the only determinant in boosting methane production electron donor accessibility and the expression level of mcra gene encoding methyl coenzyme m reductase are also two pivotal criteria affecting the methanogenesis of sludge chen et al 2021 in addition the increased f420 activity might favor the methanogenesis from was under ps mps 1 μm exposure fig 3e candidatus methanofastidiosum was enriched in the sludge samples of ps 10 μm as compared with the control and the relative abundance of methanobacterium decreased from 14 6 4 4 in the control test to 9 0 1 2 this result revealed that the methanogenesis pathway of methylated thiol reduction was further intensified by 10 μm ps mps 3 8 plastics exposure altered interspecies co occurrence networks ps nps and mps induced different correlation patterns in bacterial community assemblies fig 5 a e the network in the ps 50 nm assay comprised 140 positive correlations and 88 negative correlations both of which were the lowest of all assays otu 1 sulfurovum had an overwhelming superiority of 19 30 in the ps 50 nm test presenting negative correlations with otus 39 5 97 and 103 related to hydrolysis and acidification processes the decreased relative abundance of otu 1 sulfurovum might be in favor of the enrichment of otus 39 5 97 and 103 which was supported by the evidence that 50 nm ps nps increased the relative abundance of mariniphaga candidatus microthrix brevefilum and perlabentimonas fig 4h although otu 31 leptospira 0 98 of spirochaete and otu 36 leptolinea 0 47 and otu 39 brevefilum 0 51 of chloroflexi were in low relative abundances their relatively high positive correlation with other otus indicated that these otus might play important roles in was digestion under exposure to 50 nm ps nps the results of the bacterial community and co occurrence network in the ps 50 nm test were mutually evidence which provided a reasonable explanation for the enhancement of acidogenesis under nps exposure the interspecies co occurrence network structure was more complex in ps microbeads 1 and 10 μm than that in the control fig 5a d f more complex network structures of digested sludge exposed to ps mps could be a potential inducement for undifferentiated ad performance between these two tests and the control because the biodiversity of interaction types can effectively enhance ecosystem stability by increasing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to environmental changes isbell et al 2015 mougi and kondoh 2012 the empirical network in archaeal communities exposed to 50 nm ps nanobeads was the most complicated of all assays with positive and negative connections of 118 and 96 respectively fig 5g l compared to the abundance of otus the network analysis in the ps 50 nm test based on dominant genera top 50 was less complex and could directly reflect interspecific relationships in the archaea community fig s2 candidatus methanofastidiosum was negatively correlated with methanobrevibacter possibly suggesting that the decreased relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum might motivate the action of methanobrevibacter in the presence of ps nps ps mps 1 μm and 10 μm exposure increased the proportion of negative correlation as compared with the control and no distinct difference of positive correlations was observed candidatus methanofastidiosum was negatively correlated with methanosphaera and candidatus nitrososphaera in the control however the keystone species turned out to be methanobacterium in the ps 1 μm test positively correlated with methanomassiliicoccus and methanosaeta the results consistently showed that the relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum dramatically decreased in the presence of 1 μm ps microbeads a negative correlation between candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanobrevibacter and a positive correlation between methanosaeta and candidatus methanomethylicus were constructed in the ps 10 μm test it could be inferred that the methylotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum and candidatus methanomethylicus and acetoclastic methanosaeta methanogens appeared to dominate the methanogenesis in ps 10 μm assay zhou et al 2020 3 9 nanoplastics reduced the abundance of functional genes ht qpcr analyses for assessing and quantifying the genetic potential of microbiota in element cycling showed that the abundant genes were chiefly involved in nitrogen recycling and carbon fixation with absolute quantities ranging in 1 1 1 4 105 and 5 5 9 0 104 copies ng dna respectively fig 6 b the presence of 50 nm ps nps reduced the number of genes involved in carbon c degradation and fixation methane metabolism as well as nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s cycles it should be noted that the abundance of mcra encoding a key enzyme associated with methane production was only 54 4 of the control test fig 6a and table s8 ermler et al 1997 these results might well interpret the inhibiting effect of 50 nm ps nps on methane production during the 30 day bmp test fig 1h significantly the opposite result was observed in the ps 1 μm test and is justified although the relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanobacterium decreased under exposure to 1 μm ps microbeads the cumulative methane production was similar to the control test figs 1h and 4j all tested groups shared the same abundant genes of gdha nirs1 acsa nifh nirs2 and urec which were mostly related to n recycling except for gene acsa associated with carbon fixation fig 6a compared with the control group ps nps of 50 nm significantly reduced the abundance of lig naglu xyla and gcd encoding lignin peroxidase α n acetylglucosaminidase xylose isomerase and quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase respectively as well as phnk involved in the phosphorus cycle p 0 05 fig 6c the putative phosphonate transport system atp binding protein encoded by phnk is used for nutrient uptake metabolite release and signal transduction thus mediating c n and p cycles wang et al 2017 the results that nps reduced the number of the genes involved in c n and p metabolisms were consistent with decreases in the relative abundance of the foremost genera sulfurovum and candidatus methanofastidiosum participating in the carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles fig 4h and j we extrapolated from these results that excessive oxidative stress induced by ps nps was toxic to intracellular lipids proteins and some intermediates leading to more apoptosis which may provide some explanation for the decreased abundance of relevant functional genes table s8 mu and chen 2011 wei et al 2019c the presence of 1 μm ps microbeads significantly increased the abundance of napa encoding nitrate reductase as compared to the control p 0 01 fig 6d this observation was consistent with the increased relative abundance of sulfurovum observed in the ps 1 μm test moreover there was no significant difference in the absolute abundance of other genes between these two tests p 0 05 compared with the control ps microbeads of 10 μm significantly reduced the absolute abundances of bpp and gcd involved in the phosphorus cycle fig 6e the abundance of urec was the opposite p 0 05 reduction of gcd abundance might be manifested as decreased glycolysis capacity which provided direct evidence for the inhibition of sludge acidification by 10 μm ps microbeads fig 2c 4 conclusion this work was the first to comprehensively evaluate the effects of ps nps and mps exposure on anaerobic microbiome assembly and metabolic function compared with mps ps nps of 50 nm might well restrain acidogenic activity thus inhibiting methane production during the 30 day bmp test oxidative stress was the key contributor to the observed toxicity of ps nps rather than leachates and styrene monomers the reduction in the number of genes associated with carbon degradation and fixation methane metabolism especially mcra n p and s cycles and the relative abundance of sulfurovum candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanobacterium well interpreted the reduced methane production in the ps 50 nm test the enrichment of mariniphaga candidatus microthrix brevefilum and perlabentimonas in the ps 50 nm assay accounted for the enhancement of was hydrolysis several critical attributes of nps and mps must be addressed before expanding our findings to practical ecological risk assessment in the natural environment first only commercially available and spherical ps nps and mps were used in this work however the complicated treatment processes in the natural environment could alter the shape and behavior of nps and mps thus resulting in different effects besides the concentration of ps nps and mps was far beyond the actual scene it is necessary to develop advanced equipment to overcome the limitations of the analysis and conduct more research on the properties of nps and mps in environmental samples this study makes important advances on assessment of the effects of nps and mps on catabolism of key microbial communities and the interaction

15932,nanoplastics nps and microplastics mps are ubiquitous in the natural environment social production and life however our understanding of the effects of nps and mps on shaping the microbiome and functional metabolism of anaerobic microorganisms is limited we investigated the response of core microbiomes and functional genes to polystyrene ps nps and mps exposure in a representative anaerobic micro ecosystem of waste activated sludge independent anaerobic digestion ad experiment indicated that ps nanobeads suppressed acidogenesis by inhibiting the activity of acetate kinase and subsequently reduced methane production our findings confirmed that mps 1 and 10 μm had no perceptible effect on methane production yet 50 nm nps resulted in a 15 5 decrease in methane yield perhaps driven by the behavior of dominant genera sulfurovum candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanobacterium assays revealed that nps contributed to the simplest network assemblies in bacterial communities contrary to empirical networks in archaeal communities nps significantly reduced the abundance of genes involved in carbon degradation lig naglu and xyla as well as gcd and phnk related to phosphorus cycling the absolute abundance of mcra encoding methyl coenzyme m reductase was 54 4 of the control assay ps nps might adversely affect the biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles in natural and artificial ecosystems through their negative impact on biomass energy conversion by anaerobic microorganisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics anaerobic microorganisms methanogenesis waste activated sludge community network 1 introduction globally the accumulation and pollution of microplastics mps normally defined as plastic debris less than 5 mm in diameter in the ecosystem have aroused increasing concerns considering their adverse environmental impacts and toxicological risks to aquatic species and human beings fendall and sewell 2009 sun et al 2019 wei et al 2019b mps can be further categorized as nanoscale plastics 1000 nm and microscale plastics 1 5 mm sobhani et al 2020 compared to mps nanoplastics nps are likely to induce more serious environmental

al 2020 wright and kelly 2017 nps may serve as vectors for multiple pollutants such as metal or organic pollutants and persistent organic pollutants pops to name a few because of their large specific surface area resulting in combined pollution to the ecosystem koelmans et al 2016 li et al 2019 our knowledge of the interaction between incidental nps and the eco environment is still limited which is essentially different from assessing the impact of mps on environmental systems gigault et al 2021 mitrano et al 2021 natural environments including marine the atmosphere rivers and sediments soil and even polar regions contain nps and mps as do artificial ecosystems such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps and landfills cheung and fok 2017 lim 2021 exposure or migration of nps and mps has unpredictable effects on the biota of multiple ecological environments assessing the impacts of nps and mps on a series of biochemical physical and chemical reactions in natural and engineered ecosystems is complex in nature anaerobic microorganisms exist widely in various ecosystems and play a key role in degrading and recycling organic matter by working together to push the limits of biocatalytic hydrolysis lillington et al 2020 the exploitation and utilization of these microbial populations via anaerobic digestion ad can enhance the biodegradation of waste products emanating from anthropogenic activities such as waste activated sludge was urban solid waste lignocellulosic residues etc currently most laboratory studies have stressed the exposure of nps and mps to animals especially aquatic organisms e g fish zooplankton bivalves benthos and rotifers and microalgae few studies have exposed anaerobic microbial communities involved in ad to nps and mps thus making it crucial for further understanding the effect of nps and mps on the catabolism of pivotal microbial communities bhattacharya et al 2010 lim 2021 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b as an inevitable byproduct of wwtps was is one of the most commonly used environmental substrates for ad studies several studies have indicated that the addition of polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet as well as polyvinyl chloride pvc mps to was may impose restrictions on methane hydrogen production in ad by releasing toxic additives and or inducing redox damage wei et al 2019a 2019b 2019c zhang et al 2020b the concentration of mps on the micron scale is the unique experimental variable in these works however their findings do not apply to actual situations because mps have different shapes sizes and chemical compositions and the tiny specks of plastic used in many studies have distinct features from those found in environmental samples lim 2021 the size dependent toxicity of mps to microalgae and caenorhabditis elegans has been reported and nps have adversely affected cellular internalization of microalgae and the food availability of caenorhabditis elegans chen et al 2020b mueller et al 2020 the response of microbial communities to size dependent mps must be further studied several studies have shown that the exposure of polystyrene ps nps was detrimental to the methane production of was and yet there is limited information about how nps and mps imposed selection pressure on the microbial community and function during sludge ad fu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a the toxicological effect of nps on microorganisms during ad of was remains obscure overcoming the knowledge gap will provide a theoretical foundation for mitigating and preventing the potential impacts of nps on human health and ecosystems the main purpose of this work was to evaluate the impacts of ps nano microbeads on ad and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of toxicity of nps on microbes in was the effect of ps nano microbeads exposure on was anaerobic fermentation was explored by a biochemical methane potential bmp test coupled with a modeling analysis toxicity leaching experiments of styrene monomers as well as additives reactive oxygen species ros and cell viability were measured to reveal the potential toxic mechanisms additionally the responses in microbiomes and key functional genes to ps nps were investigated on the basis of illumina novaseq sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and a high throughput quantitative pcr based chip of functional genes involved in carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycles 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge and polystyrene nano microbeads sources the feedstock was and anaerobically digested sludge ads were obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank at wenchang wwtp harbin china and a long term running up flow anaerobic sludge bed anaerobic digester respectively wang et al 2022 raw was was thickened by gravity and stored in a temperature controlled room at 4 before use the basic parameters of was and ads were shown in the supporting information si table s1 ps nano microbeads with particle sizes of 50 nm 1 μm and 10 μm were purchased from ruige technology co ltd wuxi china the dispersion of ps nps 50 nm and mps 1 and 10 μm were sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and ultrapure water respectively the average size and composition of ps nano microspheres were confirmed by a s 3000 n scanning electron microscope sem hitachi japan and raman spectroscopy labram hr evolution horiba france respectively the corresponding images are shown in fig 1 a c and 1 g 2 2 toxicity test of polystyrene nano microbead leachates on methane production the leaching solution was configured after short term exposure of ps nano and microbeads as reported before to verify the toxicity of ps nps and mps leachates on was digestion li et al 2016 zhang et al 2020b briefly 100 ml of simulated wastewater and experimental levels of ps nps and mps were added into 250 ml anaerobic bottles incubated at 35 2 anaerobically for 15 days once the anaerobic leaching process was completed the leachates were prepared by filtering ps nano microbeads using the whatman membrane filter with 0 02 µm pore size cat no 6809 5002 cytivia usa the influence of ps nps and mps leachates on ads methane production was assessed under two laboratory conditions one condition was performed with ps nano microbeads in contrast the other condition used the corresponding ps nps and mps leachates an equal amount of ads 2 6 g l ts was inoculated into each 250 ml bottle before the experiment started the cumulative methane production under these two ps nps and mps exposure patterns was monitored 2 3 biochemical methane potential test with different polystyrene particle sizes and model based analysis the bmp test investigated the effect of ps nano microbeads exposure on methane production during ad the batch experiment comprised five conditions 1 control without ps ultrapure water 2 dispersion solution sds 3 ps 50 nm 4 ps 1 μm 5 ps 10 μm the ad process was conducted via a series of anaerobic bottles the effective volume of each bottle was 220 ml comprising 200 ml of was and 20 ml of inoculated ads the concentration of ps nps and mps in was was artificially set at 50 mg g ts fu et al 2018 mu and chen 2011 ultra pure nitrogen 99 999 was used for 20 min of aeration before sealing the entire fermentation process was carried out in a constant temperature incubating shaker at 35 2 for 30 days gas and sludge samples were periodically withdrawn to determine the biogas composition and basic parameters the first order kinetic model was used to fit the methane production data and apparent volatile solids vs destruction y0 was calculated using the si equations 2 4 impacts of polystyrene nano microbeads on each step of anaerobic digestion individual experiments of solubilization hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis were conducted with the same bmp test procedure to elucidate the influence of ps nano microbeads 50 nm 1 μm and 10 μm on each ad step moreover the activities of protease cellulase acetate kinase ack and coenzyme f420 were determined in each corresponding process 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa was added to the ad system to eliminate interference from methanogens a sequential ad process experiment was performed at 35 2 and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod bovine serum albumin bsa and dextran volatile fatty acids vfas and methane production were detected before and after the test respectively more detailed information was shown in the si 2 5 chemical and microbial analyses total solids ts volatile solids vs and scod were measured in the light of apha standard methods apha 1998 the ph was detected using a pb 10 ph meter sartorius germany vfas concentration and gas composition were analyzed by 6890a and 7890a gas chromatographs gc agilent america respectively the assessment of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros was referred to in a previous report limbach et al 2007 cell viability was measured via the cck 8 assay wörle knirsch et al 2006 more detailed information about ros and cell viability measurements were demonstrated in the si the samples were centrifuged and filtered through 0 45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene membranes before the determination of solubility parameters 2 6 illumina novaseq sequencing analysis and network construction 10 ml of each digested sludge sample following bmp was obtained for dna extraction using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad usa partial fragments of the 16s rrna gene were amplified using universal primer sets 338f and 806r for the v3 v4 region of bacteria and 519f and 915r for the v4 v5 region of archaea chen et al 2021 liu et al 2019 the illumina novaseq 6000 platform was used to sequence 16s rrna gene amplicons network construction and analysis were performed to investigate the microbial interactions under different experimental conditions via the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline means deng et al 2012 more detailed sequencing procedures were presented in the si 2 7 functional genes of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycling we quantified 71 functional genes involved in carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p sulfur s and methane cycles using high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr based chips table s7 chen et al 2020a zheng et al 2018 the detection and quantitative calculation of target genes in multiple samples were performed based on the smartchip real time quantitative pcr system takara bio inc shiga japan canco software v5 0 was used to obtain the cycle threshold ct value of each gene and the 16s rrna gene was used as an internal reference to standardize the data and obtain the relative quantitative information the absolute quantitative information of the 16s rrna gene was determined by the lightcycler 96 real time pcr system roche germany more details were shown in the si 2 8 statistical analysis all tests were conducted in triplicate one way analysis of variance anova was utilized to evaluate the significant difference between multiple parameters in different tests the welch s t test analyzed pairwise comparisons of absolute gene concentration in different tests p 0 05 or 0 01 was widely perceived as the threshold for statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 polystyrene nanobeads inhibited the methane production the bmp test showed that the presence of 50 nm ps nps inhibited methane production of was and the methane yield 80 7 3 5 l ch4 kg vs in the ps 50 nm test was 15 5 lower than that in the control test 95 5 2 4 l ch4 kg vs fig 1h likewise ps 50 nm exhibited a significant negative effect on b0 based on one substrate model analysis which was about 84 1 of the control 96 5 3 8 l ch4 kg vs p 0 05 and y0 correspondingly reduced from 20 4 0 4 in the control to 17 1 0 5 in the ps 50 nm table s2 instead the slightly decreased b0 and y0 in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm tests demonstrated that ps microbeads 1 and 10 μm had no obvious toxic effect on was methane production our finding that ps nps were more toxic to was methane production than mps was consistent with previous studies showing that ps toxicity increased with the decrease in particle size sjollema et al 2016 the increased k value in experimental tests could be translated into an increase in hydrolysis rate compared to the control the highest k was observed in ps 50 nm 0 171 0 002 d 1 which yielded a 15 5 increase in hydrolysis rate than the control without ps addition 3 2 little effect of chemical leachates on the observed toxicity the results of leaching experiments showed that ps nps 50 nm significantly reduced the cumulative methane production compared with the control assay p 0 05 fig 1i at the same time no significant difference was detected between the corresponding ps nps leachate assay and the control p 0 05 these discoveries suggested that the leached styrene monomers and chemicals were not responsible for the observed toxicity of ps nanobeads exposed to methane production fig 1h and i a previous study showed that the toxic effects of pvc mps on sludge ad might be caused by the chemical leachates wei et al 2019b styrene monomer is the chemical most likely to be leached from commercial ps beads at relatively low levels and is toxic to aquatic invertebrates mueller et al 2020 styrene can damage the dna in hemolymph cells mamaca et al 2005 and styrene dimers and trimers can affect the reproductive capacity of daphnia tatarazako et al 2002 besides styrene monomers other leached additives relevant to the surface area of ps beads may also be an additional reason for toxicity in the sludge ad process nobu et al 2016 however only a small amount of styrene has been reported to be released from ps microspheres stock solution into the liquid phase mueller et al 2020 the toxic effect on methane production in this work were not resulted from the chemical leachates of ps nps because the leaching concentrations might be lower than their toxic levels nps mps has been reported to inhibit the growth and reproduction of microalgae and the toxic mechanisms of nps mps vary with particle size chen et al 2020b liu et al 2020 large size mps might block the light transport and thus to affect the photosynthesis of microalgae whilst small size nps could attach to the surface of microalgae and thus to induce mechanical damage of cell well liu et al 2020 in addition nps mps may adsorb on the surface of microbial cells or even enter the cell interior by penetrating the cell membrane thus triggering ros production oxidative stress jeong et al 2016 for instance ps nps could be adsorbed on the surface of acetobacteroides hydrogenigenes and resulted in the formation of many nanopores fu et al 2018 in general cells are capable of secreting antioxidant enzymes to maintain the redox balance and defend the oxidative stress wei et al 2021 whereas once oxidative stress is beyond the level of the self regulation of cells it can induce cell peroxidation and result in inhibition of cell viability xia et al 2008 thus the unbalanced oxidative stress induced by particle size of nps mps might be the primary reason for explaining the adverse effects in this study which was further supported by the results of ros and cell viability table s4 3 3 oxidative stress caused the loss of cell viability the intracellular ros production showed a significant size related increase the exposure to 50 nm ps nanobeads significantly increased the ros level during ad of was compared to the control group p 0 05 table s4 consistent with the ros result we observed the corresponding reduction in cell viability in the ps 50 nm test 85 95 0 27 of the control sem images provide hard evidence that those tiny specks of ps plastic were in direct contact with microbial cells and eps matrix after the ad process and ps nps were more easily entrapped in eps matrix than ps mps accompanied by closer binding fig 1d f as such the strong oxidative stress induced by 50 nm ps nps might account for the inhibited methane production in the ps 50 nm assay fig 1h tables s2 and s4 the 1 μm and 10 μm ps microbeads exerted little effect on the induction of oxidative stress and cell viability in activated sludge flocs 3 4 nanoplastics restrained the acidogenesis of anaerobic digestion there was no significant difference in scod concentration among the cases set after 3 days of fermentation indicating that the ps particles barely affected the solubilization process at the studied levels p 0 05 fig 2 a it could be interpreted that the solubilization of the was matrix was a nonmicrobially induced process or the ps nano microbeads were innoxious to key microbes involved in sludge solubilization mu and chen 2011 wei et al 2019a pvc mps was reported to promot sludge solubilization because of the leaching of bisphenol a thus accelerating cell lysis and eps decomposition into more soluble organics wei et al 2019b accordingly we inferred that the ps leachate had no distinct effect on the rupture of the cell wall and eps matrix ps 50 nm contributed to a 12 6 increase in the bsa degradation efficiency compared to the control test 39 6 1 8 fig 2b however the bsa degradation efficiency in the dispersion test 39 7 1 1 was comparable to that in the control in addition the significantly decreased dextran degradation in the dispersion test 64 6 5 1 p 0 05 and the slightly increased dextran degradation in the ps 50 nm test 85 2 1 9 implied that 50 nm ps nps were conducive to the hydrolysis of was the bsa degradation efficiency was slightly decreased in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm with values of 35 5 0 9 and 35 4 2 2 respectively the degradation efficiency of dextran was inhibited in the presence of 1 μm ps mps 72 0 6 7 compared to the control 82 4 4 4 while there was a quite slight difference in dextran degradation between the control and the ps 10 μm these results demonstrated that 1 μm ps microbeads slightly restrained was hydrolysis during the ad process while the effect of 10 μm ps mps on was hydrolysis was negligible acidification test results illustrated that compared with the control test the concentration of total vfas decreased in the presence of ps nano microbeads at the studied levels i e 50 nm 1 μm and 10 μm indicating that ps nps and mps suppressed was acidification fig 2c the lowest vfas concentration of 150 2 31 1 mg cod l was observed in the ps 50 nm assay followed by 263 9 30 6 and 256 2 5 7 mg cod l in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm assays respectively it was speculated that the 50 nm ps nanobeads processed had the most severe inhibiting effect on acidogenesis this inference was supported by the previous evidences that the higher concentration levels of pvc and pe mps could inhibit the acidogenesis process of sludge wei et al 2019a 2019b ps nano microbeads contributed to an increase in cumulative methane production as compared with the control which was 21 1 0 8 24 6 2 1 and 26 8 4 6 ml in ps 50 nm ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm tests respectively fig 2d given these observations we could conclude that the repressed acidification process might account for the suppression in methane production observed in ps 50 nm during the 30 day bmp test mentioned above instead of the hydrolysis and methanogenesis processes figs 1h and 2 3 5 activity of key enzymes under polystyrene nano microbeads exposure the 50 nm ps nanobeads increased the activities of protease and cellulase showing that the ps nps enhanced the hydrolysis of was which agreed with the results of bsa and dextran degradation figs 2b 3 b and c likewise the activities of protease and cellulase were improved in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm as compared to the control which could be interpreted as enhanced sludge hydrolysis significantly such an inference was inconsistent with the observation in the hydrolysis test in the ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm assays fig 2b one possible reason was that the was hydrolysis efficiency was determined not only by enzyme activity but also by the distribution of active sites on the enzyme surface chen et al 2021 eps resistance can reduce interactions between enzymes and between enzymes and substrates thereby directly reducing enzyme efficiency tang et al 2020 the ack activity decreased from 632 5 85 1 nmol min ml in the control test to 575 3 61 0 and 496 7 40 6 nmol min ml in the sds dispersion and ps 50 nm tests respectively fig 3d no significant difference in ack activity was noted between ps 50 nm ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm assays p 0 05 these results revealed that the ps nps and mps suppressed the acidification process by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of ack the f420 activity was respectively 120 0 145 0 173 8 and 177 5 of the control in the groups sorted above fig 3e this result was consistent with the observation described above during the methanogenesis process which demonstrated that ps nps and mps exposure favored methanogenesis by intensifying the activity of f420 it was concluded that the inhibitory effect of was acidification and the enhancement of methanogenesis caused by ps exposure were interdependent and mutually restrained consequently they jointly resulted in the overall declining trend of methane production in the ps 50 nm test during the 30 day ad process in contrast the methane production in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm assays was similar to that in the control group figs 1h 3 3 6 response of bacterial community structure to plastics the predominant bacterial populations of digested sludge samples were distinguishable from those of the raw was and inoculum ads fig 4 a and b bacteroidetes proteobacteria epsilonbacteraeota chloroflexi and firmicutes were the foremost predominant phyla in digested sludge samples fig 4c and g the digested sludge samples shared the same predominant genera comprising sulfurovum mariniphaga brevefilum perlabentimonas and candidatus microthrix fig 4h the predominant genera of dispersion test were affiliated with sulfurovum mariniphaga and brevefilum with relative abundance of 32 0 3 8 3 7 0 9 and 3 7 0 4 respectively compared to the dispersion test ps nanobeads of 50 nm yielded a 36 6 decrease in the relative abundance of sulfurovum 20 3 12 7 and increased the relative abundance of mariniphaga 7 4 2 8 and brevefilum 4 6 1 3 by 97 1 and 26 1 respectively in addition nps significantly contributed to the enrichment of candidatus microthrix and perlabentimonas as compared with the dispersion p 0 05 sulfurovum as the most abundant population is an important member of the thiosulfate oxidizing and nitrate reducing chemolithoautotrophy capable of oxidizing hydrogen sulfide from biogas systems with nitrate as an electron acceptor giovannelli et al 2016 meier et al 2017 mariniphaga is an interspecific electron transporter known in anoxic environments iino et al 2014 genera brevefilum and perlabentimonas can ferment carbohydrates and proteins khomyakova et al 2021 mcilroy et al 2017 candidatus microthrix is a hydrolytic microbe commonly found in activated sludge mcilroy et al 2013 the enrichment of mariniphaga candidatus microthrix brevefilum and perlabentimonas in 50 nm ps nanobeads was behind the enhancement of was hydrolysis figs 2b and 4h the relative abundance of sulfurovum was increased from 22 0 2 7 in the control to 27 8 2 3 in the ps 1 μm assay however the composition of dominant populations in ps 1 μm and ps 10 μm tests was similar to that in the control indicating that the ps mps tested did not substantially shape the core microbiome of digested sludge this result might explain the observation of similar methane production in these tests during 30 day ad 3 7 nanoplastics shaped archaeal core microbiome the archaeal communities of digested sludge were distinctly different from was and ads fig 4d and e euryarchaeota crenarchaeota and nanoarchaeaeota were the predominant phyla in digested samples fig 4f and i the dominating genera in digested samples comprised candidatus methanofastidiosum methanobacterium methanomassiliicoccus and methanobrevibacter among which candidatus methanofastidiosum presented a vastly superior fig 4j candidatus methanofastidiosum as a fastidious methyl reducing methanogen dominated the methanogenesis pathway in this work nobu et al 2016 the prominent microbiomes in the sds dispersion test belonged to candidatus methanofastidiosum 72 4 4 5 and methanobacterium 10 4 2 9 in comparison the presence of ps nps significantly reduced the relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum 61 0 4 6 p 0 05 exposure of 1 μm ps microbeads reduced the relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum 44 7 6 7 and methanobacterium 5 7 0 7 compared to that in the control whereas no significant difference in cumulative methane production was observed between the control and ps 1 μm tests fig 1h and table s2 p 0 05 the abundance of methanogens is not the only determinant in boosting methane production electron donor accessibility and the expression level of mcra gene encoding methyl coenzyme m reductase are also two pivotal criteria affecting the methanogenesis of sludge chen et al 2021 in addition the increased f420 activity might favor the methanogenesis from was under ps mps 1 μm exposure fig 3e candidatus methanofastidiosum was enriched in the sludge samples of ps 10 μm as compared with the control and the relative abundance of methanobacterium decreased from 14 6 4 4 in the control test to 9 0 1 2 this result revealed that the methanogenesis pathway of methylated thiol reduction was further intensified by 10 μm ps mps 3 8 plastics exposure altered interspecies co occurrence networks ps nps and mps induced different correlation patterns in bacterial community assemblies fig 5 a e the network in the ps 50 nm assay comprised 140 positive correlations and 88 negative correlations both of which were the lowest of all assays otu 1 sulfurovum had an overwhelming superiority of 19 30 in the ps 50 nm test presenting negative correlations with otus 39 5 97 and 103 related to hydrolysis and acidification processes the decreased relative abundance of otu 1 sulfurovum might be in favor of the enrichment of otus 39 5 97 and 103 which was supported by the evidence that 50 nm ps nps increased the relative abundance of mariniphaga candidatus microthrix brevefilum and perlabentimonas fig 4h although otu 31 leptospira 0 98 of spirochaete and otu 36 leptolinea 0 47 and otu 39 brevefilum 0 51 of chloroflexi were in low relative abundances their relatively high positive correlation with other otus indicated that these otus might play important roles in was digestion under exposure to 50 nm ps nps the results of the bacterial community and co occurrence network in the ps 50 nm test were mutually evidence which provided a reasonable explanation for the enhancement of acidogenesis under nps exposure the interspecies co occurrence network structure was more complex in ps microbeads 1 and 10 μm than that in the control fig 5a d f more complex network structures of digested sludge exposed to ps mps could be a potential inducement for undifferentiated ad performance between these two tests and the control because the biodiversity of interaction types can effectively enhance ecosystem stability by increasing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to environmental changes isbell et al 2015 mougi and kondoh 2012 the empirical network in archaeal communities exposed to 50 nm ps nanobeads was the most complicated of all assays with positive and negative connections of 118 and 96 respectively fig 5g l compared to the abundance of otus the network analysis in the ps 50 nm test based on dominant genera top 50 was less complex and could directly reflect interspecific relationships in the archaea community fig s2 candidatus methanofastidiosum was negatively correlated with methanobrevibacter possibly suggesting that the decreased relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum might motivate the action of methanobrevibacter in the presence of ps nps ps mps 1 μm and 10 μm exposure increased the proportion of negative correlation as compared with the control and no distinct difference of positive correlations was observed candidatus methanofastidiosum was negatively correlated with methanosphaera and candidatus nitrososphaera in the control however the keystone species turned out to be methanobacterium in the ps 1 μm test positively correlated with methanomassiliicoccus and methanosaeta the results consistently showed that the relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum dramatically decreased in the presence of 1 μm ps microbeads a negative correlation between candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanobrevibacter and a positive correlation between methanosaeta and candidatus methanomethylicus were constructed in the ps 10 μm test it could be inferred that the methylotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum and candidatus methanomethylicus and acetoclastic methanosaeta methanogens appeared to dominate the methanogenesis in ps 10 μm assay zhou et al 2020 3 9 nanoplastics reduced the abundance of functional genes ht qpcr analyses for assessing and quantifying the genetic potential of microbiota in element cycling showed that the abundant genes were chiefly involved in nitrogen recycling and carbon fixation with absolute quantities ranging in 1 1 1 4 105 and 5 5 9 0 104 copies ng dna respectively fig 6 b the presence of 50 nm ps nps reduced the number of genes involved in carbon c degradation and fixation methane metabolism as well as nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s cycles it should be noted that the abundance of mcra encoding a key enzyme associated with methane production was only 54 4 of the control test fig 6a and table s8 ermler et al 1997 these results might well interpret the inhibiting effect of 50 nm ps nps on methane production during the 30 day bmp test fig 1h significantly the opposite result was observed in the ps 1 μm test and is justified although the relative abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanobacterium decreased under exposure to 1 μm ps microbeads the cumulative methane production was similar to the control test figs 1h and 4j all tested groups shared the same abundant genes of gdha nirs1 acsa nifh nirs2 and urec which were mostly related to n recycling except for gene acsa associated with carbon fixation fig 6a compared with the control group ps nps of 50 nm significantly reduced the abundance of lig naglu xyla and gcd encoding lignin peroxidase α n acetylglucosaminidase xylose isomerase and quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase respectively as well as phnk involved in the phosphorus cycle p 0 05 fig 6c the putative phosphonate transport system atp binding protein encoded by phnk is used for nutrient uptake metabolite release and signal transduction thus mediating c n and p cycles wang et al 2017 the results that nps reduced the number of the genes involved in c n and p metabolisms were consistent with decreases in the relative abundance of the foremost genera sulfurovum and candidatus methanofastidiosum participating in the carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycles fig 4h and j we extrapolated from these results that excessive oxidative stress induced by ps nps was toxic to intracellular lipids proteins and some intermediates leading to more apoptosis which may provide some explanation for the decreased abundance of relevant functional genes table s8 mu and chen 2011 wei et al 2019c the presence of 1 μm ps microbeads significantly increased the abundance of napa encoding nitrate reductase as compared to the control p 0 01 fig 6d this observation was consistent with the increased relative abundance of sulfurovum observed in the ps 1 μm test moreover there was no significant difference in the absolute abundance of other genes between these two tests p 0 05 compared with the control ps microbeads of 10 μm significantly reduced the absolute abundances of bpp and gcd involved in the phosphorus cycle fig 6e the abundance of urec was the opposite p 0 05 reduction of gcd abundance might be manifested as decreased glycolysis capacity which provided direct evidence for the inhibition of sludge acidification by 10 μm ps microbeads fig 2c 4 conclusion this work was the first to comprehensively evaluate the effects of ps nps and mps exposure on anaerobic microbiome assembly and metabolic function compared with mps ps nps of 50 nm might well restrain acidogenic activity thus inhibiting methane production during the 30 day bmp test oxidative stress was the key contributor to the observed toxicity of ps nps rather than leachates and styrene monomers the reduction in the number of genes associated with carbon degradation and fixation methane metabolism especially mcra n p and s cycles and the relative abundance of sulfurovum candidatus methanofastidiosum and methanobacterium well interpreted the reduced methane production in the ps 50 nm test the enrichment of mariniphaga candidatus microthrix brevefilum and perlabentimonas in the ps 50 nm assay accounted for the enhancement of was hydrolysis several critical attributes of nps and mps must be addressed before expanding our findings to practical ecological risk assessment in the natural environment first only commercially available and spherical ps nps and mps were used in this work however the complicated treatment processes in the natural environment could alter the shape and behavior of nps and mps thus resulting in different effects besides the concentration of ps nps and mps was far beyond the actual scene it is necessary to develop advanced equipment to overcome the limitations of the analysis and conduct more research on the properties of nps and mps in environmental samples this study makes important advances on assessment of the effects of nps and mps on catabolism of key microbial communities and the interaction

applications such as water treatment in this work we demonstrate that the water permeation through the laminar and electrically conductive mxene membrane can be facilely modulated with electric field by applying a negative voltage of a few volts on the membrane the water permeation rate was enhanced by 70 times density functional theory calculations and experimental characterizations suggest that the enhancement arises from the enhanced water mxene interaction under electric field which manifests itself as enhanced hydrophilicity of the mxene nanosheets along with the facilitated water permeation the rejection rate to dyes of the membrane was kept at a relatively high level which was 93 1 to congo red and 94 8 to aniline blue under an applied voltage of 3 v showing the potential for dye separation and water purification considering that there has been increasing interest in utilizing mxene for separations and water treatment this work should inspire a range of future works in the related area to improve the membrane performance with external stimuli graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mxene water permeation water treatment water transport electrical modulation 1 introduction manipulating the water transport through nanochannels nanopores is important in a broad range of applications such as water treatment membrane separation and energy conversion hou 2016 liu et al 2016 for example in membrane applications it is desired that the membrane s permeation properties can quickly adapt to changing operation and environmental conditions in addition it is also often highly favored that under the excitation of environmental stimuli the permeation rate can be enhanced as a result the recent decades have seen growing interest in developing smart membranes that can modulate water transport in response to a wide range of stimuli including temperature liu et al 2017 2019 ph zhu et al 2018 light wang et al 2019 mechanical pressure hou et al 2015 sheng et al 2018 ions huang et al 2020 magnetic field liu et al 2022 sheng et al 2020 and electric field tabassian et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 among these stimuli electric field is particularly interesting because it can be facilely and precisely controlled and is often easy to implement clearly to make the best use of the electric field for controlled water permeation a membrane should satisfy the following conditions 1 the membrane or the backbone of the membrane should be electrically conductive 2 ideally the membrane should have high surface to volume ratio so that the electric field can influence as many water molecules as possible in this regard laminar membranes constructed with two dimensional 2d materials have unique advantages gao et al 2017 some 2d materials including graphene and mxene nanosheets are conductive for example the high conductivity of the mxene materials is attracting growing interest ghidiu et al 2014 huang et al 2022 li et al 2017 shahzad et al 2016 in addition the uniform interlayer spacings in the laminar membrane form densely packed and interconnected nanochannels bai et al 2022 gao et al 2017 imparting the membrane with high surface to volume ratio in fact the height of the spacings is typically in the sub nanometer scale gao et al 2018 lao et al 2018 2020 raidongia and huang 2012 comparable to the size of a single water molecule this means that once an electric field is applied on the 2d nanosheets every water molecule will be strongly influenced paving the way for facile electrical modulation of water transport such modulation also has great technical potential particularly when considering that 2d laminar membranes have been widely recognized as promising next generation separation membranes abraham et al 2017 chen et al 2017 ding et al 2020 huang et al 2013 joshi et al 2014 xie et al 2019 especially there have been increasing research interests in developing 2d mxene based membranes for applications such as water purification pervaporation desalination and molecular separation showing their great prospects in water industry al hamadani et al 2020 castro muñoz 2020 2022 li et al 2020 it is expected that by combining with external stimuli such as electric field the performance of the membrane might be further improved recently zhou et al developed a method to gate the water transport through graphene oxide membrane they made the membrane electrically conductive by introducing conductive filaments and used electrical current to block water transport by ionizing the water molecules zhou et al 2018 this study shows the potential to modulate water transport through 2d membranes with electrical stimuli however in many applications enhancing instead of blocking water transport is preferred in this work we report that with a simply prepared ti3c2tx mxene membrane which is intrinsically conductive water permeation can be facilely achieved and enhanced by 70 times with a negative voltage of only a few volts by density functional theory calculations and experimental verification we propose that the enhanced water transport is attributed to the increased water mxene interaction under electric field which helps water entering the interlayer spacings of the laminar mxene film meanwhile the rejection rate of dye can be kept at a relatively high value indicating a potential platform of smart membrane for controlled water transport and separation purification 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of mxene membrane 0 8 g lif was slowly added into 10 ml hcl solution 3 m the mixture was stirred for 25 30 min to completely dissolve the lif then 0 3 g ti3alc2 powder was gradually added into the mixture within 20 min under stirring in a 37 c water bath and was then kept at 37 c for 24 h the reacted mixture was then washed with deionized di water via centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 5 min the centrifugation was repeated until the ph of the supernatant reached about 6 after that the sediment was collected diluted with di water and was subject to ultrasonication in ice bath for 20 min to exfoliate the etched powder into mxene nanosheets the dispersion of the nanosheets was filtrated under vacuum on a porous polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf support to obtain the laminar mxene membrane then the laminar membrane was dried in a vacuum drier at 30 c for 2 h for further experiments 2 2 characterization the cross sectional morphology of mxene membrane was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem jsm 7800f operated at 10 kv x ray diffraction xrd was carried out on a d8 advance x ray diffractometer atomic force microscopy afm images were obtained using an agilent 5400afm system raman spectrum was recorded by a nicolet 5700 raman spectrometer fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum was performed on a nicolet 6700 ftir spectrometer the contact angle was measured on a contact angle meter biolin scientific theta lite 2 3 electric field modulated water permeation the as prepared laminar mxene membrane was used to conduct the permeation experiment on a homemade filtration device for a brief description the membrane was placed and tightly clipped between two filter cups water containing 0 01 m nacl feed solution was added into the upper filter cup and a glass beaker was placed under the lower filter cup to collect the solution permeated through the membrane permeate solution for electric field modulated water permeation a working electrode was connected to the mxene membrane and the counter electrode was placed in the feed solution to apply a direct current voltage between feed solution and mxene membrane the voltage was generated by a source measure unit smu instrument sourcemeter keithley s series 2400 and the corresponding current was recorded by the instrument 2 4 dye separation during electric field facilitated water permeation for separation experiments different dyes such as congo red and aniline blue were added into the feed solution and then electric field modulated water permeation was carried out after that the concentration of dyes in the permeate solution was measured using uv vis spectrophotometer beijing puxi t9 by comparing with the original dye concentration of feed solution the related separation efficiency can be concluded the dyes were used as received their characteristic information including molecular weight molecular radius and charge have been listed in table s1 in detail 2 5 density functional theory calculations density functional theory as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp was employed to optimize the geometry structures for mxene the exchange correlation interactions were described by the generalized gradient approximation gga in the form of the perdew burke ernzerhof functional pbe nci analysis was carried out employing multiwfn package and visualized through vmd software details can be found in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 electric field modulated water permeation the membrane was fabricated by vacuum filtration of ti3c2tx nanosheets on a porous pvdf polymer support ti3c2tx is a highly conductive 2d material belonging to the family of mxene naguib et al 2011 2014 where tx represents terminal groups on the 2d nanosheets including oh f and o ti3c2tx nanosheets were fabricated by etching the bulk ti3c2al powder followed by exfoliation lao et al 2018 2020 the successful exfoliation was confirmed by both afm and raman characterization figure s1 and s2 ftir spectrum showed the characteristic peaks of oh co and c o figure s3 confirming the existence of oxygen containing terminal groups these groups make the nanosheets relatively hydrophilic and easy to disperse in water after filtration we carried out the cross sectional sem characterization of the mxene membrane optical image in figure s4a which showed the layered structure fig 1 a and figure s4b formed by the stacking of mxene nanosheets xrd pattern showed that the interlayer spacing of the membrane was 0 6 nm in hydrated state fig 1b and schematic illustration in fig 1c after subtracting the monolayer thickness of mxene in the hydrated state the spacing can accommodate around two layers of water molecules fig 1c meaning that almost every interlayer water molecule is in contact with the mxene nanosheets such configuration allows direct electrical modulation of all water molecules a remarkable advantage over conventional porous membranes we then mounted the mxene membrane together with the supporting polymer layer in a filter device schematically illustrated in fig 1d the filter device was placed in ambient condition without applying any external pressure the thickness of the mxene membrane was typically 30 μm as shown by the sem image in figure s4b the feed side was filled with aqueous solution of nacl 0 01 m the solution was typically 11 cm high nacl salt was added in the solution to increase the conductivity of water so that the electrical voltage was not dissipated in water in fact in practical water treatment process there are always a significant number of salts or other charged molecules to make the solution conductive direct current voltage was applied between feed solution and mxene membrane to modulate the water permeation and the working electrode was connected to the membrane fig 1d and the current generated during the process was recorded correspondingly because of the hydrophilicity of the mxene nanosheets water can permeate into the interlayer spacings we then collected the permeated water with a beaker to measure the permeation rate to observe how electric voltage modulate the water permeation we varied the voltage applied on the mxene membrane from 0 v to 6 v the results are presented in fig 2 in fig 2a we plotted the amount of permeated water versus time for 0 v 3 v and 5 v applied voltage it can be clearly seen that as the magnitude of voltage increased the amount of permeated water increased dramatically for a better comparison we summarized the change of permeation rate along with variable voltage fig 2b for 0 v the water flux was 1 6 l m 2 h 1 for 3 v the flux increased to 21 1 l m 2 h 1 13 times higher than that of 0 v when the voltage was switched off the permeation rate dramatically decreased figure s5 such process could be repeated figure s6 for 5 v the water flux increased to the maximum value of 111 2 l m 2 h 1 70 times higher than that for 0 v however at higher voltage 6 v the permeation rate started to decrease due to the electrolysis of water that produced gas bubbles to impede water transport this is similar to the phenomenon observed on a graphene oxide membrane inserted with conductive filaments in a previous study zhou et al 2018 yet the dramatic enhancement of water permeation rate for 5 v and beyond presented here is in stark contrast to that study the power consumption during the electric field modulated water permeation was also estimated figure s7 showing a small value of a few mw to better confirm that the electric field enhanced water permeation is due to the mxene membrane the water permeation property of the pvdf support was also investigated as shown in figure s8 the porous pvdf support owns a thickness of 98 µm and an average pore size of about 3 6 µm exhibiting a water contact angle of 0 figure s8d without the mxene membrane on top the pvdf support showed a high water flux of 221 0 l m 2 h 1 figure s9 however it has neglectable response when voltage was applied figure s9 suggesting the dominating role of mxene membrane in the electric field modulation 3 2 mechanism of the enhanced water permeation we speculate that the enhanced water permeation under negative voltage might result from an enhanced water mxene interaction compared to graphene oxide mxene is less hydrophilic due to the existence of fluoride on the nanosheets enhancing the water mxene should help water entering the interlayer spacings and as a result enhances the water permeation rate to verify our speculation we conducted ab initio density functional theory dft calculations to probe how electric field affect the water mxene interaction it is challenging to apply external electric field in dft calculations however we can impose additional charges to the mxene nanosheets to generate an effective electric field the surface of mxene was terminated by oh functional groups and the unit cell was constructed using structural parameters according to previous report wu et al 2019 a 3 3 supercell has been used two possible adsorption sites site 1 and 2 see fig 3 a and s10 respectively of water molecule adsorbed on the bare mxene surface were considered because of the symmetry of the structure the calculations table s2 s3 and figure s10 show that water molecules prefer to adsorb on site 1 fig 3a consequently site 1 was chosen as the theoretical model for the subsequent calculation in this model water molecules tend to adopt a configuration with oxygen atom oriented toward hydrogen atoms in oh group of the surface fig 3a in this way strong interaction may happen between oxygen and hydrogen atoms lowering adsorption energies then one negative charge was added to the current adsorption model to compare the possible changes in adsorption energies the results are summarized in fig 3b note that the value of adsorption energy can only reveal the qualitative trends of adsorption behavior nevertheless the results clearly show that after addition of negative charges which happens when negative voltage is applied on the nanosheets the adsorption energy of water on mxene increases in addition to adsorption energy calculation bader charge population analysis was carried out to further explain the interactions between adsorbed water molecules and the surface of mxene yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 generally more charge transfer means stronger interactions existing between surfaces and adsorbed molecules as a result based on bader charge population analysis we can see that the added charges exerted influence on the charge transfer between water molecules and surfaces especially on oxygen atom which was closer to the surface the transferred charge increased from 1 283 to 1 320 the detailed data were presented in table s4 furthermore the weak interactions between water molecules and mxene surfaces can be visualized directly through noncovalent interaction nci analysis johnson et al 2010 lu and chen 2012 strong interactions between the oxygen atoms in water and the nearest hydrogen atoms in mxene surface were revealed indicating that hydrogen bonds may form during the adsorption process fig 3c moreover obvious interactions existed between oxygen atoms and adjacent hydrogen atoms of mxene surface contributing to stable adsorption of water molecules besides the interactions are significantly enhanced after addition of charges fig 3c and 3d which is in line with the adsorption energy results the theoretical analysis confirms the enhanced mxene water interaction when negative voltage is applied it is reasonable to expect that the enhanced interaction would facilitate the water permeation into the mxene interlayer spacings in the macroscopic scale enhanced material water interaction manifests itself as surface wettability de gennes et al 2004 the material exhibits higher hydrophilicity when the interaction is stronger fig 4 a with this in mind we carried out wettability measurements of the mxene membrane under electrical voltage fig 4b the results clearly show that when the voltage was more negative the contact angle of water on the membrane was smaller suggesting higher hydrophilicity at 0 v the contact angle was 66 3 upper inset in fig 4b at 3 v it decreased to 41 4 lower inset in fig 4b at 5 v it further decreased to 38 6 in channels the contact angle θ influences the laplace pressure p which is the pressure to pull water into the channel p 2 γ cos θ a where γ is the surface tension of water and a is the radius of the channel when θ changes from 66 3 to 38 6 the p increases by nearly two fold which should significantly enhance the water permeation it is worth noting that the above analysis is only a rough estimation because the laplace pressure cannot be accurately calculated in extremely narrow nanochannels and the contact angle measurement may also be inaccurate on a laminar membrane nevertheless the trend in wettability changes qualitatively supports our enhanced interaction mechanism from the above discussion one might expect that the mechanism should also be applicable to other conductive 2d layered materials indeed we tested a reduced graphene oxide membrane which is weakly conductive and found that similar electric field enhanced water permeation could be realized figure s11 however due to the much higher resistance of the reduced graphene oxide membrane the response was much weaker and the flux was dramatically lower it is worth noting that imparting the mxene nanosheets with surface charge might result in the expansion of interlayer spacing which would also lead to increased water flux we then performed dft calculations to investigate the interlayer expansion the results show that with a surface charge density of 1 c nm2 which is not low compared to most negatively charged materials the expansion was merely 0 1 å table s5 therefore we expect that the interlayer spacing should play a minor role 3 3 use in separation for membrane applications the separation performance is a key factor mxene membrane itself can be used for separation using the uniform and narrow interlayer spacings we therefore expect that during the voltage facilitated water permeation the mxene membrane should still have reasonable separation performance as a proof of concept demonstration we added congo red 20 mg l and aniline blue 50 mg l in water a voltage of 3 v was used to modulate the water permeation the results show that there were no obvious changes in the permeation rate after the dyes were added importantly most dye molecules were rejected during the permeation as proven by the colorless permeate solutions in the optical images in fig 5 a and 5b uv vis spectrum analysis further suggested that the rejection rate for congo red was 93 1 fig 5c and that for aniline blue was 94 8 fig 5d changing the voltage had a minor influence on the dye rejection performance figure s12 as a control experiment we also investigated the dye rejection performance of pure pvdf support probed with aniline blue 50 mg l solution as shown in figure s12 the support plays a neglectable role in rejecting dyes compared with other mxene based membranes and even other types of nanocomposite membranes reported previously al hamadani et al 2020 li et al 2020 castro muñoz et al 2021 the as prepared mxene membrane exhibits both high dye separation performance and high flux see table s6 in detail plus smart modulation this high rejection rate of dyes is because of the narrow interlayer spacings of the laminar membrane indicating the potential of this strategy for advanced water treatment and purification 4 conclusions in summary we developed a method to facilely modulate the water permeation through laminar mxene membrane with low electric voltage it was found that when 5 v voltage was applied on the membrane the water permeation rate increased by 70 times up to 111 2 l m 2 h 1 along with the voltage facilitated water permeation high rejection rate of dyes was achieved thanks to the narrow interlayer spacings of the membrane we note that many strategies can be employed to optimize the separation performance of mxene membrane including cation intercalation ding et al 2020 structure and surface engineering xie et al 2019 self crosslinking reaction lu et al 2019 combining these strategies with electric field modulation we expect to achieve enhanced water permeation with desired separation performance interestingly recent studies found that electric field can even enhance the separation performance of mxene membranes fan et al 2020 ren et al 2018 making such combination more promising it is worth noting that the dye rejection is only a demonstration of the molecular separation applications the electrically modulated mxene membranes could also be used for other separation applications such as heavy metal removal oil water separation organic solvent separation and even gas separation by exploiting the electrical response of the membrane to the separated or permeated molecules we therefore expect the current study to inspire future explorations on the electrically modulated membrane applications of mxene to contribute to the field of molecular separation and water treatment and may also inspire the development of other electrically responsive membranes

previous report wu et al 2019 a 3 3 supercell has been used two possible adsorption sites site 1 and 2 see fig 3 a and s10 respectively of water molecule adsorbed on the bare mxene surface were considered because of the symmetry of the structure the calculations table s2 s3 and figure s10 show that water molecules prefer to adsorb on site 1 fig 3a consequently site 1 was chosen as the theoretical model for the subsequent calculation in this model water molecules tend to adopt a configuration with oxygen atom oriented toward hydrogen atoms in oh group of the surface fig 3a in this way strong interaction may happen between oxygen and hydrogen atoms lowering adsorption energies then one negative charge was added to the current adsorption model to compare the possible changes in adsorption energies the results are summarized in fig 3b note that the value of adsorption energy can only reveal the qualitative trends of adsorption behavior nevertheless the results clearly show that after addition of negative charges which happens when negative voltage is applied on the nanosheets the adsorption energy of water on mxene increases in addition to adsorption energy calculation bader charge population analysis was carried out to further explain the interactions between adsorbed water molecules and the surface of mxene yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 generally more charge transfer means stronger interactions existing between surfaces and adsorbed molecules as a result based on bader charge population analysis we can see that the added charges exerted influence on the charge transfer between water molecules and surfaces especially on oxygen atom which was closer to the surface the transferred charge increased from 1 283 to 1 320 the detailed data were presented in table s4 furthermore the weak interactions between water molecules and mxene surfaces can be visualized directly through noncovalent interaction nci analysis johnson et al 2010 lu and chen 2012 strong interactions between the oxygen atoms in water and the nearest hydrogen atoms in mxene surface were revealed indicating that hydrogen bonds may form during the adsorption process fig 3c moreover obvious interactions existed between oxygen atoms and adjacent hydrogen atoms of mxene surface contributing to stable adsorption of water molecules besides the interactions are significantly enhanced after addition of charges fig 3c and 3d which is in line with the adsorption energy results the theoretical analysis confirms the enhanced mxene water interaction when negative voltage is applied it is reasonable to expect that the enhanced interaction would facilitate the water permeation into the mxene interlayer spacings in the macroscopic scale enhanced material water interaction manifests itself as surface wettability de gennes et al 2004 the material exhibits higher hydrophilicity when the interaction is stronger fig 4 a with this in mind we carried out wettability measurements of the mxene membrane under electrical voltage fig 4b the results clearly show that when the voltage was more negative the contact angle of water on the membrane was smaller suggesting higher hydrophilicity at 0 v the contact angle was 66 3 upper inset in fig 4b at 3 v it decreased to 41 4 lower inset in fig 4b at 5 v it further decreased to 38 6 in channels the contact angle θ influences the laplace pressure p which is the pressure to pull water into the channel p 2 γ cos θ a where γ is the surface tension of water and a is the radius of the channel when θ changes from 66 3 to 38 6 the p increases by nearly two fold which should significantly enhance the water permeation it is worth noting that the above analysis is only a rough estimation because the laplace pressure cannot be accurately calculated in extremely narrow nanochannels and the contact angle measurement may also be inaccurate on a laminar membrane nevertheless the trend in wettability changes qualitatively supports our enhanced interaction mechanism from the above discussion one might expect that the mechanism should also be applicable to other conductive 2d layered materials indeed we tested a reduced graphene oxide membrane which is weakly conductive and found that similar electric field enhanced water permeation could be realized figure s11 however due to the much higher resistance of the reduced graphene oxide membrane the response was much weaker and the flux was dramatically lower it is worth noting that imparting the mxene nanosheets with surface charge might result in the expansion of interlayer spacing which would also lead to increased water flux we then performed dft calculations to investigate the interlayer expansion the results show that with a surface charge density of 1 c nm2 which is not low compared to most negatively charged materials the expansion was merely 0 1 å table s5 therefore we expect that the interlayer spacing should play a minor role 3 3 use in separation for membrane applications the separation performance is a key factor mxene membrane itself can be used for separation using the uniform and narrow interlayer spacings we therefore expect that during the voltage facilitated water permeation the mxene membrane should still have reasonable separation performance as a proof of concept demonstration we added congo red 20 mg l and aniline blue 50 mg l in water a voltage of 3 v was used to modulate the water permeation the results show that there were no obvious changes in the permeation rate after the dyes were added importantly most dye molecules were rejected during the permeation as proven by the colorless permeate solutions in the optical images in fig 5 a and 5b uv vis spectrum analysis further suggested that the rejection rate for congo red was 93 1 fig 5c and that for aniline blue was 94 8 fig 5d changing the voltage had a minor influence on the dye rejection performance figure s12 as a control experiment we also investigated the dye rejection performance of pure pvdf support probed with aniline blue 50 mg l solution as shown in figure s12 the support plays a neglectable role in rejecting dyes compared with other mxene based membranes and even other types of nanocomposite membranes reported previously al hamadani et al 2020 li et al 2020 castro muñoz et al 2021 the as prepared mxene membrane exhibits both high dye separation performance and high flux see table s6 in detail plus smart modulation this high rejection rate of dyes is because of the narrow interlayer spacings of the laminar membrane indicating the potential of this strategy for advanced water treatment and purification 4 conclusions in summary we developed a method to facilely modulate the water permeation through laminar mxene membrane with low electric voltage it was found that when 5 v voltage was applied on the membrane the water permeation rate increased by 70 times up to 111 2 l m 2 h 1 along with the voltage facilitated water permeation high rejection rate of dyes was achieved thanks to the narrow interlayer spacings of the membrane we note that many strategies can be employed to optimize the separation performance of mxene membrane including cation intercalation ding et al 2020 structure and surface engineering xie et al 2019 self crosslinking reaction lu et al 2019 combining these strategies with electric field modulation we expect to achieve enhanced water permeation with desired separation performance interestingly recent studies found that electric field can even enhance the separation performance of mxene membranes fan et al 2020 ren et al 2018 making such combination more promising it is worth noting that the dye rejection is only a demonstration of the molecular separation applications the electrically modulated mxene membranes could also be used for other separation applications such as heavy metal removal oil water separation organic solvent separation and even gas separation by exploiting the electrical response of the membrane to the separated or permeated molecules we therefore expect the current study to inspire future explorations on the electrically modulated membrane applications of mxene to contribute to the field of molecular separation and water treatment and may also inspire the development of other electrically responsive membranes

15934,when facing wastewater with high organic and ammonia e g swine wastewater microbial electrolysis cell mec is emerging for energy extraction as hydrogen and methane however the effects of highly concentrated ammonia on mec haven t been fully evaluated in this study single chamber mecs were operated with acetate and sucrose as substrates under various ammonia concentrations the current generally increased with ammonia loading from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 yet the substrate consumption in mecs was inhibited with ammonia concentrations above 1000 mg l 1 as a combined result the energy recovery efficiency of mecs was stable the electrochemical activity of anode biofilm reached the peak under 1000 mg l 1 ammonia and was restricted under higher ammonia loadings under neutral ph the nh4 increases the cell membrane permeability which benefited the electrochemical activity of exoelectrogens to a proper extent nevertheless the toxic ammonia also accelerated the anode biomass loss and stimulated the extracellular polymeric substance eps secretion due to the current increase the abundance of exoelectrogens generally raised with ammonia loading from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 however except for anode biomass loss the carbon and methane metabolism pathways were inhibited in acetate fed mec while the glycolysis acted as the rate limiting step for substrate degradation in sucrose fed conditions this study systematically examined the influences of high ammonia loading on mec performances bio community and anode electrochemical activities and evaluated practical feasibility and application inch of mecs for the energy recovery and pollutant removal of high concentration organic and ammonia wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrolysis cell high ammonia loading hydrogen production bio electrochemical performance biofilm activity extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction with the continuous development of the economy and adjustment of agricultural structure in china yu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the scale of the livestock and poultry breeding industry developed rapidly and has become an important pillar of rural economic development accordingly a large amount of swine wastewater which contains highly concentrated organic matter and ammonia nitrogen would be produced from those large scale livestock farms ye et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 and pose a serious risk to the surrounding environment liu et al 2020 massalha et al 2020 therefore before being discharged to the environment the swine wastewater must be properly treated to meet the regulation of the receiving water in traditional processes aerobic biological technologies like sequencing batch reactor sbr and membrane bioreactor mbr have been widely used in the treatment of swine wastewater cheng et al 2020 yang et al 2016 xu et al 2019 however considering the high level of organic matter it is a more reasonable choice to recover the energy from the swine wastewater than completely eliminate contaminants as traditional processes do anaerobic bioreactors e g continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs yang et al 2016 hu et al 2019 anaerobic mbr jiang et al 2020 and up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb montes et al 2019 have been adopted to produce methane from the swine wastewater nevertheless the effluent of an anaerobic bioreactor often fails to meet the discharge standard and needs further treatment tian et al 2018 therefore aerobic treatment is generally followed in series which consumes a lot of energy to aerate and produces a large amount of excess sludge microbial electrolysis cell mec is a new microbial electrochemical technology to recover clean energy h2 from organic wastes the exoelectrogenic bacteria oxidize diverse forms of organic matter on the anode and produce hydrogen gas at cathode lu et al 2016 the mec technology demonstrated high energy conversion efficiency by taking advantage of the chemical energy from waste organics escapa et al 2016 to compensate the energy requirement of hydrogen evolution reaction her resulting in a lower external voltage demand of 0 2 0 6 v than that of the conventional electrohydrolysis hydrogen generation at 1 8 2 0 v logan et al 2008 compared with input energy the mecs have been reported to achieve an attractive energy output ratio of over 400 using organic waste after anaerobic digestion ad treatment hassanein et al 2017 with the cellobiose fermentation effluent the high energy efficiency of 220 30 was achieved in single chamber mecs with a hydrogen yield of 900 140 ml h2 g cod 1 lalaurette et al 2009 the mecs could also achieve higher hydrogen conversion efficiency from any organic substrate which makes it a competing technology among biohydrogen processes a superior h2 yield ratio from organics has been reported using mec 8 11 mol h2 mol 1 glucose a conversion rate of 67 91 compared with the dark fermentation process 2 5 mol h2 mol 1 glucose a conversion rate of 20 liang et al 2021 hence the mec process was an attractive alternative or complement of anaerobic methane production for higher efficiency energy conversion from greater proportion organics to reduce the organic load of subsequent stages and achieve an energy neutral hybrid process for livestock wastewater treatment however despite the advantages of mec for energy recovery from high organic concentration wastewater the effect of highly concentrated ammonia nitrogen in swine wastewater on mec operation is still questionable the toxicity of ammonia in wastewater is derived from the ionized ammonium nh4 and the free ammonia nh3 fan sprott et al 1986 calli et al 2005 the ionized ammonium nh4 dominative in neutral or acidic circumstances can combine with phosphate radical in the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane resulting in the increase of cell membrane permeability and the leakage of important cellular contents like phosphate nucleotides amino acids purine pyrimidine k etc przestalski et al 1991 zhong et al 2013 the dominant form of ammonia in alkaline circumstances was free ammonia nh3 which can directly penetrate the lipid bilayers of cell membranes as an uncharged small molecule the influx of nh3 depletes the protons inside the cells which results in the disruption of the acid base balance in the cell yenigün et al 2013 mahmoud et al 2017 therefore for the treatment of swine wastewater in mecs the influence of high ammonia nitrogen is non ignorable it has been verified in a previous study that the increase of fan to 0 37 g l 1 would slow the acetate oxidation by inhibiting the activities of anode respiring bacteria arb in dual chamber mecs mahmoud et al 2017 müller et al 2016 the electricity generation and acetate removal were significantly inhibited in a single chamber mfc when the initial total ammonia nitrogen tan increased from 84 mg l 1 to 4000 mg l 1 with the half maximum effective concentration ec50 for tan at 894 mg l 1 equivalent to 10 mg l 1 as nh3 nam et al 2010 in the process of swine wastewater treatment the anaerobic hydrolysis and fermentation of highly concentrated organic matters generally achieved a neutral or slightly acidic circumstance which limits the action of free ammonia therefore in this condition the way that the dominant ammonia ions nh4 affect the performances of energy conversion biogas production and function biofilm in mecs requires systemically investigation in this study single chamber mecs were tested by feeding synthetic swine wastewater with a fermentable substrate sucrose and an unfermentable substrate acetate their performances of hydrogen conversion cod removal and electrochemical characters were monitored under various ammonia nitrogen nh4 n loadings the influences of high ammonia nitrogen loading were compared under uncontrolled ph and controlled weak alkaline circumstances to evaluate its main toxic effects on mecs the functional community diversities of bacteria and methanogenic archaea were analyzed by 16s rrna the responses of anode biofilm under various ammonia concentrations were analyzed by the confocal laser scanning microscope clsm while the three dimension excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy eem determined the extracellular polymeric substance eps compositions the biomass changes of anode biofilm under various ammonia concentrations were further analyzed by protein assay the morphology anode biofilm was detected by scanning electron microscope sem these results will provide a profound understanding of the responses of mecs for the treatment of high organic and ammonia wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation the single chamber microbial electrolysis cells mecs were constructed from polycarbonate with an empty bed volume of 28 ml φ 3 0 cm l 4 cm fig s1 call et al 2008 the carbon brush φ 3 0 cm l 3 0 cm was performed as the anode electrode which was made by wringing graphite fiber 3 k toray into two twisted titanium wires li et al 2021 the double layer stainless steel mesh φ 3 8 cm 60 mesh type 304 was equipped as the cathode electrode before use the stainless steel mesh was cleaned in acetone ethanol absolute 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 and deionized water for 30 min to eliminate the oxide layer an external resistor r 10 ω was connected in series with the reactor for current i monitoring by collecting the voltage v at both ends of the resistor r the gas produced from the mec was collected in an aluminum foil bag 0 2 l haide china which was connected by a silicone plug and a syringe with the reactor the gas tightness of mecs was examined by the underwater pressure test before use twenty four mec reactors were inoculated with anaerobic sludge collected from a reclaimed water treatment station jinnan campus nankai university tianjin china the synthetic wastewater which simulated the swine wastewater condition after primary treatment contained 2 g l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 5 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 nacl 0 31 g l 1 nh4cl and 1 ml l 1 trace elements qin et al 2014 the sodium acetate and sucrose were used as the electron donors that represented unfermentable and fermentable substrates before injecting into mecs the influent was purged with n2 for 15 min to remove dissolved oxygen a terminal voltage of 0 9 v was applied to the mecs using a direct current dc power source hyk 60e12 hua yao china the positive pole of the dc power source was connected to the anode while the negative pole was connected to the cathode all those reactors were started with acetate in batch mode the anode was considered to be fully developed until the reproducible current curves were obtained for at least three cycles thereafter the substrate of twelve reactors was gradually switched to sucrose by two steps acetate sucrose 1 1 complete sucrose to make sure the adaptation of electrode biofilm to sucrose each step ended until three repeatable current curves were obtained since the degradation of fermentable substrate depends on the corporation of suspended bacteria and electrode biofilm cao et al 2020 a pre fermentation of influent at 30 c for 24 h with the continuous exogenous inoculation sludge supernatant was given to the sucrose fed reactors to ensure the effective decomposition of complex substrates by fermentative bacteria otherwise the capacity of the current generation and the activity of anode biofilm would gradually decline fig s2 after the mecs achieving repeatable cyclic current curves nh4cl was gradually added to the influent to adjust the initial total ammonia nitrogen tan loading to 80 mg l 1 control group s1 500 mg l 1 s2 1000 mg l 1 s3 1500 mg l 1 s4 2000 mg l 1 s5 and 3000 mg l 1 s6 and the reactors were steadily operated for several cycles under every ammonia concentration the reactors were operated in batch mode at a temperature of 30 c under a dark condition while the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 36 h the forms of ammonia nitrogen in water include ionized ammonium nh4 and free ammonia nh3 fan the nh4 nh3 equilibrium relationship between the two forms is as follows n h 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h fan concentrations were calculated by eq 1 he et al 2016 1 fan 17 14 tan 1 0 ph exp 6334 273 t 1 0 ph where fan mg nh3 n l 1 is the free ammonia concentration tan mg nh3 n l 1 is the total ammonia concentration and t c is the temperature of the electrolyte during the operation process the nh4 played a dominant role in neutral medium after the examination of high ammonia ion concentration to investigate the different effects between nh4 and nh3 under the high tan loading 3000 mg l 1 s7 an alkali chamber was equipped besides the mec from the anode side to adjust the final ph to 8 5 0 2 fig s3 which was separated with mec part by an anion exchange membrane aem 2 2 analytical methods the volumetric fractions of h2 and ch4 were analyzed using a gas chromatograph sp 2100a berfen ruili china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a packed chromatographic column tdx 01 3 m 3 mm zhong ke hui jie china the high purity argon gas was used as the carrier gas the temperatures of the column oven injector and tcd were set at 130 c 60 c and 180 c the chemical oxygen demand cod of liquid samples was measured by the heating digestion method using a cod reagent hach co co america and a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach co co america the ammonia nitrogen nh4 n was measured according to the standard method hj 535 2009 the ph and conductivity values were measured using a ph meter fe28 standard mettler toledo switzerland and a conductivity meter fe28 standard mettler toledo switzerland 2 3 electrochemical analysis electrochemical tests were performed in a three electrode system using an electrochemical workstation aut302n v metrohm switzerland the carbon brush anode was performed as the working electrode with a counter electrode of double layer stainless steel mesh and a reference electrode of saturated calomel electrode sce the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis tests were conducted with the frequency range from 100 khz to 0 01 hz and the amplitude of the applied sinusoidal voltage signal was 0 014 v wang et al 2016 the cyclic voltammetry cv tests under turnover condition with substrate and non turnover condition no substrate were conducted from 0 7 v to 0 2 v vs sce with the scanning rate of 1 mv s 1 2 4 microbial community analysis after steadily operating for at least three repeatable cycles under different ammonia loadings the biofilm samples of anodes and effluent were taken the carbon brush anode was first washed with sterile 50 mmol l 1 pbs the carbon fibers with biofilm were then cut off from the brush from three different points which were then homogeneously mixed in a sterile centrifuge tube the electrolyte of sucrose fed mecs was centrifuged with a rate of 8000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min and the precipitate was collected for biodiversity analysis as the sample of suspended bacteria supplementary information section s7 the calculation of predicted metabolic pathways of the microbial communities based on the 16s rrna gene sequences was conducted using the picrust2 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states program based on the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database on the majorbio cloud platform majorbio technology co ltd shanghai china li et al 2022 2 5 statistical analysis all the experiments were performed at least in triplicate reactors the standard deviation sd was calculated based on the average value of the tests the results were plotted with origin software 2021 the statistical package of ibm spss statistics version 26 0 was used to perform one way anova to compare the differences in the means of the variables between treatments the significance level was set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of mecs under different ammonia loadings the increase of ammonia concentration from 80 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 benefited the current generation of mec fig 1 a under the neutral ph range 7 1 0 5 as the ammonia loading increased the electrical conductivity ec of the electrolyte raised then the decreased solution resistance table s1 s2 improved the maximum current values from 4 9 0 3 ma to 8 5 0 4 ma yet when adjusting the ph of electrolyte to alkalescent 8 5 0 2 the great increase of fan concentration resulted in a rapid current decrease fig 1a s7 compared with the sucrose fed mecs the acetate fed mecs were more sensitive to the fan concentration fig 1a s7 similar results were previously reported that the 0 37 g l 1 fan could seriously slow the acetate oxidation by inhibiting the activities of arb in a glucose fed mec mahmoud et al 2017 the different effects of high ammonia wastewater under different ph 7 1 0 5 vs 8 5 0 2 indicate the higher toxicity of fan than ammonia ions on the activity of arb therefore when facing wastewater with high ammonia concentration the ph value of mec influent should be strictly adjusted to ensure the stable operation under high concentrations of ammonia and organic matter increasing the ammonia loading also inhibited the substrate removal of mecs fig 1b increasing the ammonia loading from 80 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 the cod removal efficiency of acetate fed mecs had an indistinctive change from 94 2 0 5 to 88 2 6 under relatively constant influent cod of 2010 67 mg l 1 nevertheless ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 greatly inhibited acetate oxidation with cod removal lower than 71 5 suggesting the acetate metabolic process of anode biofilm was affected this phenomenon was consistent with the previous research that 1000 mg l 1 tan contained 11 mg l 1 fan could inhibit the acetate utilization of anode attached bacteria in mfcs nam et al 2010 as the ammonia loading increased to 3000 mg l 1 the cod removal efficiency decreased to 57 4 with 860 80 mg l 1 residue in the effluent with the increase in ammonia loading from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 the quantity of electric charge generated in each cycle was stable while the cod removal declined fig s4 fig 1b correspondingly the c e continuously increased from 105 4 to 185 15 fig 1c 1 suggesting the hydrogen cycling was accompanied with high ammonia loading in single chamber mecs the expressions of hydrogen dehydrogenase and hydrogenase which were related to the redox of h2 and h in anaerobic bacteria also generally demonstrated an increased trend fig s5 the active harvesting method like negative pressure extraction could be applied for the rapid separation of the h2 produced from the mec otherwise the re consumption of h2 would increase the duration of the operation cycle and therefore leads to low h2 recovery lu et al 2016 the hydrogen production also decreased from 48 5 ml nh4 500 mg l 1 to 39 3 ml nh4 1000 mg l 1 when ammonia loading was higher than 1000 mg l 1 fig 1d similarly the methane production also greatly decreased at ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 from 6 1 ml nh4 500 mg l 1 to 2 2 0 6 ml nh4 1000 mg l 1 fig 1d the electrons for hydrogen electrolysis reaction at the cathode were produced by substrate oxidation at the anode while the nh4 oxidation on anode was ignored considering the very little loss of ammonia in one cycle table s1 s2 hence the decline of cod removal directly affected the biogas generation of mec with high ammonia loading with lower biogas generation the cathodic gas recovery r cat decreased with ammonia loading as well the energy recovery efficiencies based on electrical input η e and the summation of both the electricity and substrate inputs η e s were calculated by the total amount and combustion heat of hydrogen and methane with the increase of ammonia loading in acetate fed mecs η e showed a similar decreasing tendency as r cat from 170 13 to 120 8 indicating generally positive energy feedback could be achieved during this process despite the decreased energy recovery efficiency fig 1c 1 however the addition of ammonia didn t significantly affect the total energy recovery η e s which was attributed to the lower cod utilization ratio for sucrose fed mecs with higher ammonia resistance the cod removal kept relatively stable from 90 2 to 84 1 until the ammonia loading reached 2000 mg l 1 fig 1b since the electroactive bacteria usually preferred simple organics the degradation of sucrose was also dependent on other functional bacteria such as hydrolyzing bacteria and fermentative bacteria while the anode biofilm of acetate fed mecs was relatively simple with ammonia loading lower than 1500 mg l 1 the value of c e didn t significantly change for the stable cod removal and electricity generation in each cycle fig 1c 2 then with ammonia loading up to 2000 mg l 1 the electric quantity decreased in each cycle fig s4 and the cod removal was inhibited under ammonia loading of 3000 mg l 1 the cod removal was reduced to 54 5 with an effluent concentration of 880 90 mg l 1 therefore c e increased from 106 7 to 130 14 as the ammonia loading increased from 2000 to 3000 mg l 1 hydrogen production decreased with ammonia loading from 80 to 500 mg l 1 and then fluctuated in a range of 12 5 ml to 15 ml when ammonia loading was higher than 1000 mg l 1 yet the methane production did not show an obvious change compared with acetate fed mecs hydrogen production 18 6 ml in sucrose fed mecs was lower as a fermentable substrate the sucrose needs to be firstly fermented by functional bacteria the electrons released in this step were not involved in the current production which resulted in a significant decrease in electric quantity and a lower hydrogen production in sucrose reactors however more methane could be recovered 5 2 ml due to the relatively complex bacteria community in sucrose fed biofilm fig 1d fig s4 for long term operation of single chamber mec a variety of approaches such as low ph control hu et al 2008 temperature adjustment lu et al 2012 reduction of the hydraulic retention time call and logan 2008 specific methanogen inhibitors catal et al 2015 and negative pressure extraction lu et al 2016 could be used for increasing the hydrogen production the η e reduced from 130 20 to 90 11 fig 1c 2 hence the recovery of hydrogen and methane was only slightly higher than the electrical input with high ammonia loading in sucrose fed mecs 3 2 electrochemical characteristics of anodes under different ammonia loadings the eis and cv measurements were performed to investigate the internal resistance and electrochemical activity of anode biofilm under different ammonia loadings fig 2 the nyquist plots of eis analyses obtained with both acetate fed and sucrose fed anode biofilm showed two main arcs fig 2a b to determine the meaning of each arc a 300 ml larger electrolytic cell was used for anode eis tests with the graphic fibers of the brush fully stretched in this condition the first arc in the high frequency region almost disappeared which indicated that the first arc was likely to be a charge transfer resistance but limited by the substrate diffusion fig s6 considering the stratified anode biofilm for glucose oxidation with arb rich inner layer showed very similar electrochemical characters cao et al 2020 the similar nyquist plots of acetate fed and sucrose fed anode biofilm might also indicate their similar charge transfer processes from anode biofilm to electrode with the increase of the ammonia loading the rs decreased which resulted from the increase of the conductivity of the electrolyte the rct1 reduced and then vanished suggesting the higher ammonia loading was beneficial to obtain uniform electrolyte in the anode area however for acetate fed anodes the rct2 initially showed a decrease from 14 8 ω to 12 0 ω before ammonia loading reached 1000 mg l 1 and then increased to 16 4 ω under ammonia loading reached 3000 mg l 1 fig 2a c the rct2 of sucrose fed anode showed a similar trend fig 2b d in arb the electron mediators and oxidoreductases involved in metabolism and electron transport chains are abundant in the cytoplasm yet the lipopolysaccharide cytoderm retarded the extracellular electron transfer liu et al 2012 the combination of nh4 with the phosphate radical in the phospholipid bilayer could change the permeability and selectivity of the cell membrane which redistributed the nutrients and the metabolites and played a role in promoting metabolism to a certain extent smith et al 1987 with ammonia lower than 1000 mg l 1 the eps secretion was stimulated especially the protein secretion which may enhance the electroconductibility and reduce the internal resistance of the membrane borole et al 2011 marshall et al 2006 meanwhile the high conductivity of electrolytes may promote redox reactions on anodes which might in turn enhance the electrochemical performance of mes zhang et al 2012 guo et al 2018 nevertheless with ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 the adverse effects of ammonia ions appeared high salinity can cause the unbalance of osmotic stress across the cell membrane resulting in deleterious impacts by loss of water through osmosis vallero et al 2003 then the rct2 showed an upward trend instead under the turnover condition the results of cv tests fig 2e f showed the same variation trend as eis that is the imax table s3 of cv curves reached its maximum when the ammonia loading was 1000 mg l 1 the non turnover cv tests were conducted to investigate the extracellular electron transfer features of anode biofilm with the substrate free solution to eliminate the redox effects of the substrate fig 2g h and table s4 the shape and redox peaks of non turnover cv curves with acetate fed and sucrose fed anode biofilm were similar the cv curve of acetate fed anode showed two clear redox peaks with ammonia loading lower than 1000 mg l 1 fig 2g the peak1 was centered at 0 45 0 04 v which was assigned to the mediated electron transfer met by endogenously secreted flavins xiao et al 2017 the peak2 centered at 0 37 0 02 v which indicated the direct electron transfer det by outer membrane c type cytochrome z omcz marsili et al 2008 however with the ammonia higher than 1000 mg l 1 a new redox peak peak3 appeared at 0 231 0 002 v which was responsible for the det process through outer membrane c type cytochrome a omca li et al 2020 for sucrose fed anodes with ammonia loading of 80 mg l 1 three pairs of redox peaks were shown in the non turnover cv plots fig 2h the peak1 centered at 0 505 v was linked to the met of flavins the peak2 at 0 42 0 02 v was the det of omcz and the peak3 at 0 31 0 04 v was related to the combination of flavins and outer membrane c type cytochromes om c cyts xiao et al 2017 however with ammonia loading higher than 500 mg l 1 the met redox peak peak1 directly involved by flavins disappeared indicating that the flavins dependent electron transfer process was reduced in response to the stimulation of ammonia 3 3 the effects of ammonia loading on anode biofilm activity and eps secretion the morphology features of anode biofilm were characterized by sem under the normal condition nh4 80 mg l 1 the dark red biofilm was closely attached to the graphic fibers with the increase of ammonia loading from 80 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 the anode biofilm became thicker fig 3 s7 yet a serious biomass loss was then observed on acetate fed anodes with ammonia higher than 1500 mg l 1 parts of the graphic fibers were almost exposed in the images fig 3 s7 and s8 for sucrose fed anodes the high ammonia loading didn t cause the biomass loss on the anode fig 3 s7 and s8 under 15 000 times magnification the morphology features of acetate fed and sucrose fed biofilm showed great differences fig 3 under ammonia loading of 80 mg l 1 the eps of biofilm was very limited and the individual cells were visible the bacteria were then covered with eps under higher ammonia loading up to 1000 mg l 1 which may be attributed to the stress reaction of cells to toxic compounds after that the differences appeared again in acetate fed and sucrose fed biofilm under ammonia loading higher than 1500 mg l 1 fig 3 the bacteria cells in the acetate fed biofilm were gradually exposed again while the sucrose fed biofilm still had a high amount of eps around the cells which explained the different tolerance of acetate fed and sucrose fed biofilm on high ammonia loading fig 1 the clsm was further performed to observe the biofilm characteristics fig 4 the abundance of living and dead cells was represented by the laser intensity fig 4c d for both acetate fed and sucrose fed mecs the intensities of both living and dead cells increased when ammonia loading increased from 80 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 the differences appeared again under ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 for acetate fed mecs the biomass loss was also observed with clsm fig 4a c during the operation the re inoculation didn t recover the biomass the proportion of dead cells gradually increased from 39 5 to 60 3 with the increase in ammonia loading from 500 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 fig 4c suggesting the negative effects of nh4 on microorganisms the total protein content per unit mass of electrode shows that the biomass of acetate fed anode increased from 16 2 mg g 1 to 21 3 mg g 1 when ammonia loading increased from 80 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 and then rapidly decreased to 13 1 mg g 1 when ammonia loading increased to 3000 mg l 1 fig s8 however for sucrose fed mecs with the increase in ammonia loading from 1000 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 the biomass on the anode kept stable despite the increase in the proportion of dead cells fig 4b d and s8 unlike the acetate fed mecs the sucrose fed anode biofilm required the collaborative metabolic of many functional bacteria the more complex microbial community may help to keep the biomass on sucrose fed anodes under high ammonia loading considering that the electrochemical activity of both acetate fed and sucrose fed mecs rapidly decreased with ammonia concentration 1000 mg l 1 the mec may better operate with ammonia loading lower than 1000 mg l 1 for stable performance the stress response of microorganisms to the stimulation of high concentrations of ammonia was studied by measuring eps secretion using clsm as well fig 5 three kinds of eps including α d glucopyranose polysaccharides α d glucopyranose ps red β d glucopyranose polysaccharides β d glucopyranose ps blue and protein green were cross linked together the initial intensities of those three kinds of eps were nearly equivalent fig 5c d the addition of ammonia stimulated the microbes to produce more carbohydrate and protein eps for acetate fed anodes the epss included α β d glucopyranose ps and protein significantly increased with ammonia loading below 1000 mg l 1 with ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 the decline of eps secretion revealed the serious inhibitory effects of ammonia fig 5a c the decrease of eps secretion might result in the exposure of electron transport sites omca in acetate fed anodes fig 2g for sucrose fed anodes ammonia significantly increased the amounts of polysaccharides and proteins a more complex and thicker biofilm may also help the sucrose fed anode biofilm to withstand higher ammonia concentrations hence with ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 the amount of eps remained at a high level fig 5b d the eps can store and provide nutrients for cells to maintain their activity and integrity in adverse environments the eps also keeps the cells tightly together and enhances the biofilm stability moreover in the process of substance transfer from solution to cell the compounds must pass through the eps layer first which reduces the damage caused by toxins for acetate fed anodes the lack of eps protection under high ammonia loading caused a more rapid peak current decline than that of sucrose fed anodes in case of high ammonia loading and high ph more fan fig 1a however in sucrose fed anode biofilm while eps wrapped the cell to resist external stress the barrier also impeded the interspecific electron transfer process on the cell membrane fig 2h to deeply characterize the composition of eps the tightly bound eps tb eps loosely bound lb eps and soluble eps sol eps were severally extracted for the eem test fig 6 the tb eps extracted from the surface of acetate fed or sucrose fed anode biofilm showed a prominent peak peak1 at excitation emission ex em of 280 nm 304 nm which could be ascribed as soluble microbial metabolites mainly characterized as tyrosine proteins fig 6a with the increase of ammonia loading the change in the intensity of peak1 was consistent with the results of the clsm test on eps content fig 5 the lb eps were the same as those of tb eps fig 6b for sol eps of both acetate fed and sucrose fed effluent two more peaks appeared the peak2 ex em of 242 nm 277 nm and peak3 ex em of 421 nm 422 nm were identified as aromatic proteins and humic acid substances dai et al 2016 chen et al 2003 moreover the peak4 ex em of 248 nm 481 nm with small intensity could be observed in the effluent of sucrose fed mecs which belongs to fulvic acid like substances such as fulvic acid and hydrophobic acid fig 6c 3 4 microbial community analysis under different ammonia loadings with the increase in current the geobacter sp a kind of typical exoelectrogen reguera et al 2005 adhikari et al 2016 was greatly improved in abundance from 0 21 to 32 86 as the ammonia concentration increased from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 fig 7 s9 table s5 similarly the abundance of another exoelectrogen cloacibacillus zhang et al 2020 increased from 0 67 to 4 15 fig 7 s9 table s5 the total abundance of all the twelve exoelectrogen species abundance 1 also revealed a dramatic rise from 36 04 to 64 51 for mecs a higher abundance of exoelectrogens would produce higher current which in turn promoted the enrichment of exoelectrogens in the anode biofilm the microbial community of sucrose fed anode was more complex than that in the acetate fed anode fig s10 there are many species of fermentative bacteria such as macellibacteroides guo et al 2019 klebsiella zeng et al 1993 pleomorphomonas lu et al 2017 etc that occupied a large proportion in sucrose fed biofilm but they were not found in acetate fed biofilm nevertheless the total abundance of exoelectrogens was lower than that in acetate fed anodes due to the attachment of fermentative bacteria table s5 s6 both acetate and sucrose reactors can stably operate under 1000 mg l 1 of ammonia however the biofilm of the acetate fed anode was simple and dominated by exoelectrogens while that of the sucrose fed anode was more complex and stable due to the growth of fermentative bacteria on the electrode surface the sucrose fed reactors demonstrated higher tolerance to ammonia in cod removal and biofilm stability due to their diverse biofilm with the increase of ammonia loading in the acetate fed mecs the expression of the functional gene of carbon metabolism declined which might result in the decrease in acetate consumption fig s11 fig 1b similarly the expression number of methane metabolism functional genes also decreased which resulted in the reduction of methane production the expression numbers of most pathways related to the polysaccharide metabolism were reduced in sucrose fed anode biofilm by the increased ammonia fig 8 the polysaccharide metabolism functional genes in the suspension also played an important role in the process of sucrose degradation which demonstrates no obvious variation tendency with the increase in ammonia loading nevertheless when only considering the expression of functional genes related to starch and sucrose metabolism a clear decline was observed in both anode biofilm and solution fig 8 when the sucrose amended media was pre fermented outside mecs the cod removal decreased with the increased ammonia loading confirming the negative effects of ammonia on sucrose fermentation fig s12 hence glycolysis might be the limiting step for sucrose fed mecs under high ammonia loading the archaea communities were tested to obtain the diversity of methanogens on sucrose fed anodes fig 9 the first three dominant genus species in sucrose fed mec reactors were methanocorpusculum methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter which were all known as typical hydrogenotrophic methanogens pisciotta et al 2012 yu et al 2020 their relatively high abundance indicated the methane in mecs in this work might be mainly produced by hydrogen trophic methanogens which resulted in the decline of hydrogen production under high ammonia concentrations the total abundance of methanogens didn t change significantly which might maintain the methane production in sucrose fed mecs it is worth noticing that the dominated methanogens changed from methanobacterium to methanocorpusculum under ammonia loading of 1000 mg l 1 the methanocorpusculum was reported to metabolize relatively complex compounds e g propanol butanol and acetate while the methanobacterium preferred simpler compounds e g formate hydrogen and carbon dioxide liu et al 2008 smith et al 1997 the acetotrophic methanogens were detected in this work fig 9 it has been reported that the acetotrophic methanogens e g methanosaetaceae and methanosarcinaceae were more sensitive to ammonia loading han et al 2015 song et al 2010 wang et al 2015 similar in this study the methanosaeta gradually also decreased with the ammonia loading increased from 80 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 mec demonstrates great advantages over the traditional biological treatment process in treating wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen a mec centered hybrid treatment process fig s13 might achieve high efficient energy recovery and pollutant removal to expedite the application of mec in treating swine wastewater further research needs to be carried out to promote coordination between the hydrolysis acidification process and anode respiring process to improve the synergetic degradation of organic matter the energy recovery efficiency of mec also needs to be improved by the optimization of reactor architecture the catalytic performance of electrodes and the efficient extraction of hydrogen furthermore other than the high concentration of ammonia there are also many other pollutants in swine wastewater such as antibiotics and heavy metals which may demonstrate co effects on mec with ammonia and require further investigation 4 conclusions this study focused on the effects of ammonia on electrochemical active biofilm in mecs for synthetic swine wastewater treatment results indicated that the increase of ammonia benefited the current generation of mecs under the neutral ph range but the cod consumption and hydrogen production were gradually inhibited with the increase in ammonia concentration from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 however the addition of ammonia didn t significantly affect the total energy recovery due to the decrease in cod consumption generally positive electric energy feedback could be achieved during this process the ammonia ions can increase the permeability of cell membrane in neutral ph while the proper increase of cell permeability benefited the electrochemical activity of bacteria in a range of 80 to 1000 mg l 1 the increase of ammonia could improve the electrochemical performance of both acetate fed and sucrose fed anodes both the minimum charge transfer resistance and the maximum current of cv curves were achieved at the ammonia concentration of 1000 mg l 1 in mecs the toxic nh4 stimulated the cells to secrete eps as self defense and caused biomass reduction when ammonia concentration increased the abundance of exoelectrogens raised up with the current nevertheless the carbon and methane metabolism pathways were inhibited in acetate fed mec while the glycolysis acted as the rate limiting step for substrate degradation in sucrose fed conditions the hydrogen trophic methanogens kept a high abundance in the anode biofilm and contributed to the stable methane production but the ammonia loadings higher than 1000 mg l 1 changed the dominant archaea from methanobacterium to methanocorpusculum this article provided a comprehensive study for the performance of mec in treating ammonia rich wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15934,when facing wastewater with high organic and ammonia e g swine wastewater microbial electrolysis cell mec is emerging for energy extraction as hydrogen and methane however the effects of highly concentrated ammonia on mec haven t been fully evaluated in this study single chamber mecs were operated with acetate and sucrose as substrates under various ammonia concentrations the current generally increased with ammonia loading from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 yet the substrate consumption in mecs was inhibited with ammonia concentrations above 1000 mg l 1 as a combined result the energy recovery efficiency of mecs was stable the electrochemical activity of anode biofilm reached the peak under 1000 mg l 1 ammonia and was restricted under higher ammonia loadings under neutral ph the nh4 increases the cell membrane permeability which benefited the electrochemical activity of exoelectrogens to a proper extent nevertheless the toxic ammonia also accelerated the anode biomass loss and stimulated the extracellular polymeric substance eps secretion due to the current increase the abundance of exoelectrogens generally raised with ammonia loading from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 however except for anode biomass loss the carbon and methane metabolism pathways were inhibited in acetate fed mec while the glycolysis acted as the rate limiting step for substrate degradation in sucrose fed conditions this study systematically examined the influences of high ammonia loading on mec performances bio community and anode electrochemical activities and evaluated practical feasibility and application inch of mecs for the energy recovery and pollutant removal of high concentration organic and ammonia wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrolysis cell high ammonia loading hydrogen production bio electrochemical performance biofilm activity extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction with the continuous development of the economy and adjustment of agricultural structure in china yu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the scale of the livestock and poultry breeding industry developed rapidly and has become an important pillar of rural economic development accordingly a large amount of swine wastewater which contains highly concentrated organic matter and ammonia nitrogen would be produced from those large scale livestock farms ye et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 and pose a serious risk to the surrounding environment liu et al 2020 massalha et al 2020 therefore before being discharged to the environment the swine wastewater must be properly treated to meet the regulation of the receiving water in traditional processes aerobic biological technologies like sequencing batch reactor sbr and membrane bioreactor mbr have been widely used in the treatment of swine wastewater cheng et al 2020 yang et al 2016 xu et al 2019 however considering the high level of organic matter it is a more reasonable choice to recover the energy from the swine wastewater than completely eliminate contaminants as traditional processes do anaerobic bioreactors e g continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs yang et al 2016 hu et al 2019 anaerobic mbr jiang et al 2020 and up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb montes et al 2019 have been adopted to produce methane from the swine wastewater nevertheless the effluent of an anaerobic bioreactor often fails to meet the discharge standard and needs further treatment tian et al 2018 therefore aerobic treatment is generally followed in series which consumes a lot of energy to aerate and produces a large amount of excess sludge microbial electrolysis cell mec is a new microbial electrochemical technology to recover clean energy h2 from organic wastes the exoelectrogenic bacteria oxidize diverse forms of organic matter on the anode and produce hydrogen gas at cathode lu et al 2016 the mec technology demonstrated high energy conversion efficiency by taking advantage of the chemical energy from waste organics escapa et al 2016 to compensate the energy requirement of hydrogen evolution reaction her resulting in a lower external voltage demand of 0 2 0 6 v than that of the conventional electrohydrolysis hydrogen generation at 1 8 2 0 v logan et al 2008 compared with input energy the mecs have been reported to achieve an attractive energy output ratio of over 400 using organic waste after anaerobic digestion ad treatment hassanein et al 2017 with the cellobiose fermentation effluent the high energy efficiency of 220 30 was achieved in single chamber mecs with a hydrogen yield of 900 140 ml h2 g cod 1 lalaurette et al 2009 the mecs could also achieve higher hydrogen conversion efficiency from any organic substrate which makes it a competing technology among biohydrogen processes a superior h2 yield ratio from organics has been reported using mec 8 11 mol h2 mol 1 glucose a conversion rate of 67 91 compared with the dark fermentation process 2 5 mol h2 mol 1 glucose a conversion rate of 20 liang et al 2021 hence the mec process was an attractive alternative or complement of anaerobic methane production for higher efficiency energy conversion from greater proportion organics to reduce the organic load of subsequent stages and achieve an energy neutral hybrid process for livestock wastewater treatment however despite the advantages of mec for energy recovery from high organic concentration wastewater the effect of highly concentrated ammonia nitrogen in swine wastewater on mec operation is still questionable the toxicity of ammonia in wastewater is derived from the ionized ammonium nh4 and the free ammonia nh3 fan sprott et al 1986 calli et al 2005 the ionized ammonium nh4 dominative in neutral or acidic circumstances can combine with phosphate radical in the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane resulting in the increase of cell membrane permeability and the leakage of important cellular contents like phosphate nucleotides amino acids purine pyrimidine k etc przestalski et al 1991 zhong et al 2013 the dominant form of ammonia in alkaline circumstances was free ammonia nh3 which can directly penetrate the lipid bilayers of cell membranes as an uncharged small molecule the influx of nh3 depletes the protons inside the cells which results in the disruption of the acid base balance in the cell yenigün et al 2013 mahmoud et al 2017 therefore for the treatment of swine wastewater in mecs the influence of high ammonia nitrogen is non ignorable it has been verified in a previous study that the increase of fan to 0 37 g l 1 would slow the acetate oxidation by inhibiting the activities of anode respiring bacteria arb in dual chamber mecs mahmoud et al 2017 müller et al 2016 the electricity generation and acetate removal were significantly inhibited in a single chamber mfc when the initial total ammonia nitrogen tan increased from 84 mg l 1 to 4000 mg l 1 with the half maximum effective concentration ec50 for tan at 894 mg l 1 equivalent to 10 mg l 1 as nh3 nam et al 2010 in the process of swine wastewater treatment the anaerobic hydrolysis and fermentation of highly concentrated organic matters generally achieved a neutral or slightly acidic circumstance which limits the action of free ammonia therefore in this condition the way that the dominant ammonia ions nh4 affect the performances of energy conversion biogas production and function biofilm in mecs requires systemically investigation in this study single chamber mecs were tested by feeding synthetic swine wastewater with a fermentable substrate sucrose and an unfermentable substrate acetate their performances of hydrogen conversion cod removal and electrochemical characters were monitored under various ammonia nitrogen nh4 n loadings the influences of high ammonia nitrogen loading were compared under uncontrolled ph and controlled weak alkaline circumstances to evaluate its main toxic effects on mecs the functional community diversities of bacteria and methanogenic archaea were analyzed by 16s rrna the responses of anode biofilm under various ammonia concentrations were analyzed by the confocal laser scanning microscope clsm while the three dimension excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy eem determined the extracellular polymeric substance eps compositions the biomass changes of anode biofilm under various ammonia concentrations were further analyzed by protein assay the morphology anode biofilm was detected by scanning electron microscope sem these results will provide a profound understanding of the responses of mecs for the treatment of high organic and ammonia wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation the single chamber microbial electrolysis cells mecs were constructed from polycarbonate with an empty bed volume of 28 ml φ 3 0 cm l 4 cm fig s1 call et al 2008 the carbon brush φ 3 0 cm l 3 0 cm was performed as the anode electrode which was made by wringing graphite fiber 3 k toray into two twisted titanium wires li et al 2021 the double layer stainless steel mesh φ 3 8 cm 60 mesh type 304 was equipped as the cathode electrode before use the stainless steel mesh was cleaned in acetone ethanol absolute 0 5 mol l 1 h2so4 and deionized water for 30 min to eliminate the oxide layer an external resistor r 10 ω was connected in series with the reactor for current i monitoring by collecting the voltage v at both ends of the resistor r the gas produced from the mec was collected in an aluminum foil bag 0 2 l haide china which was connected by a silicone plug and a syringe with the reactor the gas tightness of mecs was examined by the underwater pressure test before use twenty four mec reactors were inoculated with anaerobic sludge collected from a reclaimed water treatment station jinnan campus nankai university tianjin china the synthetic wastewater which simulated the swine wastewater condition after primary treatment contained 2 g l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 5 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 nacl 0 31 g l 1 nh4cl and 1 ml l 1 trace elements qin et al 2014 the sodium acetate and sucrose were used as the electron donors that represented unfermentable and fermentable substrates before injecting into mecs the influent was purged with n2 for 15 min to remove dissolved oxygen a terminal voltage of 0 9 v was applied to the mecs using a direct current dc power source hyk 60e12 hua yao china the positive pole of the dc power source was connected to the anode while the negative pole was connected to the cathode all those reactors were started with acetate in batch mode the anode was considered to be fully developed until the reproducible current curves were obtained for at least three cycles thereafter the substrate of twelve reactors was gradually switched to sucrose by two steps acetate sucrose 1 1 complete sucrose to make sure the adaptation of electrode biofilm to sucrose each step ended until three repeatable current curves were obtained since the degradation of fermentable substrate depends on the corporation of suspended bacteria and electrode biofilm cao et al 2020 a pre fermentation of influent at 30 c for 24 h with the continuous exogenous inoculation sludge supernatant was given to the sucrose fed reactors to ensure the effective decomposition of complex substrates by fermentative bacteria otherwise the capacity of the current generation and the activity of anode biofilm would gradually decline fig s2 after the mecs achieving repeatable cyclic current curves nh4cl was gradually added to the influent to adjust the initial total ammonia nitrogen tan loading to 80 mg l 1 control group s1 500 mg l 1 s2 1000 mg l 1 s3 1500 mg l 1 s4 2000 mg l 1 s5 and 3000 mg l 1 s6 and the reactors were steadily operated for several cycles under every ammonia concentration the reactors were operated in batch mode at a temperature of 30 c under a dark condition while the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 36 h the forms of ammonia nitrogen in water include ionized ammonium nh4 and free ammonia nh3 fan the nh4 nh3 equilibrium relationship between the two forms is as follows n h 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h fan concentrations were calculated by eq 1 he et al 2016 1 fan 17 14 tan 1 0 ph exp 6334 273 t 1 0 ph where fan mg nh3 n l 1 is the free ammonia concentration tan mg nh3 n l 1 is the total ammonia concentration and t c is the temperature of the electrolyte during the operation process the nh4 played a dominant role in neutral medium after the examination of high ammonia ion concentration to investigate the different effects between nh4 and nh3 under the high tan loading 3000 mg l 1 s7 an alkali chamber was equipped besides the mec from the anode side to adjust the final ph to 8 5 0 2 fig s3 which was separated with mec part by an anion exchange membrane aem 2 2 analytical methods the volumetric fractions of h2 and ch4 were analyzed using a gas chromatograph sp 2100a berfen ruili china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a packed chromatographic column tdx 01 3 m 3 mm zhong ke hui jie china the high purity argon gas was used as the carrier gas the temperatures of the column oven injector and tcd were set at 130 c 60 c and 180 c the chemical oxygen demand cod of liquid samples was measured by the heating digestion method using a cod reagent hach co co america and a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach co co america the ammonia nitrogen nh4 n was measured according to the standard method hj 535 2009 the ph and conductivity values were measured using a ph meter fe28 standard mettler toledo switzerland and a conductivity meter fe28 standard mettler toledo switzerland 2 3 electrochemical analysis electrochemical tests were performed in a three electrode system using an electrochemical workstation aut302n v metrohm switzerland the carbon brush anode was performed as the working electrode with a counter electrode of double layer stainless steel mesh and a reference electrode of saturated calomel electrode sce the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis tests were conducted with the frequency range from 100 khz to 0 01 hz and the amplitude of the applied sinusoidal voltage signal was 0 014 v wang et al 2016 the cyclic voltammetry cv tests under turnover condition with substrate and non turnover condition no substrate were conducted from 0 7 v to 0 2 v vs sce with the scanning rate of 1 mv s 1 2 4 microbial community analysis after steadily operating for at least three repeatable cycles under different ammonia loadings the biofilm samples of anodes and effluent were taken the carbon brush anode was first washed with sterile 50 mmol l 1 pbs the carbon fibers with biofilm were then cut off from the brush from three different points which were then homogeneously mixed in a sterile centrifuge tube the electrolyte of sucrose fed mecs was centrifuged with a rate of 8000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min and the precipitate was collected for biodiversity analysis as the sample of suspended bacteria supplementary information section s7 the calculation of predicted metabolic pathways of the microbial communities based on the 16s rrna gene sequences was conducted using the picrust2 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states program based on the kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database on the majorbio cloud platform majorbio technology co ltd shanghai china li et al 2022 2 5 statistical analysis all the experiments were performed at least in triplicate reactors the standard deviation sd was calculated based on the average value of the tests the results were plotted with origin software 2021 the statistical package of ibm spss statistics version 26 0 was used to perform one way anova to compare the differences in the means of the variables between treatments the significance level was set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of mecs under different ammonia loadings the increase of ammonia concentration from 80 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 benefited the current generation of mec fig 1 a under the neutral ph range 7 1 0 5 as the ammonia loading increased the electrical conductivity ec of the electrolyte raised then the decreased solution resistance table s1 s2 improved the maximum current values from 4 9 0 3 ma to 8 5 0 4 ma yet when adjusting the ph of electrolyte to alkalescent 8 5 0 2 the great increase of fan concentration resulted in a rapid current decrease fig 1a s7 compared with the sucrose fed mecs the acetate fed mecs were more sensitive to the fan concentration fig 1a s7 similar results were previously reported that the 0 37 g l 1 fan could seriously slow the acetate oxidation by inhibiting the activities of arb in a glucose fed mec mahmoud et al 2017 the different effects of high ammonia wastewater under different ph 7 1 0 5 vs 8 5 0 2 indicate the higher toxicity of fan than ammonia ions on the activity of arb therefore when facing wastewater with high ammonia concentration the ph value of mec influent should be strictly adjusted to ensure the stable operation under high concentrations of ammonia and organic matter increasing the ammonia loading also inhibited the substrate removal of mecs fig 1b increasing the ammonia loading from 80 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 the cod removal efficiency of acetate fed mecs had an indistinctive change from 94 2 0 5 to 88 2 6 under relatively constant influent cod of 2010 67 mg l 1 nevertheless ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 greatly inhibited acetate oxidation with cod removal lower than 71 5 suggesting the acetate metabolic process of anode biofilm was affected this phenomenon was consistent with the previous research that 1000 mg l 1 tan contained 11 mg l 1 fan could inhibit the acetate utilization of anode attached bacteria in mfcs nam et al 2010 as the ammonia loading increased to 3000 mg l 1 the cod removal efficiency decreased to 57 4 with 860 80 mg l 1 residue in the effluent with the increase in ammonia loading from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 the quantity of electric charge generated in each cycle was stable while the cod removal declined fig s4 fig 1b correspondingly the c e continuously increased from 105 4 to 185 15 fig 1c 1 suggesting the hydrogen cycling was accompanied with high ammonia loading in single chamber mecs the expressions of hydrogen dehydrogenase and hydrogenase which were related to the redox of h2 and h in anaerobic bacteria also generally demonstrated an increased trend fig s5 the active harvesting method like negative pressure extraction could be applied for the rapid separation of the h2 produced from the mec otherwise the re consumption of h2 would increase the duration of the operation cycle and therefore leads to low h2 recovery lu et al 2016 the hydrogen production also decreased from 48 5 ml nh4 500 mg l 1 to 39 3 ml nh4 1000 mg l 1 when ammonia loading was higher than 1000 mg l 1 fig 1d similarly the methane production also greatly decreased at ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 from 6 1 ml nh4 500 mg l 1 to 2 2 0 6 ml nh4 1000 mg l 1 fig 1d the electrons for hydrogen electrolysis reaction at the cathode were produced by substrate oxidation at the anode while the nh4 oxidation on anode was ignored considering the very little loss of ammonia in one cycle table s1 s2 hence the decline of cod removal directly affected the biogas generation of mec with high ammonia loading with lower biogas generation the cathodic gas recovery r cat decreased with ammonia loading as well the energy recovery efficiencies based on electrical input η e and the summation of both the electricity and substrate inputs η e s were calculated by the total amount and combustion heat of hydrogen and methane with the increase of ammonia loading in acetate fed mecs η e showed a similar decreasing tendency as r cat from 170 13 to 120 8 indicating generally positive energy feedback could be achieved during this process despite the decreased energy recovery efficiency fig 1c 1 however the addition of ammonia didn t significantly affect the total energy recovery η e s which was attributed to the lower cod utilization ratio for sucrose fed mecs with higher ammonia resistance the cod removal kept relatively stable from 90 2 to 84 1 until the ammonia loading reached 2000 mg l 1 fig 1b since the electroactive bacteria usually preferred simple organics the degradation of sucrose was also dependent on other functional bacteria such as hydrolyzing bacteria and fermentative bacteria while the anode biofilm of acetate fed mecs was relatively simple with ammonia loading lower than 1500 mg l 1 the value of c e didn t significantly change for the stable cod removal and electricity generation in each cycle fig 1c 2 then with ammonia loading up to 2000 mg l 1 the electric quantity decreased in each cycle fig s4 and the cod removal was inhibited under ammonia loading of 3000 mg l 1 the cod removal was reduced to 54 5 with an effluent concentration of 880 90 mg l 1 therefore c e increased from 106 7 to 130 14 as the ammonia loading increased from 2000 to 3000 mg l 1 hydrogen production decreased with ammonia loading from 80 to 500 mg l 1 and then fluctuated in a range of 12 5 ml to 15 ml when ammonia loading was higher than 1000 mg l 1 yet the methane production did not show an obvious change compared with acetate fed mecs hydrogen production 18 6 ml in sucrose fed mecs was lower as a fermentable substrate the sucrose needs to be firstly fermented by functional bacteria the electrons released in this step were not involved in the current production which resulted in a significant decrease in electric quantity and a lower hydrogen production in sucrose reactors however more methane could be recovered 5 2 ml due to the relatively complex bacteria community in sucrose fed biofilm fig 1d fig s4 for long term operation of single chamber mec a variety of approaches such as low ph control hu et al 2008 temperature adjustment lu et al 2012 reduction of the hydraulic retention time call and logan 2008 specific methanogen inhibitors catal et al 2015 and negative pressure extraction lu et al 2016 could be used for increasing the hydrogen production the η e reduced from 130 20 to 90 11 fig 1c 2 hence the recovery of hydrogen and methane was only slightly higher than the electrical input with high ammonia loading in sucrose fed mecs 3 2 electrochemical characteristics of anodes under different ammonia loadings the eis and cv measurements were performed to investigate the internal resistance and electrochemical activity of anode biofilm under different ammonia loadings fig 2 the nyquist plots of eis analyses obtained with both acetate fed and sucrose fed anode biofilm showed two main arcs fig 2a b to determine the meaning of each arc a 300 ml larger electrolytic cell was used for anode eis tests with the graphic fibers of the brush fully stretched in this condition the first arc in the high frequency region almost disappeared which indicated that the first arc was likely to be a charge transfer resistance but limited by the substrate diffusion fig s6 considering the stratified anode biofilm for glucose oxidation with arb rich inner layer showed very similar electrochemical characters cao et al 2020 the similar nyquist plots of acetate fed and sucrose fed anode biofilm might also indicate their similar charge transfer processes from anode biofilm to electrode with the increase of the ammonia loading the rs decreased which resulted from the increase of the conductivity of the electrolyte the rct1 reduced and then vanished suggesting the higher ammonia loading was beneficial to obtain uniform electrolyte in the anode area however for acetate fed anodes the rct2 initially showed a decrease from 14 8 ω to 12 0 ω before ammonia loading reached 1000 mg l 1 and then increased to 16 4 ω under ammonia loading reached 3000 mg l 1 fig 2a c the rct2 of sucrose fed anode showed a similar trend fig 2b d in arb the electron mediators and oxidoreductases involved in metabolism and electron transport chains are abundant in the cytoplasm yet the lipopolysaccharide cytoderm retarded the extracellular electron transfer liu et al 2012 the combination of nh4 with the phosphate radical in the phospholipid bilayer could change the permeability and selectivity of the cell membrane which redistributed the nutrients and the metabolites and played a role in promoting metabolism to a certain extent smith et al 1987 with ammonia lower than 1000 mg l 1 the eps secretion was stimulated especially the protein secretion which may enhance the electroconductibility and reduce the internal resistance of the membrane borole et al 2011 marshall et al 2006 meanwhile the high conductivity of electrolytes may promote redox reactions on anodes which might in turn enhance the electrochemical performance of mes zhang et al 2012 guo et al 2018 nevertheless with ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 the adverse effects of ammonia ions appeared high salinity can cause the unbalance of osmotic stress across the cell membrane resulting in deleterious impacts by loss of water through osmosis vallero et al 2003 then the rct2 showed an upward trend instead under the turnover condition the results of cv tests fig 2e f showed the same variation trend as eis that is the imax table s3 of cv curves reached its maximum when the ammonia loading was 1000 mg l 1 the non turnover cv tests were conducted to investigate the extracellular electron transfer features of anode biofilm with the substrate free solution to eliminate the redox effects of the substrate fig 2g h and table s4 the shape and redox peaks of non turnover cv curves with acetate fed and sucrose fed anode biofilm were similar the cv curve of acetate fed anode showed two clear redox peaks with ammonia loading lower than 1000 mg l 1 fig 2g the peak1 was centered at 0 45 0 04 v which was assigned to the mediated electron transfer met by endogenously secreted flavins xiao et al 2017 the peak2 centered at 0 37 0 02 v which indicated the direct electron transfer det by outer membrane c type cytochrome z omcz marsili et al 2008 however with the ammonia higher than 1000 mg l 1 a new redox peak peak3 appeared at 0 231 0 002 v which was responsible for the det process through outer membrane c type cytochrome a omca li et al 2020 for sucrose fed anodes with ammonia loading of 80 mg l 1 three pairs of redox peaks were shown in the non turnover cv plots fig 2h the peak1 centered at 0 505 v was linked to the met of flavins the peak2 at 0 42 0 02 v was the det of omcz and the peak3 at 0 31 0 04 v was related to the combination of flavins and outer membrane c type cytochromes om c cyts xiao et al 2017 however with ammonia loading higher than 500 mg l 1 the met redox peak peak1 directly involved by flavins disappeared indicating that the flavins dependent electron transfer process was reduced in response to the stimulation of ammonia 3 3 the effects of ammonia loading on anode biofilm activity and eps secretion the morphology features of anode biofilm were characterized by sem under the normal condition nh4 80 mg l 1 the dark red biofilm was closely attached to the graphic fibers with the increase of ammonia loading from 80 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 the anode biofilm became thicker fig 3 s7 yet a serious biomass loss was then observed on acetate fed anodes with ammonia higher than 1500 mg l 1 parts of the graphic fibers were almost exposed in the images fig 3 s7 and s8 for sucrose fed anodes the high ammonia loading didn t cause the biomass loss on the anode fig 3 s7 and s8 under 15 000 times magnification the morphology features of acetate fed and sucrose fed biofilm showed great differences fig 3 under ammonia loading of 80 mg l 1 the eps of biofilm was very limited and the individual cells were visible the bacteria were then covered with eps under higher ammonia loading up to 1000 mg l 1 which may be attributed to the stress reaction of cells to toxic compounds after that the differences appeared again in acetate fed and sucrose fed biofilm under ammonia loading higher than 1500 mg l 1 fig 3 the bacteria cells in the acetate fed biofilm were gradually exposed again while the sucrose fed biofilm still had a high amount of eps around the cells which explained the different tolerance of acetate fed and sucrose fed biofilm on high ammonia loading fig 1 the clsm was further performed to observe the biofilm characteristics fig 4 the abundance of living and dead cells was represented by the laser intensity fig 4c d for both acetate fed and sucrose fed mecs the intensities of both living and dead cells increased when ammonia loading increased from 80 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 the differences appeared again under ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 for acetate fed mecs the biomass loss was also observed with clsm fig 4a c during the operation the re inoculation didn t recover the biomass the proportion of dead cells gradually increased from 39 5 to 60 3 with the increase in ammonia loading from 500 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 fig 4c suggesting the negative effects of nh4 on microorganisms the total protein content per unit mass of electrode shows that the biomass of acetate fed anode increased from 16 2 mg g 1 to 21 3 mg g 1 when ammonia loading increased from 80 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 and then rapidly decreased to 13 1 mg g 1 when ammonia loading increased to 3000 mg l 1 fig s8 however for sucrose fed mecs with the increase in ammonia loading from 1000 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 the biomass on the anode kept stable despite the increase in the proportion of dead cells fig 4b d and s8 unlike the acetate fed mecs the sucrose fed anode biofilm required the collaborative metabolic of many functional bacteria the more complex microbial community may help to keep the biomass on sucrose fed anodes under high ammonia loading considering that the electrochemical activity of both acetate fed and sucrose fed mecs rapidly decreased with ammonia concentration 1000 mg l 1 the mec may better operate with ammonia loading lower than 1000 mg l 1 for stable performance the stress response of microorganisms to the stimulation of high concentrations of ammonia was studied by measuring eps secretion using clsm as well fig 5 three kinds of eps including α d glucopyranose polysaccharides α d glucopyranose ps red β d glucopyranose polysaccharides β d glucopyranose ps blue and protein green were cross linked together the initial intensities of those three kinds of eps were nearly equivalent fig 5c d the addition of ammonia stimulated the microbes to produce more carbohydrate and protein eps for acetate fed anodes the epss included α β d glucopyranose ps and protein significantly increased with ammonia loading below 1000 mg l 1 with ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 the decline of eps secretion revealed the serious inhibitory effects of ammonia fig 5a c the decrease of eps secretion might result in the exposure of electron transport sites omca in acetate fed anodes fig 2g for sucrose fed anodes ammonia significantly increased the amounts of polysaccharides and proteins a more complex and thicker biofilm may also help the sucrose fed anode biofilm to withstand higher ammonia concentrations hence with ammonia loading higher than 1000 mg l 1 the amount of eps remained at a high level fig 5b d the eps can store and provide nutrients for cells to maintain their activity and integrity in adverse environments the eps also keeps the cells tightly together and enhances the biofilm stability moreover in the process of substance transfer from solution to cell the compounds must pass through the eps layer first which reduces the damage caused by toxins for acetate fed anodes the lack of eps protection under high ammonia loading caused a more rapid peak current decline than that of sucrose fed anodes in case of high ammonia loading and high ph more fan fig 1a however in sucrose fed anode biofilm while eps wrapped the cell to resist external stress the barrier also impeded the interspecific electron transfer process on the cell membrane fig 2h to deeply characterize the composition of eps the tightly bound eps tb eps loosely bound lb eps and soluble eps sol eps were severally extracted for the eem test fig 6 the tb eps extracted from the surface of acetate fed or sucrose fed anode biofilm showed a prominent peak peak1 at excitation emission ex em of 280 nm 304 nm which could be ascribed as soluble microbial metabolites mainly characterized as tyrosine proteins fig 6a with the increase of ammonia loading the change in the intensity of peak1 was consistent with the results of the clsm test on eps content fig 5 the lb eps were the same as those of tb eps fig 6b for sol eps of both acetate fed and sucrose fed effluent two more peaks appeared the peak2 ex em of 242 nm 277 nm and peak3 ex em of 421 nm 422 nm were identified as aromatic proteins and humic acid substances dai et al 2016 chen et al 2003 moreover the peak4 ex em of 248 nm 481 nm with small intensity could be observed in the effluent of sucrose fed mecs which belongs to fulvic acid like substances such as fulvic acid and hydrophobic acid fig 6c 3 4 microbial community analysis under different ammonia loadings with the increase in current the geobacter sp a kind of typical exoelectrogen reguera et al 2005 adhikari et al 2016 was greatly improved in abundance from 0 21 to 32 86 as the ammonia concentration increased from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 fig 7 s9 table s5 similarly the abundance of another exoelectrogen cloacibacillus zhang et al 2020 increased from 0 67 to 4 15 fig 7 s9 table s5 the total abundance of all the twelve exoelectrogen species abundance 1 also revealed a dramatic rise from 36 04 to 64 51 for mecs a higher abundance of exoelectrogens would produce higher current which in turn promoted the enrichment of exoelectrogens in the anode biofilm the microbial community of sucrose fed anode was more complex than that in the acetate fed anode fig s10 there are many species of fermentative bacteria such as macellibacteroides guo et al 2019 klebsiella zeng et al 1993 pleomorphomonas lu et al 2017 etc that occupied a large proportion in sucrose fed biofilm but they were not found in acetate fed biofilm nevertheless the total abundance of exoelectrogens was lower than that in acetate fed anodes due to the attachment of fermentative bacteria table s5 s6 both acetate and sucrose reactors can stably operate under 1000 mg l 1 of ammonia however the biofilm of the acetate fed anode was simple and dominated by exoelectrogens while that of the sucrose fed anode was more complex and stable due to the growth of fermentative bacteria on the electrode surface the sucrose fed reactors demonstrated higher tolerance to ammonia in cod removal and biofilm stability due to their diverse biofilm with the increase of ammonia loading in the acetate fed mecs the expression of the functional gene of carbon metabolism declined which might result in the decrease in acetate consumption fig s11 fig 1b similarly the expression number of methane metabolism functional genes also decreased which resulted in the reduction of methane production the expression numbers of most pathways related to the polysaccharide metabolism were reduced in sucrose fed anode biofilm by the increased ammonia fig 8 the polysaccharide metabolism functional genes in the suspension also played an important role in the process of sucrose degradation which demonstrates no obvious variation tendency with the increase in ammonia loading nevertheless when only considering the expression of functional genes related to starch and sucrose metabolism a clear decline was observed in both anode biofilm and solution fig 8 when the sucrose amended media was pre fermented outside mecs the cod removal decreased with the increased ammonia loading confirming the negative effects of ammonia on sucrose fermentation fig s12 hence glycolysis might be the limiting step for sucrose fed mecs under high ammonia loading the archaea communities were tested to obtain the diversity of methanogens on sucrose fed anodes fig 9 the first three dominant genus species in sucrose fed mec reactors were methanocorpusculum methanobacterium and methanobrevibacter which were all known as typical hydrogenotrophic methanogens pisciotta et al 2012 yu et al 2020 their relatively high abundance indicated the methane in mecs in this work might be mainly produced by hydrogen trophic methanogens which resulted in the decline of hydrogen production under high ammonia concentrations the total abundance of methanogens didn t change significantly which might maintain the methane production in sucrose fed mecs it is worth noticing that the dominated methanogens changed from methanobacterium to methanocorpusculum under ammonia loading of 1000 mg l 1 the methanocorpusculum was reported to metabolize relatively complex compounds e g propanol butanol and acetate while the methanobacterium preferred simpler compounds e g formate hydrogen and carbon dioxide liu et al 2008 smith et al 1997 the acetotrophic methanogens were detected in this work fig 9 it has been reported that the acetotrophic methanogens e g methanosaetaceae and methanosarcinaceae were more sensitive to ammonia loading han et al 2015 song et al 2010 wang et al 2015 similar in this study the methanosaeta gradually also decreased with the ammonia loading increased from 80 mg l 1 to 3000 mg l 1 mec demonstrates great advantages over the traditional biological treatment process in treating wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen a mec centered hybrid treatment process fig s13 might achieve high efficient energy recovery and pollutant removal to expedite the application of mec in treating swine wastewater further research needs to be carried out to promote coordination between the hydrolysis acidification process and anode respiring process to improve the synergetic degradation of organic matter the energy recovery efficiency of mec also needs to be improved by the optimization of reactor architecture the catalytic performance of electrodes and the efficient extraction of hydrogen furthermore other than the high concentration of ammonia there are also many other pollutants in swine wastewater such as antibiotics and heavy metals which may demonstrate co effects on mec with ammonia and require further investigation 4 conclusions this study focused on the effects of ammonia on electrochemical active biofilm in mecs for synthetic swine wastewater treatment results indicated that the increase of ammonia benefited the current generation of mecs under the neutral ph range but the cod consumption and hydrogen production were gradually inhibited with the increase in ammonia concentration from 80 to 3000 mg l 1 however the addition of ammonia didn t significantly affect the total energy recovery due to the decrease in cod consumption generally positive electric energy feedback could be achieved during this process the ammonia ions can increase the permeability of cell membrane in neutral ph while the proper increase of cell permeability benefited the electrochemical activity of bacteria in a range of 80 to 1000 mg l 1 the increase of ammonia could improve the electrochemical performance of both acetate fed and sucrose fed anodes both the minimum charge transfer resistance and the maximum current of cv curves were achieved at the ammonia concentration of 1000 mg l 1 in mecs the toxic nh4 stimulated the cells to secrete eps as self defense and caused biomass reduction when ammonia concentration increased the abundance of exoelectrogens raised up with the current nevertheless the carbon and methane metabolism pathways were inhibited in acetate fed mec while the glycolysis acted as the rate limiting step for substrate degradation in sucrose fed conditions the hydrogen trophic methanogens kept a high abundance in the anode biofilm and contributed to the stable methane production but the ammonia loadings higher than 1000 mg l 1 changed the dominant archaea from methanobacterium to methanocorpusculum this article provided a comprehensive study for the performance of mec in treating ammonia rich wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare
