9830,intensification of agricultural management practices including irrigation and addition of nitrogen n fertilizers can lead to enhanced n leaching and loss of soil fertility in new zealand expansion of the dairy industry has rapidly increased irrigated land area particularly on shallow stony soils of the canterbury region that are prone to leaching leading to degradation of surface and ground water quality and losses of soil n and carbon c in this study we measure components of n balance for two adjacent fields of lucerne medicago sativa l alfalfa harvested for cut and carry feed and grazed in situ one field was non irrigated and one irrigated with both water and dairy effluent inputs from n fixation associated with the legume crop were quantified using a natural abundance isotopic approach drainage from the root zone and leaching were measured with 6 large lysimeters in each field leaching losses from non irrigated lucerne were 7 30 kg n ha 1 y 1 with the largest losses occurring in a year with primarily grazing management losses from irrigated lucerne were 39 102 kg n ha 1 y 1 with the largest losses resulting from summer drainage events exacerbated by irrigation fixation of n was the largest input to both systems contributing 192 257 kg n ha 1 y 1 for non irrigated lucerne under irrigation biomass production increased but n uptake from effluent and soil stocks contributed to biomass n to a greater extent and fixation was 262 286 kg n ha 1 y 1 management influenced n balance through inputs from animal excreta and effluent additions and exports through harvest and grazing removals management practices which reduce n losses from the soil are needed to minimize environmental impacts and protect soil fertility keywords nitrogen fixation leaching grazing effluent intensification alfalfa 1 introduction leaching of nitrogen n from agricultural soils impacts the quality of surface and groundwater and is a loss of valuable nutrients that could otherwise be utilized for crop growth understanding the relationships between inputs and outputs of n and their response to agricultural management practices particularly irrigation is critical for minimizing n leaching while maximizing production in this study field scale measurements of n inputs from biological nitrogen fixation effluent irrigation and animal excreta are balanced against outputs from leaching and grazing and harvest removals for irrigated and non irrigated lucerne medicago sativa l alfalfa grown on stony alluvial soils global intensification of agricultural management relies heavily upon irrigation and use of n fertilizers to improve crop yields mueller et al 2012 however irrigation can lead to increased drainage volumes duncan et al 2016 laubach et al 2019 while additions of n can result in n surplus and enhanced loss to groundwater lassaletta et al 2014 together drainage volume and n surplus are the primary drivers of n leaching blicher mathiesen et al 2014 di and cameron 2002b korsaeth and eltun 2000 pandey et al 2018 within forage systems in addition to chemical fertilizers n inputs from grazing animal excreta haynes and williams 1993 soussana and lemaire 2014 application of effluent houlbrooke et al 2004 and biological nitrogen fixation associated with legumes peoples et al 2009 all contribute to n inputs the total amount timing of application and chemical form of n in these inputs determine susceptibility to loss to the environment through leaching and gaseous pathways plant uptake and subsequent removal from the system through harvest and grazing or storage in the soil inputs from animals pose a particular risk for leaching as concentrated urine patches typically have n loads well in excess of plant requirements selbie et al 2015 the irrigated land area of new zealand has increased by more than 90 to nearly 800 000 ha over the past 15 years primarily to support expansion of the dairy industry ministry for the environment statistics new zealand 2018 this intensification of land use associated with irrigation has focused on the canterbury region where shallow stony soils are prone to leaching losses carrick et al 2013 and consequently nitrate leaching for the region is estimated to have doubled between 1990 and 2011 dymond et al 2013 in addition to enhanced n loss intensively managed irrigated pastoral soils have lost soil carbon c relative to adjacent non irrigated soils condron et al 2014 mudge et al 2017 this depletion of soil c may increase vulnerability of these systems to n loss as c is an important driver of microbial mechanisms for n retention in soils castellano et al 2012 mooshammer et al 2014 numerous strategies to reduce losses of both n and c have been proposed including changes in grazing management soussana and lemaire 2014 whitehead et al 2018 use of nitrification inhibitors williamson et al 1998 and use of alternative forage species or species mixtures malcolm et al 2014 rutledge et al 2017 lucerne is a legume which has high dry matter production and deep roots which allow water extraction from well below 2 m soil depth brown et al 2005 despite fixing n it has also been shown to extract n from deep in the soil profile kelner et al 1997 russelle et al 2001 lucerne has been used extensively as forage for dryland sheep and beef farms in new zealand moot 2012 however few measurements of leaching losses from lucerne have been conducted betteridge et al 2007 mcleod 2015 and none represent its use in intensive irrigated systems where extraction of water and nutrients at depth may serve to reduce n leaching the objective of this study was to quantify losses of n through leaching and crop harvest for two lucerne systems on stony alluvial soils under contrasting irrigation effluent and grazing management regimes we relate these losses to the quantity and chemical composition of inputs from n fixation dairy effluent and animal excreta to assess the potential effects of each management type on the soil n balance we further explore linkages between c and n cycling to identify potential for mitigation of n leaching losses through improved management practices 2 methods 2 1 study sites and management this study was carried out at the lincoln university ashley dene research and development station in central south island new zealand this 190 ha research farm is situated on glacial alluvium classified as typic orthic brown soil dystrudepts hewitt 2010 soil survey staff 2006 stony silt loam topsoils overlie sandy textured subsoil with a volumetric stone content of up to 70 graham et al 2019 in 2015 the farm was converted from low intensity dryland sheep and beef farming to intensive dairying two sites were selected for the current study one in a 14 ha area of non irrigated lucerne and the other within 15 ha of lucerne irrigated by a center pivot irrigator irrigation was applied at approximately 4 mm of water per pass of the irrigator with a 30 hour minimum return period dairy effluent was also applied to the irrigated site through a separate distribution system on the center pivot effluent was applied at a rate of approximately 2 mm per pass either along with or independent of irrigation water total n stocks in the top 1 5 m of soil were 12 0 and 9 4 mg n ha 1 at the non irrigated and irrigated site respectively for further details of the study sites see laubach et al 2019 for details of soil physical properties and water balance see graham et al 2019 the lucerne crop at each site was harvested 4 6 times per year either mechanically for cut and carry feed or by grazing throughout the first year of measurement october 2016 september 2017 year 1 both sites were harvested mechanically in mid december 2017 and early january 2018 year 2 the irrigated site was rotationally grazed by a herd of 172 dairy cows during each grazing event the cows were confined to small grazing strips within the larger field for a single day all other harvests were carried out mechanically the non irrigated site was rotationally grazed by 88 dairy cows in early june 2018 with all other harvests carried out mechanically during the final year of measurement october 2018 september 2019 year 3 the non irrigated site was rotationally grazed throughout the season by a herd of 90 cows with no mechanical harvests a mixed harvest management was continued at the irrigated site with grazing events occurring in may 2019 95 cows and again in september 2019 220 cows 2 2 biomass sampling and estimation of n fixation throughout the study period monthly samples of biomass were collected from ten randomly located points within each field vegetation was clipped to the soil surface within a 0 25 m2 quadrat at each location samples were dried at 60 c for at least 24 h and weighed similarly pre and post harvest samples were collected to determine the amounts of biomass removed by mechanical harvest and grazing subsequently harvested material was analyzed for total n content to determine the amount of n exported n export biological n fixation n fixed associated with the lucerne crop was estimated using a natural abundance δ15n approach which utilizes the distinct δ 15n signatures of biologically fixed n and other n sources in the soil unkovich et al 2008 the soil end member was estimated from the δ15n signature of n in aboveground biomass of a non fixing reference plant the end member representing pure n fixation was determined from the δ15n signature of lucerne grown in a glasshouse on n free media in september 2017 six pairs of 1 m2 plots were established within each the irrigated and non irrigated fields of each pair one plot was left as lucerne while the other was seeded with spitfire forage rape brassica napus l ssp biennis as brassica species have been identified as an appropriate non fixing reference crop for comparison with legume crops unkovich et al 2008 between late september 2017 and mid may 2018 these plots were sampled on seven occasions corresponding to harvests of the lucerne three individual plants were clipped to ground level in each plot these samples were bulked by plot dried at 60 c ground and analyzed for δ15n by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer europa scientific 20 20 sercon ltd crewe uk the reference plots initially failed to establish particularly at the non irrigated site thus broad leaved dock rumex obtusifolius l a common deep rooted weed species was used as the non fixing reference species until november 2017 in the irrigated field and february 2018 in the non irrigated field when the forage rape was sufficiently established where possible sampling of this species continued after establishment of the forage rape to ensure a similar δ15n signature was obtained for both species the fraction of n from fixation f fixed in field grown lucerne was estimated from a two end member mixing model uncertainty in f fixed was estimated from the variability in signatures of field grown lucerne and the two end members according to phillips and gregg 2001 estimated f fixed was applied in combination with the concentration of n in lucerne biomass to harvested dry matter to estimate the total amount of n fixed at each harvest date 2 3 lysimeter measurements drainage from the root zone and associated leaching of n n leached was measured by six large lysimeters located in each field the lysimeters were constructed in situ from undisturbed columns of soil already containing lucerne the soil was enclosed in a 2 m diameter high density polyethylene cylinder sealed to a perforated base plate at 1 5 m depth which allowed free drainage into a collection pan see carrick et al 2017 for further details of the lysimeter construction drainage volumes were recorded continuously by tipping spoons with a subsample of leachate continuously collected and sampled for chemical analysis following each drainage event drainage water was analyzed for total n no3 including no2 total ammoniacal n nh3 and nh4 henceforth simplified to nh4 and total organic c lysimeter installation was completed in september 2016 however drainage did not occur until april 2017 due to a summer with low rainfall grazing animals and machinery were excluded from the lysimeter area but lucerne within the lysimeters was managed to replicate that of the surrounding fields throughout the study 2 4 grazing and effluent inputs the amounts of n deposited by animals during grazing events as dung n dung and urine n urine were estimated based on animal numbers dry matter intake including supplemental feeds time spent grazing and estimated area volume and n concentration of dung and urine patches from selbie et al 2015 haynes and williams 1993 and luo and kelliher 2014 this was then used to guide application of both dung and urine to each lysimeter when practical a single application of urine and dung to the lysimeters was used to represent two grazing events this allowed for urine and dung to be applied to each lysimeter in natural patch sizes while still representing the n load to the wider field both the urine and dung were sampled and analyzed for total n no3 nh4 total organic c concentration and dry matter contents to determine the n input to the lysimeters inputs of n from effluent irrigation n effluent were estimated from three 2 m long 0 2 m wide troughs located adjacent to the lysimeters at the irrigated site liquid captured in the troughs was periodically sampled and analyzed for total n no3 nh4 and total organic c concentration 2 5 estimation of nitrogen balance and uncertainties annual change in whole system n was estimated from the balance of measured inputs from fixation effluent and grazing and outputs from harvest export and leaching according to 1 δ n soil n fixed n effluent n dung n urine n leached n export n gas where δn soil is the net change in soil n pool and n gas is the gaseous loss of n from the system through denitrification and volatilization which were not measured in the present study uncertainty in each of the n balance terms was estimated based on variability in the measurements for n export this included variability standard error of the mean sem of the biomass estimate and n concentration of biomass uncertainty in n fixed included that for n export with the additional variability of the isotopic partitioning uncertainty in n urine and ndung was assumed to be 5 a conservative estimate accounting for variability in n concentrations and dry matter content and possible errors arising during application to lysimeters the only source of error considered for n effluent was the variation in water input across the lysimeter site as only a single sample of effluent water was analyzed for each collection date the sem of the six lysimeters at each site was used to represent variability in n leached uncertainties were propagated into the annual δn soil estimate using root mean square error propagation additional unquantified uncertainties related to bias in measurements and the unmeasured n gas term are discussed further in section 4 3 results 3 1 climate and irrigation management the study took place over three years with distinctly different weather patterns although annual totals of water input from precipitation and irrigation were similar table 1 their seasonal distribution and patterns of drainage differed figs 1 2 year 1 october 2016 september 2017 included a summer drought with no drainage events occurring in either non irrigated or irrigated lucerne until april 2017 fig 2 this was followed by an unusually wet winter year 2 october 2017 september 2018 included large precipitation events during january and february and as a result drainage occurred throughout the year year 3 october 2018 september 2019 included a dry summer during which no drainage occurred followed by moderate winter precipitation resulting in relatively few leaching events these differences in seasonal water input contributed to large interannual variation in drainage volume for non irrigated lucerne despite the similarity of total annual precipitation for the three years drainage varied from 137 to 293 mm irrigation was applied from november to april each year in year 1 irrigation of 268 mm was applied by the pivot irrigator in year 2 416 mm of irrigation water was applied and a moderate amount 336 mm was applied in year 3 this irrigation contributed to drainage volumes 1 2 2 5 times greater than under non irrigated conditions table 1 the largest effect was measured in year 2 when the combination of increased soil water content from irrigation and large summer precipitation events contributed to substantial drainage during the growing season fig 2 3 2 lucerne biomass and n fixation annual aboveground dry matter production for non irrigated lucerne was 6 9 9 2 mg ha 1 y 1 table 1 fig 3 production was approximately 30 greater during year 2 which we attributed to substantial precipitation events over summer relative to year 1 and year 3 which each experienced summer drought periods the average n fraction of dry matter was 3 5 varying amongst harvests between 3 4 and 3 8 measured n export was 242 320 kg ha 1 y 1 annual dry matter harvested from irrigated lucerne showed less interannual variability 12 8 14 4 mg ha 1 y 1 with the lowest harvest amount occurring in year 1 when less irrigation was applied the n fraction of dry matter was similar to that for the non irrigated lucerne at 3 5 although more variable between harvest dates ranging from 3 0 to 3 8 n export from irrigated lucerne showed low interannual variation and was 461 496 kg n ha 1 y 1 the mean δ15n signature of lucerne biomass was 0 10 0 06 for the non irrigated site the δ15n of non fixing reference species was 3 10 0 34 and the δ15n signature for lucerne grown on n free media was 0 98 0 04 isotopically partitioned f fixed varied from 90 in spring to 68 in late summer fig 3 applying the seasonality of calculated f fixed to measurements of n export n fixed at the non irrigated site was 192 257 kg n ha 1 y 1 at the irrigated site lucerne had a δ15n of 1 18 0 26 while the non fixing reference species had a signature of 3 82 0 40 resulting f fixed was lower than that of non irrigated lucerne and varied between 66 in spring to 47 in autumn with a similar seasonality to that for non irrigated lucerne estimated n fixed was 262 286 kg n ha 1 y 1 for irrigated lucerne 3 3 grazing and effluent inputs grazing events in year 2 and 3 added n to both the non irrigated and irrigated lucerne sites table 1 additions of excreta to the non irrigated lysimeter site in june of year 2 corresponding with grazing in the surrounding paddock resulted in additions of 19 and 28 kg n ha 1 y 1 as dung and urine respectively the non irrigated lucerne was grazed throughout year 3 and additions of excreta were carried out in october january april and august to simulate inputs from these events fig 2 for year 3 total inputs as n dung and n urine were 53 and 134 kg n ha 1 respectively the irrigated lucerne was grazed twice during the summer of year 2 to represent the areal coverage of dung and urine patches over the course of the two events using standard patch sizes an amount equivalent to n dung of 28 kg n ha 1 and n urine of 84 kg n ha 1 was added to the lysimeters in december in year 3 grazing of the irrigated lucerne was carried out in may and september adding 19 and 49 kg n ha 1 as dung and urine respectively the c n ratios of dung and urine samples were 16 1 0 8 and 1 8 0 3 kg kg 1 from february 2017 onwards the irrigated field received regular n inputs from effluent application fig 1 in year 1 n effluent was 73 kg n ha 1 y 1 table 1 in year 2 addition of n effluent was increased to 147 kg n ha 1 y 1 and further increased to 205 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 3 while inputs of n dung and n urine were predominantly organic forms of n n effluent on average was comprised of 54 ammoniacal n with the remainder as organic forms and negligible amounts of no3 1 the c n ratio of effluent was 3 4 0 2 kg kg 1 fig 2 3 4 leachate composition the mean concentration of n in leachate samples from lysimeters in non irrigated lucerne was 6 7 mg n l 1 varying from 1 6 to 37 0 mg n l 1 the highest concentrations were observed during year 3 when the site was grazed throughout the season with no mechanical harvests cumulative annual n leached for non irrigated lucerne was 7 30 kg n ha 1 y 1 table 1 fig 2 n leached was more than three times greater during year 3 when the site was grazed compared to the previous years with primarily mechanical harvests the dominant form of mineral n in leachate was no3 with the samples containing negligible amounts of nh4 the mean concentration of no3 in leachate samples from non irrigated lucerne was 3 9 mg no3 n l 1 and varied from 0 1 35 mg no3 n l 1 following a similar temporal pattern to total n the contribution of no3 to the total n loss increased over time from 20 in year 1 44 in year 2 and 87 in year 3 fig 2 the remaining fraction of n leached was organic forms of n the ratio of no3 n to total n was related inversely to the c n ratio of leachate explaining 85 of the variability of c n the c n of leachate from non irrigated lucerne declined from 10 8 in year 1 1 8 in year 3 the mean concentration of n in leachate samples from the lysimeters in irrigated lucerne was 18 0 mg n l 1 varying from 2 3 to 150 0 mg n l 1 the highest concentrations were observed during leaching events which occurred over summer of year 2 cumulative annual n loss through leaching for the irrigated site was 39 102 kg n ha 1 y 1 table 1 fig 2 n leached was greatest in year 2 resulting from large losses during summer leaching events substantial variation amongst the six lysimeters also accumulated over this period as with the non irrigated lysimeters no3 was the dominant form of mineral n at the irrigated site and the mean concentration of no3 in leachate samples was 14 7 mg n l 1 varying from 0 1 150 0 mg n l 1 the ratio of no3 n to total n initially resembled that for the non irrigated site fig 2 the fraction of no3 rapidly increased following approximately 98 mm of drainage or approximately equal to the water storage volume of the 1 5 m soil profile estimated as 96 mm from a profile array of soil water content sensors the contribution of no3 to cumulative n leached was 72 during year 1 89 in year 2 and 84 in year 3 similar to the non irrigated site the ratio of no3 n to total n in leachate from the irrigated lysimeters was closely related to the c n ratio of leachate explaining 95 of the variability of c n the c n of leachate resembled that for the non irrigated site but decreased below 5 following drainage equivalent to the storage volume of the soil then remained low varying around 1 5 for the remainder of the study 3 5 soil n balance the balance of measured inputs from n fixed n effluent n urine and n dung and losses from n leached and n export indicate a δn soil which varied from a net loss of 62 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 1 to a net gain of 107 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 3 for non irrigated lucerne table 1 at the irrigated site total measured n input was 60 greater than that at the non irrigated site while n outputs were 85 greater δnsoil varied from a loss of 161 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 1 to a marginal gain of 18 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 3 4 discussion 4 1 effects of management on nitrogen inputs for both non irrigated and irrigated lucerne n fixed was the largest input of n to the system annual n fixed in harvested dry matter of 192 286 kg n ha 1 y 1 corresponds well with estimates of n fixed in above ground plant components from other studies measurements from a nearby field site found n fixed of non irrigated lucerne to be equivalent to 200 kg n ha 1 y 1 berenji et al 2015 a survey of organic farms in france found n fixed in shoots of lucerne to be 274 60 kg n ha 1 y 1 anglade et al 2015 irrigated lucerne in australia fixed 222 kg n ha 1 y 1 in aboveground biomass yang et al 2011 although dry matter production of irrigated lucerne over the study period was 73 greater than that of non irrigated lucerne n fixed was only 24 greater this is due to the substantially lower f fixed in response to additional n from effluent additions a finding typical for legumes carlsson and huss danell 2003 irrigation also leads to enhanced mineralization of organic matter curtin et al 2012 which may also increase availability of n in the soil and suppress fixation particularly late in the growing season when mineralization rate in non irrigated soil is water limited in the current study estimates of n fixation were based on aboveground biomass which was subsequently removed by harvest or grazing however lucerne has substantial and seasonally dynamic belowground biomass teixeira et al 2009 that acts as a reservoir for fixed n likewise fine root turnover transfers n to the soil organic matter pool previous studies have estimated additions to the soil of up to 60 kg n ha 1 y 1 through turnover of lucerne roots goins and russelle 1996 whole plant n fixed is often estimated by multiplying measured above ground n fixed by a correction factor to account for unmeasured accumulation in roots this factor typically ranges from 1 3 to 2 anglade et al 2015 kelner et al 1997 unkovich et al 2010 with a moderate factor of 1 7 total n fixed would increase to 350 452 kg n ha 1 y 1 in the present study however these factors are often based on root to shoot ratios of unharvested plants and it is uncertain how well they represent belowground allocation of n for repeatedly harvested crops the correction factor is also likely to differ with irrigation and effluent management as previous studies in forage grasslands have shown that irrigation and fertilizer addition while increasing aboveground production does not affect belowground productivity scott et al 2012 the proportional contribution of inputs from grazing animals and effluent addition to the n balance increased over the 3 years of measurements for the non irrigated lucerne excreta from grazing animals contributed nearly half of the total n input during the final year of measurements for the irrigated lucerne the increased annual rate of effluent application and the change of management practice from mechanical harvest to grazing over the course of the study led to an increase in the contribution of external n to the total n input from 20 in year 1 to nearly 50 in year 3 4 2 effects of management on nitrogen exports and losses export of n by harvest and grazing of lucerne was the largest component of the n balance of both the irrigated and non irrigated field due to the substantially greater dry matter production of the irrigated lucerne and consequent higher harvest frequency n export was 73 larger under irrigation and effluent addition relative to that for the non irrigated lucerne the prevailing importance of harvest removal in regulating soil organic matter dynamics has been documented previously for these forage systems hunt et al 2016 laubach et al 2019 moinet et al 2017 while removing smaller amounts of n from the system relative to harvest nleached is critically important for the potential for environmental impacts under primarily cut and carry management n leached of 7 9 kg n ha 1 y 1 for non irrigated lucerne compares well with the previous estimates for a lucerne crop in new zealand of 5 20 kg n ha 1 y 1 betteridge et al 2007 mcleod 2015 the transition to grazing in the final year of the study led to a more than three times greater value of n leached annual n leached of 30 kg n ha 1 y 1 under grazed non irrigated lucerne resembled that of other grazed grasslands cameron et al 2013 monaghan et al 2005 irrigation of lucerne with water and effluent resulted in n leached of 39 kg n ha 1 y 1 under exclusively cut and carry management four times greater than the annual total for the non irrigated lucerne in a previous study of lysimeters planted with perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l and white clover trifolium repens l receiving irrigation and additions of dairy shed effluent equivalent to 400 kg n ha 1 leaching was only 18 kg n ha 1 y 1 although higher losses of 78 kg n ha 1 y 1 were observed in a year where results were confounded by pasture renewal di and cameron 2002a this disparity may be due to the higher demand for n of the non fixing ryegrass relative to that for a legume crop it is also likely that effluent applications over the autumn and winter months when lucerne growth rate is reduced contributed to higher n losses in subsequent measurement years increased effluent addition and the more frequent grazing increased the external n input to the system and contributed to n leached of 44 102 kg n ha 1 y 1 these losses fall well within the range of values reported for other irrigated forage systems under grazing with various effluent and fertilizer management practices of 30 162 kg n ha 1 y 1 di and cameron 2002a silva et al 1999 given the variability in effluent and grazing management as well as drainage characteristics across the measurement years it is difficult to attribute the effects on n leached to any one factor however timing of drainage events appears to play an important role in the interannual variability in n leached for irrigated lucerne during year 2 of the study large drainage events in january and february summer contributed a loss of 60 kg n ha 1 with 42 kg n ha 1 leached throughout the remainder of the year despite the fact that only a third of the annual drainage volume resulted from these events while this may be due in part to additions of n dung and n urine from grazing during the preceding month it may also be due to the higher mobility of n at times when warm soil temperatures contributed to greater microbial activity and mineralization rates previous analysis of n leached in grazed grasslands have shown that n urine deposited over summer and autumn months is more vulnerable to loss through leaching cichota et al 2013 this has important management implications as drainage events which occur within the irrigation season could be potentially minimized through careful management of irrigation not only the quantity but also the chemical composition of n leached varied with management practices under cut and carry management without external inputs of n from excreta or effluent n leached was primarily composed of organic forms of n with a c n ratio indicating origins from plant biomass c n 12 2 and soil organic matter c n 10 5 these losses of organic matter are driven primarily by the volume of drainage moving through the soil similar to that for organic c laubach et al 2019 with addition of n effluent to irrigated lucerne and with increased frequency of grazing at both sites n leached was primarily in the form of no3 this indicates the importance of these external inputs of n in driving no3 leaching and its association with both health and environmental risks the predominance of no3 in leachate also indicates that external inputs of n underwent microbial transformation before leaving the root zone as n effluent n dung and n urine were primarily in the forms of nh4 and organic n nitrification of nh4 in grazing animal urine has been shown to occur over a period of weeks haynes and williams 1992 observations from the lysimeters show drainage commencing within less than 1 day following large rain events it was also common for effluent to be applied leading up to rain events as a practical measure for preventing overflow of the storage pond creating conditions conducive to rapid transport of effluent through the soil however the absence of nh4 in the leachate suggests that under this management system rapid bypass flow through the stony soil is not contributing substantially to n leached previous research suggested this as a potential risk for stony soils carrick et al 2014 mcleod et al 2014 although we cannot completely rule out an of influence preferential flow pathways it may be the low soil volume due to the high stone content and thus low storage capacity for n which leads to enhanced n losses from these soils one potential limitation to our interpretation of the quantity and chemical composition of n leached is that soil disturbance is known to affect n losses cultivation caused a one time loss of 10 15 kg n ha 1 in lysimeters planted with lucerne mcleod 2015 similar losses may have been expected from soil disturbance caused by lysimeter construction organic n losses from severed roots may have contributed to the higher c n ratio and greater organic n content of the first pore volume of leachate collected from the irrigated lysimeters fig 2 however this period did not contribute substantially to annual n leached likewise losses from the first two years at the non irrigated site which were primarily cut and carry showed consistent values of n leached this suggests that our interpretation of the effects of irrigation and grazing management and timing of drainage events on n leached is not likely compromised by soil disturbance outputs of n gas from denitrification and volatilization were not measured in the present study emission of nitrous oxide related to denitrification is of interest due to its impact as a potent greenhouse gas however from a n balance perspective n2o losses are generally low 6 11 kg n ha 1 y 1 for grazed ryegrass clover ledgard et al 2009 an additional relatively unknown quantity may be lost as dinitrogen gas resulting from complete denitrification saggar et al 2013 ammonia emissions are of greater potential consequence to the n balance at a study site within 10 km of the present site laubach et al 2013 found 25 loss of n urine and 12 loss from n dung through volatilization at the warmest time of the year the new zealand greenhouse gas inventory applies a 10 loss to inputs from animal excreta and fertilizers based on a review of chamber studies sherlock et al 2008 4 3 estimated net nitrogen balances the balances from measured inputs and outputs of n indicate a cumulative δn soil of 23 28 and 185 52 kg n ha 1 over the three years of measurement for non irrigated and irrigated lucerne respectively legume crops are typically associated with positive effects on δn soil due to n inputs through fixation previous measurements of lucerne indicate δn soil of 83 124 kg n ha 1 y 1 kelner et al 1997 however such positive effects on δn soil depend strongly on the intensity of harvest removals and often involve incorporation of plant residues into the soil estimation of belowground contributions of n fixation to the soil remains an important source of uncertainty in the effect of legumes on δn soil anglade et al 2015 in the current study both n gas and belowground n fixed were not measured lending uncertainty to our estimate of δn soil applying an estimate of 10 loss from n dung n urine and n effluent as n gas sherlock et al 2008 along with commonly used belowground correction factors may provide a likely range for δn soil with a relatively high belowground fixation correction factor of 2 both non irrigated lucerne sites accumulate n over the 3 year study 655 44 and 568 74 kg n ha 1 respectively at a relatively low correction factor of 1 3 non irrigated lucerne would gain 196 32 kg n ha 1 over 3 years while irrigated lucerne would be neutral at 1 8 57 kg n ha 1 although estimates of δn soil vary widely the trend that irrigated lucerne loses more gains less n is preserved due to the greater relative change in outputs of n compared to inputs resulting from irrigation and effluent application this is consistent with a national scale survey of paired pasture sites that showed lower n stocks for irrigated soils relative to non irrigated soils mudge et al 2017 4 4 carbon cycle interactions retention of n in soil organic matter is coupled strongly to the dynamics of c cycling castellano et al 2012 mooshammer et al 2014 schipper et al 2004 soussana and lemaire 2014 estimates of net c balance at our lucerne sites showed losses of 1 3 mg c ha 1 y 1 attributable to mineralization of soil organic matter laubach et al 2019 the largest losses were observed under irrigation and effluent application where water limitation to microbial mineralization is alleviated these enhanced c losses may explain in part the larger n leached under irrigation mineralization of soil organic matter which has a c n ratio of 10 5 at these rates would release a further 95 285 kg n ha 1y 1 which could be used by the crop or lost as n leached or n gas however such additional losses are not supported by current estimates of δn soil continued loss of soil c will lead to c and n imbalances in the soil reducing the n storage capacity and enhancing n loss through mineralization schipper et al 2004 microbial immobilization is an important mechanism for n retention in soils additions of labile c to the stony soils of the present study led to decreases in both soil mineral n concentration and n leached nascente et al 2021 talbot et al 2019 this effect is driven by stimulation of microbial activity and immobilization as biomass n conversely c limitation reduces microbial n use efficiency leading to reduced retention of n in biomass and enhanced mineralization resulting in increased losses mooshammer et al 2014 management practices which increase c inputs to the soil may have the benefit of increasing n retention and reducing leaching losses 5 conclusions over three full years of measurement annual n leached from irrigated and effluent treated lucerne was from 1 5 to nearly 15 times greater than that from non irrigated lucerne while fixation by lucerne was the largest input of n to both systems leaching losses associated with n fixed were small and n leached was driven primarily by external inputs of n from grazing animals and effluent application along with n inputs the dynamics of drainage affected n leached with drainage events occurring over summer months at the irrigated site contributing more substantially to n loss than those during the typical winter drainage season this has important implications for management as these events occurred during the irrigation season and careful water management could be used to minimize summer leaching estimates of the n balance of the soil plant system remain uncertain due to unquantified inputs from belowground n fixation and gaseous n losses however irrigation with water and effluent enhanced n outputs to a greater extent than inputs leading to lower values for soil n balance this is consistent with findings from national scale studies indicating lower soil n stocks under irrigation mudge et al 2017 these results demonstrate the risks associated with intensive management practices including irrigation effluent application and high animal stocking rates particularly on the shallow stony soils of our canterbury study site in addition to environmental impacts associated with higher n leaching there is also a risk to human health if the concentration of no3 in leachate entering surface and ground water from irrigated lucerne exceeds the safe drinking water standard of 11 3 mg no3 n l 1 ministry of health 2018 enhanced losses of both c and n from soil under irrigation also threaten to reduce soil quality and fertility with potential losses in productivity irrigation management practices which maintain a soil water deficit would limit growing season leaching events that contribute to high leaching losses

9830,intensification of agricultural management practices including irrigation and addition of nitrogen n fertilizers can lead to enhanced n leaching and loss of soil fertility in new zealand expansion of the dairy industry has rapidly increased irrigated land area particularly on shallow stony soils of the canterbury region that are prone to leaching leading to degradation of surface and ground water quality and losses of soil n and carbon c in this study we measure components of n balance for two adjacent fields of lucerne medicago sativa l alfalfa harvested for cut and carry feed and grazed in situ one field was non irrigated and one irrigated with both water and dairy effluent inputs from n fixation associated with the legume crop were quantified using a natural abundance isotopic approach drainage from the root zone and leaching were measured with 6 large lysimeters in each field leaching losses from non irrigated lucerne were 7 30 kg n ha 1 y 1 with the largest losses occurring in a year with primarily grazing management losses from irrigated lucerne were 39 102 kg n ha 1 y 1 with the largest losses resulting from summer drainage events exacerbated by irrigation fixation of n was the largest input to both systems contributing 192 257 kg n ha 1 y 1 for non irrigated lucerne under irrigation biomass production increased but n uptake from effluent and soil stocks contributed to biomass n to a greater extent and fixation was 262 286 kg n ha 1 y 1 management influenced n balance through inputs from animal excreta and effluent additions and exports through harvest and grazing removals management practices which reduce n losses from the soil are needed to minimize environmental impacts and protect soil fertility keywords nitrogen fixation leaching grazing effluent intensification alfalfa 1 introduction leaching of nitrogen n from agricultural soils impacts the quality of surface and groundwater and is a loss of valuable nutrients that could otherwise be utilized for crop growth understanding the relationships between inputs and outputs of n and their response to agricultural management practices particularly irrigation is critical for minimizing n leaching while maximizing production in this study field scale measurements of n inputs from biological nitrogen fixation effluent irrigation and animal excreta are balanced against outputs from leaching and grazing and harvest removals for irrigated and non irrigated lucerne medicago sativa l alfalfa grown on stony alluvial soils global intensification of agricultural management relies heavily upon irrigation and use of n fertilizers to improve crop yields mueller et al 2012 however irrigation can lead to increased drainage volumes duncan et al 2016 laubach et al 2019 while additions of n can result in n surplus and enhanced loss to groundwater lassaletta et al 2014 together drainage volume and n surplus are the primary drivers of n leaching blicher mathiesen et al 2014 di and cameron 2002b korsaeth and eltun 2000 pandey et al 2018 within forage systems in addition to chemical fertilizers n inputs from grazing animal excreta haynes and williams 1993 soussana and lemaire 2014 application of effluent houlbrooke et al 2004 and biological nitrogen fixation associated with legumes peoples et al 2009 all contribute to n inputs the total amount timing of application and chemical form of n in these inputs determine susceptibility to loss to the environment through leaching and gaseous pathways plant uptake and subsequent removal from the system through harvest and grazing or storage in the soil inputs from animals pose a particular risk for leaching as concentrated urine patches typically have n loads well in excess of plant requirements selbie et al 2015 the irrigated land area of new zealand has increased by more than 90 to nearly 800 000 ha over the past 15 years primarily to support expansion of the dairy industry ministry for the environment statistics new zealand 2018 this intensification of land use associated with irrigation has focused on the canterbury region where shallow stony soils are prone to leaching losses carrick et al 2013 and consequently nitrate leaching for the region is estimated to have doubled between 1990 and 2011 dymond et al 2013 in addition to enhanced n loss intensively managed irrigated pastoral soils have lost soil carbon c relative to adjacent non irrigated soils condron et al 2014 mudge et al 2017 this depletion of soil c may increase vulnerability of these systems to n loss as c is an important driver of microbial mechanisms for n retention in soils castellano et al 2012 mooshammer et al 2014 numerous strategies to reduce losses of both n and c have been proposed including changes in grazing management soussana and lemaire 2014 whitehead et al 2018 use of nitrification inhibitors williamson et al 1998 and use of alternative forage species or species mixtures malcolm et al 2014 rutledge et al 2017 lucerne is a legume which has high dry matter production and deep roots which allow water extraction from well below 2 m soil depth brown et al 2005 despite fixing n it has also been shown to extract n from deep in the soil profile kelner et al 1997 russelle et al 2001 lucerne has been used extensively as forage for dryland sheep and beef farms in new zealand moot 2012 however few measurements of leaching losses from lucerne have been conducted betteridge et al 2007 mcleod 2015 and none represent its use in intensive irrigated systems where extraction of water and nutrients at depth may serve to reduce n leaching the objective of this study was to quantify losses of n through leaching and crop harvest for two lucerne systems on stony alluvial soils under contrasting irrigation effluent and grazing management regimes we relate these losses to the quantity and chemical composition of inputs from n fixation dairy effluent and animal excreta to assess the potential effects of each management type on the soil n balance we further explore linkages between c and n cycling to identify potential for mitigation of n leaching losses through improved management practices 2 methods 2 1 study sites and management this study was carried out at the lincoln university ashley dene research and development station in central south island new zealand this 190 ha research farm is situated on glacial alluvium classified as typic orthic brown soil dystrudepts hewitt 2010 soil survey staff 2006 stony silt loam topsoils overlie sandy textured subsoil with a volumetric stone content of up to 70 graham et al 2019 in 2015 the farm was converted from low intensity dryland sheep and beef farming to intensive dairying two sites were selected for the current study one in a 14 ha area of non irrigated lucerne and the other within 15 ha of lucerne irrigated by a center pivot irrigator irrigation was applied at approximately 4 mm of water per pass of the irrigator with a 30 hour minimum return period dairy effluent was also applied to the irrigated site through a separate distribution system on the center pivot effluent was applied at a rate of approximately 2 mm per pass either along with or independent of irrigation water total n stocks in the top 1 5 m of soil were 12 0 and 9 4 mg n ha 1 at the non irrigated and irrigated site respectively for further details of the study sites see laubach et al 2019 for details of soil physical properties and water balance see graham et al 2019 the lucerne crop at each site was harvested 4 6 times per year either mechanically for cut and carry feed or by grazing throughout the first year of measurement october 2016 september 2017 year 1 both sites were harvested mechanically in mid december 2017 and early january 2018 year 2 the irrigated site was rotationally grazed by a herd of 172 dairy cows during each grazing event the cows were confined to small grazing strips within the larger field for a single day all other harvests were carried out mechanically the non irrigated site was rotationally grazed by 88 dairy cows in early june 2018 with all other harvests carried out mechanically during the final year of measurement october 2018 september 2019 year 3 the non irrigated site was rotationally grazed throughout the season by a herd of 90 cows with no mechanical harvests a mixed harvest management was continued at the irrigated site with grazing events occurring in may 2019 95 cows and again in september 2019 220 cows 2 2 biomass sampling and estimation of n fixation throughout the study period monthly samples of biomass were collected from ten randomly located points within each field vegetation was clipped to the soil surface within a 0 25 m2 quadrat at each location samples were dried at 60 c for at least 24 h and weighed similarly pre and post harvest samples were collected to determine the amounts of biomass removed by mechanical harvest and grazing subsequently harvested material was analyzed for total n content to determine the amount of n exported n export biological n fixation n fixed associated with the lucerne crop was estimated using a natural abundance δ15n approach which utilizes the distinct δ 15n signatures of biologically fixed n and other n sources in the soil unkovich et al 2008 the soil end member was estimated from the δ15n signature of n in aboveground biomass of a non fixing reference plant the end member representing pure n fixation was determined from the δ15n signature of lucerne grown in a glasshouse on n free media in september 2017 six pairs of 1 m2 plots were established within each the irrigated and non irrigated fields of each pair one plot was left as lucerne while the other was seeded with spitfire forage rape brassica napus l ssp biennis as brassica species have been identified as an appropriate non fixing reference crop for comparison with legume crops unkovich et al 2008 between late september 2017 and mid may 2018 these plots were sampled on seven occasions corresponding to harvests of the lucerne three individual plants were clipped to ground level in each plot these samples were bulked by plot dried at 60 c ground and analyzed for δ15n by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer europa scientific 20 20 sercon ltd crewe uk the reference plots initially failed to establish particularly at the non irrigated site thus broad leaved dock rumex obtusifolius l a common deep rooted weed species was used as the non fixing reference species until november 2017 in the irrigated field and february 2018 in the non irrigated field when the forage rape was sufficiently established where possible sampling of this species continued after establishment of the forage rape to ensure a similar δ15n signature was obtained for both species the fraction of n from fixation f fixed in field grown lucerne was estimated from a two end member mixing model uncertainty in f fixed was estimated from the variability in signatures of field grown lucerne and the two end members according to phillips and gregg 2001 estimated f fixed was applied in combination with the concentration of n in lucerne biomass to harvested dry matter to estimate the total amount of n fixed at each harvest date 2 3 lysimeter measurements drainage from the root zone and associated leaching of n n leached was measured by six large lysimeters located in each field the lysimeters were constructed in situ from undisturbed columns of soil already containing lucerne the soil was enclosed in a 2 m diameter high density polyethylene cylinder sealed to a perforated base plate at 1 5 m depth which allowed free drainage into a collection pan see carrick et al 2017 for further details of the lysimeter construction drainage volumes were recorded continuously by tipping spoons with a subsample of leachate continuously collected and sampled for chemical analysis following each drainage event drainage water was analyzed for total n no3 including no2 total ammoniacal n nh3 and nh4 henceforth simplified to nh4 and total organic c lysimeter installation was completed in september 2016 however drainage did not occur until april 2017 due to a summer with low rainfall grazing animals and machinery were excluded from the lysimeter area but lucerne within the lysimeters was managed to replicate that of the surrounding fields throughout the study 2 4 grazing and effluent inputs the amounts of n deposited by animals during grazing events as dung n dung and urine n urine were estimated based on animal numbers dry matter intake including supplemental feeds time spent grazing and estimated area volume and n concentration of dung and urine patches from selbie et al 2015 haynes and williams 1993 and luo and kelliher 2014 this was then used to guide application of both dung and urine to each lysimeter when practical a single application of urine and dung to the lysimeters was used to represent two grazing events this allowed for urine and dung to be applied to each lysimeter in natural patch sizes while still representing the n load to the wider field both the urine and dung were sampled and analyzed for total n no3 nh4 total organic c concentration and dry matter contents to determine the n input to the lysimeters inputs of n from effluent irrigation n effluent were estimated from three 2 m long 0 2 m wide troughs located adjacent to the lysimeters at the irrigated site liquid captured in the troughs was periodically sampled and analyzed for total n no3 nh4 and total organic c concentration 2 5 estimation of nitrogen balance and uncertainties annual change in whole system n was estimated from the balance of measured inputs from fixation effluent and grazing and outputs from harvest export and leaching according to 1 δ n soil n fixed n effluent n dung n urine n leached n export n gas where δn soil is the net change in soil n pool and n gas is the gaseous loss of n from the system through denitrification and volatilization which were not measured in the present study uncertainty in each of the n balance terms was estimated based on variability in the measurements for n export this included variability standard error of the mean sem of the biomass estimate and n concentration of biomass uncertainty in n fixed included that for n export with the additional variability of the isotopic partitioning uncertainty in n urine and ndung was assumed to be 5 a conservative estimate accounting for variability in n concentrations and dry matter content and possible errors arising during application to lysimeters the only source of error considered for n effluent was the variation in water input across the lysimeter site as only a single sample of effluent water was analyzed for each collection date the sem of the six lysimeters at each site was used to represent variability in n leached uncertainties were propagated into the annual δn soil estimate using root mean square error propagation additional unquantified uncertainties related to bias in measurements and the unmeasured n gas term are discussed further in section 4 3 results 3 1 climate and irrigation management the study took place over three years with distinctly different weather patterns although annual totals of water input from precipitation and irrigation were similar table 1 their seasonal distribution and patterns of drainage differed figs 1 2 year 1 october 2016 september 2017 included a summer drought with no drainage events occurring in either non irrigated or irrigated lucerne until april 2017 fig 2 this was followed by an unusually wet winter year 2 october 2017 september 2018 included large precipitation events during january and february and as a result drainage occurred throughout the year year 3 october 2018 september 2019 included a dry summer during which no drainage occurred followed by moderate winter precipitation resulting in relatively few leaching events these differences in seasonal water input contributed to large interannual variation in drainage volume for non irrigated lucerne despite the similarity of total annual precipitation for the three years drainage varied from 137 to 293 mm irrigation was applied from november to april each year in year 1 irrigation of 268 mm was applied by the pivot irrigator in year 2 416 mm of irrigation water was applied and a moderate amount 336 mm was applied in year 3 this irrigation contributed to drainage volumes 1 2 2 5 times greater than under non irrigated conditions table 1 the largest effect was measured in year 2 when the combination of increased soil water content from irrigation and large summer precipitation events contributed to substantial drainage during the growing season fig 2 3 2 lucerne biomass and n fixation annual aboveground dry matter production for non irrigated lucerne was 6 9 9 2 mg ha 1 y 1 table 1 fig 3 production was approximately 30 greater during year 2 which we attributed to substantial precipitation events over summer relative to year 1 and year 3 which each experienced summer drought periods the average n fraction of dry matter was 3 5 varying amongst harvests between 3 4 and 3 8 measured n export was 242 320 kg ha 1 y 1 annual dry matter harvested from irrigated lucerne showed less interannual variability 12 8 14 4 mg ha 1 y 1 with the lowest harvest amount occurring in year 1 when less irrigation was applied the n fraction of dry matter was similar to that for the non irrigated lucerne at 3 5 although more variable between harvest dates ranging from 3 0 to 3 8 n export from irrigated lucerne showed low interannual variation and was 461 496 kg n ha 1 y 1 the mean δ15n signature of lucerne biomass was 0 10 0 06 for the non irrigated site the δ15n of non fixing reference species was 3 10 0 34 and the δ15n signature for lucerne grown on n free media was 0 98 0 04 isotopically partitioned f fixed varied from 90 in spring to 68 in late summer fig 3 applying the seasonality of calculated f fixed to measurements of n export n fixed at the non irrigated site was 192 257 kg n ha 1 y 1 at the irrigated site lucerne had a δ15n of 1 18 0 26 while the non fixing reference species had a signature of 3 82 0 40 resulting f fixed was lower than that of non irrigated lucerne and varied between 66 in spring to 47 in autumn with a similar seasonality to that for non irrigated lucerne estimated n fixed was 262 286 kg n ha 1 y 1 for irrigated lucerne 3 3 grazing and effluent inputs grazing events in year 2 and 3 added n to both the non irrigated and irrigated lucerne sites table 1 additions of excreta to the non irrigated lysimeter site in june of year 2 corresponding with grazing in the surrounding paddock resulted in additions of 19 and 28 kg n ha 1 y 1 as dung and urine respectively the non irrigated lucerne was grazed throughout year 3 and additions of excreta were carried out in october january april and august to simulate inputs from these events fig 2 for year 3 total inputs as n dung and n urine were 53 and 134 kg n ha 1 respectively the irrigated lucerne was grazed twice during the summer of year 2 to represent the areal coverage of dung and urine patches over the course of the two events using standard patch sizes an amount equivalent to n dung of 28 kg n ha 1 and n urine of 84 kg n ha 1 was added to the lysimeters in december in year 3 grazing of the irrigated lucerne was carried out in may and september adding 19 and 49 kg n ha 1 as dung and urine respectively the c n ratios of dung and urine samples were 16 1 0 8 and 1 8 0 3 kg kg 1 from february 2017 onwards the irrigated field received regular n inputs from effluent application fig 1 in year 1 n effluent was 73 kg n ha 1 y 1 table 1 in year 2 addition of n effluent was increased to 147 kg n ha 1 y 1 and further increased to 205 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 3 while inputs of n dung and n urine were predominantly organic forms of n n effluent on average was comprised of 54 ammoniacal n with the remainder as organic forms and negligible amounts of no3 1 the c n ratio of effluent was 3 4 0 2 kg kg 1 fig 2 3 4 leachate composition the mean concentration of n in leachate samples from lysimeters in non irrigated lucerne was 6 7 mg n l 1 varying from 1 6 to 37 0 mg n l 1 the highest concentrations were observed during year 3 when the site was grazed throughout the season with no mechanical harvests cumulative annual n leached for non irrigated lucerne was 7 30 kg n ha 1 y 1 table 1 fig 2 n leached was more than three times greater during year 3 when the site was grazed compared to the previous years with primarily mechanical harvests the dominant form of mineral n in leachate was no3 with the samples containing negligible amounts of nh4 the mean concentration of no3 in leachate samples from non irrigated lucerne was 3 9 mg no3 n l 1 and varied from 0 1 35 mg no3 n l 1 following a similar temporal pattern to total n the contribution of no3 to the total n loss increased over time from 20 in year 1 44 in year 2 and 87 in year 3 fig 2 the remaining fraction of n leached was organic forms of n the ratio of no3 n to total n was related inversely to the c n ratio of leachate explaining 85 of the variability of c n the c n of leachate from non irrigated lucerne declined from 10 8 in year 1 1 8 in year 3 the mean concentration of n in leachate samples from the lysimeters in irrigated lucerne was 18 0 mg n l 1 varying from 2 3 to 150 0 mg n l 1 the highest concentrations were observed during leaching events which occurred over summer of year 2 cumulative annual n loss through leaching for the irrigated site was 39 102 kg n ha 1 y 1 table 1 fig 2 n leached was greatest in year 2 resulting from large losses during summer leaching events substantial variation amongst the six lysimeters also accumulated over this period as with the non irrigated lysimeters no3 was the dominant form of mineral n at the irrigated site and the mean concentration of no3 in leachate samples was 14 7 mg n l 1 varying from 0 1 150 0 mg n l 1 the ratio of no3 n to total n initially resembled that for the non irrigated site fig 2 the fraction of no3 rapidly increased following approximately 98 mm of drainage or approximately equal to the water storage volume of the 1 5 m soil profile estimated as 96 mm from a profile array of soil water content sensors the contribution of no3 to cumulative n leached was 72 during year 1 89 in year 2 and 84 in year 3 similar to the non irrigated site the ratio of no3 n to total n in leachate from the irrigated lysimeters was closely related to the c n ratio of leachate explaining 95 of the variability of c n the c n of leachate resembled that for the non irrigated site but decreased below 5 following drainage equivalent to the storage volume of the soil then remained low varying around 1 5 for the remainder of the study 3 5 soil n balance the balance of measured inputs from n fixed n effluent n urine and n dung and losses from n leached and n export indicate a δn soil which varied from a net loss of 62 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 1 to a net gain of 107 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 3 for non irrigated lucerne table 1 at the irrigated site total measured n input was 60 greater than that at the non irrigated site while n outputs were 85 greater δnsoil varied from a loss of 161 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 1 to a marginal gain of 18 kg n ha 1 y 1 in year 3 4 discussion 4 1 effects of management on nitrogen inputs for both non irrigated and irrigated lucerne n fixed was the largest input of n to the system annual n fixed in harvested dry matter of 192 286 kg n ha 1 y 1 corresponds well with estimates of n fixed in above ground plant components from other studies measurements from a nearby field site found n fixed of non irrigated lucerne to be equivalent to 200 kg n ha 1 y 1 berenji et al 2015 a survey of organic farms in france found n fixed in shoots of lucerne to be 274 60 kg n ha 1 y 1 anglade et al 2015 irrigated lucerne in australia fixed 222 kg n ha 1 y 1 in aboveground biomass yang et al 2011 although dry matter production of irrigated lucerne over the study period was 73 greater than that of non irrigated lucerne n fixed was only 24 greater this is due to the substantially lower f fixed in response to additional n from effluent additions a finding typical for legumes carlsson and huss danell 2003 irrigation also leads to enhanced mineralization of organic matter curtin et al 2012 which may also increase availability of n in the soil and suppress fixation particularly late in the growing season when mineralization rate in non irrigated soil is water limited in the current study estimates of n fixation were based on aboveground biomass which was subsequently removed by harvest or grazing however lucerne has substantial and seasonally dynamic belowground biomass teixeira et al 2009 that acts as a reservoir for fixed n likewise fine root turnover transfers n to the soil organic matter pool previous studies have estimated additions to the soil of up to 60 kg n ha 1 y 1 through turnover of lucerne roots goins and russelle 1996 whole plant n fixed is often estimated by multiplying measured above ground n fixed by a correction factor to account for unmeasured accumulation in roots this factor typically ranges from 1 3 to 2 anglade et al 2015 kelner et al 1997 unkovich et al 2010 with a moderate factor of 1 7 total n fixed would increase to 350 452 kg n ha 1 y 1 in the present study however these factors are often based on root to shoot ratios of unharvested plants and it is uncertain how well they represent belowground allocation of n for repeatedly harvested crops the correction factor is also likely to differ with irrigation and effluent management as previous studies in forage grasslands have shown that irrigation and fertilizer addition while increasing aboveground production does not affect belowground productivity scott et al 2012 the proportional contribution of inputs from grazing animals and effluent addition to the n balance increased over the 3 years of measurements for the non irrigated lucerne excreta from grazing animals contributed nearly half of the total n input during the final year of measurements for the irrigated lucerne the increased annual rate of effluent application and the change of management practice from mechanical harvest to grazing over the course of the study led to an increase in the contribution of external n to the total n input from 20 in year 1 to nearly 50 in year 3 4 2 effects of management on nitrogen exports and losses export of n by harvest and grazing of lucerne was the largest component of the n balance of both the irrigated and non irrigated field due to the substantially greater dry matter production of the irrigated lucerne and consequent higher harvest frequency n export was 73 larger under irrigation and effluent addition relative to that for the non irrigated lucerne the prevailing importance of harvest removal in regulating soil organic matter dynamics has been documented previously for these forage systems hunt et al 2016 laubach et al 2019 moinet et al 2017 while removing smaller amounts of n from the system relative to harvest nleached is critically important for the potential for environmental impacts under primarily cut and carry management n leached of 7 9 kg n ha 1 y 1 for non irrigated lucerne compares well with the previous estimates for a lucerne crop in new zealand of 5 20 kg n ha 1 y 1 betteridge et al 2007 mcleod 2015 the transition to grazing in the final year of the study led to a more than three times greater value of n leached annual n leached of 30 kg n ha 1 y 1 under grazed non irrigated lucerne resembled that of other grazed grasslands cameron et al 2013 monaghan et al 2005 irrigation of lucerne with water and effluent resulted in n leached of 39 kg n ha 1 y 1 under exclusively cut and carry management four times greater than the annual total for the non irrigated lucerne in a previous study of lysimeters planted with perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l and white clover trifolium repens l receiving irrigation and additions of dairy shed effluent equivalent to 400 kg n ha 1 leaching was only 18 kg n ha 1 y 1 although higher losses of 78 kg n ha 1 y 1 were observed in a year where results were confounded by pasture renewal di and cameron 2002a this disparity may be due to the higher demand for n of the non fixing ryegrass relative to that for a legume crop it is also likely that effluent applications over the autumn and winter months when lucerne growth rate is reduced contributed to higher n losses in subsequent measurement years increased effluent addition and the more frequent grazing increased the external n input to the system and contributed to n leached of 44 102 kg n ha 1 y 1 these losses fall well within the range of values reported for other irrigated forage systems under grazing with various effluent and fertilizer management practices of 30 162 kg n ha 1 y 1 di and cameron 2002a silva et al 1999 given the variability in effluent and grazing management as well as drainage characteristics across the measurement years it is difficult to attribute the effects on n leached to any one factor however timing of drainage events appears to play an important role in the interannual variability in n leached for irrigated lucerne during year 2 of the study large drainage events in january and february summer contributed a loss of 60 kg n ha 1 with 42 kg n ha 1 leached throughout the remainder of the year despite the fact that only a third of the annual drainage volume resulted from these events while this may be due in part to additions of n dung and n urine from grazing during the preceding month it may also be due to the higher mobility of n at times when warm soil temperatures contributed to greater microbial activity and mineralization rates previous analysis of n leached in grazed grasslands have shown that n urine deposited over summer and autumn months is more vulnerable to loss through leaching cichota et al 2013 this has important management implications as drainage events which occur within the irrigation season could be potentially minimized through careful management of irrigation not only the quantity but also the chemical composition of n leached varied with management practices under cut and carry management without external inputs of n from excreta or effluent n leached was primarily composed of organic forms of n with a c n ratio indicating origins from plant biomass c n 12 2 and soil organic matter c n 10 5 these losses of organic matter are driven primarily by the volume of drainage moving through the soil similar to that for organic c laubach et al 2019 with addition of n effluent to irrigated lucerne and with increased frequency of grazing at both sites n leached was primarily in the form of no3 this indicates the importance of these external inputs of n in driving no3 leaching and its association with both health and environmental risks the predominance of no3 in leachate also indicates that external inputs of n underwent microbial transformation before leaving the root zone as n effluent n dung and n urine were primarily in the forms of nh4 and organic n nitrification of nh4 in grazing animal urine has been shown to occur over a period of weeks haynes and williams 1992 observations from the lysimeters show drainage commencing within less than 1 day following large rain events it was also common for effluent to be applied leading up to rain events as a practical measure for preventing overflow of the storage pond creating conditions conducive to rapid transport of effluent through the soil however the absence of nh4 in the leachate suggests that under this management system rapid bypass flow through the stony soil is not contributing substantially to n leached previous research suggested this as a potential risk for stony soils carrick et al 2014 mcleod et al 2014 although we cannot completely rule out an of influence preferential flow pathways it may be the low soil volume due to the high stone content and thus low storage capacity for n which leads to enhanced n losses from these soils one potential limitation to our interpretation of the quantity and chemical composition of n leached is that soil disturbance is known to affect n losses cultivation caused a one time loss of 10 15 kg n ha 1 in lysimeters planted with lucerne mcleod 2015 similar losses may have been expected from soil disturbance caused by lysimeter construction organic n losses from severed roots may have contributed to the higher c n ratio and greater organic n content of the first pore volume of leachate collected from the irrigated lysimeters fig 2 however this period did not contribute substantially to annual n leached likewise losses from the first two years at the non irrigated site which were primarily cut and carry showed consistent values of n leached this suggests that our interpretation of the effects of irrigation and grazing management and timing of drainage events on n leached is not likely compromised by soil disturbance outputs of n gas from denitrification and volatilization were not measured in the present study emission of nitrous oxide related to denitrification is of interest due to its impact as a potent greenhouse gas however from a n balance perspective n2o losses are generally low 6 11 kg n ha 1 y 1 for grazed ryegrass clover ledgard et al 2009 an additional relatively unknown quantity may be lost as dinitrogen gas resulting from complete denitrification saggar et al 2013 ammonia emissions are of greater potential consequence to the n balance at a study site within 10 km of the present site laubach et al 2013 found 25 loss of n urine and 12 loss from n dung through volatilization at the warmest time of the year the new zealand greenhouse gas inventory applies a 10 loss to inputs from animal excreta and fertilizers based on a review of chamber studies sherlock et al 2008 4 3 estimated net nitrogen balances the balances from measured inputs and outputs of n indicate a cumulative δn soil of 23 28 and 185 52 kg n ha 1 over the three years of measurement for non irrigated and irrigated lucerne respectively legume crops are typically associated with positive effects on δn soil due to n inputs through fixation previous measurements of lucerne indicate δn soil of 83 124 kg n ha 1 y 1 kelner et al 1997 however such positive effects on δn soil depend strongly on the intensity of harvest removals and often involve incorporation of plant residues into the soil estimation of belowground contributions of n fixation to the soil remains an important source of uncertainty in the effect of legumes on δn soil anglade et al 2015 in the current study both n gas and belowground n fixed were not measured lending uncertainty to our estimate of δn soil applying an estimate of 10 loss from n dung n urine and n effluent as n gas sherlock et al 2008 along with commonly used belowground correction factors may provide a likely range for δn soil with a relatively high belowground fixation correction factor of 2 both non irrigated lucerne sites accumulate n over the 3 year study 655 44 and 568 74 kg n ha 1 respectively at a relatively low correction factor of 1 3 non irrigated lucerne would gain 196 32 kg n ha 1 over 3 years while irrigated lucerne would be neutral at 1 8 57 kg n ha 1 although estimates of δn soil vary widely the trend that irrigated lucerne loses more gains less n is preserved due to the greater relative change in outputs of n compared to inputs resulting from irrigation and effluent application this is consistent with a national scale survey of paired pasture sites that showed lower n stocks for irrigated soils relative to non irrigated soils mudge et al 2017 4 4 carbon cycle interactions retention of n in soil organic matter is coupled strongly to the dynamics of c cycling castellano et al 2012 mooshammer et al 2014 schipper et al 2004 soussana and lemaire 2014 estimates of net c balance at our lucerne sites showed losses of 1 3 mg c ha 1 y 1 attributable to mineralization of soil organic matter laubach et al 2019 the largest losses were observed under irrigation and effluent application where water limitation to microbial mineralization is alleviated these enhanced c losses may explain in part the larger n leached under irrigation mineralization of soil organic matter which has a c n ratio of 10 5 at these rates would release a further 95 285 kg n ha 1y 1 which could be used by the crop or lost as n leached or n gas however such additional losses are not supported by current estimates of δn soil continued loss of soil c will lead to c and n imbalances in the soil reducing the n storage capacity and enhancing n loss through mineralization schipper et al 2004 microbial immobilization is an important mechanism for n retention in soils additions of labile c to the stony soils of the present study led to decreases in both soil mineral n concentration and n leached nascente et al 2021 talbot et al 2019 this effect is driven by stimulation of microbial activity and immobilization as biomass n conversely c limitation reduces microbial n use efficiency leading to reduced retention of n in biomass and enhanced mineralization resulting in increased losses mooshammer et al 2014 management practices which increase c inputs to the soil may have the benefit of increasing n retention and reducing leaching losses 5 conclusions over three full years of measurement annual n leached from irrigated and effluent treated lucerne was from 1 5 to nearly 15 times greater than that from non irrigated lucerne while fixation by lucerne was the largest input of n to both systems leaching losses associated with n fixed were small and n leached was driven primarily by external inputs of n from grazing animals and effluent application along with n inputs the dynamics of drainage affected n leached with drainage events occurring over summer months at the irrigated site contributing more substantially to n loss than those during the typical winter drainage season this has important implications for management as these events occurred during the irrigation season and careful water management could be used to minimize summer leaching estimates of the n balance of the soil plant system remain uncertain due to unquantified inputs from belowground n fixation and gaseous n losses however irrigation with water and effluent enhanced n outputs to a greater extent than inputs leading to lower values for soil n balance this is consistent with findings from national scale studies indicating lower soil n stocks under irrigation mudge et al 2017 these results demonstrate the risks associated with intensive management practices including irrigation effluent application and high animal stocking rates particularly on the shallow stony soils of our canterbury study site in addition to environmental impacts associated with higher n leaching there is also a risk to human health if the concentration of no3 in leachate entering surface and ground water from irrigated lucerne exceeds the safe drinking water standard of 11 3 mg no3 n l 1 ministry of health 2018 enhanced losses of both c and n from soil under irrigation also threaten to reduce soil quality and fertility with potential losses in productivity irrigation management practices which maintain a soil water deficit would limit growing season leaching events that contribute to high leaching losses such deficit irrigation practices may also serve to limit microbial mineralization of both c and n preserving capacity for n retention in the soil declaration of competing interest the authors declare

management practices bmps generally used to counteract soil erosion in achieving nutrient load reduction and evaluate their economic convenience in the private and public sector the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to model point and diffuse nutrient sources in the carapelle basin apulia italy and to simulate bmp scenarios contour farming cf no tillage nt reforestation rf and two additional scenarios including the 20 reduction of fertilizers in cf and nt cfr and ntr were simulated following the eugd strategy for the current land uses the riverine export of nitrogen tn and phosphorous tp were 49 kg ha 1y 1 and 0 044 kg ha 1y 1 respectively cf and nt increased n no3 load both into surface runoff and in terms of leaching conversely rf showed a reduction of n no3 losses cfr and ntr scenarios decreased n no3 load both in surface runoff and leached of 20 cfr and ntr represented the best alternative among the analyzed scenarios both for their lower production costs at the farm level and for their savings in terms of nutrient and soil losses rf was economically profitable in sloped areas thus representing bmps that may be implemented in combination with other

apulia italy the results demonstrated that bmps can be effective to reduce soil erosion but their implementation requires significant investments public and private and that further studies are needed to analyze their impact on water quality the ultimate goal of this work is to provide a framework for an integrated analysis of bmps including water quality soil erosion and economic aspects it serves

forests and pastures are prevalent in uplands 2 2 model hydrology sediment yield and nutrients swat a semi distributed continuous hydrological model arnold et al 1998 developed by the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 2012a was used in this study to assess streamflow sediment and nutrient loads as well as to evaluate the effect of bmps on water the 2015 swat version winchell et al 2013 was set up and run for eight years 2004 2011 at a daily timescale including a three year warming up period 2004 2006 ricci et al 2020 to estimate the potential evapotranspiration the hargreaves method hargreaves 1975 was used for watershed delineation purposes swat divides the basin area into sub basins and then further divides the sub basins into hydrological response units hrus which are the minimum territorial unit of the model defined as homogenous areas by land use slope and soil characteristics arnold et al 2012b the dimension of the basin and the resolution 20 m of the digital elevation model dem were taken into consideration to select the threshold of 200 ha used for basin delineation this generated 115 sub basins representing the main topographical features of the study areas subsequently the proportion of the main soil types slope classes and land uses were analyzed to define the thresholds in hru determination percentage thresholds of 5 25 and 25 for soil slope and land use respectively were selected to create 451 hrus ricci et al 2020 for each hru the swat model simulates the surface runoff with the modified soil conservation service curve number method scs cn united states department of agriculture 1972 the sediment yield by the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 and the nutrient cycle by a mass balance neitsch et al 2011 subsequently the model computes the channel processes the manning s equation is used to determine the stream velocity and the discharge relationship in addition a simplified version of the bagnold s stream power relationship bagnold 1977 is used to simulate sediment degradation or deposition in the channel water quality equations taken from the qual2e model brown and barnwell 1987 are used to simulate nutrients in the stream a detailed description of the model and more theoretical information can be found in neitsch et al 2011 swat needs several measures and input data for its calibration as well as validation that may constitute a limit for its application brouziyne et al 2021 the input data used to set up the model are listed in table 1 the management files mgt were modified according to the collected data table 1 for winter wheat a 4 year crop rotation wheat wheat wheat clover was considered planting in november and harvesting in july ploughing 25 40 cm depth and harrowing were carried out in august and october respectively in mountainous areas slope 15 ploughing perpendicular to the contour lines was generally adopted the fertilizer was applied in december fertilizer grade 25 15 00 amount 180 220 kg ha 1 and february urea amount 100 140 kg ha 1 for olives two fertilizer applications were adopted in december manure and in spring fertilizer grade 26 00 00 amount 90 110 kg ha 1 and three shallow tillage operations ploughing and harrowing were executed every two months starting in april whereas the plants were harvested in november aquilino et al 2014 abdelwahab et al 2016 2 3 calibration and validation the swat model was calibrated first for the streamflow arnold et al 2015 then for sediment load and finally for nutrients the daily dataset of observed streamflow and sediment load 2007 2011 were divided into two sub datasets used for calibration january 2007 to april 2009 and validation january 2010 to december 2011 respectively ricci et al 2020 with regard to nutrients tn n no3 tp p po4 due to the limited data availability the whole dataset was used for calibrating the model calibration was performed changing the nutrient parameter relative to tn n no3 tp p po4 the usle p factor erosion management practice factor varying 0 1 was set to 1 0 because no conservation practices were applied in the watershed to identify the sensitive parameters for each calibrated variable a swat cup tool was used to perform the sensitivity analysis via the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 abbaspour et al 2015 more details about the procedure adopted for the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation can be found in ricci et al 2018 thereafter swat cup was applied firstly to improve the correspondence between the simulated and the observed curves manually changing the model parameters jeong et al 2010 and then to identify the best set of parameters with an automatic procedure selecting a nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse greater than 0 5 as an objective function table 2 illustrates the list of the calibrated parameter for nutrients the model performance was evaluated at the daily time step considering acceptable values of r2 and nse greater than 0 5 and of percent bias pbias less than or equal to 25 for runoff less than or equal to 55 for sediment and less than or equal to 70 for nutrients moriasi et al 2007 furl et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2017 melaku et al 2018 woo et al 2021 2 4 defining bmp characteristics the analysis of the apulia region s psr 2014 rural development program psr 2014 2020 and national regulation dm 2490 2017 of the ministry of agricultural food and forestry policies mipaaf mipaaf 2017 points out that contour farming cf no tillage nt and reforestation rf are the main bmps applied in rural areas ricci et al 2020 cf as defined by the natural resources conservation service nrcs is a practice in which tillage follows contour lines with a consequent reduction of the surface runoff and an increment of infiltration gilley 2004 usda nscs 2017 cf leads to a reduction in soil erosion processes e g sheet and rills and to the abatement of p and n compounds transported with sediment gassman et al 2006 stevens et al 2009 in contrast n no3 loads conveyed in the subsurface runoff may be higher than in conventional tillage xia et al 2014 moreover the increase in infiltration can correspond to an increment of the n no3 leaching into groundwater follett 1995 gassman et al 2006 cf begins to lose its effect for slopes greater than 8 and must be replaced with other bmps in areas with a slope greater than 20 where the risk of tractors overturning is high abubakar et al 2010 liu et al 2013 farmers in central italy in particular in the hills in the apennines and sub apennines have been using cf since the early 1900 s referring to it with the local name of girapoggio bazzoffi et al 2011 nt is a conservative practice consisting of planting or seeding directly on the residue left on soil after carrying out only in row operations e g drilling or furrowing without executing deep tillage such as ploughing usda nscs 2017 nt reduces soil erosion by decreasing the surface runoff and increasing soil infiltration ullrich and volk 2009a generally tp and n no3 in surface runoff are reduced verbree et al 2010 delaune and sij 2012 trewavas 2004 meanwhile n no3 leached in groundwater may increase daryanto et al 2017a however daryanto et al 2017a also observed an increment in n no3 in surface runoff despite its overall positive effects on the cropping systems de vita et al 2007 nt is still not widely used in southern italy as compared to the central or northern plain areas cavalchini et al 2013 lastly rf is definable as a land use change luc from a land use prone to soil erosion to another less prone bakker et al 2008 rf induces a positive effect on the multifunctionality of the agro environment such as reduced soil erosion improved water quality new wildlife habitat and wood production the national forest and carbon inventory infc pointed out that the surface covered by forests increased after the second world war and that an increment of 20 was recorded over the past 20 years national forest and carbon inventory infc 2015 the calibrated and validated swat model for the current land use and management practices was set as actual ac scenario cf nt and rf were simulated in the carapelle basin as three different scenarios to reduce soil erosion by water as reported in a previous paper ricci et al 2020 in the present work their implications in terms of water quality were analyzed in addition considering that both cf and nt can limit the loss of nutrients in surface water while increasing n no3 leaching into the groundwater two additional scenarios i e cfr and ntr were simulated to reduce the use of fertilizers by 20 as suggested by the farm to fork strategy european commission ec 2020 the effects of these scenarios in reducing nutrients were then evaluated in terms of loads kg ha 1 y 1 at basin sub basin and hrus scales 2 5 modeling bmp scenarios since one of the aims of this work was to assess the impact of soil erosion control bmps on nutrients losses 59 hrus were used as target areas based on a threshold of high erosion risk of 10 mg ha 1 y 1 panagos and katsoyiannis 2019 ricci et al 2020 in addition a threshold of 20 slope limit of tractor overturning was considered to further select the areas where cf was applicable it is difficult to till areas with a slope higher than 20 using traditional techniques zhang et al 2014 so these areas were converted to forests in the rf scenario ricci et al 2020 therefore cf and cfr were applied to 44 hrus nt and ntr to 59 hrus and rf to 15 hrus to simulate management practices in the bmp scenarios some parameters were appropriately adapted in the swat model ni and parajuli 2018 ricci et al 2020 according to several authors arabi et al 2008 tuppad et al 2010 wang et al 2018a cn and usle p factors were modified in the cf scenario the new values were assigned following the work done by arnold et al 2012b to implement nt tillage operations were removed in the target hrus ullrich and volk 2009a the biological soil mixing efficiency biomix and the manning s roughness coefficient for overland flow ov n were increased to 0 4 and 0 320 respectively neitsch et al 2011 cn was decreased by a two point value mtibaa et al 2018 since rf is a luc practice as described above the land use of the 15 target hrus was changed from winter wheat to forest betrie et al 2011 accordingly cn was also modified by entering values relative to forested areas retrieved by arnold et al 2012b finally cfr and ntr were implemented by reducing the fertilization of cf and nt by 20 fig 2 provides an overview of the criteria adopted to discretize the target areas the number of hrus involved in every bmp scenario and the swat parameter modified to implement the described scenarios results obtained from the different bmp scenarios were analyzed at a basin sub basin and hru scale 2 6 economic assessment in this work the methodology developed by ricci et al 2020 to analyze the economic feasibility of bmp scenarios for soil loss reduction was applied considering both the field farmers and the basin scale at the field level the farm return fr

unit price sup by the yield of the crop increased or decreased depending on the slope and bmp liu et al 2014a mtibaa et al 2018 concerning the crop yield since no calibration was possible under the bmps for the study area two different computations were carried out by using the crop yield predicted by swat and yield from literature 3 mg ha 1 y 1 psr 2014 agricultural census 2010 respectively based on literature ricci et al 2020 liu et al 2014b for a slope less than 20 winter wheat yield was increased by 5 and 10 for cf and nt respectively by converse for steep slope areas the yield was reduced by 10 ricci et al 2020 subsidies s planned by the cap or psr were also added ricci et al 2020 the specific production cost spc euro ha 1 was calculated considering the conventional average tillage cost retrieved from farmers surveys and industry magazines https terraevita edagricole it increased or decreased depending on slope as well as on the bmp considered de vita et al 2007 liu et al 2014a in addition the costs of investments and transactions necessary to switch from conventional to bmps were added as reported by the farmers survey and psr psr 2014 ricci et al 2020 at the basin level the impact of bmp application was determined by considering the total practice cost tpc euro for the public sector the soil loss cost slc euro and the crop productivity loss cpl euro panagos et al 2018 ricci et al 2020 tpc corresponded to the sum of the subsidies s provided by the public sector at the basin scale slc was obtained by the unit value of soil of 20 panagos et al 2015 converted and discounted at the time of the study ricci et al 2020 multiplied by the annual sediment load t y 1 finally cpl was calculated by multiplying crop area ca ha crop productivity cp mg ha 1 land productivity loss lpl and sup euro mg 1 where lpl is equal to severe erosion areas 10 mg ha 1 sea ha divided by the total agricultural areas taa ha of the basin and then multiplied by the value of crop productivity loss in intensively cultivated fields 0 08 panagos et al 2018 as to cfr and ntr the unit cost of fertilization ucf which included both the price of the fertilizers and the costs of the machinery and operators was separated from spc using the information retrieved from farmers surveys and industry magazines https terraevita edagricole it sfr was recalculated by considering the reduction of crop yield 7 derived by the implementation of bmps with a fertilizer reduction the percentage of reduction with respect to cf and nt was determined by analyzing the swat model results in terms of the average yield for the areas under cfr and ntr at the basin scale the impact of the application of bmps was recalculated for all the scenarios implemented in this study cf nt rf cfr ntr including the economic value of tn losses vnl by applying the replacement cost criteria la notte et al 2017 panagos et al 2018 this method entails evaluating an asset based on the cost that must be incurred to replace tn losses the price of urea n content 46 the most used fertilizer was utilized to calculate the n unit price nup euro kg 1 through a proportion nitrogen nitrate losses tnl kg were determined by summing n no3 loads in surface runoff and in leachate vnl was then obtained by multiplying nup by tnl table 3 shows all the income and costs considered in the economic analysis 3 results

unsatisfactory nse table 4 discrepancies among the measured and simulated streamflow and nutrient loads especially in summer could be attributed to the point sources data which were considered constant on a monthly time scale in the simulation at the same time they could vary from one day to another in addition the overestimation and or underestimation of the streamflow may influence the results of sediment load and nutrient performance at a daily timescale floods were generally lightly underestimated in the calibration period pbias 5 3 whereas the baseflow was overestimated in the driest year of the validation period pbias 17 2 fig 3 a b c d shows specific simulated and measured nutrient loads for the calibration period tn and n no3 were generally well simulated in the wet season and underestimated in the dry season when tp and p po4 loads were overestimated the highest nutrient loads measured in surface waters over the observed period occurred on october 26th 2010 4882 kg for tn 3039 kg for n no3 98 kg for tp and 63 kg for p po4 when the corresponding simulated values were 4663 kg for tn 3071 kg for n no3 98 kg for tp and 50 kg for p po4 for the study period the mean annual actual evapotranspiration was 470 mm corresponding to 71 of the rainfall 662 mm romanazzi et al 2015 estimated similar values of evapotranspiration for the apulia region surface runoff and total water yield were 86 mm 17 of the rainfall and 180 mm 27 of the rainfall respectively at the basin scale the simulated mean specific sediment load was 5 95 mg ha 1 y 1 mainly concentrated in the wet season december to april 3 2 modeling bmp scenarios at the basin scale the loss of organic component org n n no3 flowing into surface waters and n no3 leached past to the bottom layer of soil leachn no3 were analyzed for the current and bmp scenarios cf cfr nt ntr rf for ac the annual average specific loads were 3 841 kg ha 1 y 1 for n no3 43 366 for leachn no3 2 001 for org n and 0 044 kg ha 1 y 1 for tp table 5 at the basin scale ntr and cfr were the most effective bmps in reducing n no3 revealing a decline of 17 52 and 16 45 respectively rf showed an abatement of 3 54 whereas cf and nt showed an increase of 5 5 and 4 26 respectively similarly leachn no3 was reduced by 26 55 in the ntr scenario by 26 17 in cfr and 4 13 in rf incrementing by 2 60 in cf and by 2 06 in nt org n decreased in all the scenarios ntr 20 5 whereas nt 19 exhibited the higher reduction followed by cfr 16 cf 15 and rf 12 table 5 all the bmp scenarios showed a reduction in terms of tp load with the exception of nt which increased slightly 2 2 cfr was the most efficient bmp in reducing tp loads 11 4 followed by cf rf and ntr with a percentage of 9 1 4 5 and 2 3 respectively table 5 figs 4 and 5 show n no3 kg ha 1 y 1 and tp kg ha 1 y 1 the primary sources of water pollution fao 2018 delivered to the river at the sub basin scale specific n no3 load in ac ranged from 0 38 to 10 55 kg ha 1 y 1 showing a preponderance of higher values in medium or steep slope areas fig 4 in cf and nt the increment in specific n no3 load 17 38 and 14 67 respectively was mainly related to the south east sub basins i e sub basins 70 73 76 85 fig 4 conversely rf cfr and ntr showed an overall reduction across the basin including in sloped areas fig 4 in particular within the targeted hrus rf produced a higher reduction 18 70 followed by ntr 9 60 and cfr 7 22 tp ranged from 0 02 to 0 43 kg ha 1 y 1 in ac displaying the highest loads in the hilly or steep sloped areas fig 5 in the same areas all bmp scenarios showed an abatement of tp loads fig 5 upon analyzing the treated hrus in the sub basins cf and cfr proved most effective in reducing tp loads 27 36 and 26 03 respectively rf resulted in a reduction of 25 13 while ntr and nt led to a lower reduction of 21 22 and 21 05 respectively at the farm hru level agricultural fields are known to have a great influence on leachn no3 fao 2018 curk et al 2020 fig 6 a b depicts leachn no3 and tp yields delivered to the river in the analyzed scenarios the median leachn no3 value for ac was 44 04 kg ha 1 lower than cf 53 23 kg ha 1 y 1 and then nt 51 15 kg ha 1 y 1 cfr and ntr were found to be the two most efficient scenarios with the median values of 37 09 kg ha 1 y 1and 35 00 kg ha 1 y 1 respectively rf showed a median value of leachn no3 to 42 83 kg ha 1 y 1 fig 6a tp yields to surface water were reduced in each bmp scenario compared to ac fig 6b ac showed a median value of tp of 0 20 kg ha 1 y 1 whereas rf was less effective 0 18 kg ha 1 y 1 nt and ntr emerged as the most efficient bmps both reducing tp at 0 14 kg ha 1 y 1 cf and cfr exhibited a slightly lower reduction with a median value of 0 15 kg ha 1 y 1 for both it is important to remember that only 15 hrus 1988 ha were converted to a forest in the rf scenario additional details on sediment yield obtained for the different scenarios can be found in ricci et al 2020 3 3 economic feasibility the economic analysis was carried out both at the field and the basin scale by using literature values for crop yield table 6 and model results table a1 appendix a as to the literature approach ricci et al 2020 liu et al 2014b results are shown in table 6 dividing the target hrus into two slope classes based on the limit threshold found for cf ac was economically sustainable only in gentle slope areas 20 with an fr pc ratio of 1 12 table 6 on the other hand for steep slopes 20 the fr pc ratio was 0 93 cf and cfr applied only in areas with a slope less than 20 showing fr pc values very similar to ac 1 11 and 1 09 respectively for the same slope class nt and ntr were economically more convenient despite the investment costs required for the transition the benefit cost ratio fr pc was 1 67 for nt and 1 66 for ntr net of the investment cost and lost income for the first 12 years the minimum period before first cutting rf was the most economically profitable bmp in areas with a slope higher than 20 fr pc 1 49 nt and ntr resulted economically advantageous also in the steep slope areas 20 with an fr pc ratio of 1 41 and 1 40 respectively the economic analysis based on the crop yields simulated by the swat model was summarized in table a1 annex a simulated winter wheat yield for the ac ranged from 1 94 to 3 47 mg ha 1 y 1 with the average in agreement with literature values 3 mg ha 1 y 1 psr 2014 agricultural census 2010 as to bmps swat simulated crop yields lower than literature values up to 14 table 6 and table a1 hence a lower fr in the simulated bmp scenarios was generated differences in terms of fr pc between the two economic analyses were in the 2 11 range this interval can be considered as an indicator of uncertainty however results showed that nt and ntr for slope 20 and rf for slope 20 were the most economically valid scenarios at the farm level while cfr slope 20 proved unsustainable from an economic point of view the economic analysis carried out at the basin scale is shown in table 7 considering that rf has a different year subsidy for the first year the second year and after 12 years the community cost was evaluated at the end of these three periods the economic impact of tp loss was not taken into account due to the low loads obtained for the modeled years ac followed by rf showed the highest values in terms of cpl soil loss and n loss whereas ntr showed the lowest values because of the reduced costs of tn loss cfr and nt were also economically convenient for the community since there was a moderate reduction both in soil and tn losses as compared to ac considering the bmp implementation cost in the first and the second year rf nt and ntr were the most expensive followed by cf cfr and ac however after 12 years when the forest is cut rf no longer receives subsidies which is why the total practice cost became the most convenient 4 discussion 4 1 estimating streamflow sediment and nutrient loads swat model performed satisfactorily for streamflow and sediment load in both the calibration and validation periods ricci et al 2020 this confirms that despite the complexity of the mediterranean environment especially in terms of topography and climate swat can assess hydrological processes with a certain degree of accuracy de girolamo et al 2015 abdelwahab et al 2018 the correct watershed delineation which accounted for the topography of the upland areas and for the proportion between the main land uses positively influenced the results of the model han et al 2013 however the low flow was overestimated in the validation period ricci et al 2020 in the carapelle convective and localized rainfall events as well as the low number of the weather stations and their suboptimal location generated discrepancy between observed and simulated data ricci et al 2018 moreover some extreme events caused a rise in cn values in accordance with the antecedent soil moisture condition decreasing the subsequent infiltration capacity and increasing the streamflow swat underestimated the sediment load in the two years of validation ricci et al 2020 abouabdillah et al 2014 stated that some typical processes of the mediterranean stream such as bank collapse are not correctly simulated by swat whose sediment computation is based on the bagnold s stream power function and the musle equation abdelwahab et al 2018 due to the paucity of measured nutrient loads a decision was made to only calibrate the model for tn n no3 tp and p po4 maintaining constant the parameters already calibrated and validated for the runoff and sediment load arnold et al 2012b swat showed a satisfactory performance except for the n no3 nse 0 31 some swat parameters related to the denitrification processes i e cdn and sdnco can be only changed at the basin level arnold et al 2012b causing difficulties in reproducing the seasonality and the spatial distribution of n no3 malagó et al 2017 epelde et al 2016 the model slightly underestimated p po4 during floods and overestimated it in the low flow period this is because the accuracy of nutrient and sediment simulation is influenced by the result obtained for hydrology indeed some large floods in the validation periods were underestimated ricci et al 2020 and the observed streamflow in the dry season was overestimated abdelwahab et al 2018 ricci et al 2018 simulating extreme low flow in intermittent rivers is a critical point both for hydrology and for water quality de girolamo et al 2015 the limited data about point sources discharges could have contributed to an overestimation of the extremely low flow it is well know that model results are affected by uncertainty it includes input uncertainty that is due to errors in input data interpolation integration of data from different sources low resolution etc model uncertainty i e simplification of processes unknown or missing processes and parameter uncertainty non uniqueness of parameters in inverse modeling evenson et al 2021 in the present work input uncertainty could be large since data had different resolutions and were derived from different sources data used for calibrating the model included continuous measurements of q and ssc and discrete measurements of nutrient concentrations six samples covering 2 years using discrete data for calibrating the model the uncertainty associated to the nutrient loads increases since discrete measurements may not account for all the hydrological conditions harmel et al 2006 ullrich and volk 2009b de girolamo et al 2018 a high sample frequency is desirable since it may result in lower uncertainty pulighe et al 2020 unfortunately its implementation is currently limited in italy due to the low budget allocated to monitoring uncertainty could be significant in bmp scenario simulations arabi et al 2007 cerro et al 2014 since the parameters were assumed on the literature basis and were not validated with field measurements this has had implications on the crop yield predicted by swat table a1 appendix which proved to be different compared to the crop yield retrieved from the literature analysis table 6 hence the economic analysis was carried out considering both the crop yield simulated by the model and the literature values it was assumed that the relative comparison between different scenarios is affected by less uncertainty providing reliable results for decision makers arabi et al 2007 the results of the present study show that current agricultural practices coupled with mineral fertilization produce a surplus of tn 49 kg ha 1y 1 which is comparable to the average load found for the 27 eu member states 47 kg ha 1y 1 eea 2020 eurostat 2020 tn surplus is known to vary considerably from one basin to another velthof et al 2009 in italy the average value is 70 kg ha 1y 1 but some areas such as the mincio a sub basin of the po river show much higher values 107 66 kg n ha 1 y 1 pinardi et al 2020 in the apulia region de girolamo et al 2017 2019 computed 43 kg ha 1 y 1 and 60 kg ha 1 y 1 for the celone basin 72 km2 and the canale d aiedda basin 360 km2 respectively tn surplus is a potential risk indicator of nitrate contamination since it may partially be delivered to the surface waters and leached into the groundwater the model predicted both n no3 riverine export 3 84 kg ha 1 y 1 and leachn no3 43 37 kg ha 1 y 1 n no3 concentrations measured in surface waters confirmed the nitrate contamination since the measures were always higher than the threshold limits 1 2 mg l 1 level ii required to support the functioning ecosystem dm 260 2010 measures of n no3 concentrations in groundwater were not available in the river basin hence further studies are needed to analyze groundwater nitrate pollution these results highlight that a wider program of measures is necessary to reduce the pressures for achieving the main goal of the water framework directive generally tp load to surface waters 0 044 kg ha 1 y 1 computed for the carapelle was lower as compared to the european average of 1 2 kg ha 1 y 1 eurostat 2020 and consistent with the average values estimated in italy from 3 to 2 kg ha 1 y 1 eurostat 2021 gross nutrient balance on agricultural land by nutrient the tp concentrations measured and simulated in the carapelle river were lower than the threshold limits 0 1 mg l 1 level ii required to support the functioning ecosystem dm 260 2010 depending on the anthropogenic pressures and on the peculiarities of the basins tp load varies largely in the sulcis basin sardinia pulighe et al 2020 assessed a value of 1 18 kg ha 1 y 1 meanwhile the canale d aiedda basin showed an average value very similar to the carapelle 0 04 kg ha 1 y 1 d ambrosio et al 2020 in the po basin viaroli et al 2018 estimated a value of tp surplus of 13 kg ha 1y 1 4 2 are bmps specific for soil erosion able to reduce nutrient loads cf and nt which are efficient in reducing soil erosion mtibaa et al 2018 ricci et al 2020 may cause an increased water infiltration usda nscs 2017 inducing a higher leachn no3 gassman et al 2006 daryanto et al 2017a in cf n no3 also increases due to its higher concentration within the subsurface runoff xia et al 2014 which partly contributes to the return flow to stream neitsch et al 2011 conversely nt can cause soil compaction especially in some clay dominant soil which can lead to an increment of n no3 in soil surface quincke et al 2007 daryanto et al 2017a as a result n no3 simulated for nt was higher than ac 4 the retention and accumulation of n no3 in soils under cf and nt liu et al 2014b xue et al 2015 can be an advantage since it ensures less reliance on fertilizers moreover cf nt and other bmp scenarios showed a reduction of org n losses 15 20 corresponding to an increment of org n in soil associated with humus neitsch et al 2011 martínez et al 2017 this can represent an important pool of n since the mineralization processes allow a certain amount of leachn no3 to be gradually generated becoming available for soil microorganisms and plants geisseler et al 2009 ladha et al 2020 cfr and ntr scenarios incorporating the farm to fork strategy showed a tn reduction of about 20 confirming previous studies bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 in particular leachn no3 decreased by 8 kg ha 1 y 1 as compared to cf and nt velthof et al 2009 highlighted that abating n fertilization can be used as a stand alone effective measure to reduce leachn no3 and that its effect can be amplified by coupling it with other measures the level of n no3 load for cfr and ntr showed a lower decrease compared to leachn no3 however a degree of uncertainty affects these results since swat does not correctly track no3 in the shallow acquirer arnold et al 2012b epelde et al 2016 therefore no3 in return flow maybe underestimated grizzetti et al 2005 cf cfr nt and ntr decreased the tp delivered to the river cfr and ntr showed values similar to cf and nt because the amount of p fertilizer used in the carapelle was quite low abdelwahab et al 2018 nt and ntr highlighted a tp load higher than cf and cfr this result can be ascribed to the accumulation of organic matter and consequently of org p which characterizes nt daryanto et al 2017b finally rf reduced both tn and tp in the carapelle basin this practice falls into the category of land use changes and provides for the replacement of agricultural land use with a forest bakker et al 2008 with the consequent zeroing of mineral fertilizer use rf proved efficient in reducing the sediment load and the nutrient excess in runoff and groundwater usda nscs 2017 although bmps especially cfr and ntr were able to reduce nutrient loads the n no3 concentration level remained higher than the threshold limits 1 2 mg l 1 level ii required to support the functioning ecosystem in all the analyzed scenarios these results pointed out that these measures are not sufficient for achieving the water framework directive goals at the basin scale and that additional measures are needed hence further studies are required to analyze additional measures and new technologies that can minimize the pressures on waters and soil from both point and non point sources 4 3 agricultural and environmental costs defining the bmps to be implemented in an area is a complex process requiring a holistic approach that must take into account the peculiarities of the basin i e morphology slope rainfall regime the efficiency in reducing sediment and nutrient loads of each bmps economic aspects i e available subsidies xie et al 2015 haas et al 2017 as well as social considerations i e acceptability of new management practices type of farming systems multiple positive effects of bmps including the improvement of the environment s multifunctionality eu regulation no 1305 2013 should be promoted the economic analysis should include not only the feasibility for the single farm but also for the public sector at the basin scale taking into account the public investment panagos et al 2018 ricci et al 2020 in this study ac was found to be profitable for slopes 20 but not convenient for slope 20 due to the higher costs related to reliance on heavy machinery on slopes despite this farmers continue to use conventional tillage since the application of bmps is perceived as challenging and expensive zimmerman et al 2019 nt is generally accepted by farmers because the subsidies provided by the psr measure 10 1 3 cover the investment costs needed to carry out the switch from the conventional tillage ricci et al 2020 and because it reduces the production costs related to depth tillages pittelkow et al 2015 indeed nt was the most convenient for farmers in both the slope classes considered moreover nt was also suitable at the basin level inasmuch it ensures savings in terms of soil loss however public investments to sustain nt are higher as compared to ac subventions could change under new environmental programs making this bmp unprofitable while tn accumulated in the soil makes its loss possible gál et al 2007 pittelkow et al 2015 cf is included in the gaec by the eu de vita et al 2007 borrelli et al 2016 but not financed by psr therefore receiving the same subsidies provided by the cap as those provided for conventional tillage for this reason this practice is usually not implemented except in some fields where erosion processes are evident ricci et al 2020 despite this the implementation of cf is not expensive because it does not involve significant changes in agricultural machinery e g tractors cf showed a benefit cost ratio fr pc very similar to that of ac in areas with a slope 20 guaranteeing good savings at the basin level in terms of soil loss and practice costs lower than nt nevertheless as for nt cf showed a slight increase in n no3 and leachn no3 loss gassman et al 2006 which leads to greater environmental spending for the community cfr and ntr were implemented following the eugd strategy reducing the fertilized application by 20 both the new bmp scenarios showed a decrease in crop production 7 due to the reduced amount of fertilizer despite the apparent earnings losses the economic assessment revealed that fr pc for cfr and ntr was almost the same as that of cf and nt reducing fertilizer applications resulted in savings as compared to ac totalling 333 230 for cfr and 404 988 for ntr considering the advantages offered by cfr which are quite similar to ntr this practice should be favoured in the next environmental programming ricci et al 2020 in italy by introducing specific subsidies or by making this practice a mandatory standard as already done in many eu countries spain romania belgium greece malta and cyprus borrelli et al 2016 more generally a reduction in fertilizer application needs an in depth economic analysis that should also consider the potential impact of a lower demand for fertilizers on the fertilizer industry and consequently on fertilizer costs kanter et al 2015 further insights should also be gained into the loss of production recorded in cfr and ntr the reduction of the yield may not meet society s needs institute for european environmental policy ieep 2020 for this reason it could be necessary to adopt strategies to increase efficiency in using fertilizers panhwar et al 2019 the increased number of fertilizations for the same quantity of fertilizer the use of organic fertilizer and the use of controlled release fertilizers are some of the possible techniques that can be used for this purpose wang et al 2018b additionally coupling conservation practices with practices that favour ground cover between main crops such as the cover crops turned out as a valid solution to reduce fertilizer losses daryanto et al 2017a finally rf proved to be a valid alternative in areas where production costs are high slope 20 due to measure 8 1 of the psr rf was economically sustainable and also exhibited a positive impact on n loss obviously rf cannot be applied on the entire basin as income is lower compared to wheat cultivation especially if subsidies are not included but it may be implemented in combination with other bmps to have a greater effect than using a single practice strauch et al 2013 bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 ramos et al 2015 mtibaa et al 2018 the present study suggests that further studies which include field activities integrated with conceptual models could improve the results and reduce uncertainty both in environmental assessment and in economic analysis 4 4 conservation practices in changing environmental policies in the scenario of the eugd in the coming years member states will be called upon to adapt their own national environmental programs and devise plans considering the multi functionality of the environmental measures ec com 2019 640 montanarella and panagos 2021 from what emerged in this study bmps can have a positive manifold impact on both the environment and society the ability to reduce sediment and nutrient load as well as their economic feasibility make bmps fundamental measures to be considered in the management of a basin area mtibaa et al 2018 keesstra et al 2018 the health of the agro environment however needs to be analyzed by using a holistic approach following the umbrella concept which is at the base of the nbss a sustainable methodology must consider solutions composed by multiple measures ec 2021 in complex environments as the study area the project design of conservative bmps must also include forest measures i e afforestation or buffer strips aimed at enhancing the ecosystem services and the resilience of the environment haase 2017 lafortezza et al 2018 indeed in the study area land reserved for nature i e forests is very limited 7 the adoption of rf in steep sloped areas where productivity is very low should be strongly promoted not only to reduce land and water degradation but also to achieve the aichi biodiversity target abt 11 which entails expanding the protected area network to at least 17 of the terrestrial world by 2020 www cbd int sp targets modeling activities revealed to be useful both to identify basin challenges and design management solutions keesstra et al 2018 future works are needed to better asses the cumulative effect of different nbss 5 conclusions outlining a program of measures and bmps for reducing soil erosion is a difficult task that may have several implications on the quality of water crop productivity and the local economy this study aimed at testing a framework for an integrated analysis of bmps to provide a scientific basis for their selection and implementation to watershed managers the identification and quantification of the diffuse and point source pollution which is the first step of the methodological approach for implementing a bmp program was developed by using the swat model coupled with monitoring activities in the carapelle basin the swat model turned out to be an affordable tool in simulating nutrient loads for both current land use and bmps five bmp scenarios were identified and simulated to estimate their implications on water quality some bmps cf nt rf were selected among those measures that are generally used to counteract soil erosion in rural areas those bmps already proved to be effective for soil loss reduction in the study area but the results of the present study revealed that cf and nt lead to an increase of n no3 both in leaching and into surface runoff conversely rf showed a reduction in n no3 losses to mitigate the effect of cf and nt on water quality two additional scenarios cfr ntr were simulated by applying a reduction in fertilizer 20 as proposed by the farm to fork strategy cfr and ntr scenarios resulted in a 20 reduction in n no3 in leaching and into surface runoff cfr and ntr proved to be the best practices for the study area as the positive balance of production costs at the farm level while increasing the underlying cost savings in terms of nutrient and soil losses rf resulted in an effective practice if applied in limited steep slope areas hence it is suggested that rf be implemented in combination with other practices i e cfr and ntr to have a greater impact at the basin scale considering subsidies currently available the economic analysis showed that the costs to the community for supporting ntr nt and rf are higher than the current management it is noteworthy that bmps are multifunctional since they have an impact on both soil erosion and nutrient reduction thus justifying the significant public investment required to implement them the results pointed out that at the basin scale the implementation of these bmps in the critical soil erosion areas only is not sufficient in order to achieve the water framework directive goals and that supplementary measures need to be applied across a larger area further studies are needed to identify additional measures and new strategies i e increasing efficiency in fertilizer use precision agriculture etc declaration of

annualized agricultural non point source annagnps bingner and theurer 2005 allow the synthesis of basin scale processes by using specific parameters to identify critical areas and to test the effect of bmps kauffeldt et al 2016 bosch et al 2020 bezak et al 2021 this study aims to i model point and diffuse sources of nutrient in an agricultural watershed characterized by scarcity of data ii test feasible bmp scenarios for nutrient load reduction based on the measures used to counteract soil erosion in rural areas and iii assess the economic feasibility of bmps at a farm and community scale private and public sector this paper is a follow up of a previous study ricci et al 2020 carried out to estimate the efficacy and feasibility of bmps to reduce soil erosion in the carapelle basin apulia italy the results demonstrated that bmps can be effective to reduce soil erosion but their implementation requires significant investments public and private and that further studies are needed to analyze their impact on water quality the ultimate goal of this work is to provide a framework for an integrated analysis of bmps including water quality soil erosion and economic aspects it serves as guidance for water resources managers to achieve environmental protection biodiversity strategy 2030 and the farm to fork strategy aiming to make food production fair healthy and environmentally friendly 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the carapelle river basin 506 km2 is located between the apulia and the campania regions in southern italy fig 1 the main channel length is 52 2 km from the headwater to the streamflow gauging station 41 17 50 347 n 15 36 2 583 e elevation from the plain to the mountainous areas ranges between 120 and 1089 m a s l gentile et al 2010 streamflow q m3 s

nitrogen n no3 total phosphorous tp µg l 1 and orthophosphate p po4 were monitored in a river section of the main stream fig 1 by the environmental regional agency for the prevention and protection of the environment arpa arpa deals with the evaluation of the qualitative status of water bodies by carrying out six year monitoring cycles following the directives set out in annex 1 of decree no 152 of 1999 dlgs 152 1999 sampling with a frequency of not less than 4 times a year were collected and analyzed in cases of absence of flow the number of sampling remained unchanged with an intensification in the wet months since the first cycle of surface waters monitoring carried out by arpa started in 2010 only the data for 2010 and 2011 were considered in this study for the considered monitoring point data relative to 12 sample were available clayey limestone and limestone marly lithological units primarily characterize the upland area whereas sands and conglomerates clays and alluvial terraces are the main units of the plain bisantino et al 2010 land use and lithology affect the basin s hydrological and sediment regime ricci et al 2018 fortesa et al 2021 for more details about the monitoring activities and equipment reference should be made to the studies carried out by gentile et al 2010 and fortesa et al 2021 the hydrological regime is classified as intermittent pool characterized by seasonal low flows in the summer and high flow during winter and early spring fortesa et al 2021 the mediterranean climate leads to a high spatial gradient of the rainfall 450 800 mm year 1 and events of high intensity low duration in summer pagano et al 2019 winter wheat is the main agricultural production about 75 of the area whereas olive groves are common in lowlands while forests and pastures are prevalent in uplands 2 2 model hydrology sediment yield and nutrients swat a semi distributed continuous hydrological model arnold et al 1998 developed by the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 2012a was used in this study to assess streamflow sediment and nutrient loads as well as to evaluate the effect of bmps on water the 2015 swat version winchell et al 2013 was set up and run for eight years 2004 2011 at a daily timescale including a three year warming up period 2004 2006 ricci et al 2020 to estimate the potential evapotranspiration the hargreaves method hargreaves 1975 was used for watershed delineation purposes swat divides the basin area into sub basins and then further divides the sub basins into hydrological response units hrus which are the minimum territorial unit of the model defined as homogenous areas by land use slope and soil characteristics arnold et al 2012b the dimension of the basin and the resolution 20 m of the digital elevation model dem were taken into consideration to select the threshold of 200 ha used for basin delineation this generated 115 sub basins representing the main topographical features of the study areas subsequently the proportion of the main soil types slope classes and land uses were analyzed to define the thresholds in hru determination percentage thresholds of 5 25 and 25 for soil slope and land use respectively were selected to create 451 hrus ricci et al 2020 for each hru the swat model simulates the surface runoff with the modified soil conservation service curve number method scs cn united states department of agriculture 1972 the sediment yield by the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 and the nutrient cycle by a mass balance neitsch et al 2011 subsequently the model computes the channel processes the manning s equation is used to determine the stream velocity and the discharge relationship in addition a simplified version of the bagnold s stream power relationship bagnold 1977 is used to simulate sediment degradation or deposition in the channel water quality equations taken from the qual2e model brown and barnwell 1987 are used to simulate nutrients in the stream a detailed description of the model and more theoretical information can be found in neitsch et al 2011 swat needs several measures and input data for its calibration as well as validation that may constitute a limit for its application brouziyne et al 2021 the input data used to set up the model are listed in table 1 the management files mgt were modified according to the collected data table 1 for winter wheat a 4 year crop rotation wheat wheat wheat clover was considered planting in november and harvesting in july ploughing 25 40 cm depth and harrowing were carried out in august and october respectively in mountainous areas slope 15 ploughing perpendicular to the contour lines was generally adopted the fertilizer was applied in december fertilizer grade 25 15 00 amount 180 220 kg ha 1 and february urea amount 100 140 kg ha 1 for olives two fertilizer applications were adopted in december manure and in spring fertilizer grade 26 00 00 amount 90 110 kg ha 1 and three shallow tillage operations ploughing and harrowing were executed every two months starting in april whereas the plants were harvested in november aquilino et al 2014 abdelwahab et al 2016 2 3 calibration and validation the swat model was calibrated first for the streamflow arnold et al 2015 then for sediment load and finally for nutrients the daily dataset of observed streamflow and sediment load 2007 2011 were divided into two sub datasets used for calibration january 2007 to april 2009 and validation january 2010 to december 2011 respectively ricci et al 2020 with regard to nutrients tn n no3 tp p po4 due to the limited data availability the whole dataset was used for calibrating the model calibration was performed changing the nutrient parameter relative to tn n no3 tp p po4 the usle p factor erosion management practice factor varying 0 1 was set to 1 0 because no conservation practices were applied in the watershed to identify the sensitive parameters for each calibrated variable a swat cup tool was used to perform the sensitivity analysis via the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 abbaspour et al 2015 more details about the procedure adopted for the sensitivity analysis calibration and validation can be found in ricci et al 2018 thereafter swat cup was applied firstly to improve the correspondence between the simulated and the observed curves manually changing the model parameters jeong et al 2010 and then to identify the best set of parameters with an automatic procedure selecting a nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency nse greater than 0 5 as an objective function table 2 illustrates the list of the calibrated parameter for nutrients the model performance was evaluated at the daily time step considering acceptable values of r2 and nse greater than 0 5 and of percent bias pbias less than or equal to 25 for runoff less than or equal to 55 for sediment and less than or equal to 70 for nutrients moriasi et al 2007 furl et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2017 melaku et al 2018 woo et al 2021 2 4 defining bmp characteristics the analysis of the apulia region s psr 2014 rural development program psr 2014 2020 and national regulation dm 2490 2017 of the ministry of agricultural food and forestry policies mipaaf mipaaf 2017 points out that contour farming cf no tillage nt and reforestation rf are the main bmps applied in rural areas ricci et al 2020 cf as defined by the natural resources conservation service nrcs is a practice in which tillage follows contour lines with a consequent reduction of the surface runoff and an increment of infiltration gilley 2004 usda nscs 2017 cf leads to a reduction in soil erosion processes e g sheet and rills and to the abatement of p and n compounds transported with sediment gassman et al 2006 stevens et al 2009 in contrast n no3 loads conveyed in the subsurface runoff may be higher than in conventional tillage xia et al 2014 moreover the increase in infiltration can correspond to an increment of the n no3 leaching into groundwater follett 1995 gassman et al 2006 cf begins to lose its effect for slopes greater than 8 and must be replaced with other bmps in areas with a slope greater than 20 where the risk of tractors overturning is high abubakar et al 2010 liu et al 2013 farmers in central italy in particular in the hills in the apennines and sub apennines have been using cf since the early 1900 s referring to it with the local name of girapoggio bazzoffi et al 2011 nt is a conservative practice consisting of planting or seeding directly on the residue left on soil after carrying out only in row operations e g drilling or furrowing without executing deep tillage such as ploughing usda nscs 2017 nt reduces soil erosion by decreasing the surface runoff and increasing soil infiltration ullrich and volk 2009a generally tp and n no3 in surface runoff are reduced verbree et al 2010 delaune and sij 2012 trewavas 2004 meanwhile n no3 leached in groundwater may increase daryanto et al 2017a however daryanto et al 2017a also observed an increment in n no3 in surface runoff despite its overall positive effects on the cropping systems de vita et al 2007 nt is still not widely used in southern italy as compared to the central or northern plain areas cavalchini et al 2013 lastly rf is definable as a land use change luc from a land use prone to soil erosion to another less prone bakker et al 2008 rf induces a positive effect on the multifunctionality of the agro environment such as reduced soil erosion improved water quality new wildlife habitat and wood production the national forest and carbon inventory infc pointed out that the surface covered by forests increased after the second world war and that an increment of 20 was recorded over the past 20 years national forest and carbon inventory infc 2015 the calibrated and validated swat model for the current land use and management practices was set as actual ac scenario cf nt and rf were simulated in the carapelle basin as three different scenarios to reduce soil erosion by water as reported in a previous paper ricci et al 2020 in the present work their implications in terms of water quality were analyzed in addition considering that both cf and nt can limit the loss of nutrients in surface water while increasing n no3 leaching into the groundwater two additional scenarios i e cfr and ntr were simulated to reduce the use of fertilizers by 20 as suggested by the farm to fork strategy european commission ec 2020 the effects of these scenarios in reducing nutrients were then evaluated in terms of loads kg ha 1 y 1 at basin sub basin and hrus scales 2 5 modeling bmp scenarios since one of the aims of this work was to assess the impact of soil erosion control bmps on nutrients losses 59 hrus were used as target areas based on a threshold of high erosion risk of 10 mg ha 1 y 1 panagos and katsoyiannis 2019 ricci et al 2020 in addition a threshold of 20 slope limit of tractor overturning was considered to further select the areas where cf was applicable it is difficult to till areas with a slope higher than 20 using traditional techniques zhang et al 2014 so these areas were converted to forests in the rf scenario ricci et al 2020 therefore cf and cfr were applied to 44 hrus nt and ntr to 59 hrus and rf to 15 hrus to simulate management practices in the bmp scenarios some parameters were appropriately adapted in the swat model ni and parajuli 2018 ricci et al 2020 according to several authors arabi et al 2008 tuppad et al 2010 wang et al 2018a cn and usle p factors were modified in the cf scenario the new values were assigned following the work done by arnold et al 2012b to implement nt tillage operations were removed in the target hrus ullrich and volk 2009a the biological soil mixing efficiency biomix and the manning s roughness coefficient for overland flow ov n were increased to 0 4 and 0 320 respectively neitsch et al 2011 cn was decreased by a two point value mtibaa et al 2018 since rf is a luc practice as described above the land use of the 15 target hrus was changed from winter wheat to forest betrie et al 2011 accordingly cn was also modified by entering values relative to forested areas retrieved by arnold et al 2012b finally cfr and ntr were implemented by reducing the fertilization of cf and nt by 20 fig 2 provides an overview of the criteria adopted to discretize the target areas the number of hrus involved in every bmp scenario and the swat parameter modified to implement the described scenarios results obtained from the different bmp scenarios were analyzed at a basin sub basin and hru scale 2 6 economic assessment in this work the methodology developed by ricci et al 2020 to analyze the economic feasibility of bmp scenarios for soil loss reduction was applied considering both the field farmers and the basin scale at the field level the farm return fr and production cost pc euro ha 1 ratio fr pc was evaluated one year after implementing the bmps the specific farm return sfr euro ha 1 for a single scenario was determined by multiplying the selling unit price sup by the yield of the crop increased or decreased depending on the slope and bmp liu et al 2014a mtibaa et al 2018 concerning the crop yield since no calibration was possible under the bmps for the study area two different computations were carried out by using the crop yield predicted by swat and yield from literature 3 mg ha 1 y 1 psr 2014 agricultural census 2010 respectively based on literature ricci et al 2020 liu et al 2014b for a slope less than 20 winter wheat yield was increased by 5 and 10 for cf and nt respectively by converse for steep slope areas the yield was reduced by 10 ricci et al 2020 subsidies s planned by the cap or psr were also added ricci et al 2020 the specific production cost spc euro ha 1 was calculated considering the conventional average tillage cost retrieved from farmers surveys and industry magazines https terraevita edagricole it increased or decreased depending on slope as well as on the bmp considered de vita et al 2007 liu et al 2014a in addition the costs of investments and transactions necessary to switch from conventional to bmps were added as reported by the farmers survey and psr psr 2014 ricci et al 2020 at the basin level the impact of bmp application was determined by considering the total practice cost tpc euro for the public sector the soil loss cost slc euro and the crop productivity loss cpl euro panagos et al 2018 ricci et al 2020 tpc corresponded to the sum of the subsidies s provided by the public sector at the basin scale slc was obtained by the unit value of soil of 20 panagos et al 2015 converted and discounted at the time of the study ricci et al 2020 multiplied by the annual sediment load t y 1 finally cpl was calculated by multiplying crop area ca ha crop productivity cp mg ha 1 land productivity loss lpl and sup euro mg 1 where lpl is equal to severe erosion areas 10 mg ha 1 sea ha divided by the total agricultural areas taa ha of the basin and then multiplied by the value of crop productivity loss in intensively cultivated fields 0 08 panagos et al 2018 as to cfr and ntr the unit cost of fertilization ucf which included both the price of the fertilizers and the costs of the machinery and operators was separated from spc using the information retrieved from farmers surveys and industry magazines https terraevita edagricole it sfr was recalculated by considering the reduction of crop yield 7 derived by the implementation of bmps with a fertilizer reduction the percentage of reduction with respect to cf and nt was determined by analyzing the swat model results in terms of the average yield for the areas under cfr and ntr at the basin scale the impact of the application of bmps was recalculated for all the scenarios implemented in this study cf nt rf cfr ntr including the economic value of tn losses vnl by applying the replacement cost criteria la notte et al 2017 panagos et al 2018 this method entails evaluating an asset based on the cost that must be incurred to replace tn losses the price of urea n content 46 the most used fertilizer was utilized to calculate the n unit price nup euro kg 1 through a proportion nitrogen nitrate losses tnl kg were determined by summing n no3 loads in surface runoff and in leachate vnl was then obtained by multiplying nup by tnl table 3 shows all the income and costs considered in the economic analysis 3 results 3 1 streamflow sediment and nutrient loads the swat model calibration and validation performance was satisfactory for streamflow sediment load ricci et al 2020 tp p po4 and tn while n no3 proved unsatisfactory nse table 4 discrepancies among the measured and simulated streamflow and nutrient loads especially in summer could be attributed to the point sources data which were considered constant on a monthly time scale in the simulation at the same time they could vary from one day to another in addition the overestimation and or underestimation of the streamflow may influence the results of sediment load and nutrient performance at a daily timescale floods were generally lightly underestimated in the calibration period pbias 5 3 whereas the baseflow was overestimated in the driest year of the validation period pbias 17 2 fig 3 a b c d shows specific simulated and measured nutrient loads for the calibration period tn and n no3 were generally well simulated in the wet season and underestimated in the dry season when tp and p po4 loads were overestimated the highest nutrient loads measured in surface waters over the observed period occurred on october 26th 2010 4882 kg for tn 3039 kg for n no3 98 kg for tp and 63 kg for p po4 when the corresponding simulated values were 4663 kg for tn 3071 kg for n no3 98 kg for tp and 50 kg for p po4 for the study period the mean annual actual evapotranspiration was 470 mm corresponding to 71 of the rainfall 662 mm romanazzi et al 2015 estimated similar values of evapotranspiration for the apulia region surface runoff and total water yield were 86 mm 17 of the rainfall and 180 mm 27 of the rainfall respectively at the basin scale the simulated mean specific sediment load was 5 95 mg ha 1 y 1 mainly concentrated in the wet season december to april 3 2 modeling bmp scenarios at the basin scale the loss of organic component org n n no3 flowing into surface waters and n no3 leached past to the bottom layer of soil leachn no3 were analyzed for the current and bmp scenarios cf cfr nt ntr rf for ac the annual average specific loads were 3 841 kg ha 1 y 1 for n no3 43 366 for leachn no3 2 001 for org n and 0 044 kg ha 1 y 1 for tp table 5 at the basin scale ntr and cfr were the most effective bmps in reducing n no3 revealing a decline of 17 52 and 16 45 respectively rf showed an abatement of 3 54 whereas cf and nt showed an increase of 5 5 and 4 26 respectively similarly leachn no3 was reduced by 26 55 in the ntr scenario by 26 17 in cfr and 4 13 in rf incrementing by 2 60 in cf and by 2 06 in nt org n decreased in all the scenarios ntr 20 5 whereas nt 19 exhibited the higher reduction followed by cfr 16 cf 15 and rf 12 table 5 all the bmp scenarios showed a reduction in terms of tp load with the exception of nt which increased slightly 2 2 cfr was the most efficient bmp in reducing tp loads 11 4 followed by cf rf and ntr with a percentage of 9 1 4 5 and 2 3 respectively table 5 figs 4 and 5 show n no3 kg ha 1 y 1 and tp kg ha 1 y 1 the primary sources of water pollution fao 2018 delivered to the river at the sub basin scale specific n no3 load in ac ranged from 0 38 to 10 55 kg ha 1 y 1 showing a preponderance of higher values in medium or steep slope areas fig 4 in cf and nt the increment in specific n no3 load 17 38 and 14 67 respectively was mainly related to the south east sub basins i e sub basins 70 73 76 85 fig 4 conversely rf cfr and ntr showed an overall reduction across the basin including in sloped areas fig 4 in particular within the targeted hrus rf produced a higher reduction 18 70 followed by ntr 9 60 and cfr 7 22 tp ranged from 0 02 to 0 43 kg ha 1 y 1 in ac displaying the highest loads in the hilly or steep sloped areas fig 5 in the same areas all bmp scenarios showed an abatement of tp loads fig 5 upon analyzing the treated hrus in the sub basins cf and cfr proved most effective in reducing tp loads 27 36 and 26 03 respectively rf resulted in a reduction of 25 13 while ntr and nt led to a lower reduction of 21 22 and 21 05 respectively at the farm hru level agricultural fields are known to have a great influence on leachn no3 fao 2018 curk et al 2020 fig 6 a b depicts leachn no3 and tp yields delivered to the river in the analyzed scenarios the median leachn no3 value for ac was 44 04 kg ha 1 lower than cf 53 23 kg ha 1 y 1 and then nt 51 15 kg ha 1 y 1 cfr and ntr were found to be the two most efficient scenarios with the median values of 37 09 kg ha 1 y 1and 35 00 kg ha 1 y 1 respectively rf showed a median value of leachn no3 to 42 83 kg ha 1 y 1 fig 6a tp yields to surface water were reduced in each bmp scenario compared to ac fig 6b ac showed a median value of tp of 0 20 kg ha 1 y 1 whereas rf was less effective 0 18 kg ha 1 y 1 nt and ntr emerged as the most efficient bmps both reducing tp at 0 14 kg ha 1 y 1 cf and cfr exhibited a slightly lower reduction with a median value of 0 15 kg ha 1 y 1 for both it is important to remember that only 15 hrus 1988 ha were converted to a forest in the rf scenario additional details on sediment yield obtained for the different scenarios can be found in ricci et al 2020 3 3 economic feasibility the economic analysis was carried out both at the field and the basin scale by using literature values for crop yield table 6 and model results table a1 appendix a as to the literature approach ricci et al 2020 liu et al 2014b results are shown in table 6 dividing the target hrus into two slope classes based on the limit threshold found for cf ac was economically sustainable only in gentle slope areas 20 with an fr pc ratio of 1 12 table 6 on the other hand for steep slopes 20 the fr pc ratio was 0 93 cf and cfr applied only in areas with a slope less than 20 showing fr pc values very similar to ac 1 11 and 1 09 respectively for the same slope class nt and ntr were economically more convenient despite the investment costs required for the transition the benefit cost ratio fr pc was 1 67 for nt and 1 66 for ntr net of the investment cost and lost income for the first 12 years the minimum period before first cutting rf was the most economically profitable bmp in areas with a slope higher than 20 fr pc 1 49 nt and ntr resulted economically advantageous also in the steep slope areas 20 with an fr pc ratio of 1 41 and 1 40 respectively the economic analysis based on the crop yields simulated by the swat model was summarized in table a1 annex a simulated winter wheat yield for the ac ranged from 1 94 to 3 47 mg ha 1 y 1 with the average in agreement with literature values 3 mg ha 1 y 1 psr 2014 agricultural census 2010 as to bmps swat simulated crop yields lower than literature values up to 14 table 6 and table a1 hence a lower fr in the simulated bmp scenarios was generated differences in terms of fr pc between the two economic analyses were in the 2 11 range this interval can be considered as an indicator of uncertainty however results showed that nt and ntr for slope 20 and rf for slope 20 were the most economically valid scenarios at the farm level while cfr slope 20 proved unsustainable from an economic point of view the economic analysis carried out at the basin scale is shown in table 7 considering that rf has a different year subsidy for the first year the second year and after 12 years the community cost was evaluated at the end of these three periods the economic impact of tp loss was not taken into account due to the low loads obtained for the modeled years ac followed by rf showed the highest values in terms of cpl soil loss and n loss whereas ntr showed the lowest values because of the reduced costs of tn loss cfr and nt were also economically convenient for the community since there was a moderate reduction both in soil and tn losses as compared to ac considering the bmp implementation cost in the first and the second year rf nt and ntr were the most expensive followed by cf cfr and ac however after 12 years when the forest is cut rf no longer receives subsidies which is why the total practice cost became the most convenient 4 discussion 4 1 estimating streamflow sediment and nutrient loads swat model performed satisfactorily for streamflow and sediment load in both the calibration and validation periods ricci et al 2020 this confirms that despite the complexity of the mediterranean environment especially in terms of topography and climate swat can assess hydrological processes with a certain degree of accuracy de girolamo et al 2015 abdelwahab et al 2018 the correct watershed delineation which accounted for the topography of the upland areas and for the proportion between the main land uses positively influenced the results of the model han et al 2013 however the low flow was overestimated in the validation period ricci et al 2020 in the carapelle convective and localized rainfall events as well as the low number of the weather stations and their suboptimal location generated discrepancy between observed and simulated data ricci et al 2018 moreover some extreme events caused a rise in cn values in accordance with the antecedent soil moisture condition decreasing the subsequent infiltration capacity and increasing the streamflow swat underestimated the sediment load in the two years of validation ricci et al 2020 abouabdillah et al 2014 stated that some typical processes of the mediterranean stream such as bank collapse are not correctly simulated by swat whose sediment computation is based on the bagnold s stream power function and the musle equation abdelwahab et al 2018 due to the paucity of measured nutrient loads a decision was made to only calibrate the model for tn n no3 tp and p po4 maintaining constant the parameters already calibrated and validated for the runoff and sediment load arnold et al 2012b swat showed a satisfactory performance except for the n no3 nse 0 31 some swat parameters related to the denitrification processes i e cdn and sdnco can be only changed at the basin level arnold et al 2012b causing difficulties in reproducing the seasonality and the spatial distribution of n no3 malagó et al 2017 epelde et al 2016 the model slightly underestimated p po4 during floods and overestimated it in the low flow period this is because the accuracy of nutrient and sediment simulation is influenced by the result obtained for hydrology indeed some large floods in the validation periods were underestimated ricci et al 2020 and the observed streamflow in the dry season was overestimated abdelwahab et al 2018 ricci et al 2018 simulating extreme low flow in intermittent rivers is a critical point both for hydrology and for water quality de girolamo et al 2015 the limited data about point sources discharges could have contributed to an overestimation of the extremely low flow it is well know that model results are affected by uncertainty it includes input uncertainty that is due to errors in input data interpolation integration of data from different sources low resolution etc model uncertainty i e simplification of processes unknown or missing processes and parameter uncertainty non uniqueness of parameters in inverse modeling evenson et al 2021 in the present work input uncertainty could be large since data had different resolutions and were derived from different sources data used for calibrating the model included continuous measurements of q and ssc and discrete measurements of nutrient concentrations six samples covering 2 years using discrete data for calibrating the model the uncertainty associated to the nutrient loads increases since discrete measurements may not account for all the hydrological conditions harmel et al 2006 ullrich and volk 2009b de girolamo et al 2018 a high sample frequency is desirable since it may result in lower uncertainty pulighe et al 2020 unfortunately its implementation is currently limited in italy due to the low budget allocated to monitoring uncertainty could be significant in bmp scenario simulations arabi et al 2007 cerro et al 2014 since the parameters were assumed on the literature basis and were not validated with field measurements this has had implications on the crop yield predicted by swat table a1 appendix which proved to be different compared to the crop yield retrieved from the literature analysis table 6 hence the economic analysis was carried out considering both the crop yield simulated by the model and the literature values it was assumed that the relative comparison between different scenarios is affected by less uncertainty providing reliable results for decision makers arabi et al 2007 the results of the present study show that current agricultural practices coupled with mineral fertilization produce a surplus of tn 49 kg ha 1y 1 which is comparable to the average load found for the 27 eu member states 47 kg ha 1y 1 eea 2020 eurostat 2020 tn surplus is known to vary considerably from one basin to another velthof et al 2009 in italy the average value is 70 kg ha 1y 1 but some areas such as the mincio a sub basin of the po river show much higher values 107 66 kg n ha 1 y 1 pinardi et al 2020 in the apulia region de girolamo et al 2017 2019 computed 43 kg ha 1 y 1 and 60 kg ha 1 y 1 for the celone basin 72 km2 and the canale d aiedda basin 360 km2 respectively tn surplus is a potential risk indicator of nitrate contamination since it may partially be delivered to the surface waters and leached into the groundwater the model predicted both n no3 riverine export 3 84 kg ha 1 y 1 and leachn no3 43 37 kg ha 1 y 1 n no3 concentrations measured in surface waters confirmed the nitrate contamination since the measures were always higher than the threshold limits 1 2 mg l 1 level ii required to support the functioning ecosystem dm 260 2010 measures of n no3 concentrations in groundwater were not available in the river basin hence further studies are needed to analyze groundwater nitrate pollution these results highlight that a wider program of measures is necessary to reduce the pressures for achieving the main goal of the water framework directive generally tp load to surface waters 0 044 kg ha 1 y 1 computed for the carapelle was lower as compared to the european average of 1 2 kg ha 1 y 1 eurostat 2020 and consistent with the

efficient in reducing soil erosion mtibaa et al 2018 ricci et al 2020 may cause an increased water infiltration usda nscs 2017 inducing a higher leachn no3 gassman et al 2006 daryanto et al 2017a in cf n no3 also increases due to its higher concentration within the subsurface runoff xia et al 2014 which partly contributes to the return flow to stream neitsch et al 2011 conversely nt can cause soil compaction especially in some clay dominant soil which can lead to an increment of n no3 in soil surface quincke et al 2007 daryanto et al 2017a as a result n no3 simulated for nt was higher than ac 4 the retention and accumulation of n no3 in soils under cf and nt liu et al 2014b xue et al 2015 can be an advantage since it ensures less reliance on fertilizers moreover cf nt and other bmp scenarios showed a reduction of org n losses 15 20 corresponding to an increment of org n in soil associated with humus neitsch et al 2011 martínez et al 2017 this can represent an important pool of n since the mineralization processes allow a certain amount of leachn no3 to be gradually generated becoming available for soil microorganisms and plants geisseler et al 2009 ladha et al 2020 cfr and ntr scenarios incorporating the farm to fork strategy showed a tn reduction of about 20 confirming previous studies bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 in particular leachn no3 decreased by 8 kg ha 1 y 1 as compared to cf and nt velthof et al 2009 highlighted that abating n fertilization can be used as a stand alone effective measure to reduce leachn no3 and that its effect can be amplified by coupling it with other measures the level of n no3 load for cfr and ntr showed a lower decrease compared to leachn no3 however a degree of uncertainty affects these results since swat does not correctly track no3 in the shallow acquirer arnold et al 2012b epelde et al 2016 therefore no3 in return flow maybe underestimated grizzetti et al 2005 cf cfr nt and ntr decreased the tp delivered to the river cfr and ntr showed values similar to cf and nt because the amount of p fertilizer used in the carapelle was quite low abdelwahab et al 2018 nt and ntr highlighted a tp load higher than cf and cfr this result can be ascribed to the accumulation of organic matter and consequently of org p which characterizes nt daryanto et al 2017b finally rf reduced both tn and tp in the carapelle basin this practice falls into the category of land use changes and provides for the replacement of agricultural land use with a forest bakker et al 2008 with the consequent zeroing of mineral fertilizer use rf proved efficient in reducing the sediment load and the nutrient excess in runoff and groundwater usda nscs 2017 although bmps especially cfr and ntr were able to reduce nutrient loads the n no3 concentration level remained higher than the threshold limits 1 2 mg l 1 level ii required to support the functioning ecosystem in all the analyzed scenarios these results pointed out that these measures are not sufficient for achieving the water framework directive goals at the basin scale and that additional measures are needed hence further studies are required to analyze additional measures and new technologies that can minimize the pressures on waters and soil from both point and non point sources 4 3 agricultural and environmental costs defining the bmps to be implemented in an area is a complex process requiring a holistic approach that must take into account the peculiarities of the basin i e morphology slope rainfall regime the efficiency in reducing sediment and nutrient loads of each bmps economic aspects i e available subsidies xie et al 2015 haas et al 2017 as well as social considerations i e acceptability of new management practices type of farming systems multiple positive effects of bmps including the improvement of the environment s multifunctionality eu regulation no 1305 2013 should be promoted the economic analysis should include not only the feasibility for the single farm but also for the public sector at the basin scale taking into account the public investment panagos et al 2018 ricci et al 2020 in this study ac was found to be profitable for slopes 20 but not convenient for slope 20 due to the higher costs related to reliance on heavy machinery on slopes despite this farmers continue to use conventional tillage since the application of bmps is perceived as challenging and expensive zimmerman et al 2019 nt is generally accepted by farmers because the subsidies provided by the psr measure 10 1 3 cover the investment costs needed to carry out the switch from the conventional tillage ricci et al 2020 and because it reduces the production costs related to depth tillages pittelkow et al 2015 indeed nt was the most convenient for farmers in both the slope classes considered moreover nt was also suitable at the basin level inasmuch it ensures savings in terms of soil loss however public investments to sustain nt are higher as compared to ac subventions could change under new environmental programs making this bmp unprofitable while tn accumulated in the soil makes its loss possible gál et al 2007 pittelkow et al 2015 cf is included in the gaec by the eu de vita et al 2007 borrelli et al 2016 but not financed by psr therefore receiving the same subsidies provided by the cap as those provided for conventional tillage for this reason this practice is usually not implemented except in some fields where erosion processes are evident ricci et al 2020 despite this the implementation of cf is not expensive because it does not involve significant changes in agricultural machinery e g tractors cf showed a benefit cost ratio fr pc very similar to that of ac in areas with a slope 20 guaranteeing good savings at the basin level in terms of soil loss and practice costs lower than nt nevertheless as for nt cf showed a slight increase in n no3 and leachn no3 loss gassman et al 2006 which leads to greater environmental spending for the community cfr and ntr were implemented following the eugd strategy reducing the fertilized application by 20 both the new bmp scenarios showed a decrease in crop production 7 due to the reduced amount of fertilizer despite the apparent earnings losses the economic assessment revealed that fr pc for cfr and ntr was almost the same as that of cf and nt reducing fertilizer applications resulted in savings as compared to ac totalling 333 230 for cfr and 404 988 for ntr considering the advantages offered by cfr which are quite similar to ntr this practice should be favoured in the next environmental programming ricci et al 2020 in italy by introducing specific subsidies or by making this practice a mandatory standard as already done in many eu countries spain romania belgium greece malta and cyprus borrelli et al 2016 more generally a reduction in fertilizer application needs an in depth economic analysis that should also consider the potential impact of a lower demand for fertilizers on the fertilizer industry and consequently on fertilizer costs kanter et al 2015 further insights should also be gained into the loss of production recorded in cfr and ntr the reduction of the yield may not meet society s needs institute for european environmental policy ieep 2020 for this reason it could be necessary to adopt strategies to increase efficiency in using fertilizers panhwar et al 2019 the increased number of fertilizations for the same quantity of fertilizer the use of organic fertilizer and the use of controlled release fertilizers are some of the possible techniques that can be used for this purpose wang et al 2018b additionally coupling conservation practices with practices that favour ground cover between main crops such as the cover crops turned out as a valid solution to reduce fertilizer losses daryanto et al 2017a finally rf proved to be a valid alternative in areas where production costs are high slope 20 due to measure 8 1 of the psr rf was economically sustainable and also exhibited a positive impact on n loss obviously rf cannot be applied on the entire basin as income is lower compared to wheat cultivation especially if subsidies are not included but it may be implemented in combination with other bmps to have a greater effect than using a single practice strauch et al 2013 bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 ramos et al 2015 mtibaa et al 2018 the present study suggests that further studies which include field activities integrated with conceptual models could improve the results and reduce uncertainty both in environmental assessment and in economic analysis 4 4 conservation practices in changing environmental policies in the scenario of the eugd in the coming years member states will be called upon to adapt their own national environmental programs and devise plans considering the multi functionality of the environmental measures ec com 2019 640 montanarella and panagos 2021 from what emerged in this study bmps can have a positive manifold impact on both the environment and society the ability to reduce sediment and nutrient load as well as their economic feasibility make bmps fundamental measures to be considered in the management of a basin area mtibaa et al 2018 keesstra et al 2018 the health of the agro environment however needs to be analyzed by using a holistic approach following the umbrella concept which is at the base of the nbss a sustainable methodology must consider solutions composed by multiple measures ec 2021 in complex environments as the study area the project design of conservative bmps must also include forest measures i e afforestation or buffer strips aimed at enhancing the ecosystem services and the resilience of the environment haase 2017 lafortezza et al 2018 indeed in the study area land reserved for nature i e forests is very limited 7 the adoption of rf in steep sloped areas where productivity is very low should be strongly promoted not only to reduce land and water degradation but also to achieve the aichi biodiversity target abt 11 which entails expanding the protected area network to at least 17 of the terrestrial world by 2020 www cbd int sp targets modeling activities revealed to be useful both to identify basin challenges and design management solutions keesstra et al 2018 future works are needed to better asses the cumulative effect of different nbss 5 conclusions outlining a program of measures and bmps for reducing soil erosion is a difficult task that may have several implications on the quality of water crop productivity and the local economy this study aimed at testing a framework for an integrated analysis of bmps to provide a scientific basis for their selection and implementation to watershed managers the identification and quantification of the diffuse and point source pollution which is the first step of the methodological approach for implementing a bmp program was developed by using the swat model coupled with monitoring activities in the carapelle basin the swat model turned out to be an affordable tool in simulating nutrient loads for both current land use and bmps five bmp scenarios were identified and simulated to estimate their implications on water quality some bmps cf nt rf were selected among those measures that are generally used to counteract soil erosion in rural areas those bmps already proved to be effective for soil loss reduction in the study area but the results of the present study revealed that cf and nt lead to an increase of n no3 both in leaching and into surface runoff conversely rf showed a reduction in n no3 losses to mitigate the effect of cf and nt on water quality two additional scenarios cfr ntr were simulated by applying a reduction in fertilizer 20 as proposed by the farm to fork strategy cfr and ntr scenarios resulted in a 20 reduction in n no3 in leaching and into surface runoff cfr and ntr proved to be the best practices for the study area as the positive balance of production costs at the farm level while increasing the underlying cost savings in terms of nutrient and soil losses rf resulted in an effective practice if applied in limited steep slope areas hence it is suggested that rf be implemented in combination with other practices i e cfr and ntr to have a greater impact at the basin scale considering subsidies currently available the economic analysis showed that the costs to the community for supporting ntr nt and rf are higher than the current management it is noteworthy that bmps are multifunctional since they have an impact on both soil erosion and nutrient reduction thus justifying the significant public investment required to implement them the results pointed out that at the basin scale the implementation of these bmps in the critical soil erosion areas only is not sufficient in order to achieve the water framework directive goals and that supplementary measures need to be applied across a larger area further studies are needed to identify additional measures and new strategies i e increasing efficiency in fertilizer use precision agriculture etc declaration of

9832,knowledge of real time spatial distribution of soil moisture has great potential to improve yield and profit in agricultural systems recent advances in non invasive electromagnetic induction emi techniques have created an opportunity to determine soil moisture content with high resolution and minimal soil intrusion so far emi has mainly been used for homogenous soil conditions which are not common in agriculture and results are mainly validated by excavated pits or calibration models using soil samples on a transect this study converts apparent electrical conductivity data recorded with a dualem 1hs em metre for two surveys of variable moisture conditions dry and wet season with 2475 and 2174 data points over 5 4 ha in a field with a contrasting vertical soil profile into spatiotemporal management zones a least square inversion algorithm was used to determine electrical conductivities for individual soil layers of 0 0 5 m 0 5 0 8 m and 0 8 1 6 m soil samples from the depth of 0 5 m and 0 8 m were used for soil moisture calibrations a laboratory experiment under controlled conditions developed electric conductivity vs volumetric water content relations with power law functions for required soil depth slices with r2 values between 0 98 and 0 99 subsequently emi data were converted to volumetric water contents for each layer and predictions were spatially displayed median change between the measured apparent conductivity and inverted values range from 6 to 17 ms m 1 resulting in 3 7 difference in volumetric water prediction these emi based soil moisture predictions were compared with neutron moisture metre measurements with pearson r values of 0 74 and 0 95 for the wet and dry season surveys respectively the method is robust and offers a comparatively fast method to estimate the soil moisture status in fields and subsequently make informed management decisions keywords soil volumetric water content em inversion electrical resistivity tomography crop rotation 1 introduction soil moisture is a key factor of controlling the terrestrial water and energy exchange process zhang et al 2015 its spatial and temporal variability define the basis of management strategies in agriculture huntington 2010 it directly influences the soil microenvironment decisions on crop inputs farm waste reduction lesch 2005 and ultimately farm productivity moreover three quarters of world croplands are established in rainfed areas and these areas will not only remain the hub of generating global food but will also be expected to escalate their production with the projected population increase bradford et al 2017 in addition to continuous increase in urban water consumption dai 2012 a general concern for long term sustainability of agriculture is decreased annual rainfall and increased temperature mcfarlane et al 2020 seasonal changes in rainfall amount intensity and distribution lead to shifts in risks associated with farm management like a shorter growing season loss of landscape vegetation cover organic carbon decline wind erosion and increased temperatures iizumi and ramankutty 2015 predictions are for more discrete heavier rainfalls with prolonged dry spells and high temperatures during the cropping season that will critically deplete soil moisture in various parts of the world like north and central america the mediterranean southern africa and amazon cook et al 2014 the australian bureau of meteorology bom csiro 2016 has reported an 11 decline in rainfall from 1996 to 2015 causing a significant drying trend across southern australia in the april october growing season and a 19 decline in rainfall between may and july in southwest western australia wa the efficacy of applied crop inputs depends upon the availability of soil moisture half of the gap in actual wheat production from its potential yield relates to soil moisture variations hochman and horan 2018 lv et al 2017 maximised crop yields with optimum nutrient uptake can be achieved by responding to spatially well characterised soil moisture status grote et al 2010 in addition soil moisture variations influence the soil biological activities and temperature which in turn strongly affect the root development and their interactions with available nutrients zhang et al 2019 therefore knowledge of real time spatial distribution of plant available soil moisture is one of the most important yield and profit determining factors in agriculture gerssen gondelach et al 2015 soil moisture is spatially variable which requires information on certain soil properties for its accurate estimation doolittle and brevik 2014 soil parameters such as texture bulk density organic matter content aggregate structure porosity and pore size all influence soil moisture distribution zhao et al 2011 these parameters vary both horizontally across the landscape and vertically between the different soil layers and horizons sudduth et al 2003 in addition topographical characteristics vegetation lateral and vertical fluxes of water also add to the variability in spatial soil moisture distribution zhao et al 2011 detailed information on these properties can be determined through exhaustive soil sampling however this is time consuming and expensive rallos et al 2013 therefore point scale methods have limited utility value and coverage to determine soil moisture variability over large areas as in the case of broad acre agriculture heathman et al 2012 current approaches for soil moisture measurement rely on a few single point sensors possibly combined with modelling yunusa et al 2004 which may need site specific calibrations furthermore many methods are either sensitive to temperature such as time domain reflectometry tdr capacitance frequency domain reflectometer fdr and the resistive soil moisture sensors or they are hazardous in handling such as neutron moisture metres nmm hübner and kaatze 2016 among recent technologies for on the go soil moisture measurement optical methods offer many advantages over electrical ones lightweight multiplexing capability thermal stability however the utility of optical techniques is mostly limited to shallow depth of 30 cm fabre et al 2015 mananze et al 2019 and can be erroneous due to surface vegetation in addition radiometric attenuation techniques are another prospective digital soil mapping method based on scattering and absorption of gamma rays however wave interruption by surface variations and high operational cost stockmann et al 2015 has restricted this method upto the depth of 30 50 cm reinhardt and herrmann 2019 mobile non destructive or minimally intrusive geophysical technologies are becoming popular for soil moisture sensing in agricultural contexts brogi et al 2019 huang et al 2017 zare et al 2020 these methods are more efficient in terms of spatial coverage as compared to point sensors corwin and lesch 2013 among these geophysical methods electromagnetic induction emi sensors provide the simplest and least expensive method to assess variations of soil parameters such as salinity texture and moisture in agricultural fields james et al 2003 in a contactless way emi sensors measure the bulk soil electrical properties that contribute to the apparent electrical conductivity eca ms m 1 this measured soil eca is a collective response of conductive soil properties like moisture and salts organic matter texture brogi et al 2019 corwin and lesch 2005 bulk density depth to subsurface horizons stratigraphic layers or bedrock doolittle and brevik 2014 thus recording and processing of largescale soil moisture mapping data with high multidimensional variability in soil properties is challenging huang et al 2016 a general relationship of electrical property measured by a sensor and soil parameters like salinity texture and moisture can be deduced however accurate model estimates for precise spatial soil property distribution require many baseline soil samples at each site lesch 2005 previously eca surveys mainly focused assessing soil salinity patterns dakak et al 2017 huang et al 2017 lesch 2005 zhao et al 2020 a study conducted by hedley et al 2013 to assess soil water status and water table depth in a uniform textured maize field demonstrated that emi survey and wireless sensor network data coupled with rainfall data can be used for prediction of soil water dynamics and water table for precision irrigation scheduling nonetheless uniform soil textures are not common in broadacre cropping systems mckenzie et al 2000 a study by mccutcheon et al 2006 in a dryland field of alternating winter wheat and fallow strips in eastern colorado showed that soil water content was a main factor affecting eca values spatially and temporally there have been some studies associating emi measurements to soil differences and yield or soil water taylor et al 2003 concluded that emi observations were useful for assessing the soil variability which in turn was linked with differences in soil water relationships and yield during dry seasons zare et al 2020 estimated volumetric soil moisture content θ using emi taken from field capacity to wilting point in a clay dominant field clay content 35 and recommended using emi for irrigation scheduling huang et al 2016 presented field scale moisture content prediction along transects of a loamy irrigated field at various depths using inversion software i e em4soil monteiro santos 2004 for a multicoil emi instrument most studies using emi for soil moisture assessment were either focused on homogenous bulk soils conducted on irrigated fields hedley et al 2013 huang et al 2016 moghadas et al 2017 zare et al 2020 or required a comprehensive network of fixed sensors and cables inserted in the soil at variable depths for additional point measurements kelly et al 2011 recently the use of inversion algorithms are becoming popular for converting eca into depth specific electrical conductivity this allows the estimation of soil moisture at different depths using empirical and mathematical models huang et al 2016 zare et al 2020 however due to complex interactions of static and dynamic soil properties optimising crop management zones while accounting for soil moisture variability remains a challenge for example calibrations of eca with soil moisture have mostly been published for one dimensional subsurface eca data modelled for homogenous soil types to provide two dimensional subsurface conductivity abdu et al 2017 hossain et al 2010 robinet et al 2018 the aim of this study was to predict field scale θ from eca measured by a multicoil non contact emi instrument and to explore the potential of an inversion algorithm to establish layer conductivities for displaying the moisture contents at different depths in a vertically contrasting field to do this new temperature controlled laboratory θ vs conductivity calibration curves were developed for field scale θ prediction at the instrument s depths of exploration doe further this quasi 3 d moisture profiling method was validated by comparing with neutron moisture metre nmm θ measurements in a field with soil at different moisture levels 2 material and methods a dualem 1hs dualem com http www dualem comemi instrument was used to survey a trial site with different soil moisture levels on two occasions at the same time soil moisture at the trial site was measured using a nmm in addition soil samples from the site were used to determine the relationship between soil water and resistivity inverse of conductivity for different soil depths under controlled laboratory conditions this relationship was used to determine soil moisture from the inverted emi data in order to create the soil moisture maps 2 1 study site the study site was located in the wheatbelt region of western australia wa 160 km east of perth at the cunderdin college of agriculture field site 117 14 37 05 e 31 38 31 62 s fig 1 the area has a mediterranean type climate with hot dry summers and wet cold winters average annual rainfall is 310 mm with 210 mm falling between may and october during the southwest australian growing seasons of winter and spring and 100 mm between november and april during summer and autumn respectively cunderdin airfield no 010035 3 km from the trial site bom 2020 the soil is classified as a red chromosol based on the australian classification system acs isbell 2016 or luvisol based on the international wrb system iuss wrb 2014 general soil properties are a slightly alkaline red duplex sandy clay loam with plant available water capacity of approximately 200 mm in the top 1 6 m of soil and a crop lower limit of about 240 mm the ph cacl2 increases from ph 6 6 in top 10 cm to ph 7 9 at 60 cm the study site was part of a long term no tillage cropping systems experiment from 2007 to 2019 with a total size of 5 4 ha the area was divided into subplots of 40 m 80 m for different crops in 2018 and 2019 fig 2 additional details about the long term no till cropping site are available in ward et al 2012 and flower et al 2017 2 2 emi setup and data collection the dualem 1hs is a non contact multicoil fixed frequency instrument and the sensor incorporates an electromagnetic em transmitter tx with two pairs of em receivers rx contained in a portable structure the tx and one pair of rx have horizontal windings of a coil at distances of 0 5 m and 1 m which forms the horizontal coplanar geometry hcp with doe of 0 8 m and 1 6 m respectively likewise the second rx pair at distances of 0 6 m and 1 1 m from tx has the vertical coil windings which forms the perpendicular geometry prp which has does of 0 3 m and 0 5 m respectively doe is a depth where arrays accumulate 70 of the sensitivity and is a function of coil spacing and orientation mcneill 1980 two emi surveys were conducted across the plots at the trial site in 2019 fig 2 the plots had different soil moisture levels depending on the previous rotation crop and rainfall the first survey was done during dry summer autumn on april 15 the second survey was done during wet winter conditions on july 10 where soil moisture differences were expected to be less to conduct the survey the dualem 1hs was placed in a non conductive polyethylene sled with an approximate elevation of 10 cm from the ground a gps antenna was mounted on the sled for logging the position of the instrument each point was georeferenced with a horizontal accuracy of less than 0 5 m using the beacon dgps function of a hemisphere gps r130 unit this sled was towed by a light vehicle at a speed of 20 km h 1 along four 80 m transects 10 m apart across every plot eca and gps data were collected using geostudi astier dualem log www geostudiastier it http www geostudiastier it acquisition software which was set to log two readings per second the whole survey took approximately 1 h to cover the study site 2 3 nmm data collection a cpn 503dr hydroprobe cpn intl com http www cpn intl com nmm was used for measuring θ two nmm access tubes were installed in each plot to a depth of 2 0 m the nmm tubes were approximately 20 m from the northern end of the plots and 11 m from the western and eastern edges of the plot fig 1 measurements were taken at 0 2 m increments starting 0 1 m below the soil surface measurements followed the protocol and calibration established by ward et al 2012 the first nmm readings were taken on 27 march 2019 18 days prior to the emi survey april 15 2019 dry season with 16 mm of rainfall in the intervening period the second nmm measurements and emi survey was taken on the same day i e july 10 2019 wet season 2 4 soil sampling and laboratory analysis soil samples were taken from each subplot of the site with a 40 mm diameter core having an electrically driven auger bit and vacuum to extract the soil into a sampling bucket these samples were divided into subsamples for analysis of physical and chemical properties and for developing the resistivity to soil water calibration curves any macro structure was destroyed by collection auger and vacuum but micro aggregates were likely maintained laboratory analysis included texture elemental composition cation exchange capacity cec electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste and soil organic carbon details can be found in flower et al 2012 summary of soil analysis is shown in table 1 2 5 laboratory estimation of θ using electrical resistivity tomography ert subsamples of soil were used for developing calibration curves between θ and eca the later derived from resistivity laboratory estimation of ert is an intrusive point scale method which measures the bulk electrical resistivity ρ r resistivity r is inversely related to conductivity c r 1 c under homogenous soil conditions eca is equivalent to the bulk electrical conductivity ecb or true conductivity σ loke et al 2015 soil sub samples from depths of 0 5 m and 0 8 m from across the field were combined and mixed well by hand into homogenised sets for developing the θ calibration equations at these depths moisture calibration at 1 6 m depth was done using the calibration equation of 0 8 m depth a sub sample of each soil depth were placed in a 10 cm 6 25 cm 4 cm plastic container and compressed to a bulk density similar to the measured field conditions and subsequently saturated with di water electrodes at 1 cm total 3 cm spacing were inserted in the sample each plastic container containing saturated soil and electrodes were placed on an automatic scale 0 00 g to note the weight differences over time during drying resistivity was measured with currents of 0 1 5 0 ma resulting in a minimum of 10 mv the resistivity metre 4 point light hp10w lgm from lippmann geophysical equipment https www l gm de was used with a wenner 4 electrode array r of soil sample was taken according to loke 2001 as 1 ρ a 2 π α v i ρ electrical resistivity a cross section of soil sample in cm2 α distance between the electrodes cm i electric current and v measured voltage difference each measurement used a frequency of 4 16 hz and was repeated ten times before being averaged differences between measurements were way below a set threshold of 1 r measurements were recorded simultaneously with the loss of weight taken by the automatic scale on an hourly interval to exclude temperature effects on the resistivity measurements the setup was kept in a temperature control room at 25 c instead of using a petrophysical model such as archie s law archie 1942 we generated a simplified calibration equation and established ert derived resistivity vs θ for two does 0 5 m and 0 8 m fitted to a power law trend line following leopold et al 2021 this means that the ec of the soil solution is considered as constant which adds to the general misfit between our predicted θ from emi data and in the field nmm measurements 2 6 data processing 2 6 1 outlier correction a few outliers in the emi field data attributed to subsurface metallic objects were detected using the hampel filter a python based decision algorithm this filter utilises a moving window of configurable width and defined number of standard deviations here we used a window size of ten data points and three standard deviations to detect outliers the filter replaces the detected outliers by the representative median values delefortrie et al 2014 pearson et al 2016 based on the described threshold total outliers detected were less than 1 of the data in case of both surveys 55 values in wet season and 46 values in dry season survey the code used for applying the filter is available at github repository lewinson 2019 2 6 2 frequency conversion of field eca data the operating frequency of dualem 1hs and ert measurement are 9 khz and 4 16 hz respectively results of measuring electric resistivity or conductivity are partly dependent on the measurement frequency and this effect intensifies with increasing soil resistivity moura et al 2018 to compensate for the two different frequencies each measurement was transformed using the modified portela model described by moura et al 2018 which shows a direct correlation between low frequency soil conductivity and resistivity σ 0 1 ρ 0 as under 2 σ f j ω ε f σ 0 i cot ang π 2 α j ω 2 π 10 6 α substituting δi and α as δ i 0 007 1 σ 0 0 173 and α 0 026 ln 1 σ 0 0 4795 where σ conductivity s m f frequency hz ω 2 π f is angular frequency ε permittivity δ i and α are statistical parameters which express the frequency dependence of soil conductivity and permittivity 2 6 3 quasi 3d inversion and electromagnetic conductivity imaging emci em4soil v3 05 software emtomo 2018 was used to invert the eca data as 1 dimensional literally constrained quasi 2d q2d or quasi 3d q3d inversion this software offers a variety of parameters to achieve the optimal emci generated emci is a matrix of true electrical conductivity σ with minimum difference between measured and calculated eca this is obtained by adjusting factors of a forward modelling either based on linear cumulative function cf mcneill 1980 or non linear full solution fs frischknecht 1988 b inversion algorithms s1 and s2 based on occam regularisation sasaki 2001 1989 and c damping factor λ from 0 03 to 30 best inversion results were obtained by setting cf model s2 algorithm with 0 07 λ for 10 iterations using a uniform initial model σ 100 ms m 1 inversion parameters of cf model s2 algorithm and λ 0 07 were selected based on highest coefficient of determination between measured and predicted eca smallest rmse and misfit value table 2 the most important factors of model selection are geology and the geophysical arrays used in the data acquisition triantafilis et al 2013 the study site was classified as chromosol duplex along with having an influence of ground water table moreover out of our four dualem 1hs channels we excluded data from the top 0 5 m prp array because the sensor height was 10 cm above the surface and thus is not the true representative of 70 emi signal strength for the top 0 3 m soil depth hence a three layers model was used for inversion resulting into the depth slices of 0 0 5 m 0 5 0 8 m and 0 8 1 6 m the inverted eca was kriged using a 5 m grid in vesper variogram estimation and spatial prediction plus error software minasny et al 2005 2 6 4 cross validation of θ prediction with nmm measurements to validate the prediction of θ using emi results were compared with nmm measurements inverted eca measurements within diameter of 7 m around nmm were extracted for the 26 nmm sites and were tested for coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean error me this gave approximately 5 6 emi data points around each nmm tube 3 results 3 1 electromagnetic conductivity imaging emci of inverted layers fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of inverted eca at three does that are further explained as soil depth slices of 0 0 5 m 0 5 0 8 m and 0 8 1 6 m for both dry and wet season during the dry season the top measured depth of 0 0 5 m fig 3a had comparatively low eca values of less than 5 ms m 1 to 10 ms m 1 throughout most parts of the area except for two distinct regions with increased eca values of 10 18 ms m 1 clearly visible at plot 104 and plot 206 for 0 5 0 8 m depth slice fig 3b eca values are generally higher than the top depth slice fig 3a this map fig 3b could be grouped into three ranges of 14 18 ms m 1 at eastern side of the field most of the west and middle part of the field had varying values up to 20 22 ms m 1 and comparatively higher eca upto 26 49 ms m 1 detected in the two fallow plots labelled as 104 and 206 deepest measured depth of 0 8 1 6 m fig 3c shows the highest eca values the data range of this depth was from 55 to 60 ms m 1 at the eastern side 66 71 ms m 1 for most of the western and the middle part of the field but was as high as 75 ms m 1 to 90 ms m 1 at distinct areas of plot 104 and 206 measurements taken during the wet season had overall higher eca values compared to the dry season and the distribution was more homogenous for the top measured depth of 0 0 5 m fig 3d most of the area had eca values ranging from 16 to 18 ms m 1 with the lowest eca values range of 13 15 ms m 1 at the bottom west part at plot 105 and 106 and with slightly higher eca values of 19 21 ms m 1 in the middle part of the field in plot 203 and 204 for 0 5 0 8 m depth slice fig 3e eca values were again generally higher than the top depth slice and mostly in the eca range of 37 39 ms m 1 however there were comparatively low eca values of 30 35 ms m 1 in the lower western part plot 105 and 106 and higher eca values of 40 45 ms m 1 in the middle part of the field at plot 203 and 204 the deepest measured depth of 0 8 1 6 m fig 3f contained the highest eca values ranging from 75 82 ms m 1 this range covered most of the western part of the field including the fallow plots 104 and 206 and plot 203 eastern part of the field showed an eca range of 70 75 ms m 1 while middle part of the field contained a mix of these high eca ranges the percentage difference maps fig 3g and h show a substantial change in eca from dry to wet season at the depths of 0 0 5 m and 0 5 0 8 m depths the fallow plots showed a very small increase in eca as compared to the rest of the area fig 3g and h hence the fallow plots in the top two depth slices does not appear distinctly in wet season survey fig 3d and e the deepest measured depth of 0 8 1 6 m showed the least change in eca fig 3i 3 2 estimation of volumetric moisture content θ from eca a strong power law correlation was generated between θ and soil electrical resistivity ωm from the soil samples collected at the depth of 0 5 m and 0 8 m with r2 of 0 98 fig 4a and 0 99 fig 4b respectively table 3 shows the summary statistics of calculated θ using ert emi calibration curves with the soil moisture values shown in fig 4 the soil moisture maps fig 6 show a similar pattern to the eca maps fig 3 considering all emi data table 3 the average estimated θ of the top measured depth of 0 0 5 m was 5 5 which was the lowest of the three depth slices under dry soil conditions the mean value increased to 15 1 in the 0 5 0 8 m depth and an average θ of 33 8 was calculated from 0 8 to 1 6 m depth slice for the second survey during the wet soil conditions top 0 0 5 m depth had an average estimated θ of 12 2 the average θ increased to 23 1 for 0 5 0 8 m soil depth and the highest average θ of 37 4 for 0 8 1 6 m soil depth 3 3 comparison of θ from emi and nmm θ a comparison of nmm measurements with emi values around the vicinity of nmm access tubes shows strong coefficient of determination of 0 90 for the dry summer conditions fig 5 however there was considerably more variation in nmm reading than predicted values within the 0 5 0 8 m depth fig 5a and c also the nmm readings tended to be lower than the predicted values at the 0 5 0 8 and 0 8 1 6 m depth slices in the wet season similar patterns occurred except that the nmm θ measurement at 0 8 1 6 m were markedly lower 27 48 than the predicted values 37 42 resulting in smaller r2 of 0 54 fig 5b and d 3 4 spatial distribution of calculated θ fig 6 presents the spatial map of predicted θ based on emi measurements estimated θ has the same trend as shown by inverted eca spatial distribution where in dry season estimated θ is higher in the fallow plots 104 and 206 as compared to the rest of area table 4 while the wet season shows more uniform distribution of θ in the whole field over all the wet season had higher θ than the dry season table 4 similarly the percentage difference maps shows substantial increase in estimated θ in the top two depth slices fig 6g and h except for the fallow plots which showed the minimum change in moisture values while the deepest depth slice fig 6i showed the least increase in θ over the seasons 4 discussion this study shows that a non contact minimal intrusive emi survey calibrated by ert emi power law equation is an efficient way of predicting field scale θ for different soil depths up to 1 6 m the predictions were done using inversion algorithm with r2 of 0 90 and 0 54 for dry and wet soil conditions respectively emi surveys showed variable distribution of eca over the area which increased with soil depth in both dry and wet season surveys hcp coils with deeper doe 0 8 and 1 6 m had higher eca values as compared to prp coil with doe of 0 5 m eca can be a reliable expression of field scale θ provided the impact of other soil parameters are known el naggar et al 2021 the study site was a part of a long term no tillage experiment hence changes in the soil physical characters like bulk density were considered minimum pore water electrical conductivity variations have greater impact in the saline fields corwin and lesch 2005 and in the irrigated fields while in the non saline rainfed condition fertiliser application increases the soil electrical conductivity blanchy et al 2020a temperature variability influence the measured eca in cold climates when the air temperatures at or below 12 c or soil temperatures are at or below 8 c while in relatively uniform climate eca spatial patterns remain consistent brevik et al 2004 allred et al 2005 hence the soil moisture was the main variable factor at this site from dry to wet season which suggests that changes in eca values are a response governed by changes in soil moisture rather than the texture 4 1 ert emi power law calibration performance various methods have been used for calibration of emi data including the excavated pit method hossain et al 2010 zare et al 2020 using mathematical modelling of various soil samples huang et al 2016 and in field ert transects for modelling of horizontal and vertical changes in eca lavoué et al 2010 von hebel et al 2014 however these in field ert transects needs temperature corrections ma et al 2011 and are more representative of lateral soil variations where 1d transect data is stitched to get 3d subsurface model this method also requires a large range of eca values which limits its application for wide range of agricultural scenarios blanchy et al 2020b making it more suitable for homogenous soils or catchment scale applications von hebel et al 2014 2019 garré et al 2013 2011 quantified three dimensional water content changes in layered soil by converting the in situ electrical resistivity values into ecb to establish the depth specific ecb soil water content relation using tdr however this is point scale method and cannot account for spatial variability of broad acre fields blanchy et al 2020a this paper presented a new methodology of ert emi power law calibration of field scale quasi 3d eca data to predict soil moisture values at different soil depths ert emi power law calibration has a strong correlation for dry season with r2 of 0 90 however in wet season higher eca values in 1 6 m depth compared with nmm resulted in a lower r2 of 0 54 fig 5 impact of soil water variability on eca is most prominent in upper two depth slices in both seasons fig 4a b d e the depths most meaningful in agriculture for the dry season except for the fallow plots average θ in the top two depth slices was 5 5 and 15 09 cm3cm 3 which is close to the wilting point of sandy loam loam and silt soil textures respectively tsoar 2005 the deeper depth slice 0 8 1 6 m had available θ but this depth is beyond most of the root zone of grain crops nielsen and vigil 2018 while in the wet season average θ for the three soil depth slices was near to the field capacity in all the depths tsoar 2005 table 4 ert emi power law calibration allowed a direct relationship between eca and soil water content in addition this calibration was easy to obtain and a database of such ert to soil water relationship could be easily established for different soil types which would help in providing an alternative to point methods for wide spread agriculture use 4 2 inversion strength the use of inversion algorithms for mapping soil characteristics is becoming more common huang et al 2017 2016 von hebel et al 2014 zare et al 2020 however calibrating inverted soil depth slices using ert emi power law curves for mapping field scale soil moisture had not been characterised based on validation with nmm θ measurements our study demonstrated the spatial distribution of calculated θ over the area at measured depths corresponds to inverted eca maps comparison of nmm measurements with predicted θ from inverted eca has higher pearson r 0 95 for the dry and 0 74 for the wet season as compared to predicted θ from non inverted eca 0 85 for the dry and 0 61 for the wet season results not shown this confirms that using the inversion algorithm improves the prediction of layer conductivities in order to determine θ in various soil depths in addition eca based θ shows less variability than nmm measurements probably due to having more measurements which are averaged over the depth interval compared with fewer point measurements of nmm nonetheless predicted θ from inverted eca could depict the varying residual soil water following different crop rotations including fallow angus et al 2001 nielsen and vigil 2018 page et al 2019 which is a helpful for making farm management decisions 4 3 emi maps in context of crop rotation both emi surveys were done under different soil moisture conditions due to temporal seasonal differences dry summer autumn and wet winter and by the type of rotation crops as different crops have different soil water extraction rates from different depths angus et al 2001 nielsen and vigil 2018 page et al 2019 the impact of different crop rotations resulting in additional moisture variability at the site was clearly detected in the dry season eca survey the two fallow plots showed increased soil water as a result of the absence of crops in the previous season o leary and connor 1997 russell 1996 has also reported that the carry over impact of soil moisture from fallowing is high after relatively dry seasons which is evident in our soil moisture results this further confirms that the differences in eca were due to variation in soil moisture as shown by rhoades et al 1976 and also that emi surveys are helpful to measure the carry over effects of different crop rotations management on soil moisture levels the percentage difference maps clearly show that the high eca values detected by fallow plots in the dry season have been covered by extra moisture in the soil after the rains during the wet season this may be important for prediction of potential yield and rates of inputs like fertilisers through modelling for upcoming crops keating et al 2003 these differences were not distinct for wet season maps largely due to measurements being taken after the start of the rains in 2019 where soil moisture in the other plots had increased to a similar level moreover russell 1996 and flower et al 2021 reported that in rotation with fallow areas soil moisture use by subsequent crop is higher than non fallow areas adding to even out the soil moisture differences although crop water use wasn t the scope of this study our results indicate the possible usefulness of this method to estimate the change in volumetric soil moisture over time at different depths which could be used to infer the depth of crop roots and also overall crop water use 4 4 limitations and scope the soil moisture derived from eca measurements for the 1 6 m depth was higher than the nmm for both dry and wet season it is possible that there was secondary salinity deeper in the profile one limitation of this study is that no soil samples were taken from the 1 6 m soil depth for the ert emi moisture calibration which may have affected the results of this depth this deeper sample was not done since 1 6 m is below where most roots are active djaman and irmak 2012 so a substitution with values from the 0 8 m depth range with similar soil texture seemed justified secondly for dry season nmm readings were taken 18 days prior to emi survey with 16 mm of rainfall in the intervening period which might have resulted in creating the difference between nmm reading and predicted θ values it would be ideal to take both readings as close as possible moreover we did not take the soil temperature at each depth during the surveys however recorded temperature during the dry survey april 15 2019 was 25 5 c and for the wet survey july 10 2019 was 18 2 c while the temperature of the emi sensor throughout these surveys was stable with averages of 25 2 c and 18 4 c respectively for a standardise analysis we tested the temperature correction of eca at 25 c ma et al 2011 since the temperature difference is small it showed no influence on the results of moisture calculation as per the findings of brevik et al 2004 and allred et al 2005 despite many advantages of this method of estimating field scale soil moisture there is still likely to be uncertainty around the spatial estimate of moisture content where soil conditions markedly vary in the fields future work will be directed towards developing soil moisture zones in fields with contrasting soil textures and salinity levels to widen the potential use of the method to put these results in broader farming aspect availability of such soil moisture maps will be valuable for farmers to use as the basis for varying crop inputs in precision agriculture cropping systems and to predict crop yield potential using models like the agricultural production systems simulator apsim 5 conclusion this study demonstrated how spatial eca data acquired by dualem 1hs can be used to determine true layer conductivities of soil by using inversion algorithms em4soil and calibration of these layer conductivities into reliable representative θ using laboratory based ert emi calibration curves this method is robust relatively quick and inexpensive for estimating soil moisture status in the field to make farm management decisions however these calibration curves are dependent on soil depth and texture and similar baseline studies of various soil textures can be helpful in predicting θ for different field conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

9832,knowledge of real time spatial distribution of soil moisture has great potential to improve yield and profit in agricultural systems recent advances in non invasive electromagnetic induction emi techniques have created an opportunity to determine soil moisture content with high resolution and minimal soil intrusion so far emi has mainly been used for homogenous soil conditions which are not common in agriculture and results are mainly validated by excavated pits or calibration models using soil samples on a transect this study converts apparent electrical conductivity data recorded with a dualem 1hs em metre for two surveys of variable moisture conditions dry and wet season with 2475 and 2174 data points over 5 4 ha in a field with a contrasting vertical soil profile into spatiotemporal management zones a least square inversion algorithm was used to determine electrical conductivities for individual soil layers of 0 0 5 m 0 5 0 8 m and 0 8 1 6 m soil samples from the depth of 0 5 m and 0 8 m were used for soil moisture calibrations a laboratory experiment under controlled conditions developed electric conductivity vs volumetric water content relations with power law functions for required soil depth slices with r2 values between 0 98 and 0 99 subsequently emi data were converted to volumetric water contents for each layer and predictions were spatially displayed median change between the measured apparent conductivity and inverted values range from 6 to 17 ms m 1 resulting in 3 7 difference in volumetric water prediction these emi based soil moisture predictions were compared with neutron moisture metre measurements with pearson r values of 0 74 and 0 95 for the wet and dry season surveys respectively the method is robust and offers a comparatively fast method to estimate the soil moisture status in fields and subsequently make informed management decisions keywords soil volumetric water content em inversion electrical resistivity tomography crop rotation 1 introduction soil moisture is a key factor of controlling the terrestrial water and energy exchange process zhang et al 2015 its spatial and temporal variability define the basis of management strategies in agriculture huntington 2010 it directly influences the soil microenvironment decisions on crop inputs farm waste reduction lesch 2005 and ultimately farm productivity moreover three quarters of world croplands are established in rainfed areas and these areas will not only remain the hub of generating global food but will also be expected to escalate their production with the projected population increase bradford et al 2017 in addition to continuous increase in urban water consumption dai 2012 a general concern for long term sustainability of agriculture is decreased annual rainfall and increased temperature mcfarlane et al 2020 seasonal changes in rainfall amount intensity and distribution lead to shifts in risks associated with farm management like a shorter growing season loss of landscape vegetation cover organic carbon decline wind erosion and increased temperatures iizumi and ramankutty 2015 predictions are for more discrete heavier rainfalls with prolonged dry spells and high temperatures during the cropping season that will critically deplete soil moisture in various parts of the world like north and central america the mediterranean southern africa and amazon cook et al 2014 the australian bureau of meteorology bom csiro 2016 has reported an 11 decline in rainfall from 1996 to 2015 causing a significant drying trend across southern australia in the april october growing season and a 19 decline in rainfall between may and july in southwest western australia wa the efficacy of applied crop inputs depends upon the availability of soil moisture half of the gap in actual wheat production from its potential yield relates to soil moisture variations hochman and horan 2018 lv et al 2017 maximised crop yields with optimum nutrient uptake can be achieved by responding to spatially well characterised soil moisture status grote et al 2010 in addition soil moisture variations influence the soil biological activities and temperature which in turn strongly affect the root development and their interactions with available nutrients zhang et al 2019 therefore knowledge of real time spatial distribution of plant available soil moisture is one of the most important yield and profit determining factors in agriculture gerssen gondelach et al 2015 soil moisture is spatially variable which requires information on certain soil properties for its accurate estimation doolittle and brevik 2014 soil parameters such as texture bulk density organic matter content aggregate structure porosity and pore size all influence soil moisture distribution zhao et al 2011 these parameters vary both horizontally across the landscape and vertically between the different soil layers and horizons sudduth et al 2003 in addition topographical characteristics vegetation lateral and vertical fluxes of water also add to the variability in spatial soil moisture distribution zhao et al 2011 detailed information on these properties can be determined through exhaustive soil sampling however this is time consuming and expensive rallos et al 2013 therefore point scale methods have limited utility value and coverage to determine soil moisture variability over large areas as in the case of broad acre agriculture heathman et al 2012 current approaches for soil moisture measurement rely on a few single point sensors possibly combined with modelling yunusa et al 2004 which may need site specific calibrations furthermore many methods are either sensitive to temperature such as time domain reflectometry tdr capacitance frequency domain reflectometer fdr and the resistive soil moisture sensors or they are hazardous in handling such as neutron moisture metres nmm hübner and kaatze 2016 among recent technologies for on the go soil moisture measurement optical methods offer many advantages over electrical ones lightweight multiplexing capability thermal stability however the utility of optical techniques is mostly limited to shallow depth of 30 cm fabre et al 2015 mananze et al 2019 and can be erroneous due to surface vegetation in addition radiometric attenuation techniques are another prospective digital soil mapping method based on scattering and absorption of gamma rays however wave interruption by surface variations and high operational cost stockmann et al 2015 has restricted this method upto the depth of 30 50 cm reinhardt and herrmann 2019 mobile non destructive or minimally intrusive geophysical technologies are becoming popular for soil moisture sensing in agricultural contexts brogi et al 2019 huang et al 2017 zare et al 2020 these methods are more efficient in terms of spatial coverage as compared to point sensors corwin and lesch 2013 among these geophysical methods electromagnetic induction emi sensors provide the simplest and least expensive method to assess variations of soil parameters such as salinity texture and moisture in agricultural fields james et al 2003 in a contactless way emi sensors measure the bulk soil electrical properties that contribute to the apparent electrical conductivity eca ms m 1 this measured soil eca is a collective response of conductive soil properties like moisture and salts organic matter texture brogi et al 2019 corwin and lesch 2005 bulk density depth to subsurface horizons stratigraphic layers or bedrock doolittle and brevik 2014 thus recording and processing of largescale soil moisture mapping data with high multidimensional variability in soil properties is challenging huang et al 2016 a general relationship of electrical property measured by a sensor and soil parameters like salinity texture and moisture can be deduced however accurate model estimates for precise spatial soil property distribution require many baseline soil samples at each site lesch 2005 previously eca surveys mainly focused assessing soil salinity patterns dakak et al 2017 huang et al 2017 lesch 2005 zhao et al 2020 a study conducted by hedley et al 2013 to assess soil water status and water table depth in a uniform textured maize field demonstrated that emi survey and wireless sensor network data coupled with rainfall data can be used for prediction of soil water dynamics and water table for precision irrigation scheduling nonetheless uniform soil textures are not common in broadacre cropping systems mckenzie et al 2000 a study by mccutcheon et al 2006 in a dryland field of alternating winter wheat and fallow strips in eastern colorado showed that soil water content was a main factor affecting eca values spatially and temporally there have been some studies associating emi measurements to soil differences and yield or soil water taylor et al 2003 concluded that emi observations were useful for assessing the soil variability which in turn was linked with differences in soil water relationships and yield during dry seasons zare et al 2020 estimated volumetric soil moisture content θ using emi taken from field capacity to wilting point in a clay dominant field clay content 35 and recommended using emi for irrigation scheduling huang et al 2016 presented field scale moisture content prediction along transects of a loamy irrigated field at various depths using inversion software i e em4soil monteiro santos 2004 for a multicoil emi instrument most studies using emi for soil moisture assessment were either focused on homogenous bulk soils conducted on irrigated fields hedley et al 2013 huang et al 2016 moghadas et al 2017 zare et al 2020 or required a comprehensive network of fixed sensors and cables inserted in the soil at variable depths for additional point measurements kelly et al 2011 recently the use of inversion algorithms are becoming popular for converting eca into depth specific electrical conductivity this allows the estimation of soil moisture at different depths using empirical and mathematical models huang et al 2016 zare et al 2020 however due to complex interactions of static and dynamic soil properties optimising crop management zones while accounting for soil moisture variability remains a challenge for example calibrations of eca with soil moisture have mostly been published for one dimensional subsurface eca data modelled for homogenous soil types to provide two dimensional subsurface conductivity abdu et al 2017 hossain et al 2010 robinet et al 2018 the aim of this study was to predict field scale θ from eca measured by a multicoil non contact emi instrument and to explore the potential of an inversion algorithm to establish layer conductivities for displaying the moisture contents at different depths in a vertically contrasting field to do this new temperature controlled laboratory θ vs conductivity calibration curves were developed for field scale θ prediction at the instrument s depths of exploration doe further this quasi 3 d moisture profiling method was validated by comparing with neutron moisture metre nmm θ measurements in a field with soil at different moisture levels 2 material and methods a dualem 1hs dualem com http www dualem comemi instrument was used to survey a trial site with different soil moisture levels on two occasions at the same time soil moisture at the trial site was measured using a nmm in addition soil samples from the site were used to determine the relationship between soil water and resistivity inverse of conductivity for different soil depths under controlled laboratory conditions this relationship was used to determine soil moisture from the inverted emi data in order to create the soil moisture maps 2 1 study site the study site was located in the wheatbelt region of western australia wa 160 km east of perth at the cunderdin college of agriculture field site 117 14 37 05 e 31 38 31 62 s fig 1 the area has a mediterranean type climate with hot dry summers and wet cold winters average annual rainfall is 310 mm with 210 mm falling between may and october during the southwest australian growing seasons of winter and spring and 100 mm between november and april during summer and autumn respectively cunderdin airfield no 010035 3 km from the trial site bom 2020 the soil is classified as a red chromosol based on the australian classification system acs isbell 2016 or luvisol based on the international wrb system iuss wrb 2014 general soil properties are a slightly alkaline red duplex sandy clay loam with plant available water capacity of approximately 200 mm in the top 1 6 m of soil and a crop lower limit of about 240 mm the ph cacl2 increases from ph 6 6 in top 10 cm to ph 7 9 at 60 cm the study site was part of a long term no tillage cropping systems experiment from 2007 to 2019 with a total size of 5 4 ha the area was divided into subplots of 40 m 80 m for different crops in 2018 and 2019 fig 2 additional details about the long term no till cropping site are available in ward et al 2012 and flower et al 2017 2 2 emi setup and data collection the dualem 1hs is a non contact multicoil fixed frequency instrument and the sensor incorporates an electromagnetic em transmitter tx with two pairs of em receivers rx contained in a portable structure the tx and one pair of rx have horizontal windings of a coil at distances of 0 5 m and 1 m which forms the horizontal coplanar geometry hcp with doe of 0 8 m and 1 6 m respectively likewise the second rx pair at distances of 0 6 m and 1 1 m from tx has the vertical coil windings which forms the perpendicular geometry prp which has does of 0 3 m and 0 5 m respectively doe is a depth where arrays accumulate 70 of the sensitivity and is a function of coil spacing and orientation mcneill 1980 two emi surveys were conducted across the plots at the trial site in 2019 fig 2 the plots had different soil moisture levels depending on the previous rotation crop and rainfall the first survey was done during dry summer autumn on april 15 the second survey was done during wet winter conditions on july 10 where soil moisture differences were expected to be less to conduct the survey the dualem 1hs was placed in a non conductive polyethylene sled with an approximate elevation of 10 cm from the ground a gps antenna was mounted on the sled for logging the position of the instrument each point was georeferenced with a horizontal accuracy of less than 0 5 m using the beacon dgps function of a hemisphere gps r130 unit this sled was towed by a light vehicle at a speed of 20 km h 1 along four 80 m transects 10 m apart across every plot eca and gps data were collected using geostudi astier dualem log www geostudiastier it http www geostudiastier it acquisition software which was set to log two readings per second the whole survey took approximately 1 h to cover the study site 2 3 nmm data collection a cpn 503dr hydroprobe cpn intl com http www cpn intl com nmm was used for measuring θ two nmm access tubes were installed in each plot to a depth of 2 0 m the nmm tubes were approximately 20 m from the northern end of the plots and 11 m from the western and eastern edges of the plot fig 1 measurements were taken at 0 2 m increments starting 0 1 m below the soil surface measurements followed the protocol and calibration established by ward et al 2012 the first nmm readings were taken on 27 march 2019 18 days prior to the emi survey april 15 2019 dry season with 16 mm of rainfall in the intervening period the second nmm measurements and emi survey was taken on the same day i e july 10 2019 wet season 2 4 soil sampling and laboratory analysis soil samples were taken from each subplot of the site with a 40 mm diameter core having an electrically driven auger bit and vacuum to extract the soil into a sampling bucket these samples were divided into subsamples for analysis of physical and chemical properties and for developing the resistivity to soil water calibration curves any macro structure was destroyed by collection auger and vacuum but micro aggregates were likely maintained laboratory analysis included texture elemental composition cation exchange capacity cec electrical conductivity of saturated soil paste and soil organic carbon details can be found in flower et al 2012 summary of soil analysis is shown in table 1 2 5 laboratory estimation of θ using electrical resistivity tomography ert subsamples of soil were used for developing calibration curves between θ and eca the later derived from resistivity laboratory estimation of ert is an intrusive point scale method which measures the bulk electrical resistivity ρ r resistivity r is inversely related to conductivity c r 1 c under homogenous soil conditions eca is equivalent to the bulk electrical conductivity ecb or true conductivity σ loke et al 2015 soil sub samples from depths of 0 5 m and 0 8 m from across the field were combined and mixed well by hand into homogenised sets for developing the θ calibration equations at these depths moisture calibration at 1 6 m depth was done using the calibration equation of 0 8 m depth a sub sample of each soil depth were placed in a 10 cm 6 25 cm 4 cm plastic container and compressed to a bulk density similar to the measured field conditions and subsequently saturated with di water electrodes at 1 cm total 3 cm spacing were inserted in the sample each plastic container containing saturated soil and electrodes were placed on an automatic scale 0 00 g to note the weight differences over time during drying resistivity was measured with currents of 0 1 5 0 ma resulting in a minimum of 10 mv the resistivity metre 4 point light hp10w lgm from lippmann geophysical equipment https www l gm de was used with a wenner 4 electrode array r of soil sample was taken according to loke 2001 as 1 ρ a 2 π α v i ρ electrical resistivity a cross section of soil sample in cm2 α distance between the electrodes cm i electric current and v measured voltage difference each measurement used a frequency of 4 16 hz and was repeated ten times before being averaged differences between measurements were way below a set threshold of 1 r measurements were recorded simultaneously with the loss of weight taken by the automatic scale on an hourly interval to exclude temperature effects on the resistivity measurements the setup was kept in a temperature control room at 25 c instead of using a petrophysical model such as archie s law archie 1942 we generated a simplified calibration equation and established ert derived resistivity vs θ for two does 0 5 m and 0 8 m fitted to a power law trend line following leopold et al 2021 this means that the ec of the soil solution is considered as constant which adds to the general misfit between our predicted θ from emi data and in the field nmm measurements 2 6 data processing 2 6 1 outlier correction a few outliers in the emi field data attributed to subsurface metallic objects were detected using the hampel filter a python based decision algorithm this filter utilises a moving window of configurable width and defined number of standard deviations here we used a window size of ten data points and three standard deviations to detect outliers the filter replaces the detected outliers by the representative median values delefortrie et al 2014 pearson et al 2016 based on the described threshold total outliers detected were less than 1 of the data in case of both surveys 55 values in wet season and 46 values in dry season survey the code used for applying the filter is available at github repository lewinson 2019 2 6 2 frequency conversion of field eca data the operating frequency of dualem 1hs and ert measurement are 9 khz and 4 16 hz respectively results of measuring electric resistivity or conductivity are partly dependent on the measurement frequency and this effect intensifies with increasing soil resistivity moura et al 2018 to compensate for the two different frequencies each measurement was transformed using the modified portela model described by moura et al 2018 which shows a direct correlation between low frequency soil conductivity and resistivity σ 0 1 ρ 0 as under 2 σ f j ω ε f σ 0 i cot ang π

statistical parameters which express the frequency dependence of soil conductivity and permittivity 2 6 3 quasi 3d inversion and electromagnetic conductivity imaging emci em4soil v3 05 software emtomo 2018 was used to invert the eca data as 1 dimensional literally constrained quasi 2d q2d or quasi 3d q3d inversion this software offers a variety of parameters to achieve the optimal emci generated emci is a matrix of true electrical conductivity σ with minimum difference between measured and calculated eca this is obtained by adjusting factors of a forward modelling either based on linear cumulative function cf mcneill 1980 or non linear full solution fs frischknecht 1988 b inversion algorithms s1 and s2 based on occam regularisation sasaki 2001 1989 and c damping factor λ from 0 03 to 30 best inversion results were obtained by setting cf model s2 algorithm with 0 07 λ for 10 iterations using a uniform initial model σ 100 ms m 1 inversion parameters of cf model s2 algorithm and λ 0 07 were selected based on highest coefficient of determination between measured and predicted eca smallest rmse and misfit value table 2 the most important factors of model selection are geology and the geophysical arrays used in the data acquisition triantafilis et al 2013 the study site was classified as chromosol duplex along with having an influence of ground water table moreover out of our four dualem 1hs channels we excluded data from the top 0 5 m prp array because the sensor height was 10 cm above the surface and thus is not the true representative of 70 emi signal strength for the top 0 3 m soil depth hence a three layers model was used for inversion resulting into the depth slices of 0 0 5 m 0 5 0 8 m and 0 8 1 6 m the inverted eca was kriged using a 5 m grid in vesper variogram estimation and spatial prediction plus error software minasny et al 2005 2 6 4 cross validation of θ prediction with nmm measurements to validate the prediction of θ using emi results were compared with nmm measurements inverted eca measurements within diameter of 7 m around nmm were extracted for the 26 nmm sites and were tested for coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean error me this gave approximately 5 6 emi data points around each nmm tube 3 results 3 1 electromagnetic conductivity imaging emci of inverted layers fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of inverted eca at three does that are further explained as soil depth slices of 0 0 5 m 0 5 0 8 m and 0 8 1 6 m for both dry and wet season during the dry season the top measured depth of 0 0 5 m fig 3a had comparatively low eca values of less than 5 ms m 1 to 10 ms m 1 throughout most parts of the area except for two distinct regions with increased eca values of 10 18 ms m 1 clearly visible at plot 104 and plot 206 for 0 5 0 8 m depth slice fig 3b eca values are generally higher than the top depth slice fig 3a this map fig 3b could be grouped into three ranges of 14 18 ms m 1 at eastern side of the field most of the west and middle part of the field had varying values up to 20 22 ms m 1 and comparatively higher eca upto 26 49 ms m 1 detected in the two fallow plots labelled as 104 and 206 deepest measured depth of 0 8 1 6 m fig 3c shows the highest eca values the data range of this depth was from 55 to 60 ms m 1 at the eastern side 66 71 ms m 1 for most of the western and the middle part of the field but was as high as 75 ms m 1 to 90 ms m 1 at distinct areas of plot 104 and 206 measurements taken during the wet season had overall higher eca values compared to the dry season and the distribution was more homogenous for the top measured depth of 0 0 5 m fig 3d most of the area had eca values ranging from 16 to 18 ms m 1 with the lowest eca values range of 13 15 ms m 1 at the bottom west part at plot 105 and 106 and with slightly higher eca values of 19 21 ms m 1 in the middle part of the field in plot 203 and 204 for 0 5 0 8 m depth slice fig 3e eca values were again generally higher than the top depth slice and mostly in the eca range of 37 39 ms m 1 however there were comparatively low eca values of 30 35 ms m 1 in the lower western part plot 105 and 106 and higher eca values of 40 45 ms m 1 in the middle part of the field at plot 203 and 204 the deepest measured depth of 0 8 1 6 m fig 3f contained the highest eca values ranging from 75 82 ms m 1 this range covered most of the western part of the field including the fallow plots 104 and 206 and plot 203 eastern part of the field showed an eca range of 70 75 ms m 1 while middle part of the field contained a mix of these high eca ranges the percentage difference maps fig 3g and h show a substantial change in eca from dry to wet season at the depths of 0 0 5 m and 0 5 0 8 m depths the fallow plots showed a very small increase in eca as compared to the rest of the area fig 3g and h hence the fallow plots in the top two depth slices does not appear distinctly in wet season survey fig 3d and e the deepest measured depth of 0 8 1 6 m showed the least change in eca fig 3i 3 2 estimation of volumetric moisture content θ from eca a strong power law correlation was generated between θ and soil electrical resistivity ωm from the soil samples collected at the depth of 0 5 m and 0 8 m with r2 of 0 98 fig 4a and 0 99 fig 4b respectively table 3 shows the summary statistics of calculated θ using ert emi calibration curves with the soil moisture values shown in fig 4 the soil moisture maps fig 6 show a similar pattern to the eca maps fig 3 considering all emi data table 3 the average estimated θ of the top measured depth of 0 0 5 m was 5 5 which was the lowest of the three depth slices under dry soil conditions the mean value increased to 15 1 in the 0 5 0 8 m depth and an average θ of 33 8 was calculated from 0 8 to 1 6 m depth slice for the second survey during the wet soil conditions top 0 0 5 m depth had an average estimated θ of 12 2 the average θ increased to 23 1 for 0 5 0 8 m soil depth and the highest average θ of 37 4 for 0 8 1 6 m soil depth 3 3 comparison of θ from emi and nmm θ a comparison of nmm measurements with emi values around the vicinity of nmm access tubes shows strong coefficient of determination of 0 90 for the dry summer conditions fig 5 however there was considerably more variation in nmm reading than predicted values within the 0 5 0 8 m depth fig 5a and c also the nmm readings tended to be lower than the predicted values at the 0 5 0 8 and 0 8 1 6 m depth slices in the wet season similar patterns occurred except that the nmm θ measurement at 0 8 1 6 m were markedly lower 27 48 than the predicted values 37 42 resulting in smaller r2 of 0 54 fig 5b and d 3 4 spatial distribution of calculated θ fig 6 presents the spatial map of predicted θ based on emi measurements estimated θ has the same trend as shown by inverted eca spatial distribution where in dry season estimated θ is higher in the fallow plots 104 and 206 as compared to the rest of area table 4 while the wet season shows more uniform distribution of θ in the whole field over all the wet season had higher θ than the dry season table 4 similarly the percentage difference maps shows substantial increase in estimated θ in the top two depth slices fig 6g and h except for the fallow plots which showed the minimum change in moisture values while the deepest depth slice fig 6i showed the least increase in θ over the seasons 4 discussion this study shows that a non contact minimal intrusive emi survey calibrated by ert emi power law equation is an efficient way of predicting field scale θ for different soil depths up to 1 6 m the predictions were done using inversion algorithm with r2 of 0 90 and 0 54 for dry and wet soil conditions respectively emi surveys showed variable distribution of eca over the area which increased with soil depth in both dry and wet season surveys hcp coils with deeper doe 0 8 and 1 6 m had higher eca values as compared to prp coil with doe of 0 5 m eca can be a reliable expression of field scale θ provided the impact of other soil parameters are known el naggar et al 2021 the study site was a part of a long term no tillage experiment hence changes in the soil physical characters like bulk density were considered minimum pore water electrical conductivity variations have greater impact in the saline fields corwin and lesch 2005 and in the irrigated fields while in the non saline rainfed condition fertiliser application increases the soil electrical conductivity blanchy et al 2020a temperature variability influence the measured eca in cold climates when the air temperatures at or below 12 c or soil temperatures are at or below 8 c while in relatively uniform climate eca spatial patterns remain consistent brevik et al 2004 allred et al 2005 hence the soil moisture was the main variable factor at this site from dry to wet season which suggests that changes in eca values are a response governed by changes in soil moisture rather than the texture 4 1 ert emi power law calibration performance various methods have been used for calibration of emi data including the excavated pit method hossain et al 2010 zare et al 2020 using mathematical modelling of various soil samples huang et al 2016 and in field ert transects for modelling of horizontal and vertical changes in eca lavoué et al 2010 von hebel et al 2014 however these in field ert transects needs temperature corrections ma et al 2011 and are more representative of lateral soil variations where 1d transect data is stitched to get 3d subsurface model this method also requires a large range of eca values which limits its application for wide range of agricultural scenarios blanchy et al 2020b making it more suitable for homogenous soils or catchment scale applications von hebel et al 2014 2019 garré et al 2013 2011 quantified three dimensional water content changes in layered soil by converting the in situ electrical resistivity values into ecb to establish the depth specific ecb soil water content relation using tdr however this is point scale method and cannot account for spatial variability of broad acre fields blanchy et al 2020a this paper presented a new methodology of ert emi power law calibration of field scale quasi 3d eca data to predict soil moisture values at different soil depths ert emi power law calibration has a strong correlation for dry season with r2 of 0 90 however in wet season higher eca values in 1 6 m depth compared with nmm resulted in a lower r2 of 0 54 fig 5 impact of soil water variability on eca is most prominent in upper two depth slices in both seasons fig 4a b d e the depths most meaningful in agriculture for the dry season except for the fallow plots average θ in the top two depth slices was 5 5 and 15 09 cm3cm 3 which is close to the wilting point of sandy loam loam and silt soil textures respectively tsoar 2005 the deeper depth slice 0 8 1 6 m had available θ but this depth is beyond most of the root zone of grain crops nielsen and vigil 2018 while in the wet season average θ for the three soil depth slices was near to the field capacity in all the depths tsoar 2005 table 4 ert emi power law calibration allowed a direct relationship between eca and soil water content in addition this calibration was easy to obtain and a database of such ert to soil water relationship could be easily established for different soil types which would help in providing an alternative to point methods for wide spread agriculture use 4 2 inversion strength the use of inversion algorithms for mapping soil characteristics is becoming more common huang et al 2017 2016 von hebel et al 2014 zare et al 2020 however calibrating inverted soil depth slices using ert emi power law curves for mapping field scale soil moisture had not been characterised based on validation with nmm θ measurements our study demonstrated the spatial distribution of calculated θ over the area at measured depths corresponds to inverted eca maps comparison of nmm measurements with predicted θ from inverted eca has higher pearson r 0 95 for the dry and 0 74 for the wet season as compared to predicted θ from non inverted eca 0 85 for the dry and 0 61 for the wet season results not shown this confirms that using the inversion algorithm improves the prediction of layer conductivities in order to determine θ in various soil depths in addition eca based θ shows less variability than nmm measurements probably due to having more measurements which are averaged over the depth interval compared with fewer point measurements of nmm nonetheless predicted θ from inverted eca could depict the varying residual soil water following different crop rotations including fallow angus et al 2001 nielsen and vigil 2018 page et al 2019 which is a helpful for making farm management decisions 4 3 emi maps in context of crop rotation both emi surveys were done under different soil moisture conditions due to temporal seasonal differences dry summer autumn and wet winter and by the type of rotation crops as different crops have different soil water extraction rates from different depths angus et al 2001 nielsen and vigil 2018 page et al 2019 the impact of different crop rotations resulting in additional moisture variability at the site was clearly detected in the dry season eca survey the two fallow plots showed increased soil water as a result of the absence of crops in the previous season o leary and connor 1997 russell 1996 has also reported that the carry over impact of soil moisture from fallowing is high after relatively dry seasons which is evident in our soil moisture results this further confirms that the differences in eca were due to variation in soil moisture as shown by rhoades et al 1976 and also that emi surveys are helpful to measure the carry over effects of different crop rotations management on soil moisture levels the percentage difference maps clearly show that the high eca values detected by fallow plots in the dry season have been covered by extra moisture in the soil after the rains during the wet season this may be important for prediction of potential yield and rates of inputs like fertilisers through modelling for upcoming crops keating et al 2003 these differences were not distinct for wet season maps largely due to measurements being taken after the start of the rains in 2019 where soil moisture in the other plots had increased to a similar level moreover russell 1996 and flower et al 2021 reported that in rotation with fallow areas soil moisture use by subsequent crop is higher than non fallow areas adding to even out the soil moisture differences although crop water use wasn t the scope of this study our results indicate the possible usefulness of this method to estimate the change in volumetric soil moisture over time at different depths which could be used to infer the depth of crop roots and also overall crop water use 4 4 limitations and scope the soil moisture derived from eca measurements for the 1 6 m depth was higher than the nmm for both dry and wet season it is possible that there was secondary salinity deeper in the profile one limitation of this study is that no soil samples were taken from the 1 6 m soil depth for the ert emi moisture calibration which may have affected the results of this depth this deeper sample was not done since 1 6 m is below where most roots are active djaman and irmak 2012 so a substitution with values from the 0 8 m depth range with similar soil texture seemed justified secondly for dry season nmm readings were taken 18 days prior to emi survey with 16 mm of rainfall in the intervening period which might have resulted in creating the difference between nmm reading and predicted θ values it would be ideal to take both readings as close as possible moreover we did not take the soil temperature at each depth during the surveys however recorded temperature during the dry survey april 15 2019 was 25 5 c and for the wet survey july 10 2019 was 18 2 c while the temperature of the emi sensor throughout these surveys was stable with averages of 25 2 c and 18 4 c respectively for a standardise analysis we tested the temperature correction of eca at 25 c ma et al 2011 since the temperature difference is small it showed no influence on the results of moisture calculation as per the findings of brevik et al 2004 and allred et al 2005 despite many advantages of this method of estimating field scale soil moisture there is still likely to be uncertainty around the spatial estimate of moisture content where soil conditions markedly vary in the fields future work will be directed towards developing soil moisture zones in fields with contrasting soil textures and salinity levels to widen the potential use of the method to put these results in broader farming aspect availability of such soil moisture maps will be valuable for farmers to use as the basis for varying crop inputs in precision agriculture cropping systems and to predict crop yield potential using models like the agricultural production systems simulator apsim 5 conclusion this study demonstrated how spatial eca data acquired by dualem 1hs can be used to determine true layer conductivities of soil by using inversion algorithms em4soil and calibration of these layer conductivities into reliable representative θ using laboratory based ert emi calibration curves this method is robust relatively quick and inexpensive for estimating soil moisture status in the field to make farm management decisions however these calibration curves are dependent on soil depth and texture and similar baseline studies of various soil textures can be helpful in predicting θ for different field conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

9833,to achieve secure and efficient saline water irrigation in arid areas a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the salt distribution in the soil profile and response of sunflower helianthus annuus l to salinity from 2018 to 2020 the experiment included five levels of irrigation water salinity eci 0 5 ds m 3 3 ds m 4 9 ds m 6 6 ds m and 8 2 ds m the results indicated that the soil salinity rose slightly and was maintained in balance in the first two years owing to the moderate freshwater irrigation after planting in 2020 surface salinity accumulation occurred when the eci was greater than 3 3 ds m the average soil salinity at 0 100 cm soil depth was near that of the irrigation water the effects of irrigation water salinity on plant growth and yield were also investigated salinity hindered the growth of the sunflower which was indicated by a decrease of plant height biomass and plant water content salinity also reduced sunflower yield by reducing the disk diameter and 100 grain weight iwp increased in the first two years and then decreased in the third year with an increase in the irrigation water salinity the salinity threshold for oleic sunflower was 1 3 ds m and the sunflower seed yield decreased by 4 9 for every 1 ds m increase in soil salinity to ensure a seed yield of over 75 the soil salinity should be less than 6 4 ds m it was concluded that for oleic sunflower drip irrigation in arid areas the plant should be irrigated with 80 mm of freshwater to leach salt after planting this not only ensures that the seed yield is no less than 85 but also maintains a balanced soil salinity after harvest when the eci increases to 8 2 ds m keywords drip irrigation saline water oleic sunflower growth indicators salinity tolerance 1 introduction with the

primarily influences plant growth through osmotic stress and ion toxicity and severe salinity may lead to cell water loss and plant death west et al 1986 petronia et al 2018 many studies have been performed to determine the salinity tolerance thresholds of crops under drip irrigation yaron et al 1972 mass and hoffman 1997 genuchten and hoffman 1984 magán et al 2008 chen et al 2018 machekposhti et al 2017 investigated the response of oleic sunflower to mixed sea water and found that the salinity threshold for oleic sunflower in the sari region was 1 6 ds m and the yield was reduced by 10 14 for every 1 ds m increase in soil salinity schiattone et al 2017 reported that the salinity threshold of wild rocket is 1 98 ds m and there is a 6 6 decrease in yield per 1 ds m increase in soil salinity the reduction in yield due to salinity primarily occurs due to the resulting decrease in leaf size and number of leaves wang et al 2018 studied the effect of initial soil salinity on spring wheat and sequential cropping silage corn in northern xinjiang china after considering the soil salinity variation and crop yields an initial soil salinity under 8 91 g kg and 5 54 g kg was recommended to plant spring wheat and sequential cropping silage corn using drip irrigation determining the salinity tolerance thresholds of crops is urgently required to alleviate the problem of freshwater shortages and ensure the safe use of underground saline water in arid areas in this study oleic sunflower helianthus annuus l a typical oil crop widely cultivated in china was chosen as the study object to receive water at five levels of salinity under drip irrigation the objectives of the present study were to evaluate the responses of soil salinity plant growth and plant yield to salinity and to determine the irrigation water and soil salinity tolerance thresholds of oleic sunflower moreover integrated agricultural management strategies and irrigation methods for oleic sunflower in arid areas using saline water irrigation were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site experiments were conducted at bayi farm 38 36 n 102 23 e 1390 m above sea level in jinchang gansu province china from 2018 to 2020 the experiment field exhibits a typical temperate continental dry climate with a mean annual precipitation of 139 8 mm and evaporation of 2094 2 mm the development of agriculture in the area relies on irrigation the soil properties of the plow and deeper layers are presented in table 1 the soil in the experimental field was classified as silt loam usda 1998 the average organic matter total n available p and available k were 20 1 g kg 1 00 g kg 4 36 mg kg and 114 77 mg kg respectively and the soil nutrient concentrations of the plow layer were

was no freshwater irrigation the irrigation water was a mixture of saline water 16 9 ds m and freshwater 0 5 s m the saline water was transported from a groundwater well in xiqu town of minqin county an extremely dry district near the experimental site freshwater was pumped from the local deep layer groundwater the ionic composition of the irrigation water is displayed in table 2 all treatments were replicated three times and the experimental plots were arranged in a randomized block design each plot was 6 5 m long and 6 m wide and each treatment was equipped with an independent gravity drip irrigation system consisting of a water tank 0 8 m above the ground a water flow meter a screen filter and nine drip laterals the distance between the drip laterals was 70 cm and the emitter spacing was 30 cm the sunflowers were cultivated under plastic film mulching with a plant spacing of 30 cm and row spacing of 30 40 cm fig 1 each year sunflowers were sown in mid april and harvested in early september a tensiometer was placed at 20 cm underneath the emitter in the middle of each experimental plot and it was observed twice daily at 8 00 and 15 00 to instruct irrigation the water 40 mm was irrigated immediately after sunflower sowing when the smp was less than 20 kpa irrigation water 8 mm and fertilizer were applied to the plot the total fertilizer n p2o5 k amount was144 72 156 kg ha

the number of sunflower growth days and d n is the interval between irrigation 2 3 observations and measurements the soil samples were extracted from three representative plots at depth from 0 cm to

the average ece within the soil profile was calculated as follows 2 ece t j k n m ece t j k s j k j k n m s j k where t represents the time when the soil samples were obtained j represents the six horizontal distances n from the emitter where the soil samples were obtained k represents the depth m of the soil sample and s j k is the depth interval of the soil samples in september 2018 august 2019 and august 2020 nine representative plants were randomly selected and the plant height and stem diameter were determined using a ruler and vernier caliper the flower disks and stems were weighed separately and then placed in an oven for blanching at a temperature of 105 c for 0 5 h and dried at 65 c for 24 h after which the plants were weighed the grain yield was determined from three 1 1 m

growing season the growing season precipitation was 54 mm 99 mm and 61 mm for 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively compared with the mean annual precipitation 63 3 mm of the rainy season in this area the precipitation in 2019 was approximately 40 mm more than usual this affected the soil salinity and the growth of the oleic sunflower the total irrigation amounts were similar from 2018 to 2020 546 mm 567 mm and 555 mm respectively in table 3 the average annual proportion of irrigation during different sunflower growth stages was 13 seedling stage 20 budding stage 10 blooming stage and 57 maturation stage the irrigation amounts of the different treatments exhibited a decreasing trend with an increase in the eci the irrigation amount for s5 8 2 ds m was 80 of that for s1 0 5 ds m which is consistent with the results obtained by wan et al 2007 2010 in north china in addition the amount of irrigation was affected by salinity during the budding stage of the sunflower 3 2 soil salinity the ece of two depths 0 40 cm and 40 100 cm at different periods for each treatment is illustrated in fig 3 in 2018 before sowing the salinity of the soil profile was low with an average value of 1 7 ds m during the freshwater irrigation stage soil salinity of all treatments decreased to less than 1 ds m then saline water at the five levels was applied for irrigation 15 d after the experiment salinity from s1 to s5 increased by 7 43 67 77 and 132 respectively compared with baseline value before sowing however the average ece of s5 the treatment with the highest salinity was no greater than 4 ds m the soil salinity conditions remained healthy there is typically little precipitation in the winter and spring in northwest china accordingly the salinity of 0 40 cm soil depth before sowing increased in the following year particularly for treatments in which eci exceeded 4 9 ds m during the freshwater irrigation stage the soil salinity decreased by 21 54 after the experiment began there was a large amount of precipitation over 25 mm before the soil samples were collected fig 2 thus the salinity was lower than that in the saline water irrigation stage compared with the salinity before sowing in 2019 soil salinity slightly decreased and then reached a dynamic balance the salinity in 2020 further increased before sowing compared to that of the previous year soil salinity in the sunflower seedling stage decreased by 47 25 23 and 39 for s1 to s5 over time soil salinity increased continuously and then reached the maximum value after the experiment was completed the average soil salinity values from s1 to s5 were 1 4 ds m 4 4 ds m 5 4 ds m 6 6 ds m and 8 0 ds m respectively which are near or slightly higher than the corresponding eci of each treatment the soil became moderately saline 4 8 ds m under all treatments except for s1 u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 the salinity ratios of 0 40 cm to 40 100 cm soil depths increased year over year and they were 1 18 1 73 and 1 85 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the increase in salinity primarily concentrated at the soil surface pasternak conducted a two years experiment using freshwater and brackish water to investigate the salt tolerance of maize in israel and found that the salt was primarily concentrated in the upper 0 30 cm layer pasternak et al 1985 extended saline water irrigation increases the sodium ions in the soil which causes the expansion and dispersion of soil particles resulting in a decrease of soil infiltration similar works have been conducted in north china owing to the asian monsoons the amoubt of rainfall is more than twice the amount of irrigation water required for crops in north china thus soil salinity in this region increased during irrigation and then returned to the original value in the following year therefore saline water with an ece of 10 9 ds m can be safely used for irrigation wan et al 2007 chen et al 2009 2019 wang et al 2015 however with an average precipitation of 139 8 mm in northwest china the rainfall amount is not sufficient to leach away the salt in soil thus the initial salinity of soils increases every year according to the results fresh water irrigation at seedling stage of sunflower can effectively prevent soil secondary salinization chen et al 2010 also used model simulation to conclude that deficit irrigation of saline water over 3 6 ds m was not sustainable in northwest china and flooding after harvest was more efficient in reducing soil salinity and increasing crop production 3 3 growth indicators the shoot dry masses and water contents of disks and stems of sunflowers for each treatment are summarized in table 4 the results demonstrate that the shoot dry weight decreased with an increase in the irrigation water salinity for shoot water content there was no apparent relationship between the disk water content and irrigation water salinity in contrast the stem water content exhibited a decreasing tendency with an increase in the irrigation water salinity this result illustrates that the sunflower stem was more sensitive to salinity stress than other parts of the plant which is in agreement with the report of x b li 2019 li and zhang 2019 however due to the climate and other factors the interannual variation in the shoot dry mass and water content were irregular the sunflower height and stem diameter under different irrigation water salinity treatments for the three years are displayed in fig 4 linear relationships were found between the plant height and eci this result was also reported by machekposhti et al 2017 the slopes of the three years are consistent with each other plant height decreased by 1 6 cm for each 1 ds m increase in irrigation water salinity which is in agreement with the findings of chen 2009 who reported that sunflower height declined by 0 9 1 6 cm for every 1 ds m increase of eci the amount of freshwater irrigation exerted little effect on plant height excessive salinity reduces the ability of the plant to take up water and injures cells by entering transpiration stream munns et al 2006 in 2019 and 2020 stem diameter slightly decreased with an increase in the irrigation water salinity but there was no significant pattern in the stem diameter variation among treatments and years 3 4 yield components and iwp the sunflower yield and its components exhibited a decreasing tendency with an increase in irrigation water salinity in the three years and there was no significant difference between treatments in 2018 compared with the control treatment of s1 the yields of s5 decreased by 8 14 and 27 from 2018 to 2020 the variation in the rate of decrease was primarily affected by the amount of irrigation fresh water after sowing according to table 5 salinity reduces the sunflower yield by reducing the disk diameter and 100 grain weight the iwp which is the ratio of the irrigation water amount to the yield illustrated the impact of saline water irrigation on water savings and yield reduction the iwp increased in 2018 and 2019 with an increase of eci which coincided with the results of wan et al 2007 chen et al 2009 in 2020 because salt accumulated in the soils and freshwater was not provided the iwp decreased with an increase of eci it was demonstrated that in the years with freshwater leaching after sowing the negative effect of salinity on crop water consumption was stronger than that on yield in 2020 the negative effect of salinity on yield was dominant in conclusion freshwater irrigation is necessary for the sustainable development of saline water irrigation in arid areas when saline water of no more than 8 2 ds m was used for irrigation and freshwater was applied at the sunflower seedling and budding stages sunflower grain yields were unaffected when freshwater was applied only at the sunflower seedling stage the grain yield was at least 85 of that under freshwater irrigation therefore saline water irrigation can effectively improve iwp and achieve water resource conservation 3 5 plant salinity tolerance based on the mass hoffman crop salt tolerance linear function mass and hoffman 1997 the response of the sunflower relative yield to eci is illustrated in fig 5 the threshold of eci was 2 6 ds m 1 6 ds m and 0 3 ds m from 2018 to 2020 respectively when eci exceeded these values the oleic sunflower seed yield decreased by approximately 1 5 2 1 and 3 8 per 1 ds m increase for 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively as the amount of leached freshwater decreased year over year the threshold of eci and yield also decreased this proves that prophase freshwater irrigation greatly influences oleic sunflower yield because there is an evident interannual difference in the relationship between relative yield and eci a modified crop salt tolerance discount function was introduced to describe the relationship between the relative yield and ece of the root zone fig 6 according to the linear function the soil salinity threshold that the oleic sunflower can endure without any yield reduction was 1 3 ds m above this threshold the relative seed yield decreased by 4 9 for each additional 1 ds m from the discount function the relative seed yield of oleic sunflower dropped to 50 when the ece of the rootzone was 11 6 ds m at a soil salinity of 6 4 ds m the relative biomass of oleic sunflower was 75 the salinity threshold for the sunflower has been previously reported to be 4 8 ds m and the yield was reduced by 5 francois 1996 machekposhti et al 2017 investigated the response of oleic sunflower to mixed sea water and found that the salinity threshold for oleic sunflower in the sari region was 1 6 ds m and the yield was reduced by 10 14 for every 1 ds m increase in soil salinity the salinity threshold of the present study agrees with the findings of machekposhti and the salinity tolerance slope was similar to that of francois the uncertainty of the results may be related to the cultivar and experimental conditions chartzoulakis 2005 4 conclusions in this three year field experiment 2018 2020 the effects of saline water on soil salinity and oleic sunflower growth parameters and yield were investigated the conclusions of the study are as follows freshwater leaching is necessary for saline water irrigation in arid areas soil salinity increased significantly in all treatments when 80 mm of freshwater was applied after planting the soil salinity could be maintained if freshwater was not applied salt accumulated in the upper soil layer when the eci was greater than 3 2 ds m the average salinity in the soil profile 0 100 cm in depth was near that of the irrigation water salinity hindered the growth of the sunflower which manifested as a decrease in plant height biomass and stem water content the sunflower yield also demonstrated a significant decreasing trend under saline water irrigation the salinity threshold for oleic sunflower was 1 3 ds m and the sunflower seed yield decreased by 4 9 for every 1 ds m increase in soil salinity to ensure a seed yield of over 75 the soil salinity should be less than 6 4 ds m under comprehensive consideration of water conservation stable yields and prevention of secondary salinization of soil in the process of saline water irrigation when saline water of up to 8 2 ds m is used for oleic sunflower drip irrigation in arid areas 80 mm of freshwater should be provided shortly after planting for salt leaching this not only ensures that the seed yield is no less than 85 but also maintains a balanced soil salinity after harvest in addition a predetermined threshold of 20 kpa of soil matric potential and film mulching cultivation are suggested in arid areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9833,to achieve secure and efficient saline water irrigation in arid areas a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the salt distribution in the soil profile and response of sunflower helianthus annuus l to salinity from 2018 to 2020 the experiment included five levels of irrigation water salinity eci 0 5 ds m 3 3 ds m 4 9 ds m 6 6 ds m and 8 2 ds m the results indicated that the soil salinity rose slightly and was maintained in balance in the first two years owing to the moderate freshwater irrigation after planting in 2020 surface salinity accumulation occurred when the eci was greater than 3 3 ds m the average soil salinity at 0 100 cm soil depth was near that of the irrigation water the effects of irrigation water salinity on plant growth and yield were also investigated salinity hindered the growth of the sunflower which was indicated by a decrease of plant height biomass and plant water content salinity also reduced sunflower yield by reducing the disk diameter and 100 grain weight iwp increased in the first two years and then decreased in the third year with an increase in the irrigation water salinity the salinity threshold for oleic sunflower was 1 3 ds m and the sunflower seed yield decreased by 4 9 for every 1 ds m increase in soil salinity to ensure a seed yield of over 75 the soil salinity should be less than 6 4 ds m it was concluded that for oleic sunflower drip irrigation in arid areas the plant should be irrigated with 80 mm of freshwater to leach salt after planting this not only ensures that the seed yield is no less than 85 but also maintains a balanced soil salinity after harvest when the eci increases to 8 2 ds m keywords drip irrigation saline water oleic sunflower growth indicators salinity tolerance 1 introduction with the

et al 2017 investigated the response of oleic sunflower to mixed sea water and found that the salinity threshold for oleic sunflower in the sari region was 1 6 ds m and the yield was reduced by 10 14 for every 1 ds m increase in soil salinity schiattone et al 2017 reported that the salinity threshold of wild rocket is 1 98 ds m and there is a 6 6 decrease in yield per 1 ds m increase in soil salinity the reduction in yield due to salinity primarily occurs due to the resulting decrease in leaf size and number of leaves wang et al 2018 studied the effect of initial soil salinity on spring wheat and sequential cropping silage corn in northern xinjiang china after considering the soil salinity variation and crop yields an initial soil salinity under 8 91 g kg and 5 54 g kg was recommended to plant spring wheat and sequential cropping silage corn using drip irrigation determining the salinity tolerance thresholds of crops is urgently required to alleviate the problem of freshwater shortages and ensure the safe use of underground saline water in arid areas in this study oleic sunflower helianthus annuus l a typical oil crop widely cultivated in china was chosen as the study object to receive water at five levels of salinity under drip irrigation the objectives of the present study were to evaluate the responses of soil salinity plant growth and plant yield to salinity and to determine the irrigation water and soil salinity tolerance thresholds of oleic sunflower moreover integrated agricultural management strategies and irrigation methods for oleic

the guanzhong plain is one of the most important grain production areas in the yellow river basin of china winter wheat triticum aestivum l is a widely cultivated crop in the region with an annual production of 4 2 billion kg grain accounting for about 40 of the total grain yield gy in shannxi province zhang et al 2018 precipitation is the most important water source for agricultural development and production and inadequate rainfall often results in low crop productivity ali et al 2018 du et al 2015 the annual rainfall of the north china plain ranges from 470 to 910 mm but the average effective precipitation is only about 200 mm during the growing season equating to approximately 25 40 of the total water requirement of winter wheat feng et al 2017 successful irrigation is therefore essential for winter wheat to produce a high yield in this region however optimizing both the wheat gy and water use efficiency wue is difficult because of the high levels of irrigation needed for agricultural production creating a conflict between wue and the volume of irrigation water needed for a high gy xu et al 2016 wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 achieving high yielding but efficient water saving regimes is therefore increasingly urgent and important for sustainable agriculture in northwest china magnetization and oxidation irrigation water methodologies enable the physiological production potential of irrigation water to be increased improving the overall efficacy of irrigation water use in agricultural ecosystems ambashta and sillanpää 2010 colic and morse 1999 esmaeilnezhad 2017 wei 2018 when water passes through a magnetized field its structure and physical characteristics such as density and salt solution capacity etc are changed which can be very beneficial for soil and plant growth higashitani et al 1993 liu et al 2019 by improving the physicochemical properties these treatments improve the action and ultimately enhance the transmission capacity of irrigation water from soil to crops al ogaidi et al 2017 mostafazadeh et al 2012 wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2021 turker et al 2007 and qiu et al 2011 have suggested that while the osmotic pressure and solubility of treated water increase the viscosity coefficient and surface tension decrease beneficial effects of magnetically treated irrigation water have been reported for emergence rate seed yield and water use mu et al 2019 podleoeny et al 2004 selim 2011 surendran et al 2016 and many irrigation experiments on wheat corn soybean tomato and other crops have demonstrated positive biological effects zhang 2005 selim et al 2013 maffei 2014 this may be related to improvements in crop root development photosynthesis and enzyme activity turker et al 2007 liu et al 2019 the application of oxidized water in agricultural production is less widely used but studies have shown that oxidized water irrigation can improve crop yield and wue to some extent wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 wang et al 2021 suggest that the main reason for this is improved chlorophyll content and photosynthetic parameters including transpiration and photosynthetic rates however the effectiveness of treated water is still a controversial issue surendran et al 2013 for example because of the limited duration of the change in physicochemical properties surendran et al 2016 after entering the soil the treated water comes into contact with the crop s roots the change in the surface tension of the treated water increases the hydratability of the water molecules and ions the solubility of mineral salts and the availability of soil nutrients which change the water permeability of the root zone wang et al 2019 the plant root systems which significantly affect crop growth and yield formation play an important role in the plant soil ecosystem lynch 2007 zhang et al 2009 enhancement of soil wue mainly depends on the development of the root system zhang et al 2015 the morphological features of the main root system determine the efficacy of the whole root system and indirectly affect aboveground biomass and gy gao et al 2014 hu et al 2020 mosaddeghi et al 2009 thus soil water conditions and root structure affect each other and this ultimately determines the gy and wue of winter wheat previous research has examined the effects of different irrigation regimes on root growth in winter wheat li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 and the relationship between root growth and gy and wue jha et al 2017 we have focused on the effects of magnetized and oxidized water irrigation on winter wheat root growth and the relationship between root growth productivity and water use the objectives of the study were to 1 examine the physicochemical characteristics of irrigation water after magnetization and oxidation treatment and the duration of any changes 2 evaluate the effects of different irrigation regimes on root development soil water content and water consumption and 3 investigate any differences in gy and wue under different irrigation regimes in order to develop an optimized strategy for further conservation of water and increased efficiency of agriculture in northwestern china 2 materials and methods the study included laboratory and field experiments the laboratory experiments were carried out in the greenhouse of the northwest agricultural and forestry university shannxi province china from june to september 2018 during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 field experiments were carried out at the caoxinzhuang experimental farm 34 18 n 108 05 e 523 7 m of the northwest agricultural and forestry university situated on the guanzhong plain of the southern loess plateau of northwest china fig 1 this area has a warm and semi humid climate with a mean annual temperature of 12 9 c and mean annual precipitation of 650 mm the main source of irrigation is groundwater most of the precipitation accounting for 65 of the total annual precipitation falls between july and september the variation in rainfall distribution mean temperature and relative humidity is presented in fig 2 2 1 laboratory experiment the laboratory experiments included groundwater with a mineralization value of 0 14 g l 1 and brackish water with a mineralization value of 3 g l 1 prepared from nacl and groundwater both were used as the raw water for the magnetization and oxidation treatments each treatment lasted for 0 5 h wang et al 2021 following treatment the water was analyzed for changes in physicochemical properties and used to prepare a nutrient solution for the hydroponic cultivation system ding et al 2007 details of the treatment regimes are shown in table 1 the xiaoyan 22 wheat variety was used for the laboratory experiments seeds that were clean and of uniform size were selected for conventional seedling cultivation each treatment had five replicates and each treatment contained 300 seeds the cultivation water was replaced once a day after five days seedlings with consistent and robust growth were selected and cultivated with the relevant nutrient solution prepared from the treated water ding et al 2007 to avoid dissipation of treated water it was transferred to the cultivation box as soon as possible during the transfer process the volume was strictly controlled using a calibrated container the cultivation conditions were temperature 25 c 20 c day night humidity 60 70 natural light a change of nutrient solution every five days the volume of the nutrient solution in the cultivation box was 5000 cm3 the experiments used a complete randomized block design and each treatment containing 45 plants had five replicates during the experiments the position of the cultivation boxes was changed randomly every three days to ensure that the light temperature and humidity conditions were uniform during the growth period 2 2 field experiments the field experiments assessed how different irrigation water types affected crop growth and wue the winter wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 which is widely grown in the study area was used cultivation of the winter wheat followed wang et al 2020 the experimental field was on level land and the soil was an eum orthic anthrosol the total nitrogen soil organic carbon concentration hydrolysable nitrogen available phosphorous and available potassium in the 0 20 cm soil layer before the experiment began was 1 0 g kg 1 17 1 g kg 1 7 0 mg kg 1 5 7 mg kg 1 and 133 8 mg kg 1 respectively the soil bulk density was 1 33 g cm 3 the clay content silt content and sand content were 16 5 51 7 and 31 8 respectively the wheat was sown on 15 october 2018 and 13 october 2019 at a planting density of 187 5 kg ha 1 irrigating with brackish water can lead to soil salinization and destroy the soil environment so field experiments using brackish water were not carried out eight treatments varying in type and level of irrigation groundwater were applied during the overwintering 15 january 2019 and 2 january 2020 respectively jointing 3 april 2019 and 23 march 2020 respectively and filling 20 may 2019 and 22 may 2020 respectively stages of wheat growth table 2 because of the limitations of the field experiments the magnetization and oxidation treatments were considered to have ended when the water had passed through the magnetic field environment or oxidation system a drip irrigation system was used and the different irrigation levels were determined by the number of taps and their drip rate the experiments used a complete randomized block design and each treatment had three replicates each plot was 4 m 4 m and adjacent plots were separated by a 1 m buffer 2 3 magnetization and oxidation of water water becomes magnetized after being passed through a magnetic field environment comprising permanent magnets or electromagnets of a certain velocity positioned perpendicular to the line of magnetic force the equipment for magnetizing water comprised a water supply tank pump outlet pipe and magnet a permanent magnet with a field intensity of 3000 g was mounted on the outer wall of the outlet pipe and the water was magnetized as it passed through the pipe the thickness and diameter of the pipe were 0 5 cm and 10 0 cm respectively and the flow rate was 6 3 10 3 m3 s 1 oxidized water refers to water that only retains positive ions and a positive charge after flowing through an oxidation system the oxidation system used comprised an oxidation processor eco1st technology group http irrigationenhancer com grounding resistance wire and pump as water flowed along the oxidation processor the walls of the processor became enriched with electrons which were then channeled underground to an electrode through grounded wires 2 4 experimental data collection 2 4 1 physicochemical properties of magnetized and oxidized water the ph value was determined using a phsj 4a ph meter the surface tension coefficient was measured using a bz 1 surface tension tester produced by changchun great wall teaching instrument co ltd the viscosity was determined using the syp265d high precision motion produced by shanghai pingxuan scientific instrument co ltd an hq40 portable dissolved oxygen meter seven2go mettler toledo china was used to monitor the dissolved oxygen concentration of the treated water during the oxygenating process zhu et al 2020 2 4 2 reactive oxygen species ros to investigate the potential generation of hydroxyl radicals oh an important active oxygen during irradiation 200 µl of 0 1 mol l 1 aqueous dimethyl pyridine n oxide dmpo was added to a tube containing 200 µl of the irradiated samples shi et al 2021 subsequently the mixture was shaken in a vortex mixer in touch mode for 1 min and the suspension filtered using a 0 45 mm membrane filter the filtrate was transferred to a capillary tube and sealed using vacuum grease the capillary tube was then inserted into a quartz tube and measured at room temperature 25 c to determine the amount of superoxide radicals o2 generated the samples were individually mixed with dmpo in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 2 4 3 root vigor under laboratory conditions at the jointing stage of growth the roots of five plants from each hydroponic tank were randomly selected to measure root vigor 0 5 g fresh root tip samples were taken from each selected plant the root vigor was assessed by measuring the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ttc levels in the roots ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 2 4 4 root distribution under field conditions root samples were collected from each treatment at the flowering stage of growth during the 2019 2020 winter wheat season the samples were taken from different depths down the soil profile then processed in the laboratory the distance between the sampling profile and the test plot boundary was more than 1 m to eliminate the influence of a marginal effect soil samples 10 cm wide and 20 cm long along the direction of the wheat row were collected from both sides of the roots of two adjacent rows with 20 cm row spacing the soil profile was divided into 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm layers four soil samples were taken from each layer the samples of soil and associated roots were soaked in plastic buckets filled with water and gently disaggregated by hand to remove impurities and roots from other plants then loaded into 80 mesh bags live roots were carefully separated from dead roots according to gregory 1994 a 1 mm sieve was used above a 0 25 mm sieve during the washing process to ensure roots were not lost from the samples the wheat roots were cleaned with distilled water and then put onto a plexiglass plate containing a small amount of water and carefully stretched out with tweezers so that there was no overlap or intersection between the roots images of the roots were taken at a resolution of 300 dpi using an epson scanner v370 winrhizo software version 5 0 regent instruments inc quebec

weight and gy at maturity xu et al 2018 2 4 6 soil water status the volumetric soil water content swc was monitored at the center of each plot for each irrigation treatment at the greening jointing filling and maturity stages at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 3 m using a neutron meter with a standard count of 605 ih ii didcot instrument co wallingford uk three or four replicates were taken the maximum root depth of the wheat during flowering was 2 0 m so monitoring swc at a depth of 3 m was sufficient to analyze any variation in the deeper soil water wu et al 2009 zhou et al 2008 the swc was measured every 15 days from sowing to maturity after periods of precipitation the monitoring time was delayed accordingly the neutron meter was calibrated following standard methods cheng et al 2009 as neutron spillage occurred mainly at a depth of 0 20 cm the calibration was based on 0 20 cm and 20 100 cm and the calibration curve determined as follows 4 y 14 658 x 22 477 r 2 0 934 0 20 cm 5 y 107 031 x 1 043 r 2 0 841 20 100 cm where y is swc and x is the neutron meter count ratio because the texture of the vertical soil profile was relatively uniform and the soil layer below 100 cm was relatively less affected by climatic factors the calibration curve for the 20 100 cm soil layer was adopted for the 100 300 cm swc soil water storage was calculated using the following equation burgess et al 2014 6 sws wc bd h where sws is soil water storage mm wc is soil mass water content bd is soil bulk density g cm 3 and h is soil depth mm in order to ensure the accuracy of the bulk density we excavated a 3 m deep profile in the center of the study area for stratified sampling the available soil water storage asws was measured at the greening and maturity stages and calculated according to the following equations 7 awc wc θ pwp 8 asws awc bd h where awc and θpwp are the available swc and the permanent wilting point respectively the θpwp of the experimental farmland was 7 3 as measured according to bauer and black 1992 the crop evapotranspiration was estimated using the soil water balance equation 9 et p i sws d r where et mm is the crop evapotranspiration p mm is total rainfall during the growing season i mm is the total amount of irrigation δsws mm is the difference in soil water storage between two growth stages d is the deep percolation of soil water below the measurement depth and r is the surface runoff the groundwater table remained at about 80 m below the surface during the experiment based on the monitoring of wells around the study area so capillary water moving up from the deeper layers to the root zone could be discounted according to lin et al 2019 the amount of rainfall in the area was not enough to percolate into the soil layer below a depth of 300 cm soil water measurements indicated that deep percolation at the site was negligible there was usually no runoff in the area so r was ignored wue irrigation water use efficiency iwue and precipitation water use efficiency pue were calculated using the following equations guan et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 10 wue y et 11 iwue y i 12 pue y p where wue kg ha 1 mm 1 describes water use efficiency for grain yield iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 describes the irrigation water use efficiency y kg ha 1 is grain yield at maturity pue kg ha 1 mm 1 is the precipitation use efficiency and p mm is the precipitation during the growing season the water productivity wp of the crop was determined at each growth stage using the following equation zhang et al 2020 13 wp dy et where wp kg ha 1 mm 1 is the crop water productivity δdy kg ha 1 is the difference in the crop dry biomass between the two growth stages and δet mm is the difference in the water evapotranspiration between the two growth stages 2 5 statistical analyses prior to the analyses we tested the normality and homogeneity of variances in the experimental data mean values were calculated for each variable and anova was used to assess the significance of any differences in the measured variables between treatments if the f value was significant p 0 05 multiple comparisons of annual mean values were performed based on the least significant difference lsd spss software version 22 0 ibm corporation armonk ny usa was used for the statistical analyses the graphs were prepared in originpro 2016 originlab corporation northampton ma usa the correlations of yield and wue and root parameters were analyzed using the corrplot package in r wei and simko 2016 3 results 3 1 physicochemical properties of treated water in the

while the surface tension and viscosity coefficient decreased fig 3 at certain time points the dynamic characteristics of the gm and go were obviously different from those of ck g the ph of the gm and go was initially higher than that of ck g and remained so for about 60 h the surface tension of ck g after magnetization and oxidation treatment decreased by 15 4 and 7 4 respectively and the difference before and after magnetization treatment was significant p 0 05 the effects on the surface tension of groundwater and brackish water gradually disappeared after about 10 h the viscosity coefficient of the gm and go was lower than that of ck g and the difference could last for about 8 h the dissolved oxygen concentration of the gm and go hydroponic solutions was initially higher than that of ck g and remained so for about 4 0 h and 2 5 h respectively 3 1 2 hydroxyl radicals oh the spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance epr technique was used to assess the formation of ros as shown in fig 4 ros were produced in magnetized and oxidized water samples a 4 line epr spectra which was assigned to the characteristics of dmpo oh an 14 3 g aâh 12 7 g and aãh 0 61 g was detected in dmpo aqueous solutions suggesting the formation of oh the generation of oh in the gm and go showed that the oxidation ability of ck g had been enhanced directly by magnetization and oxidation treatments 3 2 wheat root system 3 2 1 root vigor as shown in fig 5 both magnetization and oxidation treatments could significantly improve root vigor in the winter wheat p 0 05 in the hydroponic systems using groundwater both the magnetization and oxidation treatments gm and go increased the root vigor of the cultivated wheat by 101 526 2 µg g 1 h 1 and 254 925 1 µg g 1 h 1 respectively compared with the control group ck g improved root vigor may directly affect wheat root growth and the absorption of soil water and nutrients compared with ck b the root vigor of plants grown in bm and bo significantly increased by 100 and 152 494 9 µg g 1 h 1 and 621 2 µg g 1 h 1 respectively both of the irrigation regimes tested therefore improved the wheat root vigor relative to untreated groundwater or brackish water 3 2 2 rld rwd and rsd rld is a fundamental determinant of soil nutrient acquisition and water uptake in plants fig 6a shows the rld distribution of winter wheat in the 0 100 cm soil profile under different irrigation regimes compared with the ni treatment irrigation could significantly improve rld p 0 05 when the irrigation level increased from 120 mm to 180 mm the effect of swc on rld was not obvious in the 20 40 cm soil layers and there was even negative growth under magnetized and oxidized water irrigation however under the same irrigation levels compared with the untreated groundwater ig both magnetized and oxidized water irrigation generally increased the rld of the 0 100 cm soil profile the rld of the 0 20 cm layer increased by 22 7 and 24 0 under igm120 and igo120 respectively rwd and rsd showed a similar trend in the 0 100 cm soil profile during the flowering stage fig 6b and c the rwd of the 0 20 cm soil layer under 120 mm magnetized and oxidized water irrigation regimes igm120 and igo120 increased by 9 8 and 26 0 respectively compared with untreated groundwater irrigation ig the overall percentages were 104 7 igm120 and 94 9 igo120 and 39 7 igm120 and 35 7 igo120 for the 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers respectively the rsd of magnetized and oxidized water in the 20 60 cm soil layer increased the most by 104 7 igm120 and 89 3 igo120 respectively 3 2 3 root system morphology the root morphology parameters of the winter wheat at the flowering growth stage varied under the different irrigation regimes table 3 compared with igm120 and igo120 treatments the root dry weight for igm180 and igo180 treatments in the 0 20 cm soil layer improved by 70 8 and 13 0 respectively compared with the ig treatment root diameter and root dry weight for the igm120 and igo120 treatments in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased by 3 8 and 13 8 and 0 4 and 20 7 respectively the igm120 and igo120 treatments significantly increased the root length ratio 17 1 and 23 8 and root mass ratio 13 8 and 15 4 compared with the ig treatment p 0 05 3 3 soil water content swc and available soil water storage asws 3 3 1 variation in root zone swc as shown in fig 7 the swc in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the winter wheat growing season fluctuated greatly under the influence of irrigation in the 2018 2019 season the average swc of the 0 100 cm soil layer under 180 mm groundwater irrigation ig was 18 2 higher than that of the control ni compared with the groundwater irrigation ig the average swc of the 0 100 cm soil layer under irrigation

igm120 and igo120 treatments in the 0 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layers were 27 6 and 27 7 and 30 0 and 31 9 respectively and there was no significant difference compared with the ig treatment figs 2 and 8 show that dynamic changes in swc varied between the two growing seasons overall the swc in 2019 2020 was higher than that in 2018 2019 with increasing irrigation levels both magnetized and oxidized water irrigation had an obvious effect on the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer in the 2018 2019 season the swc of the 0 100 cm soil layer was generally low at the greening to maturity stage with 60 mm magnetized and oxidized water irrigation regimes igm60 and igo60 during the filling stage the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer increased as a result of both irrigation and rainfall in the 2019 2020 season the average swc of the 0 100 cm soil layer during the greening to maturity stage increased by 7 6 and 15 0 with 120 mm and 180 mm of magnetized water irrigation igm120 and igm180 respectively compared with 60 mm of magnetized water igm60 3 3 2 dynamic change in asws dynamic changes in asws from the greening to maturity stage in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 are shown in fig 9 asws was investigated in three soil layers 0 100 cm 100 200 cm and 200 300 cm based on the irrigation levels and the soil water consumption characteristics of winter wheat in the 2018 2019 winter wheat season the asws of the 0 100 cm soil layer under magnetized and oxidized water irrigation igm180 and igo180 significantly increased by 61 1 and 66 7 p 0 05 respectively compared with that under untreated groundwater irrigation ig between the greening and maturity stage in 2019 2020 the asws in the 0 300 soil layer decreased under all three treatments in the 0 100 cm soil layer asws decreased by 49 34

period in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 under different irrigation regimes is shown in table 4 from the sowing to the jointing stage the wp tended to increase with increasing irrigation indicating that the growth of the wheat during the vegetative growth period was greatly affected by the amount of irrigation in the 2018 2019 season the wp of the 40 mm and 60 mm magnetized water irrigation treatments igm120 and igm180 increased by 46 0 and 57 2 p 0 05 respectively compared with that of 20 mm magnetized water irrigation igm60 with the same amount of irrigation the wp at the jointing stage under

26 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively with the increase in irrigation a threshold in gy and wue of the wheat could be seen when the total irrigation level was 120 mm the gy and wue of magnetized and oxidized water irrigation treatments igm120 and igo120 were 11 47 103 kg ha 1 and 27 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 10 56 103 kg ha 1 and 25 81 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively the iwue decreased with increasing

the molecular structure of water and the composition of the aquatic environment e g the dipole moment of water molecules and the oxygen content of water esmaeilnezhad et al 2017 mostafazadeh et al 2012 wang et al 2018 forming a small complex of water molecules consisting of 5 6 water molecules and consequently improving water activity e g solubility and reaction rate and its interaction with other substances baker and judd 1996 wang et al 2016 in this study the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh provided strong evidence for enhanced magnetized and oxidized water activity fig 4 gaafar et al 2015 proposed that under a magnetic field the polarized water molecules arrange in one direction as the hydrogen ions decrease with a subsequent increase in ph chibowski and szczes 2018 have presented a clear explanation of the action of water in the field based on changes in the structure of water via hydrogen bonding in intraclusters and between interclusters magnetization and oxidation treatments change the physicochemical properties of irrigation water zhu et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 including an increase in ph electrical conductivity ec diffusion and permeability and a decrease in viscosity and surface tension compared with untreated water surendran et al 2016 toledo et al 2008 wei 2018 although the methods used for magnetization and oxidation in this study were not the same the effects of the two treatments were similar as measured by dissolved oxygen concentration surface tension ph and electrical conductivity of the irrigation water after treatment as shown in fig 3 magnetization and oxidation could increase the ph and the dissolved oxygen concentration and a similar conclusion was reached by wang et al 2019 an explanation for the increase in ph could be the partial hydrogen bond fracture in treated water as suggested by the generation of oh in magnetized and oxidized water fig 4 in addition our results show that the viscosity coefficient and surface tension of the treated water decreased which explains the enhanced fluidity and permeability of the treated water this is consistent with the results of yin et al 2018 the altered molecular structure of the treated water reduces the hydrogen bonds under the optimized magnetic field zhang 2005 some water molecules are separated from the molecular groups and became free dimer water molecules the degree of association is reduced and the polarity enhanced wang et al 2019 found that the surface tension coefficient and viscosity coefficient of treated water decreases the diffusion coefficient increases with an optimized magnetic field enhancing the diffusion ability and permeability of the water the permeability can be increased by 34 we found that the changes in the physicochemical properties of the treated water could only be sustained for a limited period of time surendran et al 2016 have shown that magnetic treatment of solutions tends to reduce ec whereas we noticed a definite trend in increasing ph for all the solutions used however this difference in parameters was nullified after 108 h when the solution parameters returned to the original values others have come to a similar conclusion that the memory effect in the changes in physical properties can last for up to 2 days higashitani et al 1993 szczes et al 2011 silva et al 2015 pang and deng 2008 found that the biological effect of magnetized water depended on the magnetic field strength hence the diachronic properties of treated water will limit its popularization and application in agriculture 4 2 root growth responses to different irrigation regimes roots are the main plant organ that takes up water and nutrients and thus their size and distribution in soil are closely related to their capacity for water and nutrient uptake robertson et al 1993 wu and cheng 2014 the amount of soil water absorbed by plant roots mainly depends on the soil water supply and the morphological and physiological characteristics of the roots wang et al 2014 li et al 2017 root vigor defined as root growth and physiological function affects the absorption of water and nutrients ma et al 2018 and thus can directly affect crop growth nutritional status and yield wu et al 2017 our results show that the magnetization and oxidation treatments significantly improved the root vigor of the winter wheat p 0 05 fig 5 by 100 5 253 7 and 100 4 213 9 respectively compared with control plants ck g and ck b emil and aleksandra 2018 have shown that changes in ph associated with the magnetic treatment of water can modify biological activity in plants and consequently influence plant growth yin et al 2018 have also demonstrated that changes in surface tension viscosity coefficient dissolved oxygen and the degree of association can enhance the normal metabolism of plants a decrease in water surface tension and viscosity coefficient reduces the critical nucleus radius and increases the nucleation rate and crystal growth rate during the crystallization process however the formation of a large number of nuclei will rapidly reduce the supersaturation therefore the size of crystalline particles and sedimentation rate after treatment will decrease and more particles will be suspended in the treated water this will reduce the likelihood of precipitated solid substances blocking irrigation and crop capillary channels and help maintain a smooth flow of nutrient solution thus enhancing the absorption of water by plants zhang 2005 as shown in fig 3 both magnetization and oxidation treatments increased ph and dissolved oxygen levels and decreased the viscosity coefficient and surface tension for a period of time overall irrigation with treated water can promote growth of the wheat root system which in turn will improve the plant s utilization of water and nutrients savostin 1964 wang et al 2019 the most important crop root parameters include rld rsd and root diameter rd ali et al 2018 hu et al 2020 which together determine the efficacy of the whole root system gao et al 2014 mosaddeghi et al 2009 and indirectly affect aboveground biomass and gy feng et al 2017 forde and lorenzo 2001 showed that both excess and insufficient irrigation significantly change winter wheat root size and distribution thus reducing root growth in our study we found that rld and rsd slowly decreased with 120 mm and 180 mm irrigation levels at soil depths of 20 100 cm fig 6 these results are consistent with zhao et al 2020 magnetized and oxidized water irrigation could promote an increase in rld and rsd but this did not reach a level of statistical significance p 0 05 based on indoor hydroponic and outdoor field experiments wang et al 2021 have demonstrated that magnetized water irrigation promotes wheat root development including root length root surface area and root tips compared with the untreated water the rd in the 0 20 cm soil layer under magnetized and oxidized water irrigation increased by 3 8 and 13 8 0 83 mm and 0 91 mm respectively with only the change in rd between the igo120 plots achieving statistical significance p 0 05 table 3 the rd in the 20 60 cm soil layer was higher with both the magnetized and oxidized treatments than the ig treatment by 12 8 and 30 2 respectively reaching a level of statistical significance p 0 05 these results are consistent with wang et al 2019 and maffei 2014 irrigating winter wheat with magnetized or oxidized water can therefore promote the growth of the wheat root system 4 3 wheat roots and soil moisture gy and wue the availability of soil water to crops depends on the distribution of the root system passioura 2006 white and kirkegaard 2010 the spatial distribution of the roots in the soil reflects the potential water uptake capacity dai et al 2014 in our study the swc at a soil depth of 0 100 cm gradually decreased after march especially in the 2019 2020 season which largely reflected absorption by the roots to meet the growth needs of the wheat crop fig 8 liu et al 2002 observed that maximum root water absorption occurs after full vegetative growth until the booting stage from the end of march to mid april and during heading to anthesis from early to mid may similar observations have been made by wang et al 2014 who stated that roots grow into deeper soil layers and thus enhance the uptake of water from the subsoil layers ma et al 2018 emphasized the need to ensure that plants have sufficient absorptive capacity to achieve a high yield of wheat in our study igm120 and igo120 had higher wp values at the maturity stage in the 2019 2020 season table 4 and higher gy wue iwue and pue levels table 5 as well as higher root activity in the hydroponic cultivation experiments corresponding to gm and go respectively and higher rld rwd and rsd fig 6 the favorable development of roots provides the basis for wheat to absorb soil water and nutrients which will then also contribute to the yield and enhance wue in accordance with forde and lorenzo 2001 and chen et al 2014 the growth and development of the root system and its distribution in the soil not only determines the crop s absorption of water and nutrients but also directly affects the establishment of the aboveground canopy assimilated distribution and final yield ali et al 2018 have also shown that the distribution of wheat roots in the soil is important for efficient production management and the development of water saving agriculture 4 4 how to achieve a high yield and wue huang et al 2014 proposed that rainfall cannot generally meet the needs of winter wheat cultivation on the guanzhong plain of china and additional irrigation must be provided to achieve a high winter wheat gy however feng et al 2017 found that excessive irrigation was not conducive to improved yield and wue in our study two quadratic relationships were established by plotting gy versus the total levels of irrigation fig 10a from these it can be inferred that on average 103 mm of irrigation water is optimal to produce the highest yield two further quadratic functions were found by plotting wue versus the total irrigation levels fig 10b the estimated maximum wue was based on an average irrigation level of 89 mm it has been demonstrated that there is a threshold to wue improvement when excessive irrigation is applied because the recycling of assimilated dry matter before anthesis is inhibited zhang et al 2015 feng et al 2017 it has also been suggested that unsuitable irrigation will affect root growth thus affecting root uptake of nutrients and water and ultimately affect yield and wue ali et al 2019 we found a significant negative correlation between wue and et p 0 05 so it is important to consider et when trying to improve wue the level of irrigation chosen needs to take into account the local climate and soil environment in order to achieve a sustainable high yield and high wue 5 conclusions the effects of irrigation with magnetized and oxidized water on wheat growth and water use were studied using laboratory and field experiments on the guanzhong plain of the yellow river basin we conclude that magnetization and oxidation treatment of irrigation water can increase the ph and dissolved oxygen concentration and decrease the surface tension and viscosity coefficient of the water and these changes can be sustained for a limited period of time for winter wheat treated water can promote root vigor and growth improve the absorption of soil water by the wheat and thus provide favorable conditions for both high wheat yield and wue there is a threshold to improvements in wheat yield and wue with increasing irrigation and the average optimum level of irrigation appears to be 96 mm magnetization and oxidation treatment of irrigation water combined with appropriate irrigation levels can contribute to the optimization of wheat yield and wue based on saving water the magnetization and oxidation methods presented here can be used to explore the physiological and ecological functional potential of irrigation water further and to develop an efficient method for obtaining high

the guanzhong plain is one of the most important grain production areas in the yellow river basin of china winter wheat triticum aestivum l is a widely cultivated crop in the region with an annual production of 4 2 billion kg grain accounting for about 40 of the total grain yield gy in shannxi province zhang et al 2018 precipitation is the most important water source for agricultural development and production and inadequate rainfall often results in low crop productivity ali et al 2018 du et al 2015 the annual rainfall of the north china plain ranges from 470 to 910 mm but the average effective precipitation is only about 200 mm during the growing season equating to approximately 25 40 of the total water requirement of winter wheat feng et al 2017 successful irrigation is therefore essential for winter wheat to produce a high yield in this region however optimizing both the wheat gy and water use efficiency wue is difficult because of the high levels of irrigation needed for agricultural production creating a conflict between wue and the volume of irrigation water needed for a high gy xu et al 2016 wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 achieving high yielding but efficient water saving regimes is therefore increasingly urgent and important for sustainable agriculture in northwest china magnetization and oxidation irrigation water methodologies enable the physiological production potential of irrigation water to be increased improving the overall efficacy of irrigation water use in agricultural ecosystems ambashta and sillanpää 2010 colic and morse 1999 esmaeilnezhad 2017 wei 2018 when water passes through a magnetized field its structure and physical characteristics such as density and salt solution capacity etc are changed which can be very beneficial for soil and plant growth higashitani et al 1993 liu et al 2019 by improving the physicochemical properties these treatments improve the action and ultimately enhance the transmission capacity of irrigation water from soil to crops al ogaidi et al 2017 mostafazadeh et al 2012 wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2021 turker et al 2007 and qiu et al 2011 have suggested that while the osmotic pressure and solubility of treated water increase the viscosity coefficient and surface tension decrease beneficial effects of magnetically treated irrigation water have been reported for emergence rate seed yield and water use mu et al 2019 podleoeny et al 2004 selim 2011 surendran et al 2016 and many irrigation experiments on wheat corn soybean tomato and other crops have demonstrated positive biological effects zhang 2005 selim et al 2013 maffei 2014 this may be related to improvements in crop root development photosynthesis and enzyme activity turker et al 2007 liu et al 2019 the application of oxidized water in agricultural production is less widely used but studies have shown that oxidized water irrigation can improve crop yield and wue to some extent wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 wang et al 2021 suggest that the main reason for this is improved chlorophyll content and photosynthetic parameters including transpiration and photosynthetic rates however the effectiveness of treated water is still a controversial issue surendran et al 2013 for example because of the limited duration of the change in physicochemical properties surendran et al 2016 after entering the soil the treated water comes into contact with the crop s roots the change in the surface tension of the treated water increases the hydratability of the water molecules and ions the solubility of mineral salts and the availability of soil nutrients which change the water permeability of the root zone wang et al 2019 the plant root systems which significantly affect crop growth and yield formation play an important role in the plant soil ecosystem lynch 2007 zhang et al 2009 enhancement of soil wue mainly depends on the development of the root system zhang et al 2015 the morphological features of the main root system determine the efficacy of the whole root system and indirectly affect aboveground biomass and gy gao et al 2014 hu et al 2020 mosaddeghi et al 2009 thus soil water conditions and root structure affect each other and this ultimately determines the gy and wue of winter wheat previous research has examined the effects of different irrigation regimes on root growth in winter wheat li et al 2010 xu et al 2016 and the relationship between root growth and gy and wue jha et al 2017 we have focused on the effects of magnetized and oxidized water irrigation on winter wheat root growth and the relationship between root growth productivity and water use the objectives of the study were to 1 examine the physicochemical characteristics of irrigation water after magnetization and oxidation treatment and the duration of any changes 2 evaluate the effects of different irrigation regimes on root development soil water content and water consumption and 3 investigate any differences in gy and wue under different irrigation regimes in order to develop an optimized strategy for further conservation of water and increased efficiency of agriculture in northwestern china 2 materials and methods the study included laboratory and field experiments the laboratory experiments were carried out in the greenhouse of the northwest agricultural and forestry university shannxi province china from june to september 2018 during 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 field experiments were carried out at the caoxinzhuang experimental farm 34 18 n 108 05 e 523 7 m of the northwest agricultural and forestry university situated on the guanzhong plain of the southern loess plateau of northwest china fig 1 this area has a warm and semi humid climate with a mean annual temperature of 12 9 c and mean annual precipitation of 650 mm the main source of irrigation is groundwater most of the precipitation accounting for 65 of the total annual precipitation falls between july and september the variation in rainfall distribution mean temperature and relative humidity is presented in fig 2 2 1 laboratory experiment the laboratory experiments included groundwater with a mineralization value of 0 14 g l 1 and brackish water with a mineralization value of 3 g l 1 prepared from nacl and groundwater both were used as the raw water for the magnetization and oxidation treatments each treatment lasted for 0 5 h wang et al 2021 following treatment the water was analyzed for changes in physicochemical properties and used to prepare a nutrient solution for the hydroponic cultivation system ding et al 2007 details of the treatment regimes are shown in table 1 the xiaoyan 22 wheat variety was used for the laboratory experiments seeds that were clean and of uniform size were selected for conventional seedling cultivation each treatment had five replicates and each treatment contained 300 seeds the cultivation water was replaced once a day after five days seedlings with consistent and robust growth were selected and cultivated with the relevant nutrient solution prepared from the treated water ding et al 2007 to avoid dissipation of treated water it was transferred to the cultivation box as soon as possible during the transfer process the volume was strictly controlled using a calibrated container the cultivation conditions were temperature 25 c 20 c day night humidity 60 70 natural light a change of nutrient solution every five days the volume of the nutrient solution in the cultivation box was 5000 cm3 the experiments used a complete randomized block design and each treatment containing 45 plants had five replicates during the experiments the position of the cultivation boxes was changed randomly every three days to ensure that the light temperature and humidity conditions were uniform during the growth period 2 2 field experiments the field experiments assessed how different irrigation water types affected crop growth and wue the winter wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 which is widely grown in the study area was used cultivation of the winter wheat followed wang et al 2020 the experimental field was on level land and the soil

began was 1 0 g kg 1 17 1 g kg 1 7 0 mg kg 1 5 7 mg kg 1 and 133 8 mg kg 1 respectively the soil bulk density was 1 33 g cm 3 the clay content silt content and sand content were 16 5 51 7 and 31 8 respectively the wheat was sown on 15 october 2018 and 13 october 2019 at a planting density of 187 5 kg ha 1 irrigating with brackish water can lead to soil salinization and destroy the soil environment so field experiments using brackish water were not carried out eight treatments varying in type and level of irrigation groundwater were applied during the overwintering 15 january 2019 and 2 january 2020 respectively jointing 3 april 2019 and 23 march 2020 respectively and filling 20 may 2019 and 22 may 2020 respectively stages of wheat growth table 2 because of the limitations of the field experiments the magnetization and oxidation treatments were considered to have ended when the water had passed through the magnetic field environment or oxidation system a drip irrigation system was used and the different irrigation levels were determined by the number of taps and their drip rate the experiments used a complete randomized block design and each treatment had three replicates each plot was 4 m 4 m and adjacent plots were separated by a 1 m buffer 2 3 magnetization and oxidation of water water becomes magnetized after being passed through a magnetic field environment comprising permanent magnets or electromagnets of a certain velocity positioned perpendicular to the line of magnetic force the equipment for magnetizing water comprised a water supply tank pump outlet pipe and magnet a permanent magnet with a field intensity of 3000 g was mounted on the outer wall of the outlet pipe and the water was magnetized as it passed through the pipe the thickness and diameter of the pipe were 0 5 cm and 10 0 cm respectively and the flow rate was 6 3 10 3 m3 s 1 oxidized water refers to water that only retains positive ions and a positive charge after flowing through an oxidation system the oxidation system used comprised an oxidation processor eco1st technology group http irrigationenhancer com grounding resistance wire and pump as water flowed along the oxidation processor the walls of the processor became enriched with electrons which were then channeled underground to an electrode through grounded wires 2 4 experimental data collection 2 4 1 physicochemical properties of magnetized and oxidized water the ph value was determined using a phsj 4a ph meter the surface tension coefficient was measured using a bz 1 surface tension tester produced by changchun great wall teaching instrument co ltd the viscosity was determined using the syp265d high precision motion produced by shanghai pingxuan scientific instrument co ltd an hq40 portable dissolved oxygen meter seven2go mettler toledo china was used to monitor the dissolved oxygen concentration of the treated water during the oxygenating process zhu et al 2020 2 4 2 reactive oxygen species ros to investigate the potential generation of hydroxyl radicals oh an important active oxygen during irradiation 200 µl of 0 1 mol l 1 aqueous dimethyl pyridine n oxide dmpo was added to a tube containing 200 µl of the irradiated samples shi et al 2021 subsequently the mixture was shaken in a vortex mixer in touch mode for 1 min and the suspension filtered using a 0 45 mm membrane filter the filtrate was transferred to a capillary tube and sealed using vacuum grease the capillary tube was then inserted into a quartz tube and measured at room temperature 25 c to determine the amount of superoxide radicals o2 generated the samples were individually mixed with dmpo in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 2 4 3 root vigor under laboratory conditions at the jointing stage of growth the roots of five plants from each hydroponic tank were randomly selected to measure root vigor 0 5 g fresh root tip samples were taken from each selected plant the root vigor was assessed by measuring the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride ttc levels in the roots ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 2 4 4 root distribution under field conditions root samples were collected from each treatment at the flowering stage of growth during the 2019 2020 winter wheat season the samples were taken from different depths down the soil profile then processed in the laboratory the distance between the sampling profile and the test plot boundary was more than 1 m to eliminate the influence of a marginal effect soil samples 10 cm wide and 20 cm long along the direction of the wheat row were collected from both sides of the roots of two adjacent rows with 20 cm row spacing the soil profile was divided into 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm layers four soil samples were taken from each layer the samples of soil and associated roots were soaked in plastic buckets filled with water and gently disaggregated by hand to remove impurities and roots from other plants then loaded into 80 mesh bags live roots were carefully separated from dead roots according to gregory 1994 a 1 mm sieve was used above a 0 25 mm sieve during the washing process to ensure roots were not lost from the samples the wheat roots were cleaned with distilled water and then put onto a plexiglass plate containing a small amount of water and carefully stretched out with tweezers so that there was no overlap or intersection between the roots images of the roots were taken at a resolution of 300 dpi using an epson scanner v370 winrhizo software version 5 0 regent instruments inc quebec

weight and gy at maturity xu et al 2018 2 4 6 soil water status the volumetric soil water content swc was monitored at the center of each plot for each irrigation treatment at the greening jointing filling and maturity stages at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 3 m using a neutron meter with a standard count of 605 ih ii didcot instrument co wallingford uk three or four replicates were taken the maximum root depth of the wheat during flowering was 2 0 m so monitoring swc at a depth of 3 m was sufficient to analyze any variation in the deeper soil water wu et al 2009 zhou et al 2008 the swc was measured every 15 days from sowing to maturity after periods of precipitation the monitoring time was delayed accordingly the neutron meter was calibrated following standard methods cheng et al 2009 as neutron spillage occurred mainly at a depth of 0 20 cm the calibration was based on 0 20 cm and 20 100 cm and the calibration curve determined as follows 4 y 14 658 x 22 477 r 2 0 934 0 20 cm 5 y 107 031 x 1 043 r 2 0 841 20 100 cm where y is swc and x is the neutron meter count ratio because the texture of the vertical soil profile was relatively uniform and the soil layer below 100 cm was relatively less affected by climatic factors the calibration curve for the 20 100 cm soil layer was adopted for the 100 300 cm swc soil water storage was calculated using the following equation burgess et al 2014 6 sws wc bd h where sws is soil water storage mm wc is soil mass water content bd is soil bulk density g cm 3 and h is soil depth mm in order to ensure the accuracy of the bulk density we excavated a 3 m deep profile in the center of the study area for stratified sampling the available soil water storage asws was measured at the greening and maturity stages and calculated according to the following equations 7 awc wc θ pwp 8 asws awc bd h where awc and θpwp are the available swc and the permanent wilting point respectively the θpwp of the experimental farmland was 7 3

rainfall during the growing season i mm is the total amount of irrigation δsws mm is the difference in soil water storage between two growth stages d is the deep percolation of soil water below the measurement depth and r is the surface runoff the groundwater table remained at about 80 m below the surface during the experiment based on the monitoring of wells around the study area so capillary water moving up from the deeper layers to the root zone could be discounted according to lin et al 2019 the amount of rainfall in the area was not enough to percolate into the soil layer below a depth of 300 cm soil water measurements indicated that deep percolation at the site was negligible there was usually no runoff in the area so r was ignored wue irrigation water use efficiency iwue and precipitation water use efficiency pue were calculated using the following equations guan et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 10 wue y et 11 iwue y i 12 pue y p where wue kg ha 1 mm 1 describes water use efficiency for grain yield iwue kg ha 1 mm 1 describes the irrigation water use efficiency y kg ha 1 is grain yield at maturity pue kg ha 1 mm 1 is the precipitation use efficiency and p mm is the precipitation during the growing season the water productivity wp of the crop was determined at each growth stage using the following equation zhang et al 2020 13 wp dy et where wp kg ha 1 mm 1 is the crop water productivity δdy kg ha 1 is the difference in the crop dry biomass between the two growth stages and δet mm is the difference in the water evapotranspiration between the two growth stages 2

laboratory experiments 3 1 1 dynamic characteristics of treated water the ph value and dissolved oxygen concentration of both the groundwater and brackish water increased after activation treatment while the surface tension and viscosity coefficient decreased fig 3 at certain time points the dynamic characteristics of the gm and go were obviously different from those of ck g the ph of the gm and go was initially higher than that of ck g and remained so for about 60 h the surface tension of ck g after magnetization and oxidation treatment decreased by 15 4 and 7 4 respectively and the difference before and after magnetization treatment was significant p 0 05 the effects on the surface tension of groundwater and brackish water gradually disappeared after about 10 h the viscosity coefficient of the gm and go was lower than that of ck g and the difference could last for about 8 h the dissolved oxygen concentration of the gm and go hydroponic solutions was initially higher than that of ck g and remained so for about 4 0 h and 2 5 h respectively 3 1 2 hydroxyl radicals oh the spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance epr technique was used to assess the formation of ros

in dmpo aqueous solutions suggesting the formation of oh the generation of oh in the gm and go showed that the oxidation ability of ck g had been enhanced directly by magnetization and oxidation treatments 3 2 wheat root system 3 2 1 root vigor as shown in fig 5 both magnetization and oxidation treatments could significantly improve root vigor in the winter wheat p 0 05 in the hydroponic systems using groundwater both the magnetization and oxidation treatments gm and go increased the root vigor of the cultivated wheat by 101 526 2 µg g 1 h 1 and 254 925 1 µg g 1 h 1 respectively compared with the control group ck g improved root vigor may directly affect wheat root growth and the absorption of soil water and nutrients compared with ck b the root vigor of plants grown in bm

groundwater or brackish water 3 2 2 rld rwd and rsd rld is a fundamental determinant of soil nutrient acquisition and water uptake in plants fig 6a shows the rld distribution of winter wheat in the 0 100 cm soil profile under different irrigation regimes compared with the ni treatment irrigation could significantly improve rld p 0 05 when the irrigation level increased from 120 mm to 180 mm the effect of swc on rld was not obvious in the 20 40 cm soil layers and there was even negative growth under magnetized and oxidized water irrigation however under the same irrigation levels compared with the untreated groundwater ig both magnetized and oxidized water irrigation generally increased the rld of the 0 100 cm soil profile the rld of the 0 20 cm layer increased by 22 7 and 24 0 under igm120 and igo120 respectively rwd and rsd showed a similar trend in the 0 100 cm soil profile during the flowering stage fig 6b and c the rwd of the 0 20 cm soil layer under 120 mm magnetized and oxidized water irrigation regimes igm120 and igo120 increased by 9 8 and 26 0 respectively compared with untreated groundwater irrigation ig the overall percentages were 104 7 igm120 and 94 9 igo120 and 39 7 igm120 and 35 7 igo120 for the 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil layers respectively the rsd of magnetized and oxidized water in the 20 60 cm soil layer increased the most by 104 7 igm120 and 89 3 igo120 respectively 3 2 3 root system morphology the root morphology parameters of the winter wheat at the flowering growth stage varied under the different irrigation regimes table 3 compared with igm120 and igo120 treatments the root dry weight for igm180 and igo180 treatments in the 0 20 cm soil layer improved by 70 8 and 13 0 respectively compared with the ig treatment root diameter and root dry weight for the igm120 and igo120 treatments in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased by 3 8 and 13 8 and 0 4 and 20 7 respectively the igm120 and igo120 treatments significantly increased the root length ratio 17 1 and 23 8 and root mass ratio 13 8 and 15 4 compared with the ig treatment p 0 05 3 3 soil water content swc and available soil water storage asws 3 3 1 variation in root zone swc as shown in fig 7 the swc in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the winter wheat growing season fluctuated greatly under the influence of irrigation in the 2018 2019 season the average swc of the 0 100 cm soil layer under 180 mm groundwater irrigation ig was 18 2 higher than that of the control ni compared with the groundwater irrigation ig the average swc of the 0 100 cm soil layer under irrigation with magnetized igm180 and oxidized igo180 water decreased by 4 3 and 8 4 respectively and the difference between igo180 and ig was significant p 0 05 in the 2019 2020 season the average swc of the igm120 and igo120 treatments in the 0 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil layers were 27 6 and 27 7 and 30 0 and 31 9 respectively and there was no significant difference compared with the ig treatment figs 2 and 8 show that dynamic changes in swc varied between the two growing seasons overall the swc in 2019 2020 was higher than that in 2018 2019 with increasing irrigation levels both magnetized and oxidized water irrigation had an obvious effect on the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer in the 2018 2019 season the swc of the 0 100 cm soil layer was generally low at the greening to maturity stage with 60 mm magnetized and oxidized water irrigation regimes igm60 and igo60 during the filling stage the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer increased as a result of both irrigation and rainfall in the 2019 2020 season the average swc of the 0 100 cm soil layer during the greening to maturity stage increased by 7 6 and 15 0 with 120 mm and 180 mm of magnetized water irrigation igm120 and igm180 respectively compared with 60 mm of magnetized water igm60 3 3 2 dynamic change in asws dynamic changes in asws from the greening to maturity stage in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 are shown in fig 9 asws was investigated in three soil layers 0 100 cm 100 200 cm and 200 300 cm based on the irrigation levels and the soil water consumption characteristics of winter wheat in the 2018 2019 winter wheat season the asws of the 0 100 cm soil layer under magnetized and oxidized water irrigation igm180 and igo180 significantly increased by 61 1 and 66 7 p 0 05 respectively compared with that under untreated groundwater irrigation ig between the greening and maturity stage in 2019 2020 the asws in the 0 300 soil layer decreased under all three treatments in the 0 100 cm soil layer asws decreased by 49 34 and 42 mm under ig igm120 and igo120 respectively and in the 100 200 cm soil layer it decreased by 68 82 and 72 mm respectively 3 4 crop water productivity wp the wp during the winter wheat growth period in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 under different irrigation regimes is shown in table 4 from the sowing to the jointing stage the wp tended to increase with increasing irrigation indicating that the growth of the wheat during the vegetative growth period was greatly affected by the amount of irrigation in the 2018 2019 season the wp of the 40 mm and 60 mm magnetized water irrigation treatments igm120 and igm180 increased by 46 0 and 57 2 p 0 05 respectively compared with that of 20 mm magnetized water irrigation igm60 with the same amount of irrigation the wp at the jointing stage under magnetized and oxidized water irrigation igm120 and igo120 increased by 16 2 and 6 0 p 0 05 respectively compared with the untreated groundwater irrigation treatment ig in the 2019 2020 winter wheat season 3 5 gy wue iwue and pue under the same irrigation level the gy and wue of winter wheat under both magnetized and oxidized water irrigation were improved compared with untreated groundwater irrigation table 5 in the 2019 2020 season the gy and wue of magnetized water irrigation igm120 was 11 68 103 kg ha 1 and 27 74 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively significantly higher than with untreated groundwater ig with the same irrigation levels p 0 05 the gy and wue of the oxidized water irrigation treatment igo120 were 11 1 and 13 8 higher than that of ig which equated to 10 72 103 kg ha 1 and 26 08 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively with the increase in irrigation a threshold in gy and wue of the wheat could be seen when the total irrigation level was 120 mm the gy and wue of magnetized and oxidized water irrigation treatments igm120 and igo120 were 11 47 103 kg ha 1 and 27 45 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 10 56 103 kg ha 1 and 25 81 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively the iwue decreased with increasing irrigation in the 2018 2019 season the iwue of magnetized and oxidized water irrigation treatments igm180 and igo180 increased by 10 1 and 13 9 57 36 kg ha 1 mm 1and 59 34 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively compared with the untreated groundwater irrigation regime ig the percentages of precipitation use efficiency pue also increased by 10 2 and 14 0 respectively 3 6 wheat yield and irrigation effectiveness gy varied with irrigation level and type of irrigation water table 5 regression analyses of gy y against supplementary water x were described by the following functions the comparative results are shown in fig 10a y 2018 2019 0 0002 x 2 0 1158 x 10 375 r 2 0 6097 y 2019 2020 0 0002 x 2 0 1176 x 8 5536 r 2 0 5917 maximizing these functions y x 0 provided evidence that irrigation with 102 mm and 104 mm of water excluding precipitation achieved the highest gy in the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons respectively the maximum wue levels for the 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 seasons were 27 15 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 27 74 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively with the igm120 treatment table 5 the relationship between wue y and supplementary water x is shown in fig 10b and can be described by the following equations fig 10b also shows that wue increased with supplementary water up to a certain level and then declined maximizing the quadratic function wue x 0 showed that irrigation with 82 mm and 96 mm

the molecular structure of water and the composition of the aquatic environment e g the dipole moment of water molecules and the oxygen content of water esmaeilnezhad et al 2017 mostafazadeh et al 2012 wang et al 2018 forming a small complex of water molecules consisting of 5 6 water molecules and consequently improving water activity e g solubility and reaction rate and its interaction with other substances baker and judd 1996 wang et al 2016 in this study the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh provided strong evidence for enhanced magnetized and oxidized water activity fig 4 gaafar et al 2015 proposed that under a magnetic field the polarized water molecules arrange in one direction as the hydrogen ions decrease with a subsequent increase in ph chibowski and szczes 2018 have presented a clear explanation of the action of water in the field based on changes in the structure of water via hydrogen bonding in intraclusters and between interclusters magnetization and oxidation treatments change the physicochemical properties of irrigation water zhu et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 including an increase in ph electrical conductivity ec diffusion and permeability and a decrease in viscosity and surface tension compared with untreated water surendran et al 2016 toledo et al 2008 wei 2018 although the methods used for magnetization and oxidation in this study were not the same the effects of the two treatments were similar as measured by dissolved oxygen concentration surface tension ph and electrical conductivity of the irrigation water after treatment as shown in fig 3 magnetization and oxidation could increase the ph and the dissolved oxygen concentration and a similar conclusion was reached by wang et al 2019 an explanation for the increase in ph could be the partial hydrogen bond fracture in treated water as suggested by the generation of oh in magnetized and oxidized water fig 4 in addition our results show that the viscosity coefficient and surface tension of the treated water decreased which explains the enhanced fluidity and permeability of the treated water this is consistent with the results of yin et al 2018 the altered molecular structure of the treated water reduces the hydrogen bonds under the optimized magnetic field zhang 2005 some water molecules are separated from the molecular groups and became free dimer water molecules the degree of association is reduced and the polarity enhanced wang et al 2019 found that the surface tension coefficient and viscosity coefficient of treated water decreases the diffusion coefficient increases with an optimized magnetic field enhancing the diffusion ability and permeability of the water the permeability can be increased by 34 we found that the changes in the physicochemical properties of the treated water could only be sustained for a limited period of time surendran et al 2016 have shown that magnetic treatment of solutions tends to reduce ec whereas we noticed a definite trend in increasing ph for all the solutions used however this difference in parameters was nullified after 108 h when the solution parameters returned to the original values others have come to a similar conclusion that the memory effect in the changes in physical properties can last for up to 2 days higashitani et al 1993 szczes et al 2011 silva et al 2015 pang and deng 2008 found that the biological effect of magnetized water depended on the magnetic field strength hence the diachronic properties of treated water will limit its popularization and application in agriculture 4 2 root growth responses to different irrigation regimes roots are the main plant organ that takes up water and nutrients and thus their size and distribution in soil are closely related to their capacity for water and nutrient uptake robertson et al 1993 wu and cheng 2014 the amount of soil water absorbed by plant roots mainly depends on the soil water supply and the morphological and physiological characteristics of the roots wang et al 2014 li et al 2017 root vigor defined as root growth and physiological function affects the absorption of water and nutrients ma et al 2018 and thus can directly affect crop growth nutritional status and yield wu et al 2017 our results show that the magnetization and oxidation treatments significantly improved the root vigor of the winter wheat p 0 05 fig 5 by 100 5 253 7 and 100 4 213 9 respectively compared with control plants ck g and ck b emil and aleksandra 2018 have shown that changes in ph associated with the magnetic treatment of water can modify biological activity in plants and consequently influence plant growth yin et al 2018 have also demonstrated that changes in surface tension viscosity coefficient dissolved oxygen and the degree of association can enhance the normal metabolism of plants a decrease in water surface tension and viscosity coefficient reduces the critical nucleus radius and increases the nucleation rate and crystal growth rate during the crystallization process however the formation of a large number of nuclei will rapidly reduce the supersaturation therefore the size of crystalline particles and sedimentation rate after treatment will decrease and more particles will be suspended in the treated water this will reduce the likelihood of precipitated solid substances blocking irrigation and crop capillary channels and help maintain a smooth flow of nutrient solution thus enhancing the absorption of water by plants zhang 2005 as shown in fig 3 both magnetization and oxidation treatments increased ph and dissolved oxygen levels and decreased the viscosity coefficient and surface tension for a period of time overall irrigation with treated water can promote growth of the wheat root system which in turn will improve the plant s utilization of water and nutrients savostin 1964 wang et al 2019 the most important crop root parameters include rld rsd and root diameter rd ali et al 2018 hu et al 2020 which together determine the efficacy of the whole root system gao et al 2014 mosaddeghi et al 2009 and indirectly affect aboveground biomass and gy feng et al 2017 forde and lorenzo 2001 showed that both excess and insufficient irrigation significantly change winter wheat root size and distribution thus reducing root growth in our study we found that rld and rsd slowly decreased with 120 mm and 180 mm irrigation levels at soil depths of 20 100 cm fig 6 these results are consistent with zhao et al 2020 magnetized and oxidized water irrigation could promote an increase in rld and rsd but this did not reach a level of statistical significance p 0 05 based on indoor hydroponic and outdoor field experiments wang et al 2021 have demonstrated that magnetized water irrigation promotes wheat root development including root length root surface area and root tips compared with the untreated water the rd in the 0 20 cm soil layer under magnetized and oxidized water irrigation increased by 3 8 and 13 8 0 83 mm and 0 91 mm respectively with only the change in rd between the igo120 plots achieving statistical significance p 0 05 table 3 the rd in the 20 60 cm soil layer was higher with both the magnetized and oxidized treatments than the ig treatment by 12 8 and 30 2 respectively reaching a level of statistical significance p 0 05 these results are consistent with wang et al 2019 and maffei 2014 irrigating winter wheat with magnetized or oxidized water can therefore promote the growth of the wheat root system 4 3 wheat roots and soil moisture gy and wue the availability of soil water to crops depends on the distribution of the root system passioura 2006 white and kirkegaard 2010 the spatial distribution of the roots in the soil reflects the potential water uptake capacity dai et al 2014 in our study the swc at a soil depth of 0 100 cm gradually decreased after march especially in the 2019 2020 season which largely reflected absorption by the roots to meet the growth needs of the wheat crop fig 8 liu et al 2002 observed that maximum root water absorption occurs after full vegetative growth until the booting stage from the end of march to mid april and during heading to anthesis from early to mid may similar observations have been made by wang et al 2014 who stated that roots grow into deeper soil layers and thus enhance the uptake of water from the subsoil layers ma et al 2018 emphasized the need to ensure that plants have sufficient absorptive capacity to achieve a high yield of wheat in our study igm120 and igo120 had higher wp values at the maturity stage in the 2019 2020 season table 4 and higher gy wue iwue and pue levels table 5 as well as higher root activity in the hydroponic cultivation experiments corresponding to gm and go respectively and higher rld rwd and rsd fig 6 the favorable development of roots provides the basis for wheat to absorb soil water and nutrients which will then also contribute to the yield and enhance wue in accordance with forde and lorenzo 2001 and chen et al 2014 the growth and development of the root system and its distribution in the soil not only determines the crop s absorption of water and nutrients but also directly affects the establishment of the aboveground canopy assimilated distribution and final yield ali et al 2018 have also shown that the distribution of wheat roots in the soil is important for efficient production management and the development of water saving agriculture 4 4 how to achieve a high yield and wue huang et al 2014 proposed that rainfall cannot generally meet the needs of winter wheat cultivation on the guanzhong plain of china and additional irrigation must be provided to achieve a high winter wheat gy however feng et al 2017 found that excessive irrigation was not conducive to improved yield and wue in our study two quadratic relationships were established by plotting gy versus the total levels of irrigation fig 10a from these it can be inferred that on average 103 mm of irrigation water is optimal to produce the highest yield two further quadratic functions were found by plotting wue versus the total irrigation levels fig 10b the estimated maximum wue was based on an average irrigation level of 89 mm it has been demonstrated that there is a threshold to wue improvement when excessive irrigation is applied because the recycling of assimilated dry matter before anthesis is inhibited zhang et al 2015 feng et al 2017 it has also been suggested that unsuitable irrigation will affect root growth thus affecting root uptake of nutrients and water and ultimately affect yield and wue ali et al 2019 we found a significant negative correlation between wue and et p 0 05 so it is important to consider et when trying to improve wue the level of irrigation chosen needs to take into account the local climate and soil environment in order to achieve a sustainable high yield and high wue 5 conclusions the effects of irrigation with magnetized and oxidized water on wheat growth and water use were studied using laboratory and field experiments on the guanzhong plain of the yellow river basin we conclude that magnetization and oxidation treatment of irrigation water can increase the ph and dissolved oxygen concentration and decrease the surface tension and viscosity coefficient of the water and these changes can be sustained for a limited period of time for winter wheat treated water can promote root vigor and growth improve the absorption of soil water by the wheat and thus provide favorable conditions for both high wheat yield and wue there is a threshold to improvements in wheat yield and wue with increasing irrigation and the average optimum level of irrigation appears to be 96 mm magnetization and oxidation treatment of irrigation water combined with appropriate irrigation levels can contribute to the optimization of wheat yield and wue based on saving water the magnetization and oxidation methods presented here can be used to explore the physiological and ecological functional potential of irrigation water further and to develop an efficient method for obtaining high yields of winter wheat simultaneously with good wue in northwest china financial support this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41830754 41771545 declaration of
