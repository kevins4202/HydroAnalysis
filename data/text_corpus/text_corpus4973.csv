24865,the sterile insect technique sit used to control insect populations consists of releasing males sterilized by ionizing radiations wild females that mate with these males can no longer produce viable offspring which may drives the population decline although this method has proved its efficiency its effect may be more limited for fast reproducing large population species such aedes albopictus a novel approach named boosted sit has been designed to strengthen the sit technique it consists of coating sterile males with a biocide that will be transferred to the mated females which will then contaminate the oviposition sites this study is aimed at exploring demographic effects of both techniques sit and boosted sit through their inclusion in a weather driven abundance model of the aedes albopictus population dynamics in the geographical context of la reunion island sensitivity analysis showed that the date to start the release as well as the quantity of sterile males released and their competitiveness are of key importance for both control methods according to our results boosted sit allows 1 increasing the effectiveness of the sit when the sterile males released are of medium quality in terms of competitiveness and 2 extending the optimal window to start the control period keywords sit boosted sit vector control pyriproxyfen population dynamics mosquito 1 introduction vector borne diseases account for about 17 of the estimated global burden of infectious diseases and are responsible for more than 700 000 deaths every year world health organization and unicef 2017 dengue is the most common and widespread arbovirus the number of dengue infections is estimated at 390 millions every year of which 96 million induce clinical symptoms of various severities bhatt et al 2013 dengue virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus aedes in particular ae albopictus and ae aegypti these species are also vectors of other arboviruses including zika and chikungunya the global distributions of these three arboviruses have recently expanded causing many severe disease outbreaks in urban human populations patterson et al 2016 different vaccines have been developed for dengue and zika but their efficacy remains to be studied musso and gubler 2016 who 2018 moreover no disease specific treatment for these arboviruses exists caglioti et al 2013 in this context mosquito control remains the cornerstone of disease prevention the tiger mosquito aedes stegomyia albopictus skuse diptera culicidae a species native to the forests of southeast asia smith 1956 has expanded its distribution by adapting to new sources of blood and environments its proximity with humans has enabled it to colonize new territories through international trade e g tire trade reiter 1998 although being less competent than its sister species ae aegypti to transmit dengue viruses paupy et al 2009 ae albopicus was the only vector involved in some recent dengue outbreaks gasperi et al 2012 paupy et al 2009 rezza 2012 wu et al 2010 for many mosquito borne diseases larvicides have demonstrated their efficiency to reduce transmission during outbreaks world health organization 2009 however ae albopictus uses multiple cryptic and dispersed breeding sites of all sorts tires beverage cans plastic items etc they are difficult to locate and treat which significantly hinders larvicides control of this vector connelly and carlson 2009 mobilization of the local communities to eliminate these diverse containers used by peridomestic ae albopictus could be an effective solution but changing attitudes and behaviors can take many years gubler and clark 1996 tapia conyer et al 2012 winch et al 1992 an integrated and sustainable control of ae albopictus is therefore necessary which cannot rely solely on the usual insecticide usage or the goodwill of local communities but must be supplemented by alternative treatment methods achee et al 2019 a promising alternative for such a cryptic breeding insect is the sterile insect technique sit it relies on the mass release of males sterilized by ionizing radiation since female mosquitoes are inseminated by only one male during their life with very rare exceptions mating with such males negates their reproductive success hence causing the target population to decline dunn and follett 2017 flores and o neill 2018 sit has been shown to be effective in eradicating tsetse flies vreysen et al 2014 screwworms wyss 2000 and medflies enkerlin et al 2017 in the case of mosquito control success has been more variable although particularly good results have been obtained in italy bellini et al 2013 and more recently in china in combination with the incompatible insect technique iit zheng et al 2019 indeed mosquito populations are generally very large and a significant reduction in their population therefore requires the release of a large number of sterile males whom breeding sorting from females and irradiating are costly an efficacy improving upgrade named boosted sit has recently been proposed bouyer et al 2016 bouyer and lefrançois 2014 its rationale is that the released males are the best available vectors to contaminate females with toxic agents that could be further disseminated to other compartments of the target population by self dissemination it has been proposed to coat the sterilized males with pyriproxyfen an insect growth regulator that prevents the emergence of adult mosquito from the aquatic pupae invest and lucas 2008 maoz et al 2017 the insecticide could be transferred to females by mating which in turn could specifically contaminate their breeding sites by using females themselves as insecticide vectors boosted sit could therefore drastically improve control of species with cryptic breeding habits such as ae albopictus however many questions remain such as the number of males to be released for efficient control or the magnitude of the potential boosting effect both depend on the duration of contamination of breeding sites no consensus appears in the bibliography invest and lucas 2008 and on the effectiveness of pyriproxyfen transfers from males to females and from females to breeding sites parameters for which empirical data are not available yet in cases empirical data are lacking mathematical models are often useful for planning mosquito population management strategies they can be used to understand and predict population density in relation to environmental variations ewing et al 2016 ezanno et al 2015 roche et al 2015 tran et al 2013 and to anticipate the effects of population management measures under various scenarios cailly et al 2012 in the case of sit such theoretical models have been developed in order to 1 optimize the strategies of sterile males releases almeida et al 2019 cai et al 2014 evans and bishop 2014 huang et al 2017 li and yuan 2015 multerer et al 2019 white et al 2010 2 study the impact of the environment on sit dufourd and dumont 2013 maiti et al 2006 mishra et al 2018 and 3 evaluate the effect of sit coupled with standard use of insecticides fister et al 2013 hendron and bonsall 2016 a recently published model by pleydell and bouyer 2019 specifically studied the efficacy gain of boosted versus standard sit in a theoretical population their results suggest that boosted sit could drastically reduce the required number of males released however to our knowledge none of these models have studied the effects of sit or boosted sit on ae albopictus populations under realistic environmental conditions the objectives of the present study were thus 1 to evaluate the efficacy gain of boosted sit in real geographical and climatic conditions with the example of la reunion island a tropical island where ae albopictus is the main chikungunya and dengue vector delatte et al 2008 and 2 to optimize sit and boosted sit strategies in this context between 2005 and 2006 reunion island was affected by a large chikungunya epidemic with more than 38 of the population infected ars and ivs 2010 an epidemic of dengue is currently spreading with more than 24 300 indigenous cases as of july 01 2019 ars and préfecture réunion 2019 located in the indian ocean between madagascar and mauritius la reunion island is a small volcanic island 2512 km2 with a mountainous topography aedes albopictus mosquitoes are mainly found at low elevations in urban and peri urban areas boyer et al 2014 moreover the island is characterized by an east west precipitation gradient ranging from a maximal annual rainfall of 15 931 mm recorded in the eastern part to a minimal annual rainfall of 183 mm in the west météo france 2019 the island is characterized by two seasons with a hot and wet austral summer from november to march and a rather mild and dry winter la reunion island with its diverse landscapes and contrasting climate is thus an excellent place to study the impact of control methods against ae albopictus in a realistic variable environment moreover since the severe 2005 2006 chikungunya epidemic ae albopictus populations have been regularly monitored by the regional health agency a deterministic model of ae albopictus population dynamics has been recently developed by tran et al 2020 and validated using these extensive entomological data this model realistically integrates the climatic variations of la reunion island on the ae albopictus population dynamics tran et al 2013 i temperature impacts the development time of aquatic stages and the mortality of larvae pupae and adults ii rainfalls positively impact the number of available breeding sites and the environmental carrying capacity iii heavy rainfalls impact the mortality rates of aquatic stages by flooding the breeding habitats dieng et al 2012 this model is currently used by the regional health agency as a tool for decision support called alborun tran et al 2020 in the present study we modified this alborun population dynamic model to integrate the potential effects of sit and boosted sit on the ae albopictus populations in la reunion island after controlling its accuracy on the same entomological data used in tran et al 2020 we first performed a global sensitivity analysis to identify the key parameters affecting the efficacy of sit and boosted sit we then assessed the optimal timing for both control methods under a tropical environment taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of micro climates in la reunion island to produce a detailed map of the locally optimal starting months of the control period finally we studied the effects of two different sterile males release strategies constant or density dependent on ae albopictus populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is delimited by 1203 operational urban sectors defined by the vector control service of the regional health agency 31 weather stations of the french meteorological service at la reunion island provide the daily average temperature and rainfall intensity records from 2011 to 2016 each operational urban sector is associated with the nearest weather station fig 1 2 2 weather driven abundance model to simulate ae albopictus population dynamics we modified the alborun mechanistic model tran et al 2020 alborun computes the densities of the different stages of ae albopictus life cycle aquatic eggs e larvae l pupae p and aerial emerging females fem nulliparous females fn parous females fp using a system of ordinary differential equations ode parous females are females that have taken a blood meal and oviposited at least once whereas nulliparous females did not yet lay eggs nulliparous and parous females are both again divided into three compartments according to the gonotrophic cycle distinguishing between host seeking females engorged females and females seeking a breeding site in total the model is composed of 10 compartments it thus makes it possible to compute independently and simultaneously the population dynamics in each operational urban sector the alborun outputs have been validated using entomological field data from la reunion island tran et al 2020 in the present study alborun was modified to assess effects of sit and boosted sit control strategies fig 2 1 as these strategies are based on the release of sterile males a specific male compartment m was explicitly included it computes the number of wild males available for mating with females 2 the number of compartments was reduced to avoid over parametrization the sub compartments for nulliparous and parous females were thus aggregated into a single compartment each nulliparous females fn parous females fp the modified model called malborun

cailly et al 2012 larval mortality ml is similarly increased when their density l increases parameters and functions are similar to the alborun model by tran et al 2020 table 1 due to the aggregation of female sub compartments the value of the parameter μ f r and the function ff had to be reevaluated to ensure consistency between the original and modified models the value of μ f r was estimated using a maximum likelihood method multi level single linkage or mlsl algorithm nloptr package r software https cran r project org web packages nloptr index html to adjust malborun to the outputs of alborun i e the density of mosquitoes for each compartment in addition the malborun ff value was obtained by summing the times spent by the nulliparous and parous females in the host seeking blood feeding and breeding site seeking compartments in alborun for each time step malborun predicts the abundance of ae albopictus for the seven stages and for each operational urban sectors the model was further validated using the entomological data from tran et al 2020 i e a longitudinal study on the larval stages of ae albopictus at five northern sites in 2012 and 2013 a spearman test was performed to assess the correlation coefficient between the observed larvae abundances and those predicted by the model 2 3 modelling the effects of control methods 2 3 1 sit model malborun eq 1 fig 2 was then

different from malborun sit eq 2 appear in bold the objective of the boosted sit is to impact the emergence of ae albopictus via the pyriproxyfen through the contamination of breeding sites we therefore introduced btot the total number of breeding sites and bc the number of contaminated breeding sites in uncontaminated breeding sites probability 1 b c b t o t fem females and m males would emerge from pupae at the same rate as in the malborun sit model however this rate may be lower in contaminated breeding sites probability b c b t o t as emergence is inhibited by pyriproxyfen let ϕ be the proportion of adults emerging from pupae in pyriproxyfen contaminated sites the overall emergence rate would therefore be modified by the factor 1 b c b t o t 1 ϕ when ϕ 0 the effect of pyriproxyfen is maximal no pupae can emerge from a contaminated breeding site conversely when ϕ 1 all pupae can emerge despite the presence of pyriproxyfen e g resistance of aedes albopictus to pyriproxyfen which is equivalent to sit alone fig g1 for this strategy the released males are always sterile but they are also coated with pyriproxyfen their abundance is noted msc during the control period with the boosted sit a number λ m s c of these males is periodically released in the population the periodicity τ and the number of releases n can be modified see malborun sit model when mating with females msc males transfer part of their pyriproxyfen coating to the females thus contaminate them the boosting effect being that these females would in turn contaminate the breeding sites bc this transfer results in these males loosing their coating thus becoming sterile uncontaminated males ms since msc males can mate with any females in the population the number of contacts is c m s c f t o t c m s c m s m where f t o t f e m f n f p f s i e the total number of adult females and c the competitiveness of irradiated males whether msc or ms see malborun sit model the number of msc

released males whether still coated with pyriproxyfen msc or having lost their coating ms are sterile and can therefore sterilize females as in malborun sit the reproductive status of emerging females fem in malborun bsit will be determined by their first mating if they mate with a sterile male probability p c m s c m s c m s c m s m they become sterile females fs if they mate with a wild male probability 1 p they become nulliparous gravid females fn in order to limit the number of compartments we did not make an explicit distinction between contaminated and uncontaminated females any

n f p f s c m s c m s m is the number of females contaminated with pyriproxyfen after contact with msc males we thus considered that any mated females sterile or not oviposit in larval breeding sites after a time ff if they were contaminated they would then transfer some of their pyriproxyfen to breeding sites thus reducing their level of contamination until complete decontamination this imperfect transfer of pyriproxyfen transfer is modelled by the factor kb the number of females required to contaminate a breeding site when 0 kb 1 several females are required to contaminate a single breeding site imperfect transfer of pyriproxyfen from msc males to females rapid decontamination of females insufficient transfer of pyriproxyfen to the breeding site when kb 1 a single female can contaminate several breeding sites overall c m s c f n f p f s c m s c m s m k b f f is therefore the effective number of contaminated breeding sites to compute the number of new contaminated breeding site we also considered the probability that a breeding site was not yet contaminated i e 1 b c b t o t finally we took into account the possibility that a breeding site bc may remain contaminated for only a limited period of time d 2 3 3 models outputs at each time step the models predict the abundance of ae albopictus for each stage and for each operational urban sector moreover four synthetic model outputs were computed to assess the impact of both sit and boosted sit methods on the mosquito population fig a1 1 the reduction rate was calculated as the size of females f n f p during the control period divided by i the size of females without control to evaluate the effect of the sit and ii the size of females during the sit control to evaluate the added effect of the boosted sit 2 the sterility rate was defined as the number of sterile females fs divided by the total number of fertilized females f n f p f s during the control period 3 the resilience corresponds to the time required to return to the natural dynamics it was calculated as the number of days required after a treatment period for the controlled population to reach the same abundance as a uncontrolled population 4 the reduction of emergence was estimated as the ratio between the number of pupae present in contaminated breeding sites that became adults during the boosted sit control and the number of pupae that became adults in a similar but uncontrolled population 2 3 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis sa was performed on the four synthetic outputs using the variance based method of fourier amplitude sensitivity test saltelli et al 2000 with the sensitivity r package https cran r project org web packages sensitivity index html the parameters of malborun sit μ m s c malborun bsit μ m s c d kf kb and the parameters relative to the release τ n tstart λ m s λ m s c were varied simultaneously using a uniform distribution the boundaries of the parameters were chosen according to knowledge from bibliography results of experiments and observational studies table 2 the parameters contributing to more than 20 of the variance of a given model output were considered to have a strong influence on the output the sa was replicated on four urban sectors selected randomly in the north south east and west of the island to account for environmental variability model sensitivity was analyzed over 256 000 simulations only outputs with normally distributed variations were analyzed 2 3 5 release strategies release starting month we produced a map of the optimal release starting month for each output of malborun sit and malborun bsit model the release starting date tstart varied from january to december the optimal release starting month corresponds to the month for which the output values is maximum due to the inter annual weather variations the simulations were replicated for three years 2013 2014 2015 and since several operational urban sectors are connected to the same weather station the simulations were computed for only one sector per weather station selected randomly we have also performed an optimization in order to find the month that gives the best value for all model outputs to summarize information in only one map for this purpose we defined the function 4 f t s t a r t s y reduction rate y sterility rate y resilience y 365 emergence reduction y with s urban sectors y 2013 2015 the higher the values of all outputs of the models i e in terms of ae albopictus populations control for a given starting date tstart and urban sector s the lower the value of the function f tstart s it should be noted that the resilience was divided by 365 days so that any effect lasting more than one year had a strong influence a global and local optimization algorithm from the nloptr r package https cran r project org web packages nloptr index html was then used to minimize the function f tstart s number of sterile male released two strategies differing in the number of sterile male released each time malborun sit λ m s malborun bsit λ m s c were compared 1 in the first strategy both λ m s λ m s c and τ were constant during the control period ten λ m s and λ m s c values were tested from 1 to 10 times the sum of nulliparous and parous females at the beginning of the control period six τ were tested from 15 days down to 5 a total of 60 simulations were performed for an extended release control period of three or six month 2 in the second strategy λ m s and λ m s c values were proportional to the number of nulliparous and parous females at the release dates the values of λ m s λ m s c τ and the total number of simulations were similar to the first strategy the sit program has chosen one site for the their future sterile male release trials corresponding to one of the operational urban sectors in reunion island called duparc sector fig 1 we therefore selected this site to predict the impact of the two different release strategies on the control of the local population of ae albopictus for both sit and boosted sit methods 2 4 initialization and simulations models were implemented in r http www rproject org at t 0 the population consisted in 1000 eggs for each operational urban sectors simulations ran over 6 years we used the weather data from 2011 to 2016 as the input of the models the first year was not retained for outputs computation no sterile male has been released during the last year which allowed computing the time required for the ae albopictus population to recover its natural dynamics i e the resilience time in days 3 results the alborun model has been modified and simplified in order to model the effects of control methods malborun as in the original model malborun predicts the abundances of ae albopictus by stage eggs larvae pupae adults females and males over time for each operational urban sector using daily rainfall and temperature data over 6 consecutive years as entries the effects of the sit malborun sit and boosted sit malborun bsit were then introduced to predict and compare the impact of the two control strategies under different scenarios fig 5 3 1 malborun is consistent with the entomological data simulated mosquito abundances of the modified malborun model based on weather conditions are consistent with the entomological data collected at five locations in 2012 and 2013 in la reunion island fig 6 as in the original alborun model tran et al 2020 the predictions were strongly correlated with the observed abundances p value 0 001 at sites with higher larval densities and high seasonal variations correlation coefficients for saint paul 0 86 la possession 0 70 sainte marie 0 68 sainte suzanne 0 75 the correlation coefficient was lower 0 61 p value 0 06 for the eastern site st benoit where the observed abundances of ae albopictus was lower 20 larvae trap with few seasonal variations nevertheless the model reproduced the major trends in the intra annual population fluctuations for all sites abundances indeed show a peak occurring in march april at the end of the austral summer and a minimum at the end of the austral winter fig 5 3 2 the number of sterile males released their competitiveness and the timing of release are the key parameters of the control to assess the most influential parameters a sa was performed for the malborun sit and malborun bsit models we analyzed four model outputs the reduction rate the sterility rate the resilience time and the reduction of emergence see methods surprisingly it was shown that the resilience time i e the time required after the treatment stopped for a treated population to reach a size similar to a untreated population was not normally distributed this was due to the complete elimination of the population that was predicted for some parameters sets as the model was run on an isolated population without migration no resilience was possible to verify whether these elimination events were maintained in the presence of a limited migration or rather a no migration artifact we simulated the introduction of adult females into the population from one female every 40 days to five females per day a total of 12 simulations were performed fig 7 the results showed that even very low immigration was sufficient enough for the population to eventually return to its natural dynamics in sharp contrast with the elimination predicted in the no migration case it thus suggested that the local eliminations were indeed artifacts consequently we decided to perform another sa with the introduction of a few females one every 40 days as shown in fig 7 for both models the reduction rate relative to the number of females f n f p without control was not normally distributed and could therefore not be analyzed considering malborun sit model fig 8 a the competitiveness of the sterile males c was identified as the most influential parameter for both sterility rate and resilience 50 the number of sterile males released λ m s and the starting date of the control period tstart were the second most influential parameters ca 25 each for both outputs finally a strong effect of the number of releases n was detected on resilience mainly through interactive effects for the malborun bsit model fig 8b the results of the sa were slightly different while both the starting date of the control period tstart and the competitiveness of the sterile males c were the determinants of the sterility rate and remained influential on resilience c appeared less determinant than in malborun sit ca 25 similarly the number of sterile males released λ m s no longer had any influence however the number of releases n remained influential on resilience as well as two additional parameter the mortality rate of sterile males μ m s c and the expected duration of contamination at larval sites d we also assessed the main parameters influencing the observed differences in reduction rates between sit and boosted sit applications they were again explained mainly by tstart c and λ m s c rather which is surprising than by parameters specific to malborun bsit kf kb d ϕ finally two of these specific parameters had as expected a strong influence on the emergence ratio the proportion of pupae surviving pyriproxyfen ϕ and the expected duration of contamination at larval sites 1 d for both models the sa showed that there was a high impact of first order parameter interactions on the outputs for example during the control period an ae albopictus population reduction rate of 0 8 can be achieved either with c 0 6 and λms 2800 sterile males ha or with a competitiveness of c 0 4 and λms 4000 sterile males ha with the sit fig 10a similarly for boosted sit c 0 6 and λmsc 1200 or c 0 4 and λmsc 1800 achieve the same population reduction of 0 8 note that fewer males need to be released compared to sit fig 10b 3 3 boosted sit control should start later than sit as shown by the sa the starting date of the release of sterile males tstart was a key parameter for both sit and boosted sit a map was produced for each control method that shows the specific optimal tstart for each operational urban sectors that depends on local climatic conditions for sit fig 9 a and fig b1 the date to begin the release was optimal when the density of ae albopictus population was low thus on average in october at the end of the austral winter may october for boosted sit fig 9b and fig c1 the optimal date was postponed by several months on average in december when the population density of ae albopictus has already increased fig c1 3 4 boosted sit carries higher benefits when sterile males are poor competitors the other important parameters identified by the sa were competitiveness c and the number of sterile males released malborun sit λ m s malborun bsit λ m s c however these two parameters are in direct interaction the more competitive the sterile males are the fewer released males are needed to obtain similar results in terms of relative reduction rate or resilience although we plotted the impact of paramter c alone on ae albopictus population control with sit and boosted sit fig f1 and fig f2 it is more relevant to analyse the combined effect of c and λ m s c λ m s we first analyzed how this interaction impacts the reduction rate in female numbers f n f p for each control method independently fig 10a sit fig 10b boosted sit for both methods the reduction rate increased with c λ m s and λ m s c but the competitiveness was clearly the main determinant in order to assess the added benefits of the boosted sit method we also calculated the difference in the reduction rate between malborun sit and malborun bsit for various combinations fig 10c it appeared that the boosted sit was mostly beneficial when the sterile males were poor competitors but not too poor 0 17 c 0 4 we then analyzed how the interaction between the number of sterile males released and their competitiveness impacted the resilience time for each control method independently fig 11 a sit fig 11b boosted sit as for reduction rate and for both methods the resilience time increased with c λ m s and λ m s c but the competitiveness was again clearly the main determinant in order to assess the added benefits of the boosted sit method we also calculated the difference in resilience time between malborun sit and malborun bsit for various combinations fig 11c it appeared that boosted sit was again mostly beneficial when sterile males were poor competitors 3 5 constant releases are better than density dependent releases we compared the impact on reduction rates and resilience times for two control strategies differing in the number of sterile males released malborun sit λ m s malborun bsit λ m s c i a constant number during the control period and ii a number proportional to the number of adult females at the time of release the second release strategy has been proposed to reduce the rearing cost of the sterile males for both models the first strategy appeared more efficient the population was reduced to a greater extent and returned to its initial dynamics more slowly after the control period fig d1 however while the difference between the two release strategies was relatively small in terms of reduction rates the resilience time was much more affected since it was reduced by about 3 times with the second strategy for example for sit with n 7 days and λ m s 10 times the number of females the population was reduced by 95 and required 335 days to return to natural dynamics with constant releases while for proportional releases the population was decreased by 82 and only needed 92 days to return to natural dynamics similar results were obtained for boosted sit fig e1 4 discussion we developed a weather driven abundance model of ae albopictus at la reunion island malborun based on the alborun mechanistic model tran et al 2020 and integrated the effects of sit malborun sit and boosted sit malborun bsit on population dynamics these non autonomous models include the impact of temperature and rainfall which are two important drivers of the mosquito dynamics agusto et al 2015 delatte et al 2009 dieng et al 2012 kruijf et al 1973 roiz et al 2010 tran et al 2020 the predicted abundance of mosquito populations follows environmental fluctuations fig 5 and was consistent with entomological field collections fig 6 thus our models are adapted to areas with a high climatic spatial heterogeneity as it is the case in la reunion island to our knowledge these are the first models that integrate real weather data in order to analyze the effects of sit and boosted sit on mosquito populations non autonomous models were chosen because as white et al 2010 pointed out environmental data are of major importance to optimize these control strategies particularly to determine the optimal period for effective releases of sterile males fig h1 our results have indeed shown that the multitude of microclimates in la reunion island lead to different optimal starting months depending on the areas concerned by the release of sterile males fig 9 4 1 migration should be considered in future models according to our results both sit and boosted sit could lead to virtual elimination of ae albopictus populations in both models as the populations are modeled independently some sets of parameters induced a density equilibrium close to zero after treatment fig 7 nevertheless we have shown that this result is probably an artifact due to the non inclusion of mosquito dispersal in the models although lacroix et al 2009 has shown a relatively low dispersal ability for ae albopictus simulations showed that the introduction of even a tiny number of females would result in a rapid recovery of the mosquito population after the treatments fig 7 it is still possible that some allee effect not modelled here may be induced by the reduction in the number of successful mating when males densities become low this would increase the difficulty of finding a mate which would delay the population s regrowth and increase the probability of sustainable elimination after treatment li et al 2007 li and yuan 2015 strugarek et al 2019 nevertheless our results are consistent with a recent pilot trial of transgenic ae aegypti males releases in brazil which showed that the population had not been eliminated despite a significant decrease in wild mosquito populations during the control period garziera et al 2017 the future integration of adult mosquito migration into our model taking into account the heterogeneity of environment and its impact on migration rates would therefore be a crucial development to provide more accurate quantitative predictions dunning et al 1995 4 2 competitiveness vs number of released males equilibrium and control timing are crucial for sit efficiency according to the sa results for the malborun sit model the competitiveness and the quantity of sterile males released are the two most important parameters that determine the effective control of ae albopictus populations fig 8a similarly to previous findings by pleydell and bouyer 2019 appropriate combinations of these two parameters values could indeed lead to important population reductions fig 10 however other studies have shown that this competitiveness is highly variable depending on local conditions at the sterile males release sites e g bellini et al 2007 bellini et al 2013 madakacherry et al 2014 oliva et al 2012 thus an accurate estimate of this competitiveness in the environment where releases occur is necessary to improve the predictive capacity of the model and to assess the efficiency of this strategy in a particular field context as underlined by white et al 2010 reduced competitiveness of sterile males can be offset by larger releases fig 8 and our model allows an accurate estimate of this balance it should be noted that increasing the number of released males would entail additional and potentially high economic costs the starting month for the sterile males releases is also a crucial parameter for the sit control method fig 9 according to our results the best date corresponds to the end of the austral winter when the wild mosquito populations are at the lowest density as there are fewer wild competitors sterile males have a higher probability of mating with females dufourd and dumont 2012 huang et al 2017 white et al 2010 which may partly compensate their lower competitiveness however and despite the additional cost we have shown here that the full benefit of these early releases requires a significant and consistent number of sterile males from the start fig d1 rather than a number of males released proportionally to the number of wild adult females cai et al 2014 li and yuan 2015 again our model allows for accurate forecasts under various scenarios and can therefore help control agencies in making informed operational decisions 4 3 boosted sit could be an interesting improvement but some parameters need to be evaluated before implementation the malborun bsit model analyses showed that coating sterile males with pyriproxyfen could potentially improve the efficiency of the sit control the additional population reduction due to this boost is particularly strong up to 45 more than sit alone for sterile males with intermediate competitiveness i e 0 2 c 0 5 fig 10c it cannot compensate too poor males c 0 2 and provide lower improvements when they are already good competitors c 0 5 similarly boosted sit could significantly increase the population resilience time up to 75 more days again for males with intermediate competitiveness and for reasonable number released fig 11c this strategy would thus be most interesting in contexts where increasing the quality of the males released is difficult due to the direct effects of the sterilizing radiations and or the effects of mass rearing in production facilities however an estimation of the relative costs of the coating boost or of producing more males should be considered too and our model provides a reliable framework for such analyzes as for sit alone the timing of boosted sit implementation appears crucial the boost effects are more visible in early austral summer fig 9 this confirms the work of pleydell and bouyer 2019 who have shown that the boosted sit must be applied when the population begins to increase when the population is too low only a small amount of pyriproxyfen is transferred to females and therefore to breeding sites so that the boosting effect is lost it should be noted that in choosing conservative hypotheses for our study we did not consider direct contamination of breeding sites by males yet this contamination may occur as some ae aegypti males were found in sticky ovitraps ritchie et al 2003 direct contact of contaminated males with breeding sites could slightly increase the effectiveness of the pyriproxyfen transfer from females under these conditions mains et al 2015 however the obvious advantage of the boosted approach is that the starting date of releases is delayed consequently fewer releases are needed for a similar effect two other parameters appeared to be significant although much less important than the previous ones in the success of the boosted sit control method the duration of pyriproxyfen contamination of breeding sites confirming pleydell and bouyer 2019 and the proportion of pupae surviving pyriproxyfen both related to the dose of the contaminants crucially the relative importance of these two parameters actually highlights the limitations of our predictions although qualitatively robust our results should be taken with caution for quantitative predictions for several key parameters of the model there is indeed little or no empirical data mainly because the concept of boosted sit is recent several studies are currently in progress to improve the coating technique similarly the efficiency of the male female and female breeding sites contamination remains to be determined experimentally both in the laboratory and under natural conditions finally we did not consider the potential direct impacts of pyriproxyfen on female fecundity and or on the hatching rate which could modify the boosting effect some have been described but they appear to vary depending on the formulation of pyriproxyfen used dell chism and apperson 2003 itoh et al 1994 mbare et al 2013 unlu et al 2017 again additional experimental studies are needed to adjust the bsit model to more realistic conditions and provide quantitatively accurate predictions 4 4 sit and boosted sit should be part of integrated management strategies against aedes albopictus our study clearly shows that for realistic sets of key parameters sit could provide effective control of mosquito populations and that boosted sit could even improve this efficiency compared to the classical use of chemical insecticides boosted sit based on pyriproxyfen would be used in a very targeted way at very low doses moreover the contaminated mosquitoes are expected to specifically contaminate their small and mostly artificial breeding sites created and maintained by humans which should limit any risk of environmental contamination however as with any use of chemical insecticides the autodissemination of pyriproxifen to boost the sit can lead to the development of mosquito resistance tantely et al 2010 vontas et al 2012 zaim and guillet 2002 malborun bsit model provides a solid framework for studying the potential evolution of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations in order to prevent its occurrence or control its spread by optimizing the use of the boosted sit under various scenarios barbosa et al 2018 moreover if the coating with the pyriproxyfen is more advanced other candidates have been proposed like the use of natural biocides such as densovirus carlson et al 2006 again our model provides the appropriate framework for evaluating this method in silico sit and boosted sit are not the only alternative control methods available in the literature or in the field they are and should be considered as alternative tools in a broader set with complementary actions mass trapping of adult mosquitoes for example have shown promising results barrera et al 2017 degener et al 2014 while our study focused on sterile males release techniques pleydell and bouyer 2019 studied for example the effects of sit and boosted sit coupled with the disposition in the environment of artificial oviposition sites contaminated with pyriproxyfen autodissemination station interactions between different method controls used simultaneously or sequentially could be positive or negative barclay 1987 knipling 1979 and should be considered to optimize mosquito population control our mechanistic model that takes into account the different stages of the mosquito life cycle provides an appropriate framework for implementing and testing alternative mosquito control methods compared to or in combination with sit and boosted sit and would be a valuable tool to guide vector control policies it could also be coupled with an epidemic model to study the impact of control methods on the basic reproduction rate r0 of diseases e g danbaba and garba 2018a danbaba and garba 2018b dumont and chiroleu 2010 hendron and bonsall 2016 mishra et al 2018 5 conclusion the control of ae albopictus based on sterile males release techniques in la reunion island was modelled for the first time with a weather driven model validated by entomological field data the results show that sustainable control of ae albopictus populations is possible with sit but depends strongly on an equilibrium between the relative competitiveness of the sterile males compared to wild ones and the number of males released as well as on the starting month of the control it also showed that even low migration can affect population dynamics and should be taken into account and that it is preferable to carry out pulsed releases with a constant number of males released during the control period our study also showed promising results for boosted sit it can significantly improve the efficiency of sit when the sterile males released have a moderate competitiveness and allows for later and shorter control implementation our model provides a solid framework for the future development of operational tools to enable control agencies to make informed decisions particularly for the implementation of integrated management strategies to control arbovirus transmission credit authorship contribution statement marion haramboure methodology

24865,the sterile insect technique sit used to control insect populations consists of releasing males sterilized by ionizing radiations wild females that mate with these males can no longer produce viable offspring which may drives the population decline although this method has proved its efficiency its effect may be more limited for fast reproducing large population species such aedes albopictus a novel approach named boosted sit has been designed to strengthen the sit technique it consists of coating sterile males with a biocide that will be transferred to the mated females which will then contaminate the oviposition sites this study is aimed at exploring demographic effects of both techniques sit and boosted sit through their inclusion in a weather driven abundance model of the aedes albopictus population dynamics in the geographical context of la reunion island sensitivity analysis showed that the date to start the release as well as the quantity of sterile males released and their competitiveness are of key importance for both control methods according to our results boosted sit allows 1 increasing the effectiveness of the sit when the sterile males released are of medium quality in terms of competitiveness and 2 extending the optimal window to start the control period keywords sit boosted sit vector control pyriproxyfen population dynamics mosquito 1 introduction vector borne diseases account for about 17 of the estimated global burden of infectious diseases and are responsible for more than 700 000 deaths every year world health organization and unicef 2017 dengue is the most common and widespread arbovirus the number of dengue infections is estimated at 390 millions every year of which 96 million induce clinical symptoms of various severities bhatt et al 2013 dengue virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus aedes in particular ae albopictus and ae aegypti these species are also vectors of other arboviruses including zika and chikungunya the global distributions of these three arboviruses have recently expanded causing many severe disease outbreaks in urban human populations patterson et al 2016 different vaccines have been developed for dengue and zika but their efficacy remains to be studied musso and gubler 2016 who 2018 moreover no disease specific treatment for these arboviruses exists caglioti et al 2013 in this context mosquito control remains the cornerstone of disease prevention the tiger mosquito aedes stegomyia albopictus skuse diptera culicidae a species native to the forests of southeast asia smith 1956 has expanded its distribution by adapting to new sources of blood and environments its proximity with humans has enabled it to colonize new territories through international trade e g tire trade reiter 1998 although being less competent than its sister species ae aegypti to transmit dengue viruses paupy et al 2009 ae albopicus was the only vector involved in some recent dengue outbreaks gasperi et al 2012 paupy et al 2009 rezza 2012 wu et al 2010 for many mosquito borne diseases larvicides have demonstrated their efficiency to reduce transmission during outbreaks world health organization 2009 however ae albopictus uses multiple cryptic and dispersed breeding sites of all sorts tires beverage cans plastic items etc they are difficult to locate and treat which significantly hinders larvicides control of this vector connelly and carlson 2009 mobilization of the local communities to eliminate these diverse containers used by peridomestic ae albopictus could be an effective solution but changing attitudes and behaviors can take many years gubler and clark 1996 tapia conyer et al 2012 winch et al 1992 an integrated and sustainable control of ae albopictus is therefore necessary which cannot rely solely on the usual insecticide usage or the goodwill of local communities but must be supplemented by alternative treatment methods achee et al 2019 a promising alternative for such a cryptic breeding insect is the sterile insect technique sit it relies on the mass release of males sterilized by ionizing radiation since female mosquitoes are inseminated by only one male during their life with very rare exceptions mating with such males negates their reproductive success hence causing the target population to decline dunn and follett 2017 flores and o neill 2018 sit has been shown to be effective in eradicating tsetse flies vreysen et al 2014 screwworms wyss 2000 and medflies enkerlin et al 2017 in the case of mosquito control success has been more variable although particularly good results have been obtained in italy bellini et al 2013 and more recently in china in combination with the incompatible insect technique iit zheng et al 2019 indeed mosquito populations are generally very large and a significant reduction in their population therefore requires the release of a large number of sterile males whom breeding sorting from females and irradiating are costly an efficacy improving upgrade named boosted sit has recently been proposed bouyer et al 2016 bouyer and lefrançois 2014 its rationale is that the released males are the best available vectors to contaminate females with toxic agents that could be further disseminated to other compartments of the target population by self dissemination it has been proposed to coat the sterilized males with pyriproxyfen an insect growth regulator that prevents the emergence of adult mosquito from the aquatic pupae invest and lucas 2008 maoz et al 2017 the insecticide could be transferred to females by mating which in turn could specifically contaminate their breeding sites by using females themselves as insecticide vectors boosted sit could therefore drastically improve control of species with cryptic breeding habits such as ae albopictus however many questions remain such as the number of males to be released for efficient control or the magnitude of the potential boosting effect both depend on the duration of contamination of breeding sites no consensus appears in the bibliography invest and lucas 2008 and on the effectiveness of pyriproxyfen transfers from males to females and from females to breeding sites parameters for which empirical data are not available yet in cases empirical data are lacking mathematical models are often useful for planning mosquito population management strategies they can be used to understand and predict population density in relation to environmental variations ewing et al 2016 ezanno et al 2015 roche et al 2015 tran et al 2013 and to anticipate the effects of population management measures under various scenarios cailly et al 2012 in the case of sit such theoretical models have been developed in order to 1 optimize the strategies of sterile males releases almeida et al 2019 cai et al 2014 evans and bishop 2014 huang et al 2017 li and yuan 2015 multerer et al 2019 white et al 2010 2 study the impact of the environment on sit dufourd and dumont 2013 maiti et al 2006 mishra et al 2018 and 3 evaluate the effect of sit coupled with standard use of insecticides fister et al 2013 hendron and bonsall 2016 a recently published model by pleydell and bouyer 2019 specifically studied the efficacy gain of boosted versus standard sit in a theoretical population their results suggest that boosted sit could drastically reduce the required number of males released however to our knowledge none of these models have studied the effects of sit or boosted sit on ae albopictus populations under realistic environmental conditions the objectives of the present study were thus 1 to evaluate the efficacy gain of boosted sit in real geographical and climatic conditions with the example of la reunion island a tropical island where ae albopictus is the main chikungunya and dengue vector delatte et al 2008 and 2 to optimize sit and boosted sit strategies in this context between 2005 and 2006 reunion island was affected by a large chikungunya epidemic with more than 38 of the population infected ars and ivs 2010 an epidemic of dengue is currently spreading with more than 24 300 indigenous cases as of july 01 2019 ars and préfecture réunion 2019 located in the indian ocean between madagascar and mauritius la reunion island is a small volcanic island 2512 km2 with a mountainous topography aedes albopictus mosquitoes are mainly found at low elevations in urban and peri urban areas boyer et al 2014 moreover the island is characterized by an east west precipitation gradient ranging from a maximal annual rainfall of 15 931 mm recorded in the eastern part to a minimal annual rainfall of 183 mm in the west météo france 2019 the island is characterized by two seasons with a hot and wet austral summer from november to march and a rather mild and dry winter la reunion island with its diverse landscapes and contrasting climate is thus an excellent place to study the impact of control methods against ae albopictus in a realistic variable environment moreover since the severe 2005 2006 chikungunya epidemic ae albopictus populations have been regularly monitored by the regional health agency a deterministic model of ae albopictus population dynamics has been recently developed by tran et al 2020 and validated using these extensive entomological data this model realistically integrates the climatic variations of la reunion island on the ae albopictus population dynamics tran et al 2013 i temperature impacts the development time of aquatic stages and the mortality of larvae pupae and adults ii rainfalls positively impact the number of available breeding sites and the environmental carrying capacity iii heavy rainfalls impact the mortality rates of aquatic stages by flooding the breeding habitats dieng et al 2012 this model is currently used by the regional health agency as a tool for decision support called alborun tran et al 2020 in the present study we modified this alborun population dynamic model to integrate the potential effects of sit and boosted sit on the ae albopictus populations in la reunion island after controlling its accuracy on the same entomological data used in tran et al 2020 we first performed a global sensitivity analysis to identify the key parameters affecting the efficacy of sit and boosted sit we then assessed the optimal timing for both control methods under a tropical environment taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of micro climates in la reunion island to produce a detailed map of the locally optimal starting months of the control period finally we studied the effects of two different sterile males release strategies constant or density dependent on ae albopictus populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is delimited by 1203 operational urban sectors defined by the vector control service of the regional health agency 31 weather stations of the french meteorological service at la reunion island provide the daily average temperature and rainfall intensity records from 2011 to 2016 each operational urban sector is associated with the nearest weather station fig 1 2 2 weather driven abundance model to simulate ae albopictus population dynamics we modified the alborun mechanistic model tran et al 2020 alborun computes the densities of the different stages of ae albopictus life cycle aquatic eggs e larvae l pupae p and aerial emerging females fem nulliparous females fn parous females fp using a system of ordinary differential equations ode parous females are females that have taken a blood meal and oviposited at least once whereas nulliparous females did not yet lay eggs nulliparous and parous females are both again divided into three compartments according to the gonotrophic cycle distinguishing between host seeking females engorged females and females seeking a breeding site in total the model is composed of 10 compartments it thus makes it possible to compute independently and simultaneously the population dynamics in each operational urban sector the alborun outputs have been validated using entomological field data from la reunion island tran et al 2020 in the present study alborun was modified to assess effects of sit and boosted sit control strategies fig 2 1 as these strategies are based on the release of sterile males a specific male compartment m was explicitly included it computes the number of wild males available for mating with females 2 the number of compartments was reduced to avoid over parametrization the sub compartments for nulliparous and parous females were thus aggregated into a single compartment each nulliparous females fn parous females fp the modified model called malborun

cailly et al 2012 larval mortality ml is similarly increased when their density l increases parameters and functions are similar to the alborun model by tran et al 2020 table 1 due to the aggregation

alborun i e the density of mosquitoes for each compartment in addition the malborun ff value was obtained by summing the times spent by the nulliparous and parous females in the host seeking blood feeding and breeding site seeking compartments in alborun for each time step malborun predicts the abundance of ae albopictus for the seven stages and for each operational urban sectors the model was further validated using the entomological data from tran et al 2020 i e a longitudinal study on the larval stages of ae albopictus at five northern sites in 2012 and 2013 a spearman test was performed to assess the correlation coefficient between the observed larvae abundances and those predicted by the model 2 3 modelling the effects of control methods 2 3 1 sit model malborun eq 1 fig 2 was then

released males whether still coated with pyriproxyfen msc or having lost their coating ms are sterile and can therefore sterilize females as in malborun sit the reproductive status of emerging females

limited period of time d 2 3 3 models outputs at each time step the models predict the abundance of ae albopictus for each stage and for each operational urban sector moreover four synthetic model outputs were computed to assess the impact of both sit and boosted sit methods on the mosquito population fig a1 1 the reduction rate was calculated as the size of females f n f p during the control period divided by i the size of females without control to evaluate the effect of the sit and ii the size of females during the sit control to evaluate the added effect of the boosted sit 2 the sterility rate was defined as the number of sterile females fs divided by the total number of fertilized females f n f p f s during the control period 3 the resilience corresponds to the time required to return to the natural dynamics it was calculated as the number of days required after a treatment period for the controlled population to reach the same abundance as a uncontrolled population 4 the reduction of emergence was estimated as the ratio between the number of pupae present in contaminated breeding sites that became adults during the boosted sit control and the number of pupae that became adults in a similar but uncontrolled population 2 3 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis sa was performed on the four synthetic outputs using the variance based method of fourier amplitude sensitivity test saltelli et al 2000 with the sensitivity r package https cran r project org web packages sensitivity index html the parameters of malborun sit μ m s c malborun bsit μ m s c d kf kb and the parameters relative to the release τ n tstart λ m s λ m s c were varied simultaneously using a uniform distribution the boundaries of the parameters were chosen according to knowledge from bibliography results of experiments and observational studies table 2 the parameters contributing to more than 20 of the variance of a given model output were considered to have a strong influence on the output the sa was replicated on four urban sectors selected randomly in the north south east and west of the island to account for environmental variability model sensitivity was analyzed over 256 000 simulations only outputs with normally distributed variations were analyzed 2 3 5 release strategies release starting month we produced a map of the optimal release starting month for each output of malborun sit and malborun bsit model the release starting date tstart varied from january to december the optimal release starting month corresponds to the month for which the output values is maximum due to the inter annual weather variations the simulations were replicated for three years 2013 2014 2015 and since several operational urban sectors are connected to the same weather station the simulations were computed for only one sector per weather station selected randomly we have also performed an optimization in order to find the month that gives the best value for all model outputs to summarize information in only one map for this purpose we defined the function 4 f t s t a r t s y reduction rate y sterility rate y resilience y 365 emergence reduction y with s urban sectors y 2013 2015 the higher the values of all outputs of the models i e in terms of ae albopictus populations control for a given starting date tstart and urban sector s the lower the value of the function f tstart s it should be noted that the resilience was divided by 365 days so that any effect lasting more than one year had a strong influence a global and local optimization algorithm from the nloptr r package https cran r project org web packages nloptr index html was then used to minimize the function f tstart s number of sterile male released two strategies differing in the number of sterile male released each time malborun sit λ m s malborun bsit λ m s c were compared 1 in the first strategy both λ m s λ m s c and τ were constant during the control period ten λ m s and λ m s c values were tested from 1 to 10 times the sum of nulliparous and parous females at the beginning of the control period six τ were tested from 15 days down to 5 a total of 60 simulations were performed for an extended release control period of three or six month 2 in the second strategy λ m s and λ m s c values were proportional to the number of nulliparous and parous females at the release dates the values of λ m s λ m s c τ and the total number of simulations were similar to the first strategy the sit program has chosen one site for the their future sterile male release trials corresponding to one of the operational urban sectors in reunion island called duparc sector fig 1 we therefore selected this site to predict the impact of the two different release strategies on the control of the local population of ae albopictus for both sit and boosted sit methods 2 4 initialization and simulations models were implemented in r http www rproject org at t 0 the population consisted in 1000 eggs for each operational urban sectors simulations ran over 6 years we used the weather data from 2011 to 2016 as the input of the models the first year was not retained for outputs computation no sterile male has been released during the last year which allowed computing the time required for the ae albopictus population to recover its natural dynamics i e the resilience time in days 3 results the alborun model has been modified and simplified in order to model the effects of control methods malborun as in the original model malborun predicts the abundances of ae albopictus by stage eggs larvae pupae adults females and males over time for each operational urban sector using daily rainfall and temperature data over 6 consecutive years as entries the effects of the sit malborun sit and boosted sit malborun bsit were then introduced to predict and compare the impact of the two control strategies under different scenarios fig 5 3 1 malborun is consistent with the entomological data simulated mosquito abundances of the modified malborun model based on weather conditions are consistent with the entomological data collected at five locations in 2012 and 2013 in la reunion island fig 6 as in the original alborun model tran et al 2020 the predictions were strongly correlated with the observed abundances p value 0 001 at sites with higher larval densities and high seasonal variations correlation coefficients for saint paul 0 86 la possession 0 70 sainte marie 0 68 sainte suzanne 0 75 the correlation coefficient was lower 0 61 p value 0 06 for the eastern site st benoit where the observed abundances of ae albopictus was lower 20 larvae trap with few seasonal variations nevertheless the model reproduced the major trends in the intra annual population fluctuations for all sites abundances indeed show a peak occurring in march april at the end of the austral summer and a minimum at the end of the austral winter fig 5 3 2 the number of sterile males released their competitiveness and the timing of release are the key parameters of the control to assess the most influential parameters a sa was performed for the malborun sit and malborun bsit models we analyzed four model outputs the reduction rate the sterility rate the resilience time and the reduction of emergence see methods surprisingly it was shown that the resilience time i e the time required after the treatment stopped for a treated population to reach a size similar to a untreated population was not normally distributed this was due to the complete elimination of the population that was predicted for some parameters sets as the model was run on an isolated population without migration no resilience was possible to verify whether these elimination events were maintained in the presence of a limited migration or rather a no migration artifact we simulated the introduction of adult females into the population from one female every 40 days to five females per day a total of 12 simulations were performed fig 7 the results showed that even very low immigration was sufficient enough for the population to eventually return to its natural dynamics in sharp contrast with the elimination predicted in the no migration case it thus suggested that the local eliminations were indeed artifacts consequently we decided to perform another sa with the introduction of a few females one every 40 days as shown in fig 7 for both models the reduction rate relative to the number of females f n f p without control was not normally distributed and could therefore not be analyzed considering malborun sit model fig 8 a the competitiveness of the sterile males c was identified as the most influential parameter for both sterility rate and resilience 50 the number of sterile males released λ m s and the starting date of the control period tstart were the second most influential parameters ca 25 each for both outputs finally a strong effect of the number of releases n was detected on resilience mainly through interactive effects for the malborun bsit model fig 8b the results of the sa were slightly different while both the starting date of the control period tstart and the competitiveness of the sterile males c were the determinants of the sterility rate and remained influential on resilience c appeared less determinant than in malborun sit ca 25 similarly the number of sterile males released λ m s no longer had any influence however the number of releases n remained influential on resilience as well as two additional parameter the mortality rate of sterile males μ m s c and the expected duration of contamination at larval sites d we also assessed the main parameters influencing the observed differences in reduction rates between sit and boosted sit applications they were again explained mainly by tstart c and λ m s c rather which is surprising than by parameters specific to malborun bsit kf kb d ϕ finally two of these specific parameters had as expected a strong influence on the emergence ratio the proportion of pupae surviving pyriproxyfen ϕ and the expected duration of contamination at larval sites 1 d for both models the sa showed that there was a high impact of first order parameter interactions on the outputs for example during the control period an ae albopictus population reduction rate of 0 8 can be achieved either with c 0 6 and λms 2800 sterile males ha or with a competitiveness of c 0 4 and λms 4000 sterile males ha with the sit fig 10a similarly for boosted sit c 0 6 and λmsc 1200 or c 0 4 and λmsc 1800 achieve the same population reduction of 0 8 note that fewer males need to be released compared to sit fig 10b 3 3 boosted sit control should start later than sit as shown by the sa the starting date of the release of sterile males tstart was a key parameter for both sit and boosted sit a map was produced for each control method that shows the specific optimal tstart for each operational urban sectors that depends on local climatic conditions for sit fig 9 a and fig b1 the date to begin the release was optimal when the density of ae albopictus population was low thus on average in october at the end of the austral winter may october for boosted sit fig 9b and fig c1 the optimal date was postponed by several months on average in december when the population density of ae albopictus has already increased fig c1 3 4 boosted sit carries higher benefits when sterile males are poor competitors the other important parameters identified by the sa were competitiveness c and the number of sterile males released malborun sit λ m s malborun bsit λ m s c however these two parameters are in direct interaction the more competitive the sterile males are the fewer released males are needed to obtain similar results in terms of relative reduction rate or resilience although we plotted the impact of paramter c alone on ae albopictus population control with sit and boosted sit fig f1 and fig f2 it is more relevant to analyse the combined effect of c and λ m s c λ m s we first analyzed how this interaction impacts the reduction rate in female numbers f n f p for each control method independently fig 10a sit fig 10b boosted sit for both methods the reduction rate increased with c λ m s and λ m s c but the competitiveness was clearly the main determinant in order to assess the added benefits of the boosted sit method we also calculated the difference in the reduction rate between malborun sit and malborun bsit for various combinations fig 10c it appeared that the boosted sit was mostly beneficial when the sterile males were poor competitors but not too poor 0 17 c 0 4 we then analyzed how the interaction between the number of sterile males released and their competitiveness impacted the resilience time for each control method independently fig 11 a sit fig 11b boosted sit as for reduction rate and for both methods the resilience time increased with c λ m s and λ m s c but the competitiveness was again clearly the main determinant in order to assess the added benefits of the boosted sit method we also calculated the difference in resilience time between malborun sit and malborun bsit for various combinations fig 11c it appeared that boosted sit was again mostly beneficial when sterile males were poor competitors 3 5 constant releases are better than density dependent releases we compared the impact on reduction rates and resilience times for two control strategies differing in the number of sterile males released malborun sit λ m s malborun bsit λ m s c i a constant number during the control period and ii a number proportional to the number of adult females at the time of release the second release strategy has been proposed to reduce the rearing cost of the sterile males for both models the first strategy appeared more efficient the population was reduced to a greater extent and returned to its initial dynamics more slowly after the control period fig d1 however while the difference between the two release strategies was relatively small in terms of reduction rates the resilience time was much more affected since it was reduced by about 3 times with the second strategy for example for sit with n 7 days and λ m s 10 times the number of females the population was reduced by 95 and required 335 days to return to natural dynamics with constant releases while for proportional releases the population was decreased by 82 and only needed 92 days to return to natural dynamics similar results were obtained for boosted sit fig e1 4 discussion we developed a weather driven abundance model of ae albopictus at la reunion island malborun based on the alborun mechanistic model tran et al 2020 and integrated the effects of sit malborun sit and boosted sit malborun bsit on population dynamics these non autonomous models include the impact of temperature and rainfall which are two important drivers of the mosquito dynamics agusto et al 2015 delatte et al 2009 dieng et al 2012 kruijf et al 1973 roiz et al 2010 tran et al 2020 the predicted abundance of mosquito populations follows environmental fluctuations fig 5 and was consistent with entomological field collections fig 6 thus our models are adapted to areas with a high climatic spatial heterogeneity as it is the case in la reunion island to our knowledge these are the first models that integrate real weather data in order to analyze the effects of sit and boosted sit on mosquito populations non autonomous models were chosen because as white et al 2010 pointed out environmental data are of major importance to optimize these control strategies particularly to determine the optimal period for effective releases of sterile males fig h1 our results have indeed shown that the multitude of microclimates in la reunion island lead to different optimal starting months depending on the areas concerned by the release of sterile males fig 9 4 1 migration should be considered in future models according to our results both sit and boosted sit could lead to virtual elimination of ae albopictus populations in both models as the populations are modeled independently some sets of parameters induced a density equilibrium close to zero after treatment fig 7 nevertheless we have shown that this result is probably an artifact due to the non inclusion of mosquito dispersal in the models although lacroix et al 2009 has shown a relatively low dispersal ability for ae albopictus simulations showed that the introduction of even a tiny number of females would result in a rapid recovery of the mosquito population after the treatments fig 7 it is still possible that some allee effect not modelled here may be induced by the reduction in the number of successful mating when males densities become low this would increase the difficulty of finding a mate which would delay the population s regrowth and increase the probability of sustainable elimination after treatment li et al 2007 li and yuan 2015 strugarek et al 2019 nevertheless our results are consistent with a recent pilot trial of transgenic ae aegypti males releases in brazil which showed that the population had not been eliminated despite a significant decrease in wild mosquito populations during the control period garziera et al 2017 the future integration of adult mosquito migration into our model taking into account the heterogeneity of environment and its impact on migration rates would therefore be a crucial development to provide more accurate quantitative predictions dunning et al 1995 4 2 competitiveness vs number of released males equilibrium and control timing are crucial for sit efficiency according to the sa results for the malborun sit model the competitiveness and the quantity of sterile males released are the two most important parameters that determine the effective control of ae albopictus populations fig 8a similarly to previous findings by pleydell and bouyer 2019 appropriate combinations of these two parameters values could indeed lead to important population reductions fig 10 however other studies have shown that this competitiveness is highly variable depending on local conditions at the sterile males release sites e g bellini et al 2007 bellini et al 2013 madakacherry et al 2014 oliva et al 2012 thus an accurate estimate of this competitiveness in the environment where releases occur is necessary to improve the predictive capacity of the model and to assess the efficiency of this strategy in a particular field context as underlined by white et al 2010 reduced competitiveness of sterile males can be offset by larger releases fig 8 and our model allows an accurate estimate of this balance it should be noted that increasing the number of released males would entail additional and potentially high economic costs the starting month for the sterile males releases is also a crucial parameter for the sit control method fig 9 according to our results the best date corresponds to the end of the austral winter when the wild mosquito populations are at the lowest density as there are fewer wild competitors sterile males have a higher probability of mating with females dufourd and dumont 2012 huang et al 2017 white et al 2010 which may partly compensate their lower competitiveness however and despite the additional cost we have shown here that the full benefit of these early releases requires a significant and consistent number of sterile males from the start fig d1 rather than a number of males released proportionally to the number of wild adult females cai et al 2014 li and yuan 2015 again our model allows for accurate forecasts under various scenarios and can therefore help control agencies in making informed operational decisions 4 3 boosted sit could be an interesting improvement but some parameters need to be evaluated before implementation the malborun bsit model analyses showed that coating sterile males with pyriproxyfen could potentially improve the efficiency of the sit control the additional population reduction due to this boost is particularly strong up to 45 more than sit alone for sterile males with intermediate competitiveness i e 0 2 c 0 5 fig 10c it cannot compensate too poor males c 0 2 and provide lower improvements when they are already good competitors c 0 5 similarly boosted sit could significantly increase the population resilience time up to 75 more days again for males with intermediate competitiveness and for reasonable number released fig 11c this strategy would thus be most interesting in contexts where increasing the quality of the males released is difficult due to the direct effects of the sterilizing radiations and or the effects of mass rearing in production facilities however an estimation of the relative costs of the coating boost or of producing more males should be considered too and our model provides a reliable framework for such analyzes as for sit alone the timing of boosted sit implementation appears crucial the boost effects are more visible in early austral summer fig 9 this confirms the work of pleydell and bouyer 2019 who have shown that the boosted sit must be applied when the population begins to increase when the population is too low only a small amount of pyriproxyfen is transferred to females and therefore to breeding sites so that the boosting effect is lost it should be noted that in choosing conservative hypotheses for our study we did not consider direct contamination of breeding sites by males yet this contamination may occur as some ae aegypti males were found in sticky ovitraps ritchie et al 2003 direct contact of contaminated males with breeding sites could slightly increase the effectiveness of the pyriproxyfen transfer from females under these conditions mains et al 2015 however the obvious advantage of the boosted approach is that the starting date of releases is delayed consequently fewer releases are needed for a similar effect two other parameters appeared to be significant although much less important than the previous ones in the success of the boosted sit control method the duration of pyriproxyfen contamination of breeding sites confirming pleydell and bouyer 2019 and the proportion of pupae surviving pyriproxyfen both related to the dose of the contaminants crucially the relative importance of these two parameters actually highlights the limitations of our predictions although qualitatively robust our results should be taken with caution for quantitative predictions for several key parameters of the model there is indeed little or no empirical data mainly because the concept of boosted sit is recent several studies are currently in progress to improve the coating technique similarly the efficiency of the male female and female breeding sites contamination remains to be determined experimentally both in the laboratory and under natural conditions finally we did not consider the potential direct impacts of pyriproxyfen on female fecundity and or on the hatching rate which could modify the boosting effect some have been described but they appear to vary depending on the formulation of pyriproxyfen used dell chism and apperson 2003 itoh et al 1994 mbare et al 2013 unlu et al 2017 again additional experimental studies are needed to adjust the bsit model to more realistic conditions and provide quantitatively accurate predictions 4 4 sit and boosted sit should be part of integrated management strategies against aedes albopictus our study clearly shows that for realistic sets of key parameters sit could provide effective control of mosquito populations and that boosted sit could even improve this efficiency compared to the classical use of chemical insecticides boosted sit based on pyriproxyfen would be used in a very targeted way at very low doses moreover the contaminated mosquitoes are expected to specifically contaminate their small and mostly artificial breeding sites created and maintained by humans which should limit any risk of environmental contamination however as with any use of chemical insecticides the autodissemination of pyriproxifen to boost the sit can lead to the development of mosquito resistance tantely et al 2010 vontas et al 2012 zaim and guillet 2002 malborun bsit model provides a solid framework for studying the potential evolution of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations in order to prevent its occurrence or control its spread by optimizing the use of the boosted sit under various scenarios barbosa et al 2018 moreover if the coating with the pyriproxyfen is more advanced other candidates have been proposed like the use of natural biocides such as densovirus carlson et al 2006 again our model provides the appropriate framework for evaluating this method in silico sit and boosted sit are not the only alternative control methods available in the literature or in the field they are and should be considered as alternative tools in a broader set with complementary actions mass trapping of adult mosquitoes for example have shown promising results barrera et al 2017 degener et al 2014 while our study focused on sterile males release techniques pleydell and bouyer 2019 studied for example the effects of sit and boosted sit coupled with the disposition in the environment of artificial oviposition sites contaminated with pyriproxyfen autodissemination station interactions between different method controls used simultaneously or sequentially could be positive or negative barclay 1987 knipling 1979 and should be considered to optimize mosquito population control our mechanistic model that takes into account the different stages of the mosquito life cycle provides an appropriate framework for implementing and testing alternative mosquito control methods compared to or in combination with sit and boosted sit and would be a valuable tool to guide vector control policies it could also be coupled with an epidemic model to study the impact of control methods on the basic reproduction rate r0 of diseases e g danbaba and garba 2018a danbaba and garba 2018b dumont and chiroleu 2010 hendron and bonsall 2016 mishra et al 2018 5 conclusion the control of ae albopictus based on sterile males release techniques in la reunion island was modelled for the first time with a weather driven model validated by entomological field data the results show that sustainable control of ae albopictus populations is possible with sit but depends strongly on an equilibrium between the relative competitiveness of the sterile males compared to wild ones and the number of males released as well as on the starting month of the control it also showed that even low migration can affect population dynamics and should be taken into account and that it is preferable to carry out pulsed releases with a constant number of males released during the control period our study also showed promising results for boosted sit it can significantly improve the efficiency of sit when the sterile males released have a moderate competitiveness and allows for later and shorter control implementation our model provides a solid framework for the future development of operational tools to enable control agencies to make informed decisions particularly for the implementation of integrated management strategies to control arbovirus transmission credit authorship contribution statement marion haramboure methodology

24866,size advantage hypothesis models sah allow an understanding of which sex occurs first and when the sex is changed in hermaphrodite species through the optimal allocation of energy in terms of male versus female roles whereas sex allocation depends directly on how an organism allocates energy throughout its lifetime the dynamic energy budget theory deb describes the uptake and use of energy

or the structural length l v 1 3 its reserve energy e and its maturity eh seen as a cumulative energy allocated to the maturity we consider the structural length at the time of a sex change as an evolutionary trait we use alternatively the term size and length for the structural length note that deb theory uses the term of length and sex allocation theory uses the term size we note that generally the term length refers to the structural length however size refers to observed individual size for consistency with the deb theory we define the size of a sex change l change i i for individual as the structural length at which the individual changes sex ghiselin 1969 warner 1988 new offspring inherit l change i from their parents through reproduction we also introduce two additional state variables specific to the aging sub model namely damage inducing compounds q acceleration and damage h hazard kooijman 2010 see tables 1 3 and 4 for a summary of deb state variables and parameters the transition from one life stage to another is based on the maturation and is quantified based on the amount of energy allocated to maturity denoted as eh indeed transition from embryo to juvenile stage occurs when the maturity reaches the birth threshold e h b in the same way the transition to adult stage is marked by a puberty threshold e h p 2 3 process overview and scheduling to simulate a reproductive pattern the year is divided into periods breeding mating period from june to september marino et al 2000 pre reproductive period from april to may and free period where individuals do not reproduce the rest of the year the simulation time step represents one day in each time step individuals feed and use up taken energy to run their metabolic processes somatic maintenance growth maturity maintenance maturity or reproduction the individual deb state variables v e and eh are then updated following the deb standard model differential equations see subsection 2 5 3 and appendix a kooijman 2010 if the individual can no longer pay somatic maintenance costs it dies martin et al 2012 otherwise it reaches the next life stage if the maturity level allows it see fig 2 along adulthood the individual accumulates energy in its reproduction buffers during the pre reproduction period depending on its size each individual checks whether it can change sex i e if l l change i during the breeding season females mate once with one of the bigger in size males and all of their eggs are fertilized by the same partner whereas males mate with all females who choose them during the free period individuals do not interact and share only food resources at each time step the following algorithm is run 2 4 design concepts 2 4 1 basic principles we use the standard deb model with the aging module kooijman 2010 and extend it based on sex allocation theory assuming that sex change occurs only once at a fixed size from female to male we suppose that females choose the largest male available for reproduction in their entourage e g lekking types mating thus a male can reproduce several times per breeding season while females reproduce only once therefore standard deviation of the number of progeny per male can be greater than that of females 2 4 2 adaptation and emergence the life history traits of the population emerge from the properties of metabolic organization and indirect interactions of individuals via partner choice moreover we suppose that size at sex change l change i is an adaptive trait that is genetically coded transmitted by the parents to their descendants who inherit the mean parents size of sex change furthermore couples are formed in preference to size the females choose in their neighborhood a male larger than herself therefore an individual with large l change i value will turns into male later allowing it to reproduce more as a female if we suppose that females always reproduce its offspring number will depend only on its gamete production otherwise individual with a small l change i value will turns into male earlier and can reproduce many time per breading season but with small mating probability particularly if the male density is large as offspring inherits the mean parents size of sex change these two antagonistic phenomena allow the emergence of a trade off property for l change i the initial state of the process begins with a uniformly distributed l change i between puberty and lmax the model does not include adaptive behavior in particular deb parameters and l change i vary among individuals but remain constant over an individual s lifespan consequently the design concepts objectives learning and prediction do not apply to this model 2 4 3 sensing individuals know their physiological parameters and have complete information regarding the size of other individuals within the neighbourhood radius as defined by the vision parameter 2 4 4 stochasticity beyond the breeding season adults move randomly through space by at most one spatial units e g grid cells per time unit however at the beginning of the spawning period males stop moving whereas sexually active females continue moving until they find a partner lay eggs and finally become sexually inactive moreover in order to investigate sensitivity regarding mating choice stochasticity was introduced in the female mating choice see paragraph 2 5 3 2 4 5 collectives we do not assume any collective behavior or any form of aggregation the individual level is the only level represented in hermadeb 2 4 6 interactions during the reproduction period males and females interact to give birth to offspring we assume that females are selective and choose an available male within neighbourhood radius as defined by the vision parameter i e partner sexual choice see paragraph 2 5 3 2 4 7 model output we annually report the population mean sex change size l change p p for population as the mean of l change i over the entire population we note that sex change size cannot be reached if the individual dies too soon we also report male population mean size at sex change called l change male as the average l change i among male individuals i e l change male l change p male sex ratio 1 ρ with ρ f e m a l e l i m a l e l i moreover at the end of each simulation we report mean population ratio between the sex change size and maximum size l r a t i o p i e mean over population of l change i l m a x we also monitor the population density and sex ratio and annual offspring count the simulations stop when l change p stabilizes i e l change p y l change p y 1 10 5 where y indicates the year each simulation is repeated and for each measured variable η we note η p as the mean population value across the simulation 2 5 details 2 5 1 initialization at the beginning of the simulation 100 embryos are introduced into the models with species specific estimated deb parameters multiplied by a log normally randomly distributed number lower than 0 1 in order to provide inter individual variability in size and in gamete production for the parameters g u h b and u h p field data did not allow us to evaluate the intra individual variability of these parameters therefore the choice of the value 0 1 is arbitrary moreover individual sex change size l change i is set randomly between the size at puberty and the maximum size this enables the sex change size distribution to cover all possibilities of size from puberty early period of male individual up to the maximum size entire lifetime of the female the deb parameters are estimated using debtool based on a set of primary parameters collected from the literature see table 2 we compared the input data using a hermaphrodite sex history database allsop and west 2003 and conducted a sensitivity analysis study on the estimated deb parameters see section 2 6 2 5 2 input data the model does not include input data representing external driving processes 2 5 3 sub models from a physiological perspective the individual is seen as the result of its physiological processes which are susceptible to influence ecological interactions increase in structure growth and somatic maintenance maturation reproduction and maturity maintenance and survival probability aging kooijman 2010 we group the processes into two main sub models first update deb state variables sub model which aims to calculate and update the physiological processes feeding assimilation reserve dynamics aging mortality rate and gamete production see fig 4 second ecological sub model which aims to model mating process find a partner and reproduce process see fig 3 sub model 1 update deb state variables processes 2 5 3 0 1 metabolic processes are governed by the deb model at each time step energy is taken from the reserve to power metabolic processes of the organism for the juvenile and adult stages the amount of energy in reserve is calculated by adding the assimilated energy amount and removing the mobilized energy needed let κ be the fraction of the mobilized reserve is used for somatic maintenance plus growth and the rest 1 κ for maturity maintenance plus maturation in juveniles or reproduction in adults see fig 1 following kooijman 2010 the equation of the reserve dynamics is as follows 1 d e d t f x e p m κ e m l where x is the scaled food density in the environment e is the scaled energy density l is the scaled structural length l lm see table 3 and κ is the fraction of mobilized reserve allocated to soma see table 3 for all parameter definitions the dot indicates the rate represents 1 l 3 and is used for 1 l 2 a fraction κ of the mobilized energy flux p c is divided between somatic maintenance and growth thus the increase in size can be written kooijman 2010 as 2 d l d t 1 3 k m e l 1 e g aging is due to the secondary effects of respiration through reactive oxygen species the amount of accumulated oxidation damage determines the survival rate δ and can be written as kooijman 2010 d δ d t δ h with h the specific death probability rate depending on the aging acceleration scaled density of damage q and r being the growth rate i e 3 d h d t q r h d q d t q l 3 s g h a e v l r r q 2 5 3 0 2 gamete production energy to initiate gamete production is taken from the reproductive buffer filled during the period between two mating periods see fig 5 let u h p be the required energy for gamete production at puberty the energy allocated to maturation in embryos and juveniles uh is redirected toward reproduction u h u h p the equation of scaled maturity density dynamic for u h u h p is 4 d u h d t k m u h 1 κ e l 2 g l g e k u h at puberty a proportion κr of the energy allocated to reproduction is used for gamete production the rest 1 κ r is dissipated in the additional reproduction costs e g courtship and sexual competition if the energy cost of one gamete is e 0 γ measured in j with γ female or male the gamete production rate r is see appendix a 5 r κ r p r e 0 γ we suppose here that e 0 γ is an explicit parameter e 0 f e m a l e 1 and e 0 m a l e 0 01 we also should note that when we only have access to the reserve energy at birth eb it is also possible to calculate e 0 γ using the growth equation and thus in the standard deb model mothers invest enough energy in an embryo so that when the embryo hatches u h u h b the scaled reserve density will be equal to its mother s scaled energy density with u h b being the scaled maturity at birth sub model 2 find a partner and reproduce process during the reproduction period males and females interact to give birth to offsprings in a first step we assume that females are selective and choose the larger male within its neighbourhood defined by its radius vision the male choice is based on size instead of invested energy in reproduction for two main reasons the first is that size s information is more available than invested energy for reproduction the second is that grouper is a sedentary species where large males defend their territories which gives them a selective advantage in a second step and in order to investigate sensitivity regarding male choice we assign to each male in the female neighbourhood a random number ω with a normal distribution with mean equal to the mean of sizes of the neighbouring males and with standard deviation a chosen value s the female chooses the male in the neighbourhood with the greatest ωli with li the male size during one time step a male reproduces with all females that choose him after reproduction females become sexually inactive for the rest of their reproduction period while males remain active until the end of the reproduction period see fig 3 we also suppose that there is no sperm competition see fig 5 2 6 model test and simulation plans we simulated and tested the hermadeb model using a four step strategy maâroufi et al 2015 in the first step we tested our model implementation with field data using epinephelus marginatus grouper parameters see table 3 we performed 100 repetitions for each simulation and compared and obtained the sex change size parameters with data from allsop and west 2003 each simulation was run for 400 years this first step allows us to validate the input parameters obtained using debtool in the second step we performed a screening analysis manchala et al 2017 omlin and reichert 1999 and response surface analysis rsa lewis et al 1998 to identify the most influential parameters on l change p l m a x p the mean over population of lmax and l r a t i o p as well as on the sex ratio these analyses were conducted using nemrodw software mathieu et al 2000 a screening analysis allows us to weigh the effects of various factors assuming a linear model and thus to test the sensitivity to the deb parameter values for this purpose we use an experimental domain defined as a 10 deviation from the input parameters shown in table 3 in the third step we compared different food environment distributions 1 constant food availability five levels of foods x 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 2 seasonal food fluctuations where we considered a sinusoidal variation of food availability with two different periods t 1 and 12 t 1 corresponding to t 1 months of abundance t 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 and 12 t 1 months of rarity see fig 6 in this case we assume that spawning usually occurs only during the months when food is abundant e g for t 1 2 where the months of abundance are june and july and for t 1 4 where the months of abundance are may june july and august in fourth step we investigated the effect of partner choose strategy where we relax the selective pressure on male so that the choice is based on a male s size dependent probability during the second and third steps the simulation was repeated 10 times each sub model 3 starvation starvation submodel runs when growth is negative i e when l e and individual does not have enough energy to pay somatic maintenance then growth is set to 0 and individuals reallocate energy from development for juveniles or reproduction for adults to pay maintenance costs more precisely when starvation occurs individual change the reserve dynamics to pay somatic maintenance only no allocation to maturity maintenance maturation or reproduction adults who have accumulated energy in the reproduction buffer reallocate this energy to pay for the maintenance cost kooijman 2010 martin et al 2013b 3 results model test and validation in our simulations an individual reaches puberty at 0 5m and the maximum size values are between 1 93m and 2m these results are compared with epinephelus marginatus grouper field data which state that the animal can reach 1 5m in size and 0 47m at puberty heemstra and randall 1993 the maximum size difference between our simulations and the field data can be explained through food abundance and the absence of disease induced mortality in both deb and hermadeb models we also observed that the average size ratio between sex change size and maximum size lratio varies between 0 78 and 0 81 over replicated simulations and that l change i 1 56 m this result was also found by allsop and west 2003 l r a t i o 0 79 m through a statistical analysis on 52 species of hermaphrodite fish including epinephelus marginatus linking population level characteristics to individual level parameters a total of 12 factors were screened see table 3 for the experimental domain values fig 7 shows that the most important factors influencing l change p l m a x and l r a t i o p are κ i e the fraction of mobilized energy allocated to soma k m i e a somatic maintenance process g e g κ e m i e energy investment to structure ratio sg i e gompertz ageing coefficient and u h p i e the amount of accumulated energy needed to move to the adult stage note that sg and u h p have no influence on l r a t i o p or l change p respectively we conducted an rsa analysis on l r a t i o p see table 3 the analysis revealed that k m has a quadratic effect on l r a t i o p with a maximum value see fig 8 this maximum value increases with κ it is of interest to note that the cost of a sperm clutch e 0 γ for male and mating group size parameter vision have little to no effect on l r a t i o p which may be due to the fact that male fecundity is equal of that of the females with which they reproduce thus male fitness is limited based on the gamete production of the partner and not by the male s own gametes because the distribution of mean sex ratio s e x r a t i o has a non constant variance in the experimental domain we carried out a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 to correct the distribution normality and studied ln s e x r a t i o we found that in addition to u h p κ and k m the most important factor is energy transfer v see fig 9 we proceeded to a sensitivity study for l change i and l m a x by varying the probability for a female to mate with the largest male fig 10 we observe that for s 1 the average size at sex change varies only slightly compared to s fig 10a however the standard deviation from the mean is increasing in addition l m a x values tend to decrease for s 1 fig 10b both these trends are no longer as clear for s 1 food variation food variation analysis shows see fig 9 that for a constant food density x 0 5 l m a x increases and then stabilizes at around 1m for x 0 5 whereas the sex change size l change p increases and tends to approach l m a x l r a t i o p 0 7 1 we should state that l change p l m a x reflects the fact that certain individuals died before reaching the size required for a sex change in this case we observed that the mean population size at the time of a sex change throughout the simulations l change p is almost zero for low food levels individuals do not reach their inherited size for a sex change to occur either because they die of starvation too early or they do not have enough resources to grow to l change i the fact that l change p can be greater than l m a x for food level x 0 5 is explained by the fact that l m a x is calculated over all individuals whereas l change p is estimated only over the male population paradoxically for periodic food density when the period of abundance is less than 6 months l m a x is about 1 47m and decreases to reach its minimum of l m a x 1 3 m for equal abundance and scarcity periods whereas l change p l m a x when the abundance period is below 6 months otherwise this tendency is reversed when the abundance period is greater than 6 months see fig 11 4 discussion sex allocation depends directly on how an organism allocates energy throughout its lifetime using deb models we linked individual structural length and gamete production with feeding these links ensure that energy based trade offs κ and κr are explicitly set in the fitness formula deb parameters as life history invariant we found that the three most important factors influencing l change p l m a x and l r a t i o p are the fraction of energy mobilized from the reserves for somatic maintenance plus growth κ the somatic maintenance process k m and the energy investment to structure ratio g e g κ e m the fact that κ plays a central role in l change p is derived from the dichotomy for reserve energy allocation into reproductive versus somatic tissues and organs kooijman 2010 somatic tissues are clearly necessary for the acquisition of matter and energy at the same time an organism s soma is of no selective value except in as much as it increases the mating probability in case of sexual selection we considered that the allocation of time and energy into reproduction in itself decreases the growth of somatic tissues and often reduces future fecundity these two opposite effects ensure a trait off property to κ moreover κ rule ensures that κ does not depend on the amount of the reserve density kooijman 2010 but still can depend on the amount of structure this can explain why growth curves of some fish do exhibit deviations at the start and end note that the specific allocation to reproduction in fully grown adults is positively correlated with specific somatic maintenance among 64 fish species from all 5 classes kooijman and lika 2014 this insure the hypothesis that κ is constant among taxa our results should be compared with those of allsop and west 2003 charnov and skúladóttir 2000 gardner et al 2005 which provide three dimensionless invariant parameters that play significant roles in the variations of lratio their invariant parameters were constructed using a mix of strong ecological hypotheses that cannot be easily fulfilled for long periods e g the power law hypothesis and adult instantaneous mortality rate and physiological related processes e g von bertalanffy 1938 growth therewith our results lead to a discussion on an adequate ecological scale physiological individual or population in which any biological invariant has to be defined to avoid a strong ecological hypothesis we show that the physiological scale is the most adequate level to define a life history invariant and thus a reformulation of the models in charnov and skúladóttir 2000 gardner et al 2005 using deb parameters into κ g and k m will theoretically prove our results power law size fecundity function we provide an explicit formula for female gamete production 5 see appendix a and prove that the power law hypothesis is a particular case when l 1 g l t the fact that fecundity follows a power function of individual size has been widely used by charnov 1993 charnov and skúladóttir 2000 gardner et al 2005 their argument charnov 1993 is based on field data that does not allow distinguishing between the direct effect on the size e g larger individuals likely to win the sexual competition and the indirect effect of size e g larger individuals produce more gametes during reproduction the gamete number linearly depends on the scaled reserve energy e see appendix a however individual size depends non linearly on e thus on one hand the power law function is the result of the non linear dependence of the size relative to the reserve and on the other hand of the functional response of the direct effect it is necessary to first understand the relationship between individual size and gamete production and to then know the functional response of the direct effect in this direction klinkhamer et al 1997 and cadet et al 2004 decomposed fecundity into gamete production and fitness return fitness return is defined as the probability of a gamete to be fertilized by a gamete partner therefore the fecundity power function comes from the hypothesis that both fitness returns and resources allocated to reproduction are a power function of size the gamete clutch size is equal to the resources allocated to reproduction divided by the energy cost of a gamete clutch male or female gamete clutch see eq 5 however the situation is more complicated because the energy cost of the female eggs is not a free parameter because well fed mothers give birth to well fed offspring i e the ratio of the amount of reserve and structure at birth tends to co vary with that of the mother during egg production kooijman 2009 moreover fitness return depends on factors such as variations in the mating system e g in systems in which mating opportunities can be monopolized by a few large males such as harems and leks understanding this fact deals with the relationship between sexual competition and individual size we suppose in our model that females can only reproduce with bigger males expressing a well known mechanism in harem and lekking fish mating types munday et al 2006 we note that more sophisticated models were used by munoz and warner 2003 for the harem mating type and by kebir et al 2015 for the lekking mating system on one hand at the evolutionary level the influence of the matting type can be seen in figure 11 for high level food density x 0 4 as l change i tends to be equal to lmax despite the fact that it was initially uniformly distributed and inherited from the parents resources affect fitness at both the population and individual levels indeed at the population level food restriction increases resource competition and affects the group size which has an effect on sexual competition at the individual level resource affects the fitness through individual size growth i e effect that come from advantages of size per se for instance sexual competition and through gamete production a simple calculus from cadet et al 2004 shows that if female has no direct effect the size at sex change depends on α 1 a with a 0 1 the direct effect of male size and α the population sex ratio thus if the sex ratio is in favor of males size at sex change is maximal when direct effect of size is large 1 a 0 notice that vizoso and schärer 2007 experimentally investigate the effects of resource availability on the sex allocation of a simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm macrostomum lignano they observed that in higher resource levels in constant size population flatworm macrostomum lignano allocates relatively more into the female function on the other hand for x 0 4 the sex change size is relatively zero as the surviving individuals are almost all females this result can be explained by the reallocation of the energy from the reproductive buffer to pay the somatic maintenance costs allowing them to decrease their mortality compared to the juveniles in the case of prolonged starvation this allows adults to be less sensitive to food limitations than juveniles this change in strategy included in the extensions of the standard deb model kooijman 2010 martin et al 2013b partially solves a paradox of the standard deb model which possess a peculiar property whereby adults are more sensitive to food limitation than are juveniles van der meer 2016 it should be noted that although the cost of the ovocyte generally appears to be 3 5 an order of magnitude higher than that of sperm we have set this ratio at about 10 it seems to us that this assumption has little effect on l change p or lratio indeed on the one hand the screening analysis showed that the energy cost of a brood of gametes male or female had very little effect in l change p and lratio on the other hand cadet et al 2004 shows mathematically in the case of a simulated hermaphrodism that the cost of the gametes has no influence on the sexual allocation curve it should be noted that their proof also works in the case of a generalization to a deb model toward a new vision of sex allocation model female protogynous fish during a sex change go through a transitory period of gonad degradation and re construction glamuzina et al 1998a marques and ferreira 2011 nakamura 2013 okumura and paper 2001 sadovy and shapiro 1987 zhou and gui 2010 they increase their sexual maturation develop new functions and install regulation systems until changing into the male sex this fact indicates that a sex change should be seen as a second maturation thus whatever path toward a change in sex namely a plastic response to the environment or group conditions munday et al 2006 or fixed through evolution processes allsop and west 2003 charnov and skúladóttir 2000 a sex change should occur after individual maturity is reached with this approach a repetitive sex change is the result of a shift in the production of one gamete type to another thus after the second maturity the sexual organ is capable of producing both types of gametes observed in cross sections of the gonads okumura and paper 2001 and individuals choose based on their mating opportunities to use one of them in order to maximize their fitness the observed delays between male and female in certain species liu and sadovy 2004 corresponds to the time needed for gamete production and should not be the result of gonad degradation or re construction warner 1988 as the first sexual maturation this second maturation should be viewed in terms of a maturation threshold for sex change e h c h a n g e the κ rule indicates that growth and development are parallel processes if food density is constant the maturation rate is a continuous function of food density namely it is zero no sex change for low food densities and increases with increasing food densities similar to puberty an individual inherits a maturity threshold for its second maturation kooijman 2010 an evaluation of size at second maturity lmat corresponding to e h c h a n g e can be conducted using the deb theory in the case of a large abundance of resources the size and age at maturity can be found by combining the deb growth equation and von bertalanffy growth curve kooijman 2010 and we thus retrieve classical results charnov and skúladóttir 2000 leigh et al 1976 furthermore the mating type e g one to one harem or lek or sexual competition can increase the observed size at the time of a sex change for example in a harem species or a species that exhibits a polygynous resource defense the largest female in a group usually changes sex following the disappearance of the dominant male liu and sadovy 2004 warner 1988 which can increase its fitness through spawning with all remaining females 5 conclusion in our work we established a link between sex allocation and environmental resources by coupling the standard deb model kooijman 2010 with sex allocation models charnov 1982 this link between physiological level and ecological level enables us to first study the effects of species specific physiological factors on sex change size and the maximum size and to then explore fluctuating food conditions on the sex change that occurs in hermaphrodites we found that the most important physiological factors influencing a sex change namely the maximum size and sex ratio are κ i e the fraction of mobilized energy allocated to the soma k m i e the somatic maintenance process and g e g κ e m i e the energy investment to structure ratio our results show that energy allocated to gamete production κr and the difference between the energetic male and female gamete cost e 0 male which is seen as a budget effect do not have an influence on either the sex change size or the population sex ratio finally our work clearly shows that physiological factors are not sufficient to explain this emergent propriety and that the mating system may be a strong force influencing the size at the time of a sex change

24866,size advantage hypothesis models sah allow an understanding of which sex occurs first and when the sex is changed in hermaphrodite species through the optimal allocation of energy in terms of male versus female roles whereas sex allocation depends directly on how an organism allocates energy throughout its lifetime the dynamic energy budget theory deb describes the uptake and use of energy and nutrients as well as the physiological organization throughout an organism s life cycle including growth maintenance reproduction and aging we propose an evolutionary individual based model to bridge the gap between metabolic models and the sexual allocation model in this paper we describe an individual based model used to study the size at the time of a sex change maximum size i e lratio and the most important physiological factors influencing size at the time of a sex change l change i we show that the fraction that determines how much to invest in somatic maintenance and growth κ the cost of the structure relative to the energy allocated to the soma and the somatic maintenance rate coefficient are the most influential factors we also show that the ratio between male and female gamete costs has very little influence on l change i and lratio keywords individual based model dynamic energy budget theory sex allocation theory metabolism evolution hermaphrodite 1 introduction in

term budget refers to the explicit use of energy conservation in this work we formulate an evolutionary individual based model ibm grimm and railsback 2005 that couples physiological and ecological levels through the deb theory kooijman 2010 and sex allocation theories charnov 1982 which we called hermadeb our goal is to investigate the key physiological parameters that affect the size at sex change for hermaphrodites we then apply hermadeb to the dusky grouper epinephelus marginatus lowe 1834 epinephelus marginatus is a sequential protogynous hermaphrodite with sex change sensitive to its immediate social environment such as the relative individual size compared to others in the social group chauvet 2007 reñones et al 2007 zabala et al 1997 moreover this species has been indexed as an endangered species by the world conservation union 1 1 http www iucn org iucn it should be noted that there is a large literature of multi agent models applied to fish dynamics however very few have been applied to groupers ben miled et al 2010 and very few have been coupled with the deb models e g martin et al 2013a 2012 thomas et al 2016 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the hermadeb model using the overview design concepts and details odd protocol grimm et al 2006 in section 3 we describe our simulation results the simulation was planned based on an experimental research methodology maâroufi et al 2015 finally in section 4 we discuss our results and pinpoint some limits and perspectives to generalize and exploit hermadeb toward filling in the gap between sex allocation and environmental resources and between individual level and population level characteristics 2 methods in this section we describe hermadeb model following the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 this protocol consists of seven elements the first three elements provide an overview the fourth describes the general concepts underlying the model s design and the remaining three provide details the implementation of the model is applied on netlogo 2 2 https ccl northwestern edu netlogo extending the deb ibm implementation martin et al 2012 the code is available at https github com dorralouati hermadeb we assume that the standard deb model is appropriate for fish kooijman 2010 as it supposes that an individual has one reserve and one structure and feeds on one type of food which is its only limiting resource see fig 1 kooijman 2010 for simplification purpose we do not take into account the abj extension that models the acceleration between birth and isomorphy metamorphosis isomorphy metamorphosis is before puberty could be neglected given the life span of dusky grouper 50 years göthel 1992 and strong sexual competition zabala et al 1997 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to highlight the main parameters i e ecological and physiological parameters that affect size to sex change as an emergent evolutionary parameter the evolution of this trait may depend on both physiological and environmental parameters we use hermadeb as a virtual laboratory to study the effects of physiological and or behavioral parameters on the life history traits or dynamics of a population in our case we explore the effects of physiological parameters on the sex change duration for a hermaphrodite species 2 2 entities state variables and scales hermadeb consists of two types of agents hermaphrodite individuals fish from the epinephelus marginatus species and environment a grid formed by cells each of which has a food density attribute x in addition hermaphrodites are structured into maturity levels embryo juvenile and adult see fig 2 from a deb theory perspective the state of an organism is completely described based on its structural volume v or the structural length l v 1 3 its reserve energy e and its maturity eh seen as a cumulative energy allocated to the maturity we consider the structural length at the time of a sex change as an evolutionary trait we use alternatively the term size and length for the structural length note that deb theory uses the term of length and sex allocation theory uses the term size we note that generally the term length refers to the structural length however size refers to observed individual size for consistency with the deb theory we define the size of a sex change l change i i for individual as the structural length at which the individual changes sex ghiselin 1969 warner 1988 new offspring inherit l change i from their parents through reproduction we also introduce two additional state variables specific to the aging sub model namely damage inducing compounds q acceleration and damage h hazard kooijman 2010 see tables 1 3 and 4 for a summary of deb state variables and parameters the transition from one life stage to another is based on the maturation and is quantified based on the amount of energy allocated to maturity denoted as eh indeed transition from embryo to juvenile stage occurs when the maturity reaches the birth threshold e h b in the same way the transition to adult stage is marked by a puberty threshold e h p 2 3 process overview and scheduling to simulate a reproductive pattern the year is divided into periods breeding mating period from june to september marino et al 2000 pre reproductive period from april to may and free period where individuals do not reproduce the rest of the year the simulation time step represents one day in each time step individuals feed and use up taken energy to run their metabolic processes somatic maintenance growth maturity maintenance maturity or reproduction the individual deb state variables v e and eh are then updated following the deb standard model differential equations see subsection 2 5 3 and appendix a kooijman 2010 if the individual can no longer pay somatic maintenance costs it dies martin et al 2012 otherwise it reaches the next life stage if the maturity level allows it see fig 2 along adulthood the individual accumulates energy in its reproduction buffers during the pre reproduction period depending on its size each individual checks whether it can change sex i e if l l change i during the breeding season females mate once with one of the bigger in size males and all of their eggs are fertilized by the same partner whereas males mate with all females who choose them during the free period individuals do not interact and share only food resources at each time step the following algorithm is run 2 4 design concepts 2 4 1 basic principles we use the standard deb model with the aging module kooijman 2010 and extend it based on sex allocation theory assuming that sex change occurs only once at a fixed size from female to male we suppose that females choose the largest male available for reproduction in their entourage e g lekking types mating thus a male can reproduce several times per breeding season while females reproduce only once therefore standard deviation of the number of progeny per male can be greater than that of females 2 4 2 adaptation and emergence the life history traits of the population emerge from the properties of metabolic organization and indirect interactions of individuals via partner choice moreover we suppose that size at sex change l change i is an adaptive trait that is genetically coded transmitted by the parents to their descendants who inherit the mean parents size of sex change furthermore couples are formed in preference to size the females choose in their neighborhood a male larger than herself therefore an individual with large l change i value will turns into male later allowing it to reproduce more as a female if we suppose that females always reproduce its offspring number will depend only on its gamete production otherwise individual with a small l change i value will turns into male earlier and can reproduce many time per breading season but with small mating probability particularly if the male density is large as offspring inherits the mean parents size of sex change these two antagonistic phenomena allow the emergence of a trade off property for l change i the initial state of the process begins with a uniformly distributed l change i between puberty and lmax the model does not include adaptive behavior in particular deb parameters and l change i vary among individuals but remain constant over an individual s lifespan consequently the design concepts objectives learning and prediction do not apply to this model 2 4 3 sensing individuals know their physiological parameters and have complete information regarding the size of other individuals within the neighbourhood radius as defined by the vision parameter 2 4 4 stochasticity beyond the breeding season adults move randomly through space by at most one spatial units e g grid cells per time unit however at the beginning of the spawning period males stop moving whereas sexually active females continue moving until they find a partner lay eggs and finally become sexually inactive moreover in order to investigate sensitivity regarding mating choice stochasticity was introduced in the female mating choice see paragraph 2 5 3 2 4 5 collectives we do not assume any collective behavior or any form of aggregation the individual level is the only level represented in hermadeb 2 4 6 interactions during the reproduction period males and females interact to give birth to offspring we assume that females are selective and choose an available male within neighbourhood radius as defined by the vision parameter i e partner sexual choice see paragraph 2 5 3 2 4 7 model output we annually report the population mean sex change size l change p p for population as the mean of l change i over the entire population we note that sex change size cannot be reached if the individual dies too soon we also report male population mean size at sex change called l change male as the average l change i among male individuals i e l change male l change p male sex ratio 1 ρ with ρ f e m a l e l i m a l e l i moreover at the end of each simulation we report mean population ratio between the sex change size and maximum size l r a t i o p i e mean over population of l change i l m a x we also monitor the population density and sex ratio and annual offspring count the simulations stop when l change p stabilizes i e l change p y l change p y 1 10 5 where y indicates the year each simulation is repeated and for each measured variable η we note η p as the mean population value across the simulation 2 5 details 2 5 1 initialization at the beginning of the simulation 100 embryos are introduced into the models with species specific estimated deb parameters multiplied by a log normally randomly distributed number lower than 0 1 in order to provide inter individual variability in size and in gamete production for the parameters g u h b and u h p field data did not allow us to evaluate the intra individual variability of these parameters therefore the choice of the value 0 1 is arbitrary moreover individual sex change size l change i is set randomly between the size at puberty and the maximum size this enables the sex change size distribution to cover all possibilities of size from puberty early period of male individual up to the maximum size entire lifetime of the female the deb parameters are estimated using debtool based on a set of primary parameters collected from the literature see table 2 we compared the input data using a hermaphrodite sex history database allsop and west 2003 and conducted a sensitivity analysis study on the estimated deb parameters see section 2 6 2 5 2 input data the model does not include input data representing external driving processes 2 5 3 sub models from a physiological perspective the individual is seen as the result of its physiological processes which are susceptible to influence ecological interactions increase in structure growth and somatic maintenance maturation reproduction and maturity maintenance and survival probability aging kooijman 2010 we group the processes into two main sub models first update deb state variables sub model which aims to calculate and update the physiological processes feeding assimilation reserve dynamics aging mortality rate and gamete production see fig 4 second ecological sub model which aims to model mating process find a partner and reproduce process see fig 3 sub model 1 update deb state variables processes 2 5 3 0 1 metabolic processes are governed by the deb model at each time step energy is taken from the reserve to power metabolic processes of the organism for the juvenile and adult stages the amount of energy in reserve is calculated by adding the assimilated energy amount and removing the mobilized energy needed let κ be the fraction of the mobilized reserve is used for somatic maintenance plus growth and the rest 1 κ for maturity maintenance plus maturation in juveniles or reproduction in adults see fig 1 following kooijman 2010 the equation of the reserve dynamics is as follows 1 d e d t f x e p m κ e m l where x is the scaled food density in the environment e is the scaled energy density l is the scaled structural length l lm see table 3 and κ is the fraction of mobilized reserve allocated to soma see table 3 for all parameter definitions the dot indicates the rate represents 1 l 3 and is used for 1 l 2 a fraction κ of the mobilized energy flux p c is divided between somatic maintenance and growth thus the increase in size can be written kooijman 2010 as 2 d l d t 1 3 k m e l 1 e g aging is due to the secondary effects of respiration through reactive oxygen species the amount of accumulated oxidation damage determines the survival rate δ and can be written as kooijman 2010 d δ d t δ h with h the specific death probability rate depending on the aging acceleration scaled density of damage q and r being the growth rate i e 3 d h d t q r h d q d t q l 3 s g h a e v l r r q 2 5 3 0 2 gamete production energy to initiate gamete production is taken from the reproductive buffer filled during the period between two mating periods see fig 5 let u h p be the required energy for gamete production at puberty the energy allocated to maturation in embryos and juveniles uh is redirected toward reproduction u h u h p the equation of scaled maturity density dynamic for u h u h p is 4 d u h d t k m u h 1 κ e l 2 g l g e k u h at puberty a proportion κr of the energy allocated to reproduction is used for gamete production the rest 1 κ r is dissipated in the additional reproduction costs e g courtship and sexual competition if the energy cost of one gamete is e 0 γ measured in j with γ female or male the gamete production rate r is see appendix a 5 r κ r p r e 0 γ we suppose here that e 0 γ is an explicit parameter e 0 f e m a l e 1 and e 0 m a l e 0 01 we also should note that when we only have access to the reserve energy at birth eb it is also possible to calculate e 0 γ using the growth equation and thus in the standard deb model mothers invest enough energy in an embryo so that when the embryo hatches u h u h b the scaled reserve density will be equal to its mother s scaled energy density with u h b being the scaled maturity at birth sub model 2 find a partner and reproduce process during the reproduction period males and females interact to give birth to offsprings in a first step we assume that females are selective and choose the larger male within its neighbourhood defined by its radius vision the male choice is based on size instead of invested energy in reproduction for two main reasons the first is that size s information is more available than invested energy for reproduction the second is that grouper is a sedentary species where large males defend their territories which gives them a selective advantage in a second step and in order to investigate sensitivity regarding male choice we assign to each male in the female neighbourhood a random number ω with a normal distribution with mean equal to the mean of sizes of the neighbouring males and with standard deviation a chosen value s the female chooses the male in the neighbourhood with the greatest ωli with li the male size during one time step a male reproduces with all females that choose him after reproduction females become sexually inactive for the rest of their reproduction period while males remain active until the end of the reproduction period see fig 3 we also suppose that there is no sperm competition see fig 5 2 6 model test and simulation plans we simulated and tested the hermadeb model using a four step strategy maâroufi et al 2015 in the first step we tested our model implementation with field data using epinephelus marginatus grouper parameters see table 3 we performed 100 repetitions for each simulation and compared and obtained the sex change size parameters with data from allsop and west 2003 each simulation was run for 400 years this first step allows us to validate the input parameters obtained using debtool in the second step we performed a screening analysis manchala et al 2017 omlin and reichert 1999 and response surface analysis rsa lewis et al 1998 to identify the most influential parameters on l change p l m a x p the mean over population of lmax and l r a t i o p as well as on the sex ratio these analyses were conducted using nemrodw software mathieu et al 2000 a screening analysis allows us to weigh the effects of various factors assuming a linear model and thus to test the sensitivity to the deb parameter values for this purpose we use an experimental domain defined as a 10 deviation from the input parameters shown in table 3 in the third step we compared different food environment distributions 1 constant food availability five levels of foods x 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 2 seasonal food fluctuations where we considered a sinusoidal variation of food availability with two different periods t 1 and 12 t 1 corresponding to t 1 months of abundance t 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 and 12 t 1 months of rarity see fig 6 in this case we assume that spawning usually occurs only during the months when food is abundant e g for t 1 2 where the months of abundance are june and july and for t 1 4 where the months of abundance are may june july and august in fourth step we investigated the effect of partner choose strategy where we relax the selective pressure on male so that the choice is based on a male s size dependent probability during the second and third steps the simulation was repeated 10 times each sub model 3 starvation starvation submodel runs when growth is negative i e when l e and individual does not have enough energy to pay somatic maintenance then growth is set to 0 and individuals reallocate energy from development for juveniles or reproduction for adults to pay maintenance costs more precisely when starvation occurs individual change the reserve dynamics to pay somatic maintenance only no allocation to maturity maintenance maturation or reproduction adults who have accumulated energy in the reproduction buffer reallocate this energy to pay for the maintenance cost kooijman 2010 martin et al 2013b 3 results model test and validation in our simulations an individual reaches puberty at 0 5m and the maximum size values are between 1 93m and 2m these results are compared with epinephelus marginatus grouper field data which state that the animal can reach 1 5m in size and 0 47m at puberty heemstra and randall 1993 the maximum size difference between our simulations and the field data can be explained through food abundance and the absence of disease induced mortality in both deb and hermadeb models we also observed that the average size ratio between sex change size and maximum size lratio varies between 0 78 and 0 81 over replicated simulations and that l change i 1 56 m this result was also found by allsop and west 2003 l r a t i o 0 79 m through a statistical analysis on 52 species of hermaphrodite fish including epinephelus marginatus linking population level characteristics to individual level parameters a total of 12 factors were screened see table 3 for the experimental domain values fig 7 shows that the most important factors influencing l change p l m a x and l r a t i o p are κ i e the fraction of mobilized energy allocated to soma k m i e a somatic maintenance process g e g κ e m i e energy investment to structure ratio sg i e gompertz ageing coefficient and u h p i e the amount of accumulated energy needed to move to the adult stage note that sg and u h p have no influence on l r a t i o p or l change p respectively we conducted an rsa analysis on l r a t i o p see table 3 the analysis revealed that k m has a quadratic effect on l r a t i o p with a maximum value see fig 8 this maximum value increases with κ it is of interest to note that the cost of a sperm clutch e 0 γ for male and mating group size parameter vision have little to no effect on l r a t i o p which may be due to the fact that male fecundity is equal of that of the females with which they reproduce thus male fitness is limited based on the gamete production of the partner and not by the male s own gametes because the distribution of mean sex ratio s e x r a t i o has a non constant variance in the experimental domain we carried out a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 to correct the distribution normality and studied ln s e x r a t i o we found that in addition to u h p κ and k m the most important factor is energy transfer v see fig 9 we proceeded to a sensitivity study for l change i and l m a x by varying the probability for a female to mate with the largest male fig 10 we observe that for s 1 the average size at sex change varies only slightly compared to s fig 10a however the standard deviation from the mean is increasing in addition l m a x values tend to decrease for s 1 fig 10b both these trends are no longer as clear for s 1 food variation food variation analysis shows see fig 9 that for a constant food density x 0 5 l m a x increases and then stabilizes at around 1m for x 0 5 whereas the sex change size l change p increases and tends to approach l m a x l r a t i o p 0 7 1 we should state that l change p l m a x reflects the fact that certain individuals died before reaching the size required for a sex change in this case we observed that the mean population size at the time of a sex change throughout the simulations l change p is almost zero for low food levels individuals do not reach their inherited size for a sex change to occur either because they die of starvation too early or they do not have enough resources to grow to l change i the fact that l change p can be greater than l m a x for food level x 0 5 is explained by the fact that l m a x is calculated over all individuals whereas l change p is estimated only over the male population paradoxically for periodic food density when the period of abundance is less than 6 months l m a x is about 1 47m and decreases to reach its minimum of l m a x 1 3 m for equal abundance and scarcity periods whereas l change p l m a x when the abundance period is below 6 months otherwise this tendency is reversed when the abundance period is greater than 6 months see fig 11 4 discussion sex allocation depends directly on how an organism allocates energy throughout its lifetime using deb models we linked individual structural length and gamete production with feeding these links ensure that energy based trade offs κ and κr are explicitly set in the fitness formula deb parameters as life history invariant we found that the three most important factors influencing l change p l m a x and l r a t i o p are the fraction of energy mobilized from the reserves for somatic maintenance plus growth κ the somatic maintenance process k m and the energy investment to structure ratio g e g κ e m the fact that κ plays a central role in l change p is derived from the dichotomy for reserve energy allocation into reproductive versus somatic tissues and organs kooijman 2010 somatic tissues are clearly necessary for the acquisition of matter and energy at the same time an organism s soma is of no selective value except in as much as it increases the mating probability in case of sexual selection we considered that the allocation of time and energy into reproduction in itself decreases the growth of somatic tissues and often reduces future fecundity these two opposite effects ensure a trait off property to κ moreover κ rule ensures that κ does not depend on the amount of the reserve density kooijman 2010 but still can depend on the amount of structure this can explain why growth curves of some fish do exhibit deviations at the start and end note that the specific allocation to reproduction in fully grown adults is positively correlated with specific somatic maintenance among 64 fish species from all 5 classes kooijman and lika 2014 this insure the hypothesis that κ is constant among taxa our results should be compared with those of allsop and west 2003 charnov and skúladóttir 2000 gardner et al 2005 which provide three dimensionless invariant parameters that play significant roles in the variations of lratio their invariant parameters were constructed using a mix of strong ecological hypotheses that cannot be easily fulfilled for long periods e g the power law hypothesis and adult instantaneous mortality rate and physiological related processes e g von bertalanffy 1938 growth therewith our results lead to a discussion on an adequate ecological scale physiological individual or population in which any biological invariant has to be defined to avoid a strong ecological hypothesis we show that the physiological scale is the most adequate level to define a life history invariant and thus a reformulation of the models in charnov and skúladóttir 2000 gardner et al 2005 using deb parameters into κ g and k m will theoretically prove our results power law size fecundity function we provide an explicit formula for female gamete production 5 see appendix a and prove that the power law hypothesis is a particular case when l 1 g l t the fact that fecundity follows a power function of individual size has been widely used by charnov 1993 charnov and skúladóttir 2000 gardner et al 2005 their argument charnov 1993 is based on field data that does not allow distinguishing between the direct effect on the size e g larger individuals likely to win the sexual competition and the indirect effect of size e g larger individuals produce more gametes during reproduction the gamete number linearly depends on the scaled reserve energy e see appendix a however individual size depends non linearly on e thus on one hand the power law function is the result of the non linear dependence of the size relative to the reserve and on the other hand of the functional response of the direct effect it is necessary to first understand the relationship between individual size and gamete production and to then know the functional response of the direct effect in this direction klinkhamer et al 1997 and cadet et al 2004 decomposed fecundity into gamete production and fitness return fitness return is defined as the probability of a gamete to be fertilized by a gamete partner therefore the fecundity power function comes from the hypothesis that both fitness returns and resources allocated to reproduction are a power function of size the gamete clutch size is equal to the resources allocated to reproduction divided by the energy cost of a gamete clutch male or female gamete clutch see eq 5 however the situation is more complicated because the energy cost of the female eggs is not a free parameter because well fed mothers give birth to well fed offspring i e the ratio of the amount of reserve and structure at birth tends to co vary with that of the mother during egg production kooijman 2009 moreover fitness return depends on factors such as variations in the mating system e g in systems in which mating opportunities can be monopolized by a few large males such as harems and leks understanding this fact deals with the relationship between sexual competition and individual size we suppose in our model that females can only reproduce with bigger males expressing a well known mechanism in harem and lekking fish mating types munday et al 2006 we note that more sophisticated models were used by munoz and warner 2003 for the harem mating type and by kebir et al 2015 for the lekking mating system on one hand at the evolutionary level the influence of the matting type can be seen in figure 11 for high level food density x 0 4 as l change i tends to be equal to lmax despite the fact that it was initially uniformly distributed and inherited from the parents resources affect fitness at both the population and individual levels indeed at the population level food restriction increases resource competition and affects the group size which has an effect on sexual competition at the individual level resource affects the fitness through individual size growth i e effect that come from advantages of size per se for instance sexual competition and through gamete production a simple calculus from cadet et al 2004 shows that if female has no direct effect the size at sex change depends on α 1 a with a 0 1 the direct effect of male size and α the population sex ratio thus if the sex ratio is in favor of males size at sex change is maximal when direct effect of size is large 1 a 0 notice that vizoso and schärer 2007 experimentally investigate the effects of resource availability on the sex allocation of a simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm macrostomum lignano they observed that in higher resource levels in constant size population flatworm macrostomum lignano allocates relatively more into the female function on the other hand for x 0 4 the sex change size is relatively zero as the surviving individuals are almost all females this result can be explained by the reallocation of the energy from the reproductive buffer to pay the somatic maintenance costs allowing them to decrease their mortality compared to the juveniles in the case of prolonged starvation this allows adults to be less sensitive to food limitations than juveniles this change in strategy included in the extensions of the standard deb model kooijman 2010 martin et al 2013b partially solves a paradox of the standard deb model which possess a peculiar property whereby adults are more sensitive to food limitation than are juveniles van der meer 2016 it should be noted that although the cost of the ovocyte generally appears to be 3 5 an order of magnitude higher than that of sperm we have set this ratio at about 10 it seems to us that this assumption has little effect on l change p or lratio indeed on the one hand the screening analysis showed that the energy cost of a brood of gametes male or female had very little effect in l change p and lratio on the other hand cadet et al 2004 shows mathematically in the case of a simulated hermaphrodism that the cost of the gametes has no influence on the sexual allocation curve it should be noted that their proof also works in the case of a generalization to a deb model toward a new vision of sex allocation model female protogynous fish during a sex change go through a transitory period of gonad degradation and re construction glamuzina et al 1998a marques and ferreira 2011 nakamura 2013 okumura and paper 2001 sadovy and shapiro 1987 zhou and gui 2010 they increase their sexual maturation develop new functions and install regulation systems until changing into the male sex this fact indicates that a sex change should be seen as a second maturation thus whatever path toward a change in sex namely a plastic response to the environment or group conditions munday et al 2006 or fixed through evolution processes allsop and west 2003 charnov and skúladóttir 2000 a sex change should occur after individual maturity is reached with this approach a repetitive sex change is the result of a shift in the production of one gamete type to another thus after the second maturity the sexual organ is capable of producing both types of gametes observed in cross sections of the gonads okumura and paper 2001 and individuals choose based on their mating opportunities to use one of them in order to maximize their fitness the observed delays between male and female in certain species liu and sadovy 2004 corresponds to the time needed for gamete production and should not be the result of gonad degradation or re construction warner 1988 as the first sexual maturation this second maturation should be viewed in terms of a maturation threshold for sex change e h c h a n g e the κ rule indicates that growth and development are parallel processes if food density is constant the maturation rate is a continuous function of food density namely it is zero no sex change for low food densities and increases with increasing food densities similar to puberty an individual inherits a maturity threshold for its second maturation kooijman 2010 an evaluation of size at second maturity lmat corresponding to e h c h a n g e can be conducted using the deb theory in the case of a large abundance of resources the size and age at maturity can be found by combining the deb growth equation and von bertalanffy growth curve kooijman 2010 and we thus retrieve classical results charnov and skúladóttir 2000 leigh et al 1976 furthermore the mating type e g one to one harem or lek or sexual competition can increase the observed size at the time of a sex change for example in a harem species or a species that exhibits a polygynous resource defense the largest female in a group usually changes sex following the disappearance of the dominant male liu and sadovy 2004 warner 1988 which can increase its fitness through spawning with all remaining females 5 conclusion in our work we established a link between sex allocation and environmental resources by coupling the standard deb model kooijman 2010 with sex allocation models charnov 1982 this link between physiological level and ecological level enables us to first study the effects of species specific physiological factors on sex change size and the maximum size and to then explore fluctuating food conditions on the sex change that occurs in hermaphrodites we found that the most important physiological factors influencing a sex change namely the maximum size and sex ratio are κ i e the fraction of mobilized energy allocated to the soma k m i e the somatic maintenance process and g e g κ e m i e the energy investment to structure ratio our results show that energy allocated to gamete production κr and the difference between the energetic male and female gamete cost e 0 male which is seen as a budget effect do not have an influence on either the sex change size or the population sex ratio finally our work clearly shows that physiological factors are not sufficient to explain this emergent propriety and that the mating system may be a strong force influencing the size at the time of a sex change

γ κ r p r e 0 γ where e 0 γ is the cost of a gamete e 0 female is the cost of one egg and e 0 male is the cost of a sperm clutch the energy allocated for gamete production is a fraction κr of energy

24867,in plant communities resource partitioning has been shown to facilitate species coexistence and in turn enhance community density such positive effects of resource partitioning in higher trophic levels are not as obvious possibly due to the occurrence of intra guild predation igp we thus built a model to explore the joint effects of igp and resource partitioning on consumer coexistence and their collective density as rarely have studies investigated this joint effect the model consists of two prey resources that do not directly compete with each other and two consumers that are engaged in igp and can partition their use of the two prey resources this model shows that the effects of igp on consumer coexistence depend on which consumer requires the lower resource density to persist when the ig predator is the inferior competitor weak igp enhances coexistence by lowering the minimum degree of partitioning that is required for coexistence otherwise igp always constrains coexistence in addition the effects of igp on total consumer density ztot depends on which consumer has the lower maximum growth potential defined as the difference between their maximum growth rate and mortality weak igp increases ztot when the ig predator has lower maximum growth potential otherwise igp always decreases ztot last the criterion for igp to have positive effects on consumer coexistence and ztot are different our results show that weak to intermediate strengths of intra guild predation can facilitate consumer coexistence and total community density but consumer coexistence does not guarantee higher consumer density keywords intra guild predation igp interaction strength biodiversity species coexistence community density 1 introduction competition among species for limited resources is thought to be one of if not the most important inter specific interactions that lead species to partition their resources in space or time in order to coexist chesson 2000 hutchinson 1961 1957 when competing species minimize competition through resource partitioning theoretical studies most of which developed for plant communities have demonstrated that the communities with more species can attain higher community functions like more efficient resources use or higher total biomass tilman et al 1997 loreau 1998 loreau and hector 2001 positive effects of resource partitioning on both species coexistence and community function are believed to also exist in consumer communities macarthur 1958 schluter 1993 for example studies of eel grass systems have shown that more coexisting herbivores species often consumes more algae and thus leads to higher total herbivore biomass duffy et al 2015 2003 stachowicz et al 2007 this positive effect of diverse herbivore species on biomass is believed to result from the fact that different grazer species tend to partition their resource use by occupying different microhabitats and in turn allowing them to partition space by foraging on different parts of the eel grass while there is evidence that resource partitioning influences both consumer coexistence and the function of a consumer community it is important to recognize that resource partitioning is not the only factor other factors include predator predator interaction modifications sih et al 1998 predator predator facilitation losey and denno 1998 intra guild predation polis et al 1989 polis and holt 1992 and other forms of omnivory pimm and lawton 1978 among these intra guild predation is particularly widespread type of interaction with 86 or more of the taxa in a food web involved in intra guild predation arim and marquet 2004 intra guild predation igp occurs when one species the intra guild ig predator feeds on another one the intra guild ig prey with which it also competes for a shared resource polis et al 1989 polis and holt 1992 some theoretical studies suggest that igp can promote the coexistence of consumers but only under specific conditions for example the classic igp model consisting of one basal resource an ig prey and ig predator has shown that the ig prey must be superior in resource competition in order for both species to coexist assessed by the species r defined as the resource level at which population growth rate is zero holt and polis 1997 this prediction has been supported by more complicated igp models mylius et al 2001 kuijper et al 2003 tanabe and namba 2005 as well as by empirical studies that have focused on simple food web configurations morin 1999 diehl and feißel 2000 2001 theoretical studies further suggest that igp may be detrimental to the function of a consumer community the function of a consumer community is often measured as the summed density of consumers or their resources in many modeling studies so that predictions are not subject to specific assumptions about how densities are converted to biomass most models predict that igp reduces total consumer density and in turn basal resources are relieved from consumption holt and polis 1997 revilla 2002 rosenheim et al 1995 and references therein this prediction makes intuitive sense as predation pressure on ig prey releases the basal resource from top down control due to a trophic cascade which is a prediction that has generally been supported by the balance of empirical studies vance chalcraft et al 2007 in the current study we also use the total density of consumers as a proxy for ecological function as this is how prior studies have examined igp influence on community level properties of the consumers and their top down control over prey to date the joint impacts of resource partitioning and igp on consumer coexistence and density have not been explicitly studied theoretically but see holt and huxel 2007 in fact coexistence predictions of the classic igp model were developed under the assumption that the ig prey and predator overlap completely in their resource usage holt and polis 1997 yet when resource partitioning has been allowed to occur in empirical studies either via the use of alternative prey species liess and diehl 2006 novak 2013 or via spatial temporal separation of habitat amarasekare 2007a 2007b predictions about consumer coexistence from the classic igp model have not been supported this suggests that impacts of igp on coexistence depend on how resource partitioning influences competition among the igp prey and predator when resource partitioning is allowed empirical evidence also lies at odds with the prediction of the classic igp model regarding the detrimental effect of igp on total consumer density several studies suggest that when the ig prey and ig predator partition their resources detrimental effects of igp on the ig prey can be alleviated to the point that the ig predator reaches higher density and suppresses the basal resources more janssen et al 2007 messelink and janssen 2014 consequently it is important to study the relative importance of resource partitioning versus igp in mediating consumer coexistence as well as density if we were to manage the population dynamics and ensuing functions of consumer community duffy et al 2007 currently there are few theoretical studies that explicitly bring together resource partitioning and igp into a single model to determine how they jointly impact consumer coexistence and total consumer density but see daugherty et al 2007 holt and huxel 2007 to this end we built a model with two consumers engaged in igp and resource competition for two basal prey species by doing so we were able to vary the strength of igp and resource partitioning simultaneously which allowed us to accomplish two objectives first it allowed us to understand how species coexistence is simultaneously affected by the strength of igp and by resource partitioning based on the general conclusion of most studies of igp we anticipated that igp would constrain consumer coexistence and that the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for coexistence would monotonically increase igp strength resource partitioning on the other hand was expected to alleviate the detrimental effects of igp on species coexistence the second objective is to understand the joint effects of igp strength and resource partitioning on total consumer density at equilibrium where species coexist we anticipated that the strength of igp would always suppress total consumer density but such negative effect would diminish with the increase of resource partitioning 2 model and analyses 2 1 model description the model contained two resource species r1 and r2 as well as two consumer species ig prey z1 and ig predator z2 that are engaged in igp fig 1 the population dynamics of the four species were described by four ordinary differential equations 1 d r 1 d t r 1 r 1 1 r 1 k 1 s 1 c 1 r 1 z 1 1 s 2 c 2 r 1 z 2 2 d r 2 d t r 2 r 2 1 r 2 k 2 1 s 1 c 1 r 2 z 1 s 2 c 2 r 2 z 2 3 d z 1 d t e 1 s 1 c 1 r 1 z 1 e 1 1 s 1 c 1 r 2 z 1 α 12 z 1 z 2 m 1 z 1 4 d z 2 d t e 2 1 s 2 c 2 r 1 z 2 e 2 s 2 c 2 r 2 z 2 f 12 α 12 z 1 z 2 m 2 z 2 eqs 1 and 2 described the dynamics of the two shared resource species r1 and r2 which grow logistically with intrinsic growth rates r1 and r2 and carrying capacities k1 and k2 both shared resource species were consumed by ig prey z1 and ig predator z2 following a linear functional response with maximum consumption rate ci the si parameter manipulated the degree of resource partitioning for example when s1 s2 0 or 1 the ig prey and predator were complete specialists consuming resource r2 or r1 and r1 or r2 respectively when s1 s2 0 5 both ig prey and predator are complete generalists consuming equal amount of both resource species eqs 3 and 4 described the dynamics of ig prey z1 and ig predator z2 the per capita growth rate of the two consumers were linearly related to consumption rate ci times the assimilation efficiency ei ig prey was also consumed by ig predator with the intra guild predation rate of α 12 and the assimilation efficiency of f12 both animal consumer species had a density independent mortality mi 2 2 model analyses 2 2 1 species coexistence our first objective is to understand the interactive effects of intra guild predation and resource partitioning on species coexistence we began by analytically solving eq 1 through 4 for the non trivial equilibrium where all four species coexist at positive densities we then numerically studied the sign of the leading eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix of the non trivial equilibrium in a parameter space consisting of igp strength α 12 from 0 to 1 and the resource partitioning si from 0 to 0 5 indicating 100 to 0 partitioning specifically we studied how increasing α 12 affects the minimum degree of si needed to generate negative real parts for the leading eigenvalue and thus guarantee stable coexistence if α 12 always increase the minimum degree of si that guarantees stable coexistence then igp has detrimental impacts on consumer coexistence because resource partitioning si is required we then performed the above analysis under different competitive hierarchy scenarios among the two consumers because the competitive hierarchy is known to determine species coexistence holt and polis 1997 consumers competitive hierarchy determines which consumer can outcompete the other one if competition is the only interaction among consumers therefore consumers competitive hierarchy is defined as their r i e the minimum resource level that still allows consumers to persist such that the consmer with lower r reguires lower resource level to persist and thus can outcompete the other one consequently the consumer with lower r is regard as the superior competitor to manipulate competitive hierarchy we assumed that the two shared resource species are identical to the two consumers e1 e2 and s1 s2 making this assumption allowed us to focus only on the benefits of reducing competition via resource partitioning if two resource species were not identical the consumer who prefers the resource with high growth rate may gain additional benefits by consuming that resource under these assumptions m i e i c i directly determined the competitive hierarchy by fixing the consumption c1 and mortality m1 of the ig prey and varying that of the ig predator we manipulated competition hierarchy and then investigated how igp strength affects consumer coexistence 2 2 2 total consumer density ztot to address how intra guild predation and resource partitioning affects total consumer density ztot we performed a two step analysis first we mathematically analyze how the sum of the two consumer densities at the equilibrium ztot responds to igp α 12 to do so we took the derivative of ztot with respective to the α 12 i e d z t o t d α 12 and used this derivative to describe how total consumer density changes with igp if the derivative is negative positive then α 12 will decrease increase ztot note that in addition to analytically calculating d z t o t d α 12 we also numerically make sure that ig prey and ig predator can stably coexist by performing linear stability analysis see above we performed these analyses across the same parameter space of c2 and m2 2 2 3 parameter value selection first to study the effects of igp strength α 12 and resource partitioning si on species coexistence we created the competitive hierarchy by fixing both c1 and m1 at 1 and varying c2 and m2 between 0 5 and 1 5 respectively for the parameters related to resources we picked values that are similar to a ciliate bacteria system i e r1 r2 2 5 k1 k2 50 e1 e2 0 3 laybourn and stewart 1975 ratkowsky et al 1982 fedrigo et al 2011 we also set f12 1 as it should not affect the competitive hierarchy second we used the same parameter set r1 r2 2 5 k1 k2 50 e1 e2 0 3 and f12 1 to assess whether ig prey and ig predator can stably coexist when calculating d z t o t d α 12 to study the effects of igp on consumer density finally to confirm that model results were robust to the above parameter values we individually increased and decreased c1 and m1 by 50 as well as increased and decreased ri ki e1 e2 and f12 by 30 in order to relax the identical resource assumption appendix b 3 results 3 1 species coexistence when resource partitioning is explicitly considered in the model we show that the effects of intra guild predation α 12 on consumer coexistence is not always disruptive and depends on the competitive hierarchy among consumers in fig 2 a we show that the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for consumer coexistence light gray region increases monotonically with intra guild predation which means igp always constrains consumer coexistence on the other hand in fig 2 b the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for consumer coexistence first decreases and then increases with intra guild predation this indicates that igp first facilitates consumer coexistence by lowering the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for stable coexistence but then constrains coexistence the two different effects of igp in fig 2 a and b depend on the competitive hierarchy between ig prey and predator fig 2 c in the upper triangle of fig 2 c white region the ig predator is the superior competitor because m 1 e 1 c 1 m 2 e 2 c 2 when the ig predator is the superior competitor some degree of resource partitioning is required to prevent the ig prey from being excluded without intra guild predation allowing intra guild predation will impose additional negative effects on the ig prey so more resource partitioning is required to prevent the ig prey from exclusion consequently the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for consumer coexistence always increases with intra guild predation in contrast in the lower triangle of fig 2 c dark gray region the ig prey is the superior competitor m 1 e 1 c 1 m 2 e 2 c 2 in this scenario the ig prey can outcompete the ig predator without intra guild predation therefore allowing weak to intermediate intra guild predation relaxes the ig predator from competition so that less resource partitioning is required for the ig prey and ig predator to coexist however as intra guild predation increases the negative impacts of predation on the ig prey becomes too severe so that a higher degree of resource partitioning is required to prevent the ig prey from exclusion as a result the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for coexistence first decreases and then increases with intra guild predation 3 2 total consumer density ztot total consumer density ztot changes with intra guild predation strength α 12 in two different fashions fig 3 a and b as we derived in appendix a under the assumption that e 1 e 2 and f 12 1 the effects of intra guild predation α 12 on total consumer density ztot depends on the sign of the following expression 5 e 1 s 1 c 1 k 1 e 1 1 s 1 c 1 k 2 m 1 e 2 s 2 c 2 k 2 e 2 1 s 2 c 2 k 1 m 2 when eq 5 is negative the sign of d z t o t d α 12 is first negative and then positive indicating that igp strength α 12 should first decrease and then increase total consumer density ztot otherwise the sign of d z t o t d α 12 is first positive and then negative indicating that igp strength should first increase and then decrease total consumer density see appendix a for detailed derivation in fig 3a and b we visualize the two effects of igp strength α 12 on the total consumer density ztot note that the patterns shown in fig 3 a and 3 b are truncated because the two consumers cannot coexistence if α 12 is beyond a certain threshold as shown in fig 2 for example eq 5 is negative in fig 3 a so theoretically ztot should first decrease and then increase with α 12 yet we do not see the increasing part because ig prey and predator cannot coexist when α 12 starts to increase ztot the criterion differentiating the two effects of igp strength on total consumer density i e eq 5 can be interpreted as the difference between the maximum growth potential of ig prey and ig predator the maximum growth potential is defined as the highest growth rate a consumer can potentially attain as shown in fig 3 c eq 5 is negative in the upper white region so that ig prey has lower maximum growth potential and intra guild predation α 12 will first decrease and then increase total consumer density ztot on the other hand eq 5 is positive in the lower dark gray region of fig 3 c so that ig prey has higher maximum growth potential and intra guild predation α 12 will first increase and then decrease total consumer density ztot finally from different line types in both fig 3 a and b we show that degree of resource partitioning si diminishes the effect of igp strength the more that consumers partition their resource use the less severe intra guild predation always decreases fig 3a or first increase and then decrease fig 3b total consumer density 3 3 effects of igp on coexistence and consumer density is decoupled the criteria for the positive effects of igp on consumer coexistence and on total consumer density are different fig 4 for consumer coexistence the criterion is the competitive hierarchy between ig prey and predator the dashed diagonal line in fig 4 while the criterion for total consumer density is the maximum growth potential i e eq 5 the solid slightly sloped line in fig 4 accordingly region 1 and 4 in fig 4 correspond to the dark gray region of fig 2 c where the ig prey is the superior competitor i e m 1 e 1 c 1 m 2 e 2 c 2 and weak to intermediate intra guild predation facilitates consumer coexistence in the opposite two regions 2 and 3 intra guild predation always constrains coexistence on the other hand region 3 and 4 in fig 4 correspond to the gray region in fig 3 c where the ig prey has higher maximum potential growth rate eq 5 is positive so that weak to intermediate intra guild predation positively affect total consumer density in the two contrasting regions 1 and 2 intra guild predation always has negative effects on total consumer density in conclusion weak to intermediate intra guild predation can have positive effects on consumer coexistence but this positive effect does not guarantee higher total consumer density e g in region 1 in fig 4 3 4 model results robustness first for the consumer coexistence we confirm that competitive hierarchy between ig prey and predator remains the primary criteria distinguishing the two effects of igp on consumer coexistence after varying c1 m1 e1 e2 and f12 fig b1 and fig b2 and relaxing the identical resource assumption left figure of each panel of fig b3 and fig b4 second for the two types of igp effects on total consumer density ztot the distinguishing criterion remains to be eq 5 after relaxing the identical resource assumption right figure of each panel of fig b3 and fig b4 finally the two criteria are fundamentally different because the criterion separating effects of igp on coexistence is about consumer s r and the other criterion is about consumer s maximum growth potential consequently the effects of igp on consumer coexistence and density are decoupled and should remain robust to parameter value selection 4 discussion resource partitioning and intra guild predation have been proposed to be two prominent factors that govern consumer coexistence and their collective density duffy et al 2007 schluter 1993 however seldom have theoretical studies simultaneously taken these two factors into account to study their joint impacts on consumer coexistence and total consumer density our model explicitly considers the two factors simultaneously and show that weak to intermediate levels of intra guild predation can make consumers more to coexistence more easily fig 2b and can increase total consumer density fig 3b however the model also shows that the positive effect of igp on consumer coexistence does not guarantee higher collective consumer density fig 4 in the following sections we compare the positive effect of intra guild predation on consumer coexistence in our model to previous theoretical studies that also show positive effects of intra guild predation on consumer population dynamics we then discuss the synergistic effects of intra guild predation and resource partitioning on total consumer density as no study has yet reported a positive effect of intra guild predation on consumer density lastly we discuss implications of the effects of intra guild predation on consumer coexistence being decoupled from its effect on consumer density fig 4 4 1 species coexistence our model shows that weak intra guild predation is not always a stabilizing factor for consumer coexistence fig 2 only when the ig prey is the superior competitor weak intra guild predation becomes a stabilizing factor because it lowers the minimum degree of resource partitioning that is required for coexistence fig 2b otherwise intra guild predation is always destabilizing fig 2a both our model and the classic igp model holt and polis 1997 demonstrate the importance of a competitive hierarchy in determining consumer coexistence in addition our finding that intra guild predation can be stabilizing is in line with previous theoretical studies that have analyzed the community matrix or implemented bifurcation analyses to demonstrate that intra guild predation can first stabilize and then destabilize the food web dynamics mccann and hastings 1997 mccann et al 1998 gellner and mccann 2012 the positive effects of intra guild predation on consumer coexistence might also be supported by some empirical studies although rarely do empirical studies explicitly manipulate the strength of intra guild predation some experiments that show ig prey and predator can coexist when intra guild predation is weakened by certain mechanisms such as ig prey taking advantage of habitat refuges from predators wissinger et al 2006 or ig prey defense behavior kratina et al 2010 based on our model and some implicit empirical evidence it seems plausible that weak to intermediate intra guild predation may be a stabilizing factor in food webs when the ig prey is the superior competitor the positive effect of weak intra guild predation on consumer coexistence might help explain why intra guild predation is common in diverse food webs arim and marquet 2004 thompson et al 2007 4 2 total consumer density ztot intra guild predation can also be beneficial to the total density of consumers in our model we show that weak to intermediate intra guild predation will increase total consumer density when the ig prey has higher maximum growth potential i e when eq 5 is positive when the ig prey has higher growth potential the ig prey can recover faster from consumption by moderately consuming the ig prey the ig predator can both directly increase its own density and release itself from resource competition however the more the ig prey and predator partition their resource use the less the ig predator will benefit from being released from competition more resource partitioning will therefore diminish the positive effects of igp on ig predator density consequently the total consumer density at the equilibrium will increase with weak to intermediate intra guild predation but such effects diminish as the degree of resource partitioning increase however the positive effect of intra guild predation on total consumer density should be interpreted with some caution to the best of our knowledge no other theoretical study has found a positive effect of intra guild predation on total consumer density theoretical works have long focused on the coexistence of ig prey and predator but have not focused on the density of consumers or their consumption on basal resources e g holt et al 1997 mccann et al 1998 second empirical studies rarely manipulate the strength of intra guild predation although non disruptive effects of intra guild predation total consumer density have sometimes been reported vance chalcraft et al 2007 however few empirical studies have demonstrated that the same animal species composition consumes more prey and attend higher collective density in structurally complex habitats where igp is less likely to occur snyder et al 2006 but not in structurally simple habitats straub and snyder 2006 this empirical evidence implies that intra guild predation may have a positive impact on total consumer density to better understand how intra guild predation strength impacts the density of consumers theoretical studies should focus more on the responses of consumer density and not just the stability of the food web moreover more empirical studies are needed to examine the effects of intra guild predation strength per se and not just the occurrence of intra guild predation on the density of the consumer community 4 3 effects of igp on coexistence and community density are decoupled according to our model the criterion for intra guild predation to have a positive impact on consumer coexistence differs from that for total consumer density fig 4 the separate criteria for coexistence and total consumer density suggest that coexistence does not guarantee higher density by decoupling consumer coexistence and their community density our study offers an important view to understand species coexistence and their collective density modern coexistence theory chesson 2000 predicts that when species coexist either through increasing niche difference or through decreasing relative fitness difference higher total density should be attained in a system carroll et al 2011 turnbull et al 2013 however modern coexistence theory assumes that competition is the only inter specific interaction that occurs among species when intra guild predation occurs in a community the belief that species coexistence always leads to a higher density of the community needs to be re evaluated our model demonstrates that weak intra guild predation can facilitate species coexistence but will either increase or decrease total animal density depending on the biological characteristics of the ig prey and predator it is therefore important to consider these complex interactions or other complex feeding behaviors that cannot be accurately modeled by a linear functional response when studying the factors mediating the density of animal communities consequently we call for a closer combination of theoretical and empirical works to better link consumer coexistence and the density of a consumer community with the underlying complex inter specific interactions among animals author credit feng

summed density of ig prey and predator at the coexistence equilibrium ztot and investigate how it is affected by intra guild predation α 12 to do so we first show the analytical solution of the four

substitute r 1 and r 2 in eq a 3 and a 4 with our expression and derive the following two equations a 5 e 1 s 1 c 1 k 1 e 1 1 s 1 c 1 k 2 m 1 e 1 s 1 2 c 1 2 k 1 z 1 r 1 e 1 s 1 1 s 2 c 1 c 2 k 1 z 2

ig prey ig predator and their total density i e z 1 z 2 and ztot respectively can be solved in terms of a b c d μ 1 and μ 2 as a 9 z 1 μ 2 b α 12 μ 1 d c f 12 α 12 b α 12 a d a 10 z 2 μ 1 c f 12 α 12

of α 12 on ztot we need to study the sign of eq a 12 which is determined by its numerator because the denominator is always positive in addition eq a 12 will not have vertical asymptotes if e 1 e 2

these two roots and 3 the opening of g α 12 if g α 12 does not have two real roots its direction of opening determines whether eq a 12 will be always positive or always negative if g α 12 concaves up or down it will be always positive or negative so that ztot will always increase or decrease with α 12 if g α 12 does have two real roots the opening of g α 12 determines how the sign of eq a 12 changes with α 12 if g α 12 is a concave upward function eq a 12 will first be positive then negative and finally positive again with increasing α 12 if g α 12 is a concave downward function eq a 12 will first be negative then positive and finally negative again therefore the opening of g α 12 determines how ztot is being affected by α 12 if g α 12 concaves up increasing α 12 will first cause ztot to increase then decrease and finally increase again in contrast if g α 12 concaves down increasing α 12 will cause ztot to first decrease then increase and finally decrease again finally in addition to the opening direction of g α 12 we also need to consider the sign of its two roots because the domain of g α 12 should be restricted to α 12 0 i e the strength of intra guild predation cannot be negative first we can judge if the two roots are real numbers with the discriminant of g α 12 the two roots are real numbers when the discriminant is positive let a f 12 f 12 μ 1 μ 2 b 2 f 12 c d μ 1 b a μ 2 and c f 12 μ 1 μ 2 a d b c b f 12 c c d μ 1 b a μ 2 the discriminant can be expressed as follow a 13 b 2 4 a c 4 f 12 2 c d μ 1 b a μ 2 2 4 f 12 f 12 μ 1 μ 2 f 12 μ 1 μ 2 a d b c b f 12 c c d μ 1 b a μ 2 with the assumption that e 1 e 2 and f 12 1 eq a 13 can be simplified because b f 12 c 0 as a 14 b 2 4 a c 4 c d μ 1 b a μ 2 2 4 μ 1 μ 2 2 a d b c eq a 14 is always positive because both the squared terms and a d b c are positive this means that g α 12 will always have two real roots which means α 12 will either increase decrease and then increase ztot or decrease increase and then decrease ztot depending on the opening of g α 12 we then went on to judge the sign of the two real roots the sign of the two roots can be judged by the product of the two roots c a a d b c f 12 which is negative since a d b c is positive this means g α 12 has one positive α and one negative real root α however negative α 12 are beyond our discussion because intra guild predation cannot be negative accordingly increasing α 12 will cause ztot to either first increase and then decrease if g α 12 concaves down or first decrease and then if g α 12 concaves up finally the opening direction of g α 12 is determined by the sign of a g α 12 concaves down if f 12 μ 1 μ 2 but concaves up if f 12 μ 1 μ 2 replacing μ 1 and μ 2 with the parameters of the model when f 12 μ 1 μ 2 which means f 12 e 1 s 1 c 1 k 1 e 1 1 s 1 c 1 k 2 m 1 e 2 s 2 c 2 k 2 e 2 1 s 2 c 2 k 1 m 2 intra guild predation α 12 will first increase and then decrease total animal density ztot however there must exist a threshold of α 12 beyond which the intra guild predation is too strong to allow the four species to coexist i e the coexistence equilibrium is no longer stable on the other hand when f 12 μ 1

there must exist a threshold of α 12 beyond which the intra guild predation is too strong to allow the four species to coexist therefore it is possible that for the intra guild predation α 12 to only decrease total animal density ztot appendix b in this appendix we show a serious of figures demonstrating sensitivity analyses mentioned in section 2 3 parameter value selection first we assess whether the competitive hierarchy is still the criterion distinguishing always negative and first positive and then negative effect of igp on consumer coexistence when increasing and decreasing m1 and c1 by 50 and ei and f12 by 30 m1 0 5 or 1 5 c1 0 5 or 1 5 e1 0 2 or 0 4 e2 0 2 or 0 4 and f12 0 7 from fig b1 and fig b2 we see that boundary in these figures all correspond to the competition hierarchy between ig prey and predator the unshaded upper triangle is where ig prey is the inferior competitor m 2 e 2 c 2 m 1 e 1 c 1 so that igp is always detrimental to consumer coexistence in the shaded triangle ig predator is the inferior competitor m 2 e 2 c 2 m 1 e 1 c 1 so that igp can first enhance and then undermine coexistence in addition in fig b3 and fig b4 we relaxed the identical resource assumption by varying ri and ki specifically we independently increase and decrease ri and ki by 30 r1 1 75 or 3 25 r2 1 75 or 3 25 k1 35 or 65 and k2 35 or 65 to see if competitive hierarchy is still the criterion separating two types of igp effects on coexistence left figure of each panel and maximum growth potential is still the criterion separating two types of igp effects on consumer density right figure of each panels regarding consumer coexistence competitive hierarchy is still the primary criterion separating always negative and first positive and then negative effect of igp left figure of each panel however because the resources are not identical the competitive hierarchy is determined by resources rates along with consumers consumption and mortality for the two types of igp effects on consumer density the distinguishing criterion was not affected by resources growth rate ri right figure of each panel of fig b3 but their carrying capacity ki right figure of each panel of fig b4 this indicated that eq 5 remains the criterion separating the two effects of igp on total consumer density ztot 
24867,in plant communities resource partitioning has been shown to facilitate species coexistence and in turn enhance community density such positive effects of resource partitioning in higher trophic levels are not as obvious possibly due to the occurrence of intra guild predation igp we thus built a model to explore the joint effects of igp and resource partitioning on consumer coexistence and their collective density as rarely have studies investigated this joint effect the model consists of two prey resources that do not directly compete with each other and two consumers that are engaged in igp and can partition their use of the two prey resources this model shows that the effects of igp on consumer coexistence depend on which consumer requires the lower resource density to persist when the ig predator is the inferior competitor weak igp enhances coexistence by lowering the minimum degree of partitioning that is required for coexistence otherwise igp always constrains coexistence in addition the effects of igp on total consumer density ztot depends on which consumer has the lower maximum growth potential defined as the difference between their maximum growth rate and mortality weak igp increases ztot when the ig predator has lower maximum growth potential otherwise igp always decreases ztot last the criterion for igp to have positive effects on consumer coexistence and ztot are different our results show that weak to intermediate strengths of intra guild predation can facilitate consumer coexistence and total community density but consumer coexistence does not guarantee higher consumer density keywords intra guild predation igp interaction strength biodiversity species coexistence community density 1 introduction competition among species for limited resources is thought to be one of if not the most important inter specific interactions that lead species to partition their resources in space or time in order to coexist chesson 2000 hutchinson 1961 1957 when competing species minimize competition through resource partitioning theoretical studies most of which developed for plant communities have demonstrated that the communities with more species can attain higher community functions like more efficient resources use or higher total biomass tilman et al 1997 loreau 1998 loreau and hector 2001 positive effects of resource partitioning on both species coexistence and community function are believed to also exist in consumer communities macarthur 1958 schluter 1993 for example studies of eel grass systems have shown that more coexisting herbivores species often consumes more algae and thus leads to higher total herbivore biomass duffy et al 2015 2003 stachowicz et al 2007 this positive effect of diverse herbivore species on biomass is believed to result from the fact that different grazer species tend to partition their resource use by occupying different microhabitats and in turn allowing them to partition space by foraging on different parts of the eel grass while there is evidence that resource partitioning influences both consumer coexistence and the function of a consumer community it is important to recognize that resource partitioning is not the only factor other factors include predator predator interaction modifications sih et al 1998 predator predator facilitation losey and denno 1998 intra guild predation polis et al 1989 polis and holt 1992 and other forms of omnivory pimm and lawton 1978 among these intra guild predation is particularly widespread type of interaction with 86 or more of the taxa in a food web involved in intra guild predation arim and marquet 2004 intra guild predation igp occurs when one species the intra guild ig predator feeds on another one the intra guild ig prey with which it also competes for a shared resource polis et al 1989 polis and holt 1992 some theoretical studies suggest that igp can promote the coexistence of consumers but only under specific conditions for example the classic igp model consisting of one basal resource an ig prey and ig predator has shown that the ig prey must be superior in resource competition in order for both species to coexist assessed by the species r defined as the resource level at which population growth rate is zero holt and polis 1997 this prediction has been supported by more complicated igp models mylius et al 2001 kuijper et al 2003 tanabe and namba 2005 as well as by empirical studies that have focused on simple food web configurations morin 1999 diehl and feißel 2000 2001 theoretical studies further suggest that igp may be detrimental to the function of a consumer community the function of a consumer community is often measured as the summed density of consumers or their resources in many modeling studies so that predictions are not subject to specific assumptions about how densities are converted to biomass most models predict that igp reduces total consumer density and in turn basal resources are relieved from consumption holt and polis 1997 revilla 2002 rosenheim et al 1995 and references therein this prediction makes intuitive sense as predation pressure on ig prey releases the basal resource from top down control due to a trophic cascade which is a prediction that has generally been supported by the balance of empirical studies vance chalcraft et al 2007 in the current study we also use the total density of consumers as a proxy for ecological function as this is how prior studies have examined igp influence on community level properties of the consumers and their top down control over prey to date the joint impacts of resource partitioning and igp on consumer coexistence and density have not been explicitly studied theoretically but see holt and huxel 2007 in fact coexistence predictions of the classic igp model were developed under the assumption that the ig prey and predator overlap completely in their resource usage holt and polis 1997 yet when resource partitioning has been allowed to occur in empirical studies either via the use of alternative prey species liess and diehl 2006 novak 2013 or via spatial temporal separation of habitat amarasekare 2007a 2007b predictions about consumer coexistence from the classic igp model have not been supported this suggests that impacts of igp on coexistence depend on how resource partitioning influences competition among the igp prey and predator when resource partitioning is allowed empirical evidence also lies at odds with the prediction of the classic igp model regarding the detrimental effect of igp on total consumer density several studies suggest that when the ig prey and ig predator partition their resources detrimental effects of igp on the ig prey can be alleviated to the point that the ig predator reaches higher density and suppresses the basal resources more janssen et al 2007 messelink and janssen 2014 consequently it is important to study the relative importance of resource partitioning versus igp in mediating consumer coexistence as well as density if we were to manage the population dynamics and ensuing functions of consumer community duffy et al 2007 currently there are few theoretical studies that explicitly bring together resource partitioning and igp into a single model to determine how they jointly impact consumer coexistence and total consumer density but see daugherty et al 2007 holt and huxel 2007 to this end we built a model with two consumers engaged in igp and resource competition for two basal prey species by doing so we were able to vary the strength of igp and resource partitioning simultaneously which allowed us to accomplish two objectives first it allowed us to understand how species coexistence is simultaneously affected by the strength of igp and by resource partitioning based on the general conclusion of most studies of igp we anticipated that igp would constrain consumer coexistence and that the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for coexistence would monotonically increase igp strength resource partitioning on the other hand was expected to alleviate the detrimental effects of igp on species coexistence the second objective is to understand the joint effects of igp strength and resource partitioning on total consumer density at equilibrium where species coexist we anticipated that the strength of igp would always suppress total consumer density but such negative effect would diminish with the increase of resource partitioning 2 model and analyses 2 1 model description the model contained two resource species r1 and r2 as well as two consumer species ig prey z1 and ig predator z2 that are engaged in igp fig 1 the population dynamics of the four species were described by four ordinary differential equations 1 d r 1 d t r 1 r 1 1 r 1 k 1 s 1 c 1 r 1 z 1 1 s 2 c 2 r 1 z 2 2 d r 2 d t r 2 r 2 1 r 2 k 2 1 s 1 c 1 r 2 z 1 s 2 c 2 r 2 z 2 3 d z 1 d t e 1 s 1 c 1 r 1 z 1 e 1 1 s 1 c 1 r 2 z 1 α 12 z 1 z 2 m 1 z 1 4 d z 2 d t e 2 1 s 2 c 2 r 1 z 2 e 2 s 2 c 2 r 2 z 2 f 12 α 12 z 1 z 2 m 2 z 2 eqs 1 and 2 described the dynamics of the two shared resource species r1 and r2 which grow logistically with intrinsic growth rates r1 and r2 and carrying capacities k1 and k2 both shared resource species were consumed by ig prey z1 and ig predator z2 following a linear functional response with maximum consumption rate ci the si parameter manipulated the degree of resource partitioning for example when s1 s2 0 or 1 the ig prey and predator were complete specialists consuming resource r2 or r1 and r1 or r2 respectively when s1 s2 0 5 both ig prey and predator are complete generalists consuming equal amount of both resource species eqs 3 and 4 described the dynamics of ig prey z1 and ig predator z2 the per capita growth rate of the two consumers were linearly related to consumption rate ci times the assimilation efficiency ei ig prey was also consumed by ig predator with the intra guild predation rate of α 12 and the assimilation efficiency of f12 both animal consumer species had a density independent mortality mi 2 2 model analyses 2 2 1 species coexistence our first objective is to understand the interactive effects of intra guild predation and resource partitioning on species coexistence we began by analytically solving eq 1 through 4 for the non trivial equilibrium where all four species coexist at positive densities we then numerically studied the sign of the leading eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix of the non trivial equilibrium in a parameter space consisting of igp strength α 12 from 0 to 1 and the resource partitioning si from 0 to 0 5 indicating 100 to 0 partitioning specifically we studied how increasing α 12 affects the minimum degree of si needed to generate negative real parts for the leading eigenvalue and thus guarantee stable coexistence if α 12 always increase the minimum degree of si that guarantees stable coexistence then igp has detrimental impacts on consumer coexistence because resource partitioning si is required we then performed the above analysis under different competitive hierarchy scenarios among the two consumers because the competitive hierarchy is known to determine species coexistence holt and polis 1997 consumers competitive hierarchy determines which consumer can outcompete the other one if competition is the only interaction among consumers therefore consumers competitive hierarchy is defined as their r i e the minimum resource level that still allows consumers to persist such that the consmer with lower r reguires lower resource level to persist and thus can outcompete the other one consequently the consumer with lower r is regard as the superior competitor to manipulate competitive hierarchy we assumed that the two shared resource species are identical to the two consumers e1 e2 and s1 s2 making this assumption allowed us to focus only on the benefits of reducing competition via resource partitioning if two resource species were not identical the consumer who prefers the resource with high growth rate may gain additional benefits by consuming that resource under these assumptions m i e i c i directly determined the competitive hierarchy by fixing the consumption c1 and mortality m1 of the ig prey and varying that of the ig predator we manipulated competition hierarchy and then investigated how igp strength affects consumer coexistence 2 2 2 total consumer density ztot to address how intra guild predation and resource partitioning affects total consumer density ztot we performed a two step analysis first we mathematically analyze how the sum of the two consumer densities at the equilibrium ztot responds to igp α 12 to do so we took the derivative of ztot with respective to the α 12 i e d z t o t d α 12 and used this derivative to describe how total consumer density changes with igp if the derivative is negative positive then α 12 will decrease increase ztot note that in addition to analytically calculating d z t o t d α 12 we also numerically make sure that ig prey and ig predator can stably coexist by performing linear stability analysis see above we performed these analyses across the same parameter space of c2 and m2 2 2 3 parameter value selection first to study the effects of igp strength α 12 and resource partitioning si on species coexistence we created the competitive hierarchy by fixing both c1 and m1 at 1 and varying c2 and m2 between 0 5 and 1 5 respectively for the parameters related to resources we picked values that are similar to a ciliate bacteria system i e r1 r2 2 5 k1 k2 50 e1 e2 0 3 laybourn and stewart 1975 ratkowsky et al 1982 fedrigo et al 2011 we also set f12 1 as it should not affect the competitive hierarchy second we used the same parameter set r1 r2 2 5 k1 k2 50 e1 e2 0 3 and f12 1 to assess whether ig prey and ig predator can stably coexist when calculating d z t o t d α 12 to study the effects of igp on consumer density finally to confirm that model results were robust to the above parameter values we individually increased and decreased c1 and m1 by 50 as well as increased and decreased ri ki e1 e2 and f12 by 30 in order to relax the identical resource assumption appendix b 3 results 3 1 species coexistence when resource partitioning is explicitly considered in the model we show that the effects of intra guild predation α 12 on consumer coexistence is not always disruptive and depends on the competitive hierarchy among consumers in fig 2 a we show that the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for consumer coexistence light gray region increases monotonically with intra guild predation which means igp always constrains consumer coexistence on the other hand in fig 2 b the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for consumer coexistence first decreases and then increases with intra guild predation this indicates that igp first facilitates consumer coexistence by lowering the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for stable coexistence but then constrains coexistence the two different effects of igp in fig 2 a and b depend on the competitive hierarchy between ig prey and predator fig 2 c in the upper triangle of fig 2 c white region the ig predator is the superior competitor because m 1 e 1 c 1 m 2 e 2 c 2 when the ig predator is the superior competitor some degree of resource partitioning is required to prevent the ig prey from being excluded without intra guild predation allowing intra guild predation will impose additional negative effects on the ig prey so more resource partitioning is required to prevent the ig prey from exclusion consequently the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for consumer coexistence always increases with intra guild predation in contrast in the lower triangle of fig 2 c dark gray region the ig prey is the superior competitor m 1 e 1 c 1 m 2 e 2 c 2 in this scenario the ig prey can outcompete the ig predator without intra guild predation therefore allowing weak to intermediate intra guild predation relaxes the ig predator from competition so that less resource partitioning is required for the ig prey and ig predator to coexist however as intra guild predation increases the negative impacts of predation on the ig prey becomes too severe so that a higher degree of resource partitioning is required to prevent the ig prey from exclusion as a result the minimum degree of resource partitioning required for coexistence first decreases and then increases with intra guild predation 3 2 total consumer density ztot total consumer density ztot changes with intra guild predation strength α 12 in two different fashions fig 3 a and b as we derived in appendix a under the assumption that e 1 e 2 and f 12 1 the effects of intra guild predation α 12 on total consumer density ztot depends on the sign of the following expression 5 e 1 s 1 c 1 k 1 e 1 1 s 1 c 1 k 2 m 1 e 2 s 2 c 2 k 2 e 2 1 s 2 c 2 k 1 m 2 when eq 5 is negative the sign of d z t o t d α 12 is first negative and then positive indicating that igp strength α 12 should first decrease and then increase total consumer density ztot otherwise the sign of d z t o t d α 12 is first positive and then negative indicating that igp strength should first increase and then decrease total consumer density see appendix a for detailed derivation in fig 3a and b we visualize the two effects of igp strength α 12 on the total consumer density ztot note that the patterns shown in fig 3 a and 3 b are truncated because the two consumers cannot coexistence if α 12 is beyond a certain threshold as shown in fig 2 for example eq 5 is negative in fig 3 a so theoretically ztot should first decrease and then increase with α 12 yet we do not see the increasing part because ig prey and predator cannot coexist when α 12 starts to increase ztot the criterion differentiating the two effects of igp strength on total consumer density i e eq 5 can be interpreted as the difference between the maximum growth potential of ig prey and ig predator the maximum growth potential is defined as the highest growth rate a consumer can potentially attain as shown in fig 3 c eq 5 is negative in the upper white region so that ig prey has lower maximum growth potential and intra guild predation α 12 will first decrease and then increase total consumer density ztot on the other hand eq 5 is positive in the lower dark gray region of fig 3 c so that ig prey has higher maximum growth potential and intra guild predation α 12 will first increase and then decrease total consumer density ztot finally from different line types in both fig 3 a and b we show that degree of resource partitioning si diminishes the effect of igp strength the more that consumers partition their resource use the less severe intra guild predation always decreases fig 3a or first increase and then decrease fig 3b total consumer density 3 3 effects of igp on coexistence and consumer density is decoupled the criteria for the positive effects of igp on consumer coexistence and on total consumer density are different fig 4 for consumer coexistence the criterion is the competitive hierarchy between ig prey and predator the dashed diagonal line in fig 4 while the criterion for total consumer density is the maximum growth potential i e eq 5 the solid slightly sloped line in fig 4 accordingly region 1 and 4 in fig 4 correspond to the dark gray region of fig 2 c where the ig prey is the superior competitor i e m 1 e 1 c 1 m 2 e 2 c 2 and weak to intermediate intra guild predation facilitates consumer coexistence in the opposite two regions 2 and 3 intra guild predation always constrains coexistence on the other hand region 3 and 4 in fig 4 correspond to the gray region in fig 3 c where the ig prey has higher maximum potential growth rate eq 5 is positive so that weak to intermediate intra guild predation positively affect total consumer density in the two contrasting regions 1 and 2 intra guild predation always has negative effects on total consumer density in conclusion weak to intermediate intra guild predation can have positive effects on consumer coexistence but this positive effect does not guarantee higher total consumer density e g in region 1 in fig 4 3 4 model results robustness first for the consumer coexistence we confirm that competitive hierarchy between ig prey and predator remains the primary criteria distinguishing the two effects of igp on consumer coexistence after varying c1 m1 e1 e2 and f12 fig b1 and fig b2 and relaxing the identical resource assumption left figure of each panel of fig b3 and fig b4 second for the two types of igp effects on total consumer density ztot the distinguishing criterion remains to be eq 5 after relaxing the identical resource assumption right figure of each panel of fig b3 and fig b4 finally the two criteria are fundamentally different because the criterion separating effects of igp on coexistence is about consumer s r and the other criterion is about consumer s maximum growth potential consequently the effects of igp on consumer coexistence and density are decoupled and should remain robust to parameter value selection 4 discussion resource partitioning and intra guild predation have been proposed to be two prominent factors that govern consumer coexistence and their collective density duffy et al 2007 schluter 1993 however seldom have theoretical studies simultaneously taken these two factors into account to study their joint impacts on consumer coexistence and total consumer density our model explicitly considers the two factors simultaneously and show that weak to intermediate levels of intra guild predation can make consumers more to coexistence more easily fig 2b and can increase total consumer density fig 3b however the model also shows that the positive effect of igp on consumer coexistence does not guarantee higher collective consumer density fig 4 in the following sections we compare the positive effect of intra guild predation on consumer coexistence in our model to previous theoretical studies that also show positive effects of intra guild predation on consumer population dynamics we then discuss the synergistic effects of intra guild predation and resource partitioning on total consumer density as no study has yet reported a positive effect of intra guild predation on consumer density lastly we discuss implications of the effects of intra guild predation on consumer coexistence being decoupled from its effect on consumer density fig 4 4 1 species coexistence our model shows that weak intra guild predation is not always a stabilizing factor for consumer coexistence fig 2 only when the ig prey is the superior competitor weak intra guild predation becomes a stabilizing factor because it lowers the minimum degree of resource partitioning that is required for coexistence fig 2b otherwise intra guild predation is always destabilizing fig 2a both our model and the classic igp model holt and polis 1997 demonstrate the importance of a competitive hierarchy in determining consumer coexistence in addition our finding that intra guild predation can be stabilizing is in line with previous theoretical studies that have analyzed the community matrix or implemented bifurcation analyses to demonstrate that intra guild predation can first stabilize and then destabilize the food web dynamics mccann and hastings 1997 mccann et al 1998 gellner and mccann 2012 the positive effects of intra guild predation on consumer coexistence might also be supported by some empirical studies although rarely do empirical studies explicitly manipulate the strength of intra guild predation some experiments that show ig prey and predator can coexist when intra guild predation is weakened by certain mechanisms such as ig prey taking advantage of habitat refuges from predators wissinger et al 2006 or ig prey defense behavior kratina et al 2010 based on our model and some implicit empirical evidence it seems plausible that weak to intermediate intra guild predation may be a stabilizing factor in food webs when the ig prey is the superior competitor the positive effect of weak intra guild predation on consumer coexistence might help explain why intra guild predation is common in diverse food webs arim and marquet 2004 thompson et al 2007 4 2 total consumer density ztot intra guild predation can also be beneficial to the total density of consumers in our model we show that weak to intermediate intra guild predation will increase total consumer density when the ig prey has higher maximum growth potential i e when eq 5 is positive when the ig prey has higher growth potential the ig prey can recover faster from consumption by moderately consuming the ig prey the ig predator can both directly increase its own density and release itself from resource competition however the more the ig prey and predator partition their resource use the less the ig predator will benefit from being released from competition more resource partitioning will therefore diminish the positive effects of igp on ig predator density consequently the total consumer density at the equilibrium will increase with weak to intermediate intra guild predation but such effects diminish as the degree of resource partitioning increase however the positive effect of intra guild predation on total consumer density should be interpreted with some caution to the best of our knowledge no other theoretical study has found a positive effect of intra guild predation on total consumer density theoretical works have long focused on the coexistence of ig prey and predator but have not focused on the density of consumers or their consumption on basal resources e g holt et al 1997 mccann et al 1998 second empirical studies rarely manipulate the strength of intra guild predation although non disruptive effects of intra guild predation total consumer density have sometimes been reported vance chalcraft et al 2007 however few empirical studies have demonstrated that the same animal species composition consumes more prey and attend higher collective density in structurally complex habitats where igp is less likely to occur snyder et al 2006 but not in structurally simple habitats straub and snyder 2006 this empirical evidence implies that intra guild predation may have a positive impact on total consumer density to better understand how intra guild predation strength impacts the density of consumers theoretical studies should focus more on the responses of consumer density and not just the stability of the food web moreover more empirical studies are needed to examine the effects of intra guild predation strength per se and not just the occurrence of intra guild predation on the density of the consumer community 4 3 effects of igp on coexistence and community density are decoupled according to our model the criterion for intra guild predation to have a positive impact on consumer coexistence differs from that for total consumer density fig 4 the separate criteria for coexistence and total consumer density suggest that coexistence does not guarantee higher density by decoupling consumer coexistence and their community density our study offers an important view to understand species coexistence and their collective density modern coexistence theory chesson 2000 predicts that when species coexist either through increasing niche difference or through decreasing relative fitness difference higher total density should be attained in a system carroll et al 2011 turnbull et al 2013 however modern coexistence theory assumes that competition is the only inter specific interaction that occurs among species when intra guild predation occurs in a community the belief that species coexistence always leads to a higher density of the community needs to be re evaluated our model demonstrates that weak intra guild predation can facilitate species coexistence but will either increase or decrease total animal density depending on the biological characteristics of the ig prey and predator it is therefore important to consider these complex interactions or other complex feeding behaviors that cannot be accurately modeled by a linear functional response when studying the factors mediating the density of animal communities consequently we call for a closer combination of theoretical and empirical works to better link consumer coexistence and the density of a consumer community with the underlying complex inter specific interactions among animals author credit feng

summed density of ig prey and predator at the coexistence equilibrium ztot and investigate how it is affected by intra guild predation α 12 to do so we first show the analytical solution of the four

ig prey ig predator and their total density i e z 1 z 2 and ztot respectively can be solved in terms of a b c d μ 1 and μ 2 as a 9 z 1 μ 2 b α 12 μ 1 d c f 12 α 12 b α 12 a d a 10 z 2 μ 1 c f 12 α 12

12 and f 12 which simplifies later calculations as we are interested in how total consumer density ztot is affected by the strength of intra guild predation α 12 we can define ztot as a function of α 12 i e f α 12 and take its derivative in respect to α 12 a 12 d z t o t d α 12 d f α 12 d α 12 f 12 f 12 μ 1 μ 2 α 12 2 2 f 12 c d μ 1 b a μ 2 α 12 f 12 μ 1 μ 2 a d b c b f 12 c c d μ 1 b a μ 2 c f 12 α 12 b α 12 a d 2 mathematically ztot will increase with α 12 in the range of α 12 that lets eq a 12 0 but will decrease with α 12 if eq a 12 0 to address our second hypothesis regarding the effects of α 12 on ztot we need to study the sign of eq a 12 which is determined by its numerator because the denominator is always positive in addition eq a 12 will not have vertical asymptotes if e 1 e 2 and f 12 1 this is because b c under these simplifications and the denominator becomes f 12 α 12 2 a d b c 2 since the term within the bracket will always be negative because a d b c k 1 k 2 r 1 r 2 e 1 e 2 c 1 2 c 2 2 1 s 1 s 2 2 0 it will have no real roots and the denominator of eq a 12 will always be defined i e no vertical asymptotes for analytical tractability we follow the assumption that e 1 e 2 and f 12 1 and focus on the numerator of eq a 12 which from here we define as g α 12 the next step is to judge 1 if g α 12 which is a quadratic function of α 12 has two real roots 2 the sign of these two roots and 3 the opening of g α 12 if g α 12 does not have two real roots its direction of opening determines whether eq a 12 will be always positive or always negative if g α 12 concaves up or down it will be always positive or negative so that ztot will always increase or decrease with α 12 if g α 12 does have two real roots the opening of g α 12 determines how the sign of eq a 12 changes with α 12 if g α 12 is a concave upward function eq a 12 will first be positive then negative and finally positive again with increasing α 12 if g α 12 is a concave downward function eq a 12 will first be negative then positive and finally negative again therefore the opening of g α 12 determines how ztot is being affected by α 12 if g α 12 concaves up increasing α 12 will first cause ztot to increase then decrease and finally increase again in contrast if g α 12 concaves down increasing α 12 will cause ztot to first decrease then increase and finally decrease again finally in addition to the opening direction of g α 12 we also need to consider the sign of its two roots because the domain of g α 12 should be restricted to α 12 0 i e the strength of intra guild predation cannot be negative first we can judge if the two roots are real numbers with the discriminant of g α 12 the two roots are real numbers when the discriminant is positive let a f 12 f 12 μ 1 μ 2 b 2 f 12 c d μ 1 b a μ 2 and c f 12 μ 1 μ 2 a d b c b f 12 c c d μ 1 b a μ 2 the discriminant can be expressed as follow a 13 b 2 4 a c 4 f 12 2 c d μ 1 b a μ 2 2 4 f 12 f 12 μ 1 μ 2 f 12 μ 1 μ 2 a d b c b f 12 c c d μ 1 b a μ 2 with the assumption that e 1 e 2 and f 12 1 eq a 13 can be simplified because b f 12 c 0 as a 14 b 2 4 a c 4 c d μ 1 b a μ 2 2 4 μ 1 μ 2 2 a d b c eq a 14 is always positive because both the squared terms and a d b c are positive this means that g α 12 will always have two real roots which means α 12 will either increase decrease and then increase ztot or decrease increase and then decrease ztot depending on the opening of g α 12 we then went on to judge the sign of the two real roots the sign of the two roots can be judged by the product of the two roots c a a d b c f 12 which is negative since a d b c is positive this means g α 12 has one positive α and one negative real root α however negative α 12 are beyond our discussion because intra guild predation cannot be negative accordingly increasing α 12 will cause ztot to either first increase and then decrease if g α 12 concaves down or first decrease and then if g α 12 concaves up finally the opening direction of g α 12 is determined by the sign of a g α 12 concaves down if f 12 μ 1 μ 2 but concaves up if f 12 μ 1 μ 2 replacing μ 1 and μ 2 with the parameters of the model when f 12 μ 1 μ 2 which means f 12 e 1 s 1 c 1 k 1 e 1 1 s 1 c 1 k 2 m 1 e 2 s 2 c 2 k 2 e 2 1 s 2 c 2 k 1 m 2 intra guild predation α 12 will first increase and then decrease total animal density ztot however there must exist a threshold of α 12 beyond which the intra guild predation is too strong to allow the four species to coexist i e the coexistence equilibrium is no longer stable on the other hand when f 12 μ 1 μ 2 which means f 12 e 1 s 1 c 1 k 1 e 1 1 s 1 c 1 k 2 m 1 e 2 s 2 c 2 k 2 e 2 1 s 2 c 2 k 1 m 2 intra guild predation α 12 will first decrease and then increase total animal density ztot similarly there must exist a threshold of α 12 beyond which the intra guild predation is too strong to allow the four species to coexist therefore it is possible that for the intra guild predation α 12 to only decrease total animal density ztot appendix b in this appendix we show a serious of figures demonstrating sensitivity analyses mentioned in section 2 3 parameter value selection first we assess whether the competitive hierarchy is still the criterion distinguishing always negative and first positive and then negative effect of igp on consumer coexistence when increasing and decreasing m1 and c1 by 50 and ei and f12 by 30 m1 0 5 or 1 5 c1 0 5 or 1 5 e1 0 2 or 0 4 e2 0 2 or 0 4 and f12 0 7 from fig b1 and fig b2 we see that boundary in these figures all correspond to the competition hierarchy between ig prey and predator the unshaded upper triangle is where ig prey is the inferior competitor m 2 e 2 c 2 m 1 e 1 c 1 so that igp is always detrimental to consumer coexistence in the shaded triangle ig predator is the inferior competitor m 2 e 2 c 2 m 1 e 1 c 1 so that igp can first enhance and then undermine coexistence in addition in fig b3 and fig b4 we relaxed the identical resource assumption by varying ri and ki specifically we independently increase and decrease ri and ki by 30 r1 1 75 or 3 25 r2 1 75 or 3 25 k1 35 or 65 and k2 35 or 65 to see if competitive hierarchy is still the criterion separating two types of igp effects on coexistence left figure of each panel and maximum growth potential is still the criterion separating two types of igp effects on consumer density right figure of each panels regarding consumer coexistence competitive hierarchy is still the primary criterion separating always negative and first positive and then negative effect of igp left figure of each panel however because the resources are not identical the competitive hierarchy is determined by resources rates along with consumers consumption and mortality for the two types of igp effects on consumer density the distinguishing criterion was not affected by resources growth rate ri right figure of each panel of fig b3 but their carrying capacity ki right figure of each panel of fig b4 this indicated that eq 5 remains the criterion separating the two effects of igp on total consumer density ztot 
24868,the use of emergy to evaluate the sustainability of greenhouse systems leads to management recommendations to increase the sustainability of production in these systems in this study four greenhouse systems for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production located in jiroft city iran were evaluated using emergy sustainability indices to accomplish this study 56 31 19 and 12 greenhouses were selected for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production respectively analysis of twelve emergy indices and a study of the social characteristics of the producers using analytic hierarchy analysis showed that the sustainability of the cucumber production system was greater than that of the other three systems the calculated unit emergy values for economic yield ueve generally indicated that greenhouse systems were at least 100 times more sustainable than open farm systems for the production of different products primarily because of drastically reduced soil erosion the highest 5 10e 04 sej j 1 4 96e 04 5 25e 04 and lowest 7 27e 03 sej j 1 7 09e 03 7 45e 03 ueve values were calculated for the bell pepper and cucumber systems respectively also cucumber producers had greenhouses with larger areas compared to the greenhouses used for the other crops examined in this study the physiological characteristics of cucumber plants resulted in greater sustainability of this system because the plants were able to capture more of the free renewable energy had a higher production potential and this production system made more efficient use of the workforce in contrast the highest proportion of purchased non renewable resources reduced the sustainability of the eggplant production system compared to the other systems studied therefore selection of a plant with more potential to use free local environmental energy higher yield and more efficient use of labor will lead to greater sustainability of greenhouse vegetable production systems sustainability can also be increased by paying attention to the socio technical characteristics of the producers the use of technologies to reduce non renewable inputs to the greenhouse building and by reducing the proportion of non renewable inputs used overall keywords greenhouse systems emergy indices vegetables intensive farming environmental burden sustainability assessment 1 introduction in iran due to its dry climatic conditions limited water resources and erosion of high quality soil under cultivation greenhouse production has been considered as a solution for better use of production resources because it achieves higher employment higher yields and more favorable selling prices for the agricultural products mehrabi boshrabadi 2008 advantages of greenhouse cultivation of plants are that it requires less water and land greenhouses allow the year round possibility of planting and harvesting crops which are protected in the greenhouse and it allows growing plants out of season which results in better marketable crop quality and availability than in open field cultivation pishgar komleh et al 2013 in addition greenhouse technology is available in areas where agriculture is not possible due to harsh agro climatic conditions allowing for expansion of the growing season gupta and chandra 2002 within this context in recent years greenhouse cultivation for out of season crop production optimal use of water resources and the use of small land parcels has developed especially near large cities that do not have enough land and water sobhani et al 2018 the fact that there are 165 million hectares of iranian land has created the misconception that agricultural land is plentiful in the country and the only problem is the scarcity of water however the reality is that agricultural land faces limitations such as its destruction from change in land use and soil erosion in addition problems such as floods droughts deteriorating living standards collapsing environmental systems and widespread changes in the use of agricultural land threaten the iranian agricultural system jamshidi and haji mirrahimi 2016 from 2002 to 2012 the cultivated area of greenhouse crops in iran almost doubled going from 3380 ha to 6630 ha the proportions of iranian greenhouse crops are as follows vegetables 59 3 flowers 39 81 fruits 0 54 and fungi 0 35 anonymous 2013 crop production under greenhouse conditions is one of the most intensive agricultural production systems worldwide due to its high yield and high energy consumption per unit area canakci and akinci 2006 today intensive production of greenhouse crops can be achieved due to technological advances and heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides along with control of environmental parameters such as the sunlight and air temperature the combination of the two most strongly affects plant growth such changes in agricultural practices which have been created to increase crop production as well as the production of fresh fruits and vegetables out of season have led to many environmental problems including high consumption of non renewable energy sources degradation of biodiversity and environmental pollution by nitrogen phosphorous and pesticides nemecek et al 2011 greenhouse production systems are dependent on free environmental energy sources and purchased inputs such as fuel electricity mechanical equipment fertilizers pesticides and other industrial products mandal et al 2002 however the traditional analysis of production systems does not accurately address the use of free local energy sources de barros et al 2009 if the role of environmental inputs is underestimated relative to non free purchased commercial inputs management strategies will be based on imperfect analyses and it will not be possible to allocate resources to develop optimal agricultural production systems ulgiati and brown 1998 emergy analysis odum 1996 takes into account the energy quality of both economic and environmental inputs and is an analysis tool that overcomes some of the disadvantages of other common analysis methods such as energy flow analysis life cycle assessment and ecological footprint analysis emergy analysis emergy synthesis is a scientific method for evaluating the equivalent direct and indirect solar energy required to produce a product or service campbell et al 2005a b shen et al 2019 the emergy unit is the solar emjoule sej which indicates the past use of available energy i e exergy solar transformity in units of solar emjoules per joule of the productive flow or crop unit has been proposed as a measure for locating a particular item in the thermodynamic hierarchy of the planet odum et al 2000 after nearly 30 years of development and applications this technique has become an ecological economic assessment tool that has been extensively utilized to evaluate different agroecosystems of various types and on many scales for example lu et al 2010 examined the sustainability of rice and vegetable production systems in paddy fields li et al 2011 explored three aquaculture systems lu et al 2018 explored the ecological economic sustainability of three types of bamboo systems and lu et al 2017 quantified three lotus root cultivation systems to find their characteristics on multiple scales in addition emergy analysis was used in china to apply engineering principles to the design of a fruit production system to maximize sustainability production efficiency and environmental impacts in this study the indices eisd and eer were used to indicate an economic advantage as well as to determine the amount of emergy consumed lu et al 2009 in iran traditional and commercial rapeseed production systems were compared using emergy analysis which led to the development of strategies to promote sustainability that were specific to each ecosystem studied amiri et al 2019 nevertheless it is still not well understood how free renewable natural inputs contribute to the process of crop production in greenhouses the evaluation of greenhouse systems is particularly challenging because these systems are complex and are designed with varying levels of expertise integration and intensity in addition the social characteristics of the producers affect the management size and volume of production activities of the greenhouse doubling the difficulty of the assessment saltiel et al 1994 the results of asgharipour et al 2019 on the consumption of different levels of inputs in bean production using emergy and economic analyses have shown that although systems with higher chemical inputs have higher economic benefits the level of sustainability of these systems is lower than that of the biological systems due to the use of non renewable inputs jafari et al 2018 using emergy energy and economic analyzes predicted the productivity and sustainability of the gardens converted from date to pistachio production the results indicated that the main motivation for gardeners to change to pistachio production is the greater economic benefit gained from these gardens amiri et al 2019 in their study on the emergy analysis of two traditional and commercial canola production systems indicated that the environmental sustainability of the commercial canola production system can be improved by improving soil organic matter and preventing its degradation kerman province produces 2750 tons of greenhouse crops from 1630 ha of greenhouse area and it is one of the largest areas producing greenhouse crops in iran the main area of greenhouse vegetable production is in the south of this province especially in jiroft which is the hub of vegetable production in the country with a total greenhouse area of 1398 ha production of cucumber tomato bell paper and eggplant dominate agriculture in this region accounting for 95 2 of the province s agricultural production kerman province statistical yearbook 2016 emergy assessment of greenhouse systems can develop new insights into the management of greenhouse crop production systems and provide complementary information on environmental sustainability this study assesses the socio ecological sustainability of the main greenhouse production systems in jiroft using integrated socioeconomic and emergy analysis the objectives of this research are 1 to evaluate the emergy investment structure and social status of farmers operating greenhouse production systems for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant 2 to compare the relative efficiency of greenhouse production systems for major crops using emergy indices and 3 to investigate the political requirements for local sustainability and environmental security to help clarify current land allocation policies that may lead to the adoption of appropriate management decisions to maximize agricultural productivity and its sustainability in jiroft iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 research sites this research was carried out in four greenhouse production systems for cucumber tomato bell paper and eggplant in jiroft city kerman province in southeastern iran 28 40 n 57 44 e which has an average elevation of 680 m above sea level the city has a warm and semi humid climate with average annual levels of temperature 33 6 c precipitation 182 mm sunshine 2821 4 h and solar radiation 1456 7 kw m 2 there are over 6000 industrial semi industrial and non industrial greenhouses in jiroft which has a population of about 311 000 people with a total production of 835 t in 2012 anonymous 2013 the city is one of the most important areas for the production of greenhouse crops in iran major greenhouse crops produced in the area are cucumbers tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants with cucumber production making up the highest proportion of the total 77 2 the portions of tomato bell paper and eggplant are 18 0 2 9 and 1 7 respectively and other vegetables such as strawberries and lettuce have much smaller fractions of the total 2 2 data collection data for this study were collected from greenhouse vegetable producers in jiroft city by a face to face questionnaire the survey was conducted in 22 villages where a considerable number of farms producing greenhouse crops were located one hundred and eighteen producers were selected randomly from the villages by stratified random sampling design using the neyman method yamane 1967 1 n n h s h n 2 d 2 n h s h 2 where n is the required sample size nh is the number of greenhouse crop producers in class h sh is the standard

this study 56 were growing cucumbers 31 tomatoes 19 bell peppers and 12 eggplants the uncertainty of the results has been evaluated at the 95 confidence interval for different flows and indices using eqs 2 and 3 xue et al 2018 2 l x z s d 3 u x z s d where l and u are the lower and upper endpoints of the 95 confidence interval respectively x is the mean value of the parameters for different flows in the greenhouse vegetable production systems z is the critical value on the 95 two sided confidence level 1 96 sd is the standard deviation the upper and lower bounds of the 95 confidence interval for average values reported in the text are given in brackets all information about the inputs and outputs of the greenhouse system was obtained by the following two methods first questionnaire aided verbal estimates were obtained from the producers during the period from october 2017 through june 2018 and second field measurements and authors observations were made during the same period information provided by the greenhouse manager and the staff was considered accurate since the staff had enough work experience to provide detailed information on each stage of production in addition to data obtained from questionnaires previous studies by such related organizations as the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and the ministry of agriculture jihad of iran were also used in this study long term meteorological data and solar radiation were obtained from the jiroft meteorological station the annual energy flow input to the system was estimated in the form of structural facilities buildings machinery and materials used in these systems according to their service life vassallo et al 2007 the lifespans of the greenhouse plastic cover machinery and buildings were estimated at periods of 8 11 months 25 years and 40 years respectively asgharipour et al 2019 although the areas of the greenhouse systems varied from 0 15 to 1 00 ha the input and output values for each planting system were standardized for an area of 1000 m2 to facilitate the calculations and comparisons between greenhouse production systems in accordance with previous studies the solar transmittance coefficient into the greenhouse was assumed to be 0 816 sangpradit 2014 there is no study on the renewability of labor in iran and our preliminary research showed that the renewability in this study is entirely dependent on the use of non renewable goods and services purchased by the public therefore according to previous studies ulgiati and brown 1998 jafari et al 2018 it was assumed that 90 of the workforce s emergy was supported by non renewable sources while the remaining 10 was considered as a renewable input since all the seedlings were obtained from industrial nurseries that were heavily dependent on machinery and fossil fuels only 43 of seedling production energy was classified as renewable watson et al 2018 2 3 details of greenhouse crop production in the study region curved plastic greenhouses made of polyethylene plastic with sheets of polycarbonate are commonly used to produce the studied crops fig 1 each production period in the greenhouse begins with collecting the previous crop residues and preparing the bed ending with the crop harvest greenhouse production management practices are shown in table 1 in the production of greenhouse crops drip irrigation is used to meet the water needs of the plants and both macro and micronutrients are continuously available to the plant through the irrigation system based on plant nutritional needs however the irrigation frequency varies according to seasonal conditions and plant types to control infesting pathogens and pests chemical pesticides are used by direct application to the plants or systemically delivered through the irrigation system the cultivated area the cultivars used the planting and harvesting dates and the management practices for greenhouse production of vegetables in jiroft are shown in table 1 energy is used either directly or indirectly in agricultural operations for greenhouse establishment soil disinfection using sunlight application of organic and chemical fertilizers planting bed preparation transplantation plant protection spraying irrigation greenhouse heating and ventilation harvesting transportation and cleaning crop transplantation harvesting and cleaning of the greenhouses are carried out by hand only the use of energy and material resources to produce vegetables in the greenhouses is presented in table 2 agricultural machinery used in greenhouse operations is driven by a tractor during the production process no animal power was used for greenhouse operations 2 4 selection of social indicators in assessing social sustainability selecting the appropriate indicators is important hua jiao et al 2007 the basis of the selection of social indicators for measuring social sustainability in the present study is pretty 1995 social indicators considered were as follows the experience level of agricultural labor the cultivation area of the greenhouse the number of years of formal learning of the manager access of the production greenhouse managers to a family workforce the degree of reliance on the application of mechanical and biological technology the amount of participation in educational extension classes the number of contacts with the agricultural extension agents and agricultural experts and membership in rural cooperatives 2 5 emergy analysis various researchers have detailed the emergy calculation process odum 1996 odum et al 2000 brown and ulgiati 1998 the first step for emergy analysis is to determine the spatiotemporal boundaries of the four examined systems and to draw the energy systems language esl diagram to classify the studied system inputs into renewable or non renewable and local or imported sources this is essential to manage the correlations between the useful processes and major parts of the system and also to determine the environmental basis of the ecosystem and its relationships fig 2 shows an esl conceptual diagram of the greenhouse systems of vegetable production the main energy and material inflows involved in the manufacturing and maintenance of a unit of greenhouse are represented in fig 3 the energy systems language sometimes called energese is a symbolic mathematically defined language for modeling that shows the networking features of the systems odum 1996 the second step in an emergy analysis is to construct the emergy evaluation tables table 3 to analyze the production systems resources were divided into four categories lu et al 2010 renewable environmental sources r including sunlight non renewable environmental resources n including underground water and evapotranspiration of this water 1 1 in contrast transpiration of rainwater would be renewable this is significant because when plant transpiration is taken as the emergy basis for plant production the renewability of that production is determined by the source of the water transpired purchased renewable resources pr with the percent renewability given in parentheses including animal manure 80 seedlings 43 labor 10 and electricity 1 and purchased non renewable resources pn with the percent non renewability given in parentheses including plastic nylon labor 90 fossil fuels agricultural machinery chemical fertilizers and pesticides electricity 99 yarn nylon seedlings 57 and animal manure 20 asgharipour et al 2019 the transplantation of cucumber tomatoes and bell peppers began in september and eggplants in january bell peppers and tomatoes were harvested in may cucumbers in july and eggplants in august therefore cucumber plants with an 11 month production period the longest tomatoes and bell peppers with a 9 month production period and eggplants with an 8 month production period the shortest utilized 5 36e 12 4 25e 12 4 25e 12 and 4 66e 12 j of solar energy respectively although eggplant had the shortest growth period solar input to this ecosystem was as much as 4 10e 11 j higher than that of the tomato and bell pepper production systems which had a 9 month production period this resulted from the replacement of longer days spring and summer days for eggplant with shorter days autumn days for the tomato and bell pepper plants system outputs included fresh vegetables cucumber tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants after calculation of all input u and output y flows the raw data for each production system were multiplied by the appropriate transformities for data in joules or specific emergy for data in grams odum et al 2000 campbell et al 2005a b bastianoni et al 2009 lu et al 2009 all values were converted to the 12 0 e 24 sej y 1 baseline brown et al 2016 the transformity of electricity was determined according to the conditions of its generation in iran asgharipour et al 2019 the renewability factor values and references for transformities and specific emergies are given in table 4 in emergy analysis emergy indices are used for environmental and economic assessments lu et al 2010 2018 amiri et al 2019 in this study the four greenhouse production systems were compared using the indicators of specific emergy or transformity based on sej g 1 or j 1 ueve renewable emergy ratio r emergy investment ratio eir and its modified version eir emergy yield ratio eyr environmental loading ratio elr and its modified version elr the environmental sustainability index esi and its modified version esi emergy exchange ratioyield eery the emergy index for sustainable development eisd and two new indices the renewable benefit ratio rbr and the renewable surplus rs which are defined specifically to provide a more complete perspective on greenhouse production the characteristics and formulae of the above emergy indices are presented in table 5 2 6 sustainability a bridge between social and emergy indices using the analytic hierarchy process ahp technique the relative weights of each index and their effect on self reliance were measured self reliance is considered to be a prerequisite for sustainability in rural areas the general attributes of self reliance are directly related to job stabilization pretty 1995 the relationship between self reliance and social sustainability is determined by the impact of the characteristics of each farmer on the selection of cucumber tomato pepper and eggplant for cultivation on the one hand and the values of the emergy indices and the sustainability of each production system on the other hand we propose that the relationship between the social indices and the emergy indices of agricultural production determines the overall sustainability of the cultivation systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 socioeconomic characteristics of jiroft greenhouses the age of the greenhouses examined in this study averaged 35 2 20 4 50 1 years which is below the average age 37 8 years of greenhouses in iranian rural communities also the largest fraction 42 9 belonged to greenhouse growers aged 30 39 years although a high percentage of greenhouse growers were in a young age group they had the skills and to some extent the experience necessary to carry out greenhouse activities family work was recorded in 85 7 of greenhouse systems family work in greenhouses indicates the strength of the traditional family relationships in iran which conveys traditional and indigenous knowledge from previous to future generations over time family members working as part of the greenhouse workforce learn the skills and gain the knowledge needed to train the next generation of greenhouse farmers in addition their understanding of the constraints challenges opportunities and privileges of the new agricultural system improves their potential to be successful in carrying out greenhouse agriculture riley 2001 the workforce s ability stabilized the activity and job creation in the production units examined with its positive effects especially the prevention of social harm almost two thirds 65 7 of the families of greenhouse growers in the studied agricultural systems had less than five members and only 15 7 consisted of six members family planning policies in the last few years have led to a significant reduction in family size even in rural communities the greenhouse growers had a broad range of education levels from illiterate 9 16 through an elementary education 31 4 a high school diploma 44 3 and a college degree 7 4 attitudes and decisions of individuals are a unique reflection of their social personality influenced by socioeconomic factors and professional experiences a farmer s decision to choose a crop and production level and to determine how to manage the farm arises from interactions among the above biological and social factors ghadim and pannell 2003 the size of greenhouses averaged 1685 1503 1867 2 2 the upper and lower bounds of the 95 confidence interval for average values reported in the text are given in brackets m2 greenhouses with areas of about 1000 2000 and 2300 m2 were owned by 44 18 and 38 of the farmers respectively average per capita greenhouse areas in cucumber tomato eggplant and bell pepper production were 2000 1784 2216 1500 1338 1661 1450 1294 1606 and 1200 1071 1329 m2 respectively the effect of the size of greenhouse complexes is considered below and we argue that this distribution is favorable in the jiroft region suggesting a promising increase in overall production and sustainability obviously a small greenhouse size will reduce the entry level expenses and the need for the application of machinery and equipment in cultivation smaller size may be chosen because of low income which does not allow for quantitative and qualitative expansion of the greenhouse activities by the farmer thereby reducing the efficiency of agricultural operations their sustainability and consequently production asadi et al 2009 accordingly and since the average greenhouse area is higher for cucumber producers it is concluded that those farmers with specific characteristics e g literacy age experience etc tend to produce cucumbers and are expected to have greenhouse management skills that result in higher sustainability private ownership was recorded for 94 3 of the greenhouses and 5 7 were operated by renters finally the relative weights of selected indicators for self reliance which is a prerequisite for sustainability as described above of greenhouse farmers as determined by ahp were calculated as follows agricultural labor experience 0 062 cultivation area in the greenhouse 0 372 number of years of agricultural education 0 186 access to a family workforce by the production managers greenhouse and less reliance on the application of mechanical and biological technology 0 193 the amount of participation in educational extension classes the number of contacts with the agricultural extension agents and agricultural experts 0 165 membership in rural cooperatives 0 022 greenhouse producers of cucumber had the highest amounts of self reliance and were more socially sustainable 3 2 the structure of emergy use table 3 represents the inputs of free and purchased environmental inputs based on physical units for the four production systems all the tabulated inputs were converted to emergy flows through multiplication by the appropriate transformities which were adapted from previous studies after examining their generalizability to conditions in iran tables 6 and 7 total emergy inputs to the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems were estimated as 1 18e 16 1 11e 16 1 24e 16 1 13e 16 1 06e 16 1 18e 16 1 11e 16 1 04e 16 1 16e 16 and 1 26e 16 1 21e 16 1 29e 16 sej 1000 m 2 respectively table 7 comparison of the total emergy inputs for the four systems showed that the eggplant and bell pepper production systems had the highest and the lowest values respectively although a higher emergy flow to an agricultural system is often directly related to the mechanization and industrialization of the system lu et al 2010 the increased emergy required for the eggplant system was related to a need for greater workforce input in the stringing and harvesting phases therefore it can be concluded that in eggplant greenhouse systems optimizing the use of labor will lead toward increased efficiency and sustainability of these systems production of greenhouse crops should be undertaken only after careful investigation and identification of problems such as water scarcity poor soil fertility high soil erosion in open fields as well as methods of design and application of technologies to tackle the cause of the unsustainability of open field cultivation we have provided two new indices to determine an environmental justification for greenhouse agriculture the renewable benefit ratio which when less than one favors open field cultivation and when greater that one indicates that greenhouse production may be the best choice the renewable surplus shows the direct emergy benefit or loss that results to the environment from the choice of field or greenhouse cultivation these indices are based on the renewable inputs alone in this case solar radiation and water evapo transpired and do not consider purchased emergy or the secondary factors such as emissions from burning fossil fuel that may result from the two cultivation methods the formulations of these two indices are easily expandable to a more complete assessment of all the inputs in future studies 3 2 1 renewable environmental flows r renewable environmental flows r included sunlight in all four vegetable production systems the r flows for the cucumber tomato bell paper and eggplant production systems were 5 36e 12 5 35e12 5 37e 12 4 25e 12 4 24e 12 4 26e 12 4 25e 12 4 24e 12 4 26e 12 and 4 66e 12 4 65e 12 4 67e 12 sej 1000 m 2 respectively table 7 fig 4 comparison of the r values among the four studied systems indicated higher utilization of renewable environmental flows by the cucumber production system due to its longer production period 11 months and therefore greater sunlight used directly in photosynthesis greenhouse crop production systems often use less renewable environmental flow than outdoor production systems e g crops and horticulture because of the nature of production in greenhouse systems which often occur outside of the conventional crop season and thus it is somewhat isolated from the natural environment production in greenhouse systems takes place with only a slight usage of free energies such as kinetic energy of the wind rain and surface waters wei et al 2009 studied certain systems of greenhouses called four in one based on the energy supply to the production system from various integrated energy sources they showed that in greenhouse systems for peach production renewable environmental flows could be used in a more desirable manner than in outdoor systems in terms of increasing the sustainability of the agricultural production system as will be explained below the r elr eyr and esi for greenhouse production of peaches was 78 29 0 28 1 61 and 5 74 respectively and for outdoor systems the values of the same indices were 25 00 2 96 2 18 and 0 74 these values clearly show lower pressure on the environment and higher sustainability of the four in one greenhouse system compared to the outdoor system 3 2 2 non renewable environmental flows n underground water and evapotranspiration supported by it were the primary non renewable environmental resources n used in the four systems studied tables 6 and 7 non renewable resource use 2 62e 14 sej 2 62e 14 2 62e 14 1000 m 2 was higher for the cucumber production system than for the other three systems due to the longer growing time the non renewable environmental emergy input to the production systems made a small contribution to the total emergy input to the systems multiple studies have shown that water use for agricultural production in greenhouse conditions is less than in outdoor settings yildizhan and taki 2018 compared the inputs to tomato production systems grown under greenhouse conditions with tomatoes grown in outdoor settings in turkey they concluded that water consumption in greenhouse tomato production systems was much less than that of the outdoor systems in their study water use in the open systems was about 7 36 times higher than under greenhouse conditions depending on weather conditions the main reason for less water consumption in greenhouse systems is decreased wind higher humidity stable temperatures and the transition of the plant production periods from warmer seasons to milder and cooler seasons thereby reducing evapotranspiration and consequently decreasing plant water requirements in the greenhouse milieu nutrient loading and efficient drip irrigation can also play a role in lower greenhouse water consumption than in outdoor systems since plants do not have to transpire as much water to get the nutrients that they need additionally greenhouse systems of agricultural production often use new irrigation systems e g drip irrigation that improve water use efficiency in many crops ramalan and nwokeocha 2000 overall the difference in water consumption in greenhouses and open fields is much greater in hot and dry climates 3 2 3 purchased input flows fr and fn the quantities of purchased inputs in the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems were 1 16e 16 1 09e 16 1 21e 16 1 12e 16 1 05e 16 1 17e 16 1 10e 16 1 02e 16 1 14e 16 and 1 24e 16 1 19e 16 1 27e 16 sej 1000 m 2 respectively tables 6 and 7 fig 4 comparison of the resources purchased in the four systems showed that there was little discrepancy in the total purchased emergy inputs between the four systems however the structure of these inputs showed differences especially in the emergy inputs of labor soil fertility string and seedlings the emergy of labor used in the eggplant production system was greater than that of the other three systems the main difference in the workforce emergy inputs of these systems was related to the eggplant stringing operation because of the plant s branching vegetative volume and offshoot weights in eggplants are higher than those of the other three plants therefore eggplant requires both a greater amount of string and a larger workforce for tying up the plants in the eggplant production system purchased inputs were 98 86 98 82 98 89 of the total inputs which was the largest portion of the total purchased inputs among the studied systems 3 2 4 yield and output emergy given a similar amount and quality of crop produced the system with a lower emergy input will be more efficient and more sustainable in other words more crops are produced with the same amount of emergy input odum 1996 brown et al 2000 total output emergy levels of the four vegetable systems are presented in table 7 the lowest and highest levels of output emergy of the four systems belonged respectively to the bell pepper 1 15e 16 sej 1000 m 2 1 06e 16 1 18e 16 and eggplant 1 25e 16 sej 1000 m 2 1 21e 16 1 29e 16 production systems the main reason for the difference in the output emergy levels of bell pepper and eggplant production systems was related to the labor required 3 3 emergy based indices the analysis of emergy based indices was used to distinguish between the four vegetable production systems these indices compared the following functional characteristics of the four studied systems viz environmental impacts resource use efficiency competitive ability in the market and ecological sustainability the production status of individual systems can be analyzed by comparing the emergy indices of the four systems the values of the emergy based indices are presented in table 8 3 3 1 unit emergy value for the economic yield ueve ueve is an effective indicator for assessing the emergy yield of crop production brown and ulgiati 2004 higher values of ueve in a similar production system indicate lower economic and environmental effectuality of the emergy use lu et al 2010 the calculated ueve values for the four systems cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant were 7 27e 03 7 09e 03 7 45e 03 1 04e 04 1 01e 04 1 07e 04 5 10e 04 4 96e 04 5 25e 04 and 1 26e 04 1 18e 04 1 35e04 sej j 1 respectively table 8 a comparison of the ueve values for the four studied systems showed that the input emergy efficiency of the cucumber production system was 43 88 and 73 higher than that of the tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems since the difference between the input emergy of the systems was far lower than the difference in the transformities of the four studied systems the main reason for the better input emergy efficiency of the cucumber production system was the greater production of cucumber per unit area as an economic crop compared to the other three vegetables jafari et al 2018 reported transformities of 1 16e 06 and 9 97e 05 sej j 1 respectively for pistachio and date crops in iran wang et al 2014 reported a wheat ueve of 1 63e 05 sej j 1 in the north of china while ghaley and porter 2013 reported a ueve for corn of 1 32e 05 sej j 1 for denmark s farms also cavalett and ortega 2009 and zhang et al 2005 found unit emergy values of 1 01e 05 sej j 1 and 8 37e 04 in soybean agroecosystems of brazil and china respectively ueve values of 1 71e 05 and 3 02e 05 sej j 1 were reported in iran for bean production at different levels of input consumption asgharipour et al 2019 the ueve values of the four vegetable crops studied indicate a high emergy effectiveness of the greenhouse production systems examined in the present study 3 3 2 renewable emergy percentage r in general production systems with a higher fraction of their emergy inputs supplied from renewable sources or if production related processes use more renewable resources such systems are more likely to have higher sustainability la rosa et al 2008 in the long run the less the system uses non renewable resources compared to renewable ones the more successful it will be in economic competition brown and ulgiati 2004 lefroy and rydberg 2003 in the present study the renewability percentages for cucumbers tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants were calculated as 19 4 20 1 14 7 18 7 19 4 14 0 18 4 19 1 14 3 and 17 7 17 9 12 6 respectively table 8 although the renewability percentages were not significantly different among the four studied systems these small differences were mainly due to differences in the emergy of r and to the fertilizer inputs used in the various systems compared to the other three cucumber plants respond to organic fertilizer better than many vegetables janoudi and widders 1993 the emergy inputs from renewable sources to the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant systems were 2 28e 15 2 12e 15 2 04e 15 and 2 23e 15 sej 1000 m 2 respectively the reason for the slight difference in the order of r for the four systems was that the r results from variations in the proportion of renewable emergy flows in the total emergy input required by the systems as with most related studies a high proportion of the non renewable emergy input belonged to chemical fertilizers especially nitrogen in the four systems studied ghaley and porter 2013 in this study due to the warm climate of the region the share of fossil fuels and electricity was low in colder regions greenhouse production is associated with high consumption of fossil fuels and electricity thereby increasing the share of non renewable inputs and reducing the r the greenhouse building also accounted for a high portion of non renewable emergy used in the four systems tables 6 and 7 therefore the use of materials and technologies that reduce the input emergy in particular of the non renewable resources used in greenhouse construction has a substantial effect on the sustainability of the greenhouse production systems and their potential for improvement in r srinivasan et al 2012 in a study by zhang et al 2012 the percentage of renewable emergy use was reported to be 27 for corn fields in china in soybean farms of brazil cavalett and ortega 2009 reported a r of 35 6 in iran r values of 53 69 and 3 35 were reported for beans in ecological production and high input systems respectively asgharipour et al 2019 according to asgharipour et al 2019 a change in the type of system inputs consumed was reported to go from a high consumption of conventional and chemical inputs with low renewability towards consumption of more renewable inputs with more use of ecological resources a higher r leading to improved system sustainability similarly a study in brazil of three farms consisting of crops and garden species one with ecological management and the other two with two different levels of conventional management were compared agostinho et al 2008 results showed average r values of 59 in the ecological farm and 27 in the other two systems the most important source of nonrenewability in conventional systems was attributed to the fossil fuel input therefore the reduction of fossil fuel reserves in the future could be a critical factor leading to the unsustainability of systems too dependent on these nonrenewable resources agostinho et al 2008 3 3 3 emergy exchange ratio eery eery is a two purpose indicator for emergy and economic assessments odum 1996 eery is the emergy exchange ratio based on crop yield per unit area and analyzes the emergy benefits gained from crop sales in other words eery evaluates the equilibrium between the emergy that can be purchased ym with the money my gained from the market exchange for the economic output compared to the total system emergy input u incorporated in the crops produced this calculation can be carried on a per unit area basis e g sej ha 1 eery values of the four systems cucumbers tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants were 0 77 0 72 0 82 0 60 0 54 0 66 0 50 0 46 0 54 and 0 37 0 33 0 41 respectively table 8 in other words 77 60 50 and 37 of the emergy inputs to the systems of cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production respectively were turned into the emergy received by the producers from the market exchange rate for the crops lu et al 2009 2017 obtained eery values of 4 2 2 5 2 6 1 9 3 6 1 8 and 2 5 in production systems of lotus fish lotus shrimp lotus guava papaya banana and wampee respectively all of which indicate desirable and high eery levels this means that the purchasing power of money received to buy emergy on the market in exchange for a commodity output from these systems is at least 1 8 times greater than the input emergy used to produce the output in the aforementioned systems our eery values were all less than 1 and thus undesirable for the farmers in all four vegetable production systems to achieve a greater eery in addition to increasing the crop s market price different methods of species specific crop management can be used at the production stage so that the amount of system emergy input required for the crops is reduced while maintaining high production from the standpoint of the consumer the emergy value obtained from greenhouse grown vegetables compared to what is paid for them is considerable with eggplant giving the most value for the ir rial although eery in the cucumber production system was higher than the other three systems the economic output emergy of crops in the market for all four studied systems failed to even reach the point equivalent to the system input emergy the cucumber production system could only convert 77 of marketable system input emergy as a commodity exchangeable for the emergy that could be purchased by the money received for the cucumbers and the relative advantage to the farmer was lower than this in the other three systems the system input emergy the system economic output emergy the yield of vegetables per unit area and the crop sale price were all incorporated in the eery index evaluation giving the index emergetic an economic relevance hence in addition to the fact that reducing the system emergy inputs increases the value of this index increasing production per unit area and a greater crop sale price will also increase the eery index leading to enhanced production sustainability for the moment let us ignore the possibility that the yield per unit area of the crops produced in the studied ecosystems could be greater than the realized amount we now explore the effects of the market price for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant 18 000 20 000 22 000 and 15 000 rials per kg respectively on the results of this study considering the relationship between eery and ym for the eery to be equal to 1 i e equivalent emergy is exchanged for each crop it is necessary to raise the market price for cucumbers tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants to 23 360 33 480 43 960 and 40 320 rials per kg respectively the productivity of greenhouse vegetables can be upgraded per unit area using new knowledge and technology accordingly if we want to determine the amount of the economic crop yield required to bring the eery value to 1 or more instead of the values shown in table 3 we need to increase the minimum economic yield to 2622 2260 2018 and 3360 kg 1000 m 2 for cucumbers tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants or an increase in productivity of 20 40 50 and 60 respectively 3 3 4 emergy yield ratio eyr the emergy yield ratio is the result of dividing the emergy output by the purchased input emergy the eyr represents the effectiveness of the larger system in exploiting the free resources of the system zhang et al 2007 a higher value of this index reflects a greater amount of consumed emergy per unit of invested emergy chen et al 2006 the higher the value of this index the greater the system s dependence on the environmental inputs compared to purchased sources eyr values for the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems were 1 017 1 025 1 022 1 008 1 015 1 014 1 009 1 014 1 013 and 1 016 1 012 1 011 respectively table 8 given the fact that the eyr index is calculated from the ratio of the total system output purchased and free to the purchased inputs the greater use of free flows from the environment in the cucumber production system is due to two reasons first the longer production period of the plant about 60 days meaning that more sunlight is used and second the physiological nature of the cucumber plant in that it has a higher evapotranspiration than the other three plants eyr comparisons of the four studied vegetable systems showed slightly less dependence on purchased resources compared with free environmental resources in the cucumber production system in a large number of emergy analyses the eyr has been reported as one of the major indices in a study in china eyrs calculated for vegetable and rice production fields were 1 05 and 1 15 respectively lu et al 2010 the reported values of the eyr for vegetables though not grown in intensive greenhouse conditions are comparable to those of the vegetables in this study particularly for the cucumber production system in north china an eyr of 1 20 was calculated for corn zhang et al 2012 eyrs for fruit such as banana papaya guava and wampee were 1 04 1 16 1 31 and 1 30 respectively lu et al 2009 3 3 5 standard environmental loading ratio elr and the modified environmental loading ratio elr elr and elr indicate the stress imposed by the growing systems on the environment elr is calculated from the ratio of the non renewable environmental emergy inputs and the purchased inputs to the renewable environmental inputs and elr is obtained from the ratio of non renewable inputs to renewable ones ortega et al 2002 high ratios of these two indices in general mean a high pressure on the environment although elr can underestimate this pressure campbell and garmestani 2012 elr values in the present study were calculated for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems as 2 21e 03 2 08e 03 2 30e 03 2 67e 03 2 50e 03 2 78e 03 2 62e 03 2 44e 03 2 72e 03 and 2 69e 03 2 59e 03 2 79e 03 respectively in contrast elr values for the same production system in the same order were 4 18 3 98 5 79 4 35 4 15 6 16 4 46 4 24 6 01 and 4 62 4 60 6 91 respectively based on the elr and elr indices calculated in this study the environmental pressures derived from the cucumber and eggplant production systems were the lowest and the highest respectively the purchased renewable resources fr input to the four systems were not significantly different the value of r had no effect on the values of these two indexes due to its very small fraction of the total input in the eggplant production system fn 1 02e 16 sej 1000 m 2 had the highest amount of non renewable purchased emergy input among the systems examined hence the difference between the elr and elr indices of the four studied systems is mainly due to the differences between fn of these system the major difference among the fn input to these systems was the high level of labor used in the eggplant production system elrs less than 2 above 2 but less than 10 and above 10 generally represent relatively low medium and high environmental stresses cavalett et al 2006 according to this scale all 4 systems produced very high stress on the environment asgharipour et al 2019 calculated elr values of 16 81 and 39 66 for ecological ecosystems and high input systems for growing beans respectively in five different ranges of conventional and chemical inputs also elr levels of the ecological system and high input system for bean culture were reported to be 0 86 and 28 81 respectively in another study in iran elr values were reported to be 1 31 and 1 82 for date and pistachio production systems respectively suggesting relatively low environmental stresses by the two aforementioned garden systems jafari et al 2018 considering that the greatest portions of purchased input sources fn and fr in the present systems are due to the inputs from the workforce the greenhouse building and nitrogen fertilizer any reduction in these three inputs will result in decreasing fn and fr and moving the elr index towards higher sustainability also strategies that boost greater system utilization of environmental renewable sources and raise r and will reduce elr and elr and thereby increase the sustainability of these systems since elr is the ratio of environmental and purchased non renewable inputs to environmental and purchased renewable inputs elr fn n r fr and if the overuse of purchased inputs in the system is inevitable any elevation of fr in relation to fn will reduce elr and move toward more sustainable production systems agostinho et al 2008 reported that the reduction of fn compared to fr in ecologically managed farms decreased environmental stress about 6 times compared with environmental stress in the high fn consumption case 3 3 6 renewable benefit ratio rbr and renewable surplus rs the rbr was proposed in this study to better examine the utilization of outside free renewable environmental inputs in the greenhouse production systems compared to in open fields the formula for rbr is presented in table 5 the rbr indicates the ratio of free renewable environmental emergy r used in an area of open field producing crops equivalent to that produced per unit area in the in the enclosed systems the rbr is determined from the ratio of the renewable flows from free local resources of land per unit area outside the greenhouse rout to the renewable environmental emergy inputs required per unit area inside the greenhouse rin to produce an equivalent quantity of crops when rbr is 1 greenhouse production frees up environmental renewable resources to do work in the regional system whereas when rbr is 1 greenhouse cultivation does not provide an advantage over field cultivation in terms of the conservation of renewable resources overall sustainability might be indicated by a similar ratio that considers the use of all resources renewable and nonrenewable required to produce the same quantity of crop per unit area the greater the ratio of utilization of outside free renewable environmental inputs in the greenhouse the greater rbr the rbr values in the four systems cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant were calculated as 0 487 0 758 0 818 0 844 respectively table 8 the lower the rbr the less advantageous the enclosed system is in using r over production in the outdoor environment among the various greenhouse vegetable systems cucumber production had the lowest rbr 0 485 or in other words production of the same quantity of cucumbers in the outside environment would require only 48 5 of the renewable emergy used in the greenhouse in contrast field production of bell pepper and eggplant systems used 82 2 and 82 percent of the renewable emergy required for production of these crops in the greenhouse crops with higher rbrs are most advantageously grown in greenhouses with respect to the use of renewable resources the rs is the result of the difference between rout rin table 5 when this difference is negative it indicates the superiority of open field production in terms of use of r in addition when the rs value is positive this indicates the advantage of the greenhouse in terms of the use of r values close to zero indicate that the greenhouse is a viable choice in terms of renewable resource conservation for these crops e g bell pepper and eggplant in this study the comparison of rs values in this study has shown the superiority of bell pepper eggplant and tomato production over the cucumber systems in terms of the use of r table 8 3 3 7 standard environmental sustainability index esi and modified environmental sustainability index esi the two sustainability indices esi and the esi are intended to identify a process that maximally utilizes free environmental inputs with minimum environmental stress odum 1996 these two indices are an expression of the effectiveness of the production process while considering the system s sustainability the higher the ratio of free environmental inputs r and n to the purchased inputs and the lower the ratio of fn to fr in esi the greater the environmental sustainability of the index ulgiati and brown 1998 esi values 1 represent a high stress on the environment and in general the more intensive the production system the greater the stress on the environment cavalett et al 2006 in this study esi levels of 4 60e 04 4 92e 04 4 44e 04 3 77e 04 4 05e 04 3 65e 04 3 85e 04 4 15e 04 3 73e 03 and 3 77e 04 3 91e 04 3 67e 04 were calculated for the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant systems respectively esi values for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production ecosystems were 0 246 0 258 0 176 0 234 0 245 0 164 0 229 0 239 0 169 and 0 218 0 220 0 146 respectively table 8 in the studied systems esi values showed a somewhat higher sustainability than the esi values because elr and elr are involved in the calculations of esi and esi the distance between esis and the esi s of the four systems was due to the differences between the elrs and elr s the trend in corresponding changes between esis and esi s are almost identical in the four studied systems indicating a slight difference between the frs of the four systems the frs of the four systems accounted for similar percentages of the total emergy input to each system the fr fractions of the total emergy inputs of cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant systems were 19 3 18 7 18 4 and 17 7 respectively regarding fr in the elr and elr formulae a higher fr percentage results in a greater per system difference between esi and esi lu et al 2003 multiple studies suggest high pressures on the environment exerted by various agricultural systems reported esi values include 0 45 for a chinese corn field zhang et al 2012 less than 0 40 for four fruit production systems banana papaya wampee and guava in china h f lu et al 2009 0 03 0 08 for five different bean production systems in iran asgharipour et al 2019 and 0 03 and 0 30 for a wheat field and a multi culture farm of clover ryegrass wheat barley and some tree species in denmark ghaley and porter 2013 when agricultural systems use more non organic inputs and are more intensive with lower portions of fr n and r as well as less diversity the index will show lower sustainability the present systems are greenhouses which are intensive agricultural systems gupta and chandra 2002 3 3 8 emergy index for sustainable development eisd the eisd examines the effects of market feedback on the system s environmental sustainability and the effects of market exchange on the emergy performance of the system the eisd integrates the results of the eery and the esi indices a greater value of this index is directly associated with the system s sustainability including the effects of the economic relationships lu et al 2003 the eisd values showed that the cucumber production system s sustainability was 1 5 2 5 times as high as the other three systems the eisd values of the four systems cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant were 3 54e 04 3 55e 04 3 64e 04 2 62e 04 2 19e 04 2 41e 04 1 92e 04 1 91e 04 2 01e 04 and 1 39e 04 1 29e 04 1 51e 04 respectively table 8 lu et al 2009 reported eisd values of 0 73 0 71 0 55 and 0 24 in the production systems of four fruits viz wampee guava papaya and banana comparison of our eisd values with those of lu et al in china showed lower sustainability of the present production systems for the four vegetables in iran compared to the chinese production systems for four fruits the higher sustainability of garden ecosystems as reported in lu et al 2009 compared to these greenhouse production systems is reasonable due to the much lower comparative intensiveness of the garden production systems nicolosi et al 2018 3 3 9 standard and modified emergy investment ratios eir and eir the eir ratio is obtained from the ratio of purchased inputs to free inputs wang et al 2014 the eir ratio is the ratio of purchased resources to renewable environmental resources alone amiri et al 2019 eir and eir explain the ratio of investment in non free resources to both free and free renewable environmental inputs in each system lan et al 2002 and amiri et al 2019 eirs in the four systems cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant were calculated as 43 44 40 53 45 11 70 00 65 36 72 90 74 82 69 35 77 37 and 82 73 83 43 89 00 respectively table 8 in the eggplant production system the eir was about twice as high as for that of cucumber production higher r 15 and n 89 percentages for cucumber compared to eggplant resulted in an eir value half of that in the eggplant systems accordingly cucumber production with fewer purchased inputs than the other three systems especially that of eggplant had greater competitive power and comparative advantage in the market relative to the other three vegetable production systems according to campbell and laherrere 1998 it is not a correct notion to consider n as a free input hence the equation fn fr r was defined as eir by amiri et al 2019 due to the deletion of n from the free input group in the eir formula the differences between eir and eir were very high however in studies in which n is significant and unavoidable due to environmental conditions not controllable within the production system amiri et al 2019 and when it includes a high fraction of the system s total emergy input eir better reflects differences in sustainability of the production systems and are much more realistic and useful for comparison than are the eir values amiri et al 2019 showed that while the difference between commercial and subsistence canola production systems was about 2 5 times based on the eir index however there was little difference between the two systems according to eir index soil loss and degradation are major contributors to the use of local non renewable resources n and n0 in agricultural production systems in iran and in many other places in the world soil loss is a major problem in many agricultural field systems in iran however it is almost zero in greenhouse systems which may offer a path toward a solution to some of the soil loss problems in arid climates cheng et al 2017 compared three crop production systems fish and chicken rearing and reported average eir values of 3 98 and 5 87 respectively indicating lower percentages of free emergy investments in agronomic systems than those of intensive chicken and fish production systems asgharipour et al 2019 reported eir values of 3 57 and 6 03 respectively for organic and high input bean production systems in iran an eir of 1 25 was reported for soybean production systems in brazil cavalett and ortega 2009 our eir values are much higher than those reported in the past for many agricultural production systems which is due to the high inputs of purchased emergy used for greenhouse construction and equipment and to the low utilization of free environmental inputs in production 4 conclusion greenhouse production is a new and effective method for the production of certain crops especially in arid climates due to the lack of water resources which is one of the main limiting factors for agriculture in iran one of the most effective methods for optimal use of water is the expansion of the off season for production by pursuing cultivation in greenhouses greenhouses have experienced growth and expansion in recent years due to favorable market prices for their produce high yields government support and payment facilities the expansion of greenhouses particularly in central and southern iran where droughts often cause many problems for farmers may be a solution to increase income and employment in the agricultural sector given the benefits of greenhouse production government support and increased demand for out of season vegetables this method of production has become one of the most attractive and profitable agricultural activities in the country however many proponents of sustainable agriculture believe that the new styles of intensive farming including greenhouse production systems do not address important issues such as the conservation of natural resources and the health of the food production system that depends on developing sustainable agricultural systems our study shows that such assumptions may be need to be qualified in the case of greenhouse production in arid climates we provide an initial index to help gage the relative efficacy of greenhouse versus field production for various crops with regard to the use of limited renewable resources in arid climates this index can be further developed to consider the overall and specific use of different types of resources and greenhouse systems in other climates in the future the present research was conducted to evaluate the socio ecological sustainability of four greenhouse systems for vegetable production in jiroft iran based on emergy analyses and the social status of the users in this study the ecological sustainabilities of four systems for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production were compared using different emergy indices and considering market conditions based on the results of the sustainability of greenhouse vegetable production a decision can be made to select the most beneficial plants in the production process to achieve the uppermost environmental and economic benefits our findings from the emergy analysis and calculation of the thermodynamic indices indicated overall a greater sustainability of the cucumber production system compared to the other three vegetables also the results of surveys on the producers social status using the analytic hierarchy process indicates that cucumber producers have different socio technical indicators including more agricultural labor experience greater cultivation areas under their control higher education status higher access to family labor greater participation in agricultural skills training courses and higher rates of membership in rural cooperatives and councils compared to the other three groups of producers leading to the prediction that cucumber greenhouse production is more likely to be more sustainable thus the results of the sociological analysis are consistent with the biophysical analysis of greenhouse production our calculated ueve values of these greenhouse vegetable crops generally had a favorable status compared to the uevs of open farm and garden production systems for example the uev of cucumbers in this study is 7 27e 03 sej j 1 7 09e 03 7 45e 03 compared favorably to that of cucumbers grown in florida 3 58e 04 sej j 1 which have a transformity almost 5 times that of greenhouse grown cucumbers in this study brandt williams 2002 the highest 5 10e 04 4 96e 04 5 25e 04 and lowest 7 27e 03 7 09e 03 7 45e 03 ueve levels were calculated for bell pepper and cucumber plants respectively the high fn of the eggplant production system resulted from the large amount of labor emergy required which led to a dramatic drop in the eggplant system s sustainability compared to that of the other systems to increase the sustainability of greenhouse systems similar to those in this study strategies to reduce or make more efficient use of labor are recommended considering its high contribution to the inputs of all four systems 30 39 of production inputs and that 24 28 for greenhouse building construction additionally technologies should be utilized that allocate the least emergy input especially from non renewable sources into the greenhouse building itself due to the intensiveness of the greenhouse production system attempts should also be made in the production process to reduce the ratio of purchased fr to fn since it involves a high use of purchased resources possibly through the use of fertilizers with higher renewable content rather than chemical fertilizers in fact a form of management should be applied that involves non chemical methods biological mechanical and physical such as the use of organic and biological materials for fertilizers as well as for pest disease and weed control the high market prices of healthy organic crops and the role of crop prices in increasing the eery index on the one hand and proponents of healthy lifestyles seeking high quality organic crops on the other hand call for a management system for the ecological production of crops fortunately this is more possible in greenhouse systems owing to their nature which includes a greater ability to control and manage inputs compared to production in open fields ultimately leading to the production of healthy and organic products with the least use of or even without the use of synthetic chemicals according to wei et al 2009 an approach that benefits from the different types of renewable energy sources in the greenhouse is also a practical approach to increase sustainability in other words given the high share of non renewable inputs in the studied greenhouse systems increasing the share of renewable inputs especially renewable environmental inputs will lead to increased sustainability the present emergy analysis compared the sustainability of four greenhouse vegetable production systems in jiroft iran the results of which can be generalized to similar climates elsewhere in iran and to other arid climates around the world for a more detailed assessment of the sustainability of greenhouse systems besides the indoor greenhouse evaluations performed in this study it is necessary to examine environmental impacts around the greenhouse and its related systems credit authorship contribution statement mohammad reza asgharipour

24868,the use of emergy to evaluate the sustainability of greenhouse systems leads to management recommendations to increase the sustainability of production in these systems in this study four greenhouse systems for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production located in jiroft city iran were evaluated using emergy sustainability indices to accomplish this study 56 31 19 and 12 greenhouses were selected for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production respectively analysis of twelve emergy indices and a study of the social characteristics of the producers using analytic hierarchy analysis showed that the sustainability of the cucumber production system was greater than that of the other three systems the calculated unit emergy values for economic yield ueve generally indicated that greenhouse systems were at least 100 times more sustainable than open farm systems for the production of different products primarily because of drastically reduced soil erosion the highest 5 10e 04 sej j 1 4 96e 04 5 25e 04 and lowest 7 27e 03 sej j 1 7 09e 03 7 45e 03 ueve values were calculated for the bell pepper and cucumber systems respectively also cucumber producers had greenhouses with larger areas compared to the greenhouses used for the other crops examined in this study the physiological characteristics of cucumber plants resulted in greater sustainability of this system because the plants were able to capture more of the free renewable energy had a higher production potential and this production system made more efficient use of the workforce in contrast the highest proportion of purchased non renewable resources reduced the sustainability of the eggplant production system compared to the other systems studied therefore selection of a plant with more potential to use free local environmental energy higher yield and more efficient use of labor will lead to greater sustainability of greenhouse vegetable production systems sustainability can also be increased by paying attention to the socio technical characteristics of the producers the use of technologies to reduce non renewable inputs to the greenhouse building and by reducing the proportion of non renewable inputs used overall keywords greenhouse systems emergy indices vegetables intensive farming environmental burden sustainability assessment 1 introduction in iran due to its dry climatic conditions limited water resources and erosion of high quality soil under cultivation greenhouse production has been considered as a solution for better use of production resources because it achieves higher employment higher yields and more favorable selling prices for the agricultural products mehrabi boshrabadi 2008 advantages of greenhouse cultivation of plants are that it requires less water and land greenhouses allow the year round possibility of planting and harvesting crops which are protected in the greenhouse and it allows growing plants out of season which results in better marketable crop quality and availability than in open field cultivation pishgar komleh et al 2013 in addition greenhouse technology is available in areas where agriculture is not possible due to harsh agro climatic conditions allowing for expansion of the growing season gupta and chandra 2002 within this context in recent years greenhouse cultivation for out of season crop production optimal use of water resources and the use of small land parcels has developed especially near large cities that do not have enough land and water sobhani et al 2018 the fact that there are 165 million hectares of iranian land has created the misconception that agricultural land is plentiful in the country and the only problem is the scarcity of water however the reality is that agricultural land faces limitations such as its destruction from change in land use and soil erosion in addition problems such as floods droughts deteriorating living standards collapsing environmental systems and widespread changes in the use of agricultural land threaten the iranian agricultural system jamshidi and haji mirrahimi 2016 from 2002 to 2012 the cultivated area of greenhouse crops in iran almost doubled going from 3380 ha to 6630 ha the proportions of iranian greenhouse crops are as follows vegetables 59 3 flowers 39 81 fruits 0 54 and fungi 0 35 anonymous 2013 crop production under greenhouse conditions is one of the most intensive agricultural production systems worldwide due to its high yield and high energy consumption per unit area canakci and akinci 2006 today intensive production of greenhouse crops can be achieved due to technological advances and heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides along with control of environmental parameters such as the sunlight and air temperature the combination of the two most strongly affects plant growth such changes in agricultural practices which have been created to increase crop production as well as the production of fresh fruits and vegetables out of season have led to many environmental problems including high consumption of non renewable energy sources degradation of biodiversity and environmental pollution by nitrogen phosphorous and pesticides nemecek et al 2011 greenhouse production systems are dependent on free environmental energy sources and purchased inputs such as fuel electricity mechanical equipment fertilizers pesticides and other industrial products mandal et al 2002 however the traditional analysis of production systems does not accurately address the use of free local energy sources de barros et al 2009 if the role of environmental inputs is underestimated relative to non free purchased commercial inputs management strategies will be based on imperfect analyses and it will not be possible to allocate resources to develop optimal agricultural production systems ulgiati and brown 1998 emergy analysis odum 1996 takes into account the energy quality of both economic and environmental inputs and is an analysis tool that overcomes some of the disadvantages of other common analysis methods such as energy flow analysis life cycle assessment and ecological footprint analysis emergy analysis emergy synthesis is a scientific method for evaluating the equivalent direct and indirect solar energy required to produce a product or service campbell et al 2005a b shen et al 2019 the emergy unit is the solar emjoule sej which indicates the past use of available energy i e exergy solar transformity in units of solar emjoules per joule of the productive flow or crop unit has been proposed as a measure for locating a particular item in the thermodynamic hierarchy of the planet odum et al 2000 after nearly 30 years of development and applications this technique has become an ecological economic assessment tool that has been extensively utilized to evaluate different agroecosystems of various types and on many scales for example lu et al 2010 examined the sustainability of rice and vegetable production systems in paddy fields li et al 2011 explored three aquaculture systems lu et al 2018 explored the ecological economic sustainability of three types of bamboo systems and lu et al 2017 quantified three lotus root cultivation systems to find their characteristics on multiple scales in addition emergy analysis was used in china to apply engineering principles to the design of a fruit production system to maximize sustainability production efficiency and environmental impacts in this study the indices eisd and eer were used to indicate an economic advantage as well as to determine the amount of emergy consumed lu et al 2009 in iran traditional and commercial rapeseed production systems were compared using emergy analysis which led to the development of strategies to promote sustainability that were specific to each ecosystem studied amiri et al 2019 nevertheless it is still not well understood how free renewable natural inputs contribute to the process of crop production in greenhouses the evaluation of greenhouse systems is particularly challenging because these systems are complex and are designed with varying levels of expertise integration and intensity in addition the social characteristics of the producers affect the management size and volume of production activities of the greenhouse doubling the difficulty of the assessment saltiel et al 1994 the results of asgharipour et al 2019 on the consumption of different levels of inputs in bean production using emergy and economic analyses have shown that although systems with higher chemical inputs have higher economic benefits the level of sustainability of these systems is lower than that of the biological systems due to the use of non renewable inputs jafari et al 2018 using emergy energy and economic analyzes predicted the productivity and sustainability of the gardens converted from date to pistachio production the results indicated that the main motivation for gardeners to change to pistachio production is the greater economic benefit gained from these gardens amiri et al 2019 in their study on the emergy analysis of two traditional and commercial canola production systems indicated that the environmental sustainability of the commercial canola production system can be improved by improving soil organic matter and preventing its degradation kerman province produces 2750 tons of greenhouse crops from 1630 ha of greenhouse area and it is one of the largest areas producing greenhouse crops in iran the main area of greenhouse vegetable production is in the south of this province especially in jiroft which is the hub of vegetable production in the country with a total greenhouse area of 1398 ha production of cucumber tomato bell paper and eggplant dominate agriculture in this region accounting for 95 2 of the province s agricultural production kerman province statistical yearbook 2016 emergy assessment of greenhouse systems can develop new insights into the management of greenhouse crop production systems and provide complementary information on environmental sustainability this study assesses the socio ecological sustainability of the main greenhouse production systems in jiroft using integrated socioeconomic and emergy analysis the objectives of this research are 1 to evaluate the emergy investment structure and social status of farmers operating greenhouse production systems for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant 2 to compare the relative efficiency of greenhouse production systems for major crops using emergy indices and 3 to investigate the political requirements for local sustainability and environmental security to help clarify current land allocation policies that may lead to the adoption of appropriate management decisions to maximize agricultural productivity and its sustainability in jiroft iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 research

for average values reported in the text are given in brackets all information about the inputs and outputs of the greenhouse system was obtained by the following two methods first questionnaire aided verbal estimates were obtained from the producers during the period from october 2017 through june 2018 and second field measurements and authors observations were made during the same period information provided by the greenhouse manager and the staff was considered accurate since the staff had enough work experience to provide detailed information on each stage of production in addition to data obtained from questionnaires previous studies by such related organizations as the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and the ministry of agriculture jihad of iran were also used in this study long term meteorological data and solar radiation were obtained from the jiroft meteorological station the annual energy flow input to the system was estimated in the form of structural facilities buildings machinery and materials used in these systems according to their service life vassallo et al 2007 the lifespans of the greenhouse plastic cover machinery and buildings were estimated at periods of 8 11 months 25 years and 40 years respectively asgharipour et al 2019 although the areas of the greenhouse systems varied from 0 15 to 1 00 ha the input and output values for each planting system were standardized for an area of 1000 m2 to facilitate the calculations and comparisons between greenhouse production systems in accordance with previous studies the solar transmittance coefficient into the greenhouse was assumed to be 0 816 sangpradit 2014 there is no study on the renewability of labor in iran and our preliminary research showed that the renewability in this study is entirely dependent on the use of non renewable goods and services purchased by the public therefore according to previous studies ulgiati and brown 1998 jafari et al 2018 it was assumed that 90 of the workforce s emergy was supported by non renewable sources while the remaining 10 was considered as a renewable input since all the seedlings were obtained from industrial nurseries that were heavily dependent on machinery and fossil fuels only 43 of seedling production energy was classified as renewable watson et al 2018 2 3 details of greenhouse crop production in the study region curved plastic greenhouses made of polyethylene plastic with sheets of polycarbonate are commonly used to produce the studied crops fig 1 each production period in the greenhouse begins with collecting the previous crop residues and preparing the bed ending with the crop harvest greenhouse production management practices are shown in table 1 in the production of greenhouse crops drip irrigation is used to meet the water needs of the plants and both macro and micronutrients are continuously available to the plant through the irrigation system based on plant nutritional needs however the irrigation frequency varies according to seasonal conditions and plant types to control infesting pathogens and pests chemical pesticides are used by direct application to the plants or systemically delivered through the irrigation system the cultivated area the cultivars used the planting and harvesting dates and the management practices for greenhouse production of vegetables in jiroft are shown in table 1 energy is used either directly or indirectly in agricultural operations for greenhouse establishment soil disinfection using sunlight application of organic and chemical fertilizers planting bed preparation transplantation plant protection spraying irrigation greenhouse heating and ventilation harvesting transportation and cleaning crop transplantation harvesting and cleaning of the greenhouses are carried out by hand only the use of energy and material resources to produce vegetables in the greenhouses is presented in table 2 agricultural machinery used in greenhouse operations is driven by a tractor during the production process no animal power was used for greenhouse operations 2 4 selection of social indicators in assessing social sustainability selecting the appropriate indicators is important hua jiao et al 2007 the basis of the selection of social indicators for measuring social sustainability in the present study is pretty 1995 social indicators considered were as follows the experience level of agricultural labor the cultivation area of the greenhouse the number of years of formal learning of the manager access of the production greenhouse managers to a family workforce the degree of reliance on the application of mechanical and biological technology the amount of participation in educational extension classes the number of contacts with the agricultural extension agents and agricultural experts and membership in rural cooperatives 2 5 emergy analysis various researchers have detailed the emergy calculation process odum 1996 odum et al 2000 brown and ulgiati 1998 the first step for emergy analysis is to determine the spatiotemporal boundaries of the four examined systems and to draw the energy systems language esl diagram to classify the studied system inputs into renewable or non renewable and local or imported sources this is essential to manage the correlations between the useful processes and major parts of the system and also to determine the environmental basis of the ecosystem and its relationships fig 2 shows an esl conceptual diagram of the greenhouse systems of vegetable production the main energy and material inflows involved in the manufacturing and maintenance of a unit of greenhouse are represented in fig 3 the energy systems language sometimes called energese is a symbolic mathematically defined language for modeling that shows the networking features of the systems odum 1996 the second step in an emergy analysis is to construct the emergy evaluation tables table 3 to analyze the production systems resources were divided into four categories lu et al 2010 renewable environmental sources r including sunlight non renewable environmental resources n including underground water and evapotranspiration of this water 1 1 in contrast transpiration of rainwater would be renewable this is significant because when plant transpiration is taken as the emergy basis for plant production the renewability of that production is determined by the source of the water transpired purchased renewable resources pr with the percent renewability given in parentheses including animal manure 80 seedlings 43 labor 10 and electricity 1 and purchased non renewable resources pn with the percent non renewability given in parentheses including plastic nylon labor 90 fossil fuels agricultural machinery chemical fertilizers and pesticides electricity 99 yarn nylon seedlings 57 and animal manure 20 asgharipour et al 2019 the transplantation of cucumber tomatoes and bell peppers began in september and eggplants in january bell peppers and tomatoes were harvested in may cucumbers in july and eggplants in august therefore cucumber plants with an 11 month production period the longest tomatoes and bell peppers with a 9 month production period and eggplants with an 8 month production period the shortest utilized 5 36e 12 4 25e 12 4 25e 12 and 4 66e 12 j of solar energy respectively although eggplant had the shortest growth period solar input to this ecosystem was as much as 4 10e 11 j higher than that of the tomato and bell pepper production systems which had a 9 month production period this resulted from the replacement of longer days spring and summer days for eggplant with shorter days autumn days for the tomato and bell pepper plants system outputs included fresh vegetables cucumber tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants after calculation of all input u and output y flows the raw data for each production system were multiplied by the appropriate transformities for data in joules or specific emergy for data in grams odum et al 2000 campbell et al 2005a b bastianoni et al 2009 lu et al 2009 all values were converted to the 12 0 e 24 sej y 1 baseline brown et al 2016 the transformity of electricity was determined according to the conditions of its generation in iran asgharipour et al 2019 the renewability factor values and references for transformities and specific emergies are given in table 4 in emergy analysis emergy indices are used for environmental and economic assessments lu et al 2010 2018 amiri et al 2019 in this study the four greenhouse production systems were compared using the indicators of specific emergy or transformity based on sej g 1 or j 1 ueve renewable emergy ratio r emergy investment ratio eir and its modified version eir emergy yield ratio eyr environmental loading ratio elr and its modified version elr the environmental sustainability index esi and its modified version esi emergy exchange ratioyield eery the emergy index for sustainable development eisd and two new indices the renewable benefit ratio rbr and the renewable surplus rs which are defined specifically to provide a more complete perspective on greenhouse production the characteristics and formulae of the above emergy indices are presented in table 5 2 6 sustainability a bridge between social and emergy indices using the analytic hierarchy process ahp technique the relative weights of each index and their effect on self reliance were measured self reliance is considered to be a prerequisite for sustainability in rural areas the general attributes of self reliance are directly related to job stabilization pretty 1995 the relationship between self reliance and social sustainability is determined by the impact of the characteristics of each farmer on the selection of cucumber tomato pepper and eggplant for cultivation on the one hand and the values of the emergy indices and the sustainability of each production system on the other hand we propose that the relationship between the social indices and the emergy indices of agricultural production determines the overall sustainability of the cultivation systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 socioeconomic characteristics of jiroft greenhouses the age of the greenhouses examined in this study averaged 35 2 20 4 50 1 years which is below the average age 37 8 years of greenhouses in iranian rural communities also the largest fraction 42 9 belonged to greenhouse growers aged 30 39 years although a high percentage of greenhouse growers were in a young age group they had the skills and to some extent the experience necessary to carry out greenhouse activities family work was recorded in 85 7 of greenhouse systems family work in greenhouses indicates the strength of the traditional family relationships in iran which conveys traditional and indigenous knowledge from previous to future generations over time family members working as part of the greenhouse workforce learn the skills and gain the knowledge needed to train the next generation of greenhouse farmers in addition their understanding of the constraints challenges opportunities and privileges of the new agricultural system improves their potential to be successful in carrying out greenhouse agriculture riley 2001 the workforce s ability stabilized the activity and job creation in the production units examined with its positive effects especially the prevention of social harm almost two thirds 65 7 of the families of greenhouse growers in the studied agricultural systems had less than five members and only 15 7 consisted of six members family planning policies in the last few years have led to a significant reduction in family size even in rural communities the greenhouse growers had a broad range of education levels from illiterate 9 16 through an elementary education 31 4 a high school diploma 44 3 and a college degree 7 4 attitudes and decisions of individuals are a unique reflection of their social personality influenced by socioeconomic factors and professional experiences a farmer s decision to choose a crop and production level and to determine how to manage the farm arises from interactions among the above biological and social factors ghadim and pannell 2003 the size of greenhouses averaged 1685 1503 1867 2 2 the upper and lower bounds of the 95 confidence interval for average values reported in the text are given in brackets m2 greenhouses with areas of about 1000 2000 and 2300 m2 were owned by 44 18 and 38 of the farmers respectively average per capita greenhouse areas in cucumber tomato eggplant and bell pepper production were 2000 1784 2216 1500 1338 1661 1450 1294 1606 and 1200 1071 1329 m2 respectively the effect of the size of greenhouse complexes is considered below and we argue that this distribution is favorable in the jiroft region suggesting a promising increase in overall production and sustainability obviously a small greenhouse size will reduce the entry level expenses and the need for the application of machinery and equipment in cultivation smaller size may be chosen because of low income which does not allow for quantitative and qualitative expansion of the greenhouse activities by the farmer thereby reducing the efficiency of agricultural operations their sustainability and consequently production asadi et al 2009 accordingly and since the average greenhouse area is higher for cucumber producers it is concluded that those farmers with specific characteristics e g literacy age experience etc tend to produce cucumbers and are expected to have greenhouse management skills that result in higher sustainability private ownership was recorded for 94 3 of the greenhouses and 5 7 were operated by renters finally the relative weights of selected indicators for self reliance which is a prerequisite for sustainability as described above of greenhouse farmers as determined by ahp were calculated as follows agricultural labor experience 0 062 cultivation area in the greenhouse 0 372 number of years of agricultural education 0 186 access to a family workforce by the production managers greenhouse and less reliance on the application of mechanical and biological technology 0 193 the amount of participation in educational extension classes the number of contacts with the agricultural extension agents and agricultural experts 0 165 membership in rural cooperatives 0 022 greenhouse producers of cucumber had the highest amounts of self reliance and were more socially sustainable 3 2 the structure of emergy use table 3 represents the inputs of free and purchased environmental inputs based on physical units for the four production systems all the tabulated inputs were converted to emergy flows through multiplication by the appropriate transformities which were adapted from previous studies after examining their generalizability to conditions in iran tables 6 and 7 total emergy inputs to the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems were estimated as 1 18e 16 1 11e 16 1 24e 16 1 13e 16 1 06e 16 1 18e 16 1 11e 16 1 04e 16 1 16e 16 and 1 26e 16 1 21e 16 1 29e 16 sej 1000 m 2 respectively table 7 comparison of the total emergy inputs for the four systems showed that the eggplant and bell pepper production systems had the highest and the lowest values respectively although a higher emergy flow to an agricultural system is often directly related to the mechanization and industrialization of the system lu et al 2010 the increased emergy required for the eggplant system was related to a need for greater workforce input in the stringing and harvesting phases therefore it can be concluded that in eggplant greenhouse systems optimizing the use of labor will lead toward increased efficiency and sustainability of these systems production of greenhouse crops should be undertaken only after careful investigation and identification of problems such as water scarcity poor soil fertility high soil erosion in open fields as well as methods of design and application of technologies to tackle the cause of the unsustainability of open field cultivation we have provided two new indices to determine an environmental justification for greenhouse agriculture the renewable benefit ratio which when less than one favors open field cultivation and when greater that one indicates that greenhouse production may be the best choice the renewable surplus shows the direct emergy benefit or loss that results to the environment from the choice of field or greenhouse cultivation these indices are based on the renewable inputs alone in this case solar radiation and water evapo transpired and do not consider purchased emergy or the secondary factors such as emissions from burning fossil fuel that may result from the two cultivation methods the formulations of these two indices are easily expandable to a more complete assessment of all the inputs in future studies 3 2 1 renewable environmental flows r renewable environmental flows r included sunlight in all four vegetable production systems the r flows for the cucumber tomato bell paper and eggplant production systems were 5 36e 12 5 35e12 5 37e 12 4 25e 12 4 24e 12 4 26e 12 4 25e 12 4 24e 12 4 26e 12 and 4 66e 12 4 65e 12 4 67e 12 sej 1000 m 2 respectively table 7 fig 4 comparison of the r values among the four studied systems indicated higher utilization of renewable environmental flows by the cucumber production system due to its longer production period 11 months and therefore greater sunlight used directly in photosynthesis greenhouse crop production systems often use less renewable environmental flow than outdoor production systems e g crops and horticulture because of the nature of production in greenhouse systems which often occur outside of the conventional crop season and thus it is somewhat isolated from the natural environment production in greenhouse systems takes place with only a slight usage of free energies such as kinetic energy of the wind rain and surface waters wei et al 2009 studied certain systems of greenhouses called four in one based on the energy supply to the production system from various integrated energy sources they showed that in greenhouse systems for peach production renewable environmental flows could be used in a more desirable manner than in outdoor systems in terms of increasing the sustainability of the agricultural production system as will be explained below the r elr eyr and esi for greenhouse production of peaches was 78 29 0 28 1 61 and 5 74 respectively and for outdoor systems the values of the same indices were 25 00 2 96 2 18 and 0 74 these values clearly show lower pressure on the environment and higher sustainability of the four in one greenhouse system compared to the outdoor system 3 2 2 non renewable environmental flows n underground water and evapotranspiration supported by it were the primary non renewable environmental resources n used in the four systems studied tables 6 and 7 non renewable resource use 2 62e 14 sej 2 62e 14 2 62e 14 1000 m 2 was higher for the cucumber production system than for the other three systems due to the longer growing time the non renewable environmental emergy input to the production systems made a small contribution to the total emergy input to the systems multiple studies have shown that water use for agricultural production in greenhouse conditions is less than in outdoor settings yildizhan and taki 2018 compared the inputs to tomato production systems grown under greenhouse conditions with tomatoes grown in outdoor settings in turkey they concluded that water consumption in greenhouse tomato production systems was much less than that of the outdoor systems in their study water use in the open systems was about 7 36 times higher than under greenhouse conditions depending on weather conditions the main reason for less water consumption in greenhouse systems is decreased wind higher humidity stable temperatures and the transition of the plant production periods from warmer seasons to milder and cooler seasons thereby reducing evapotranspiration and consequently decreasing plant water requirements in the greenhouse milieu nutrient loading and efficient drip irrigation can also play a role in lower greenhouse water consumption than in outdoor systems since plants do not have to transpire as much water to get the nutrients that they need additionally greenhouse systems of agricultural production often use new irrigation systems e g drip irrigation that improve water use efficiency in many crops ramalan and nwokeocha 2000 overall the difference in water consumption in greenhouses and open fields is much greater in hot and dry climates 3 2 3 purchased input flows fr and fn the quantities of purchased inputs in the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems were 1 16e 16 1 09e 16 1 21e 16 1 12e 16 1 05e 16 1 17e 16 1 10e 16 1 02e 16 1 14e 16 and 1 24e 16 1 19e 16 1 27e 16 sej 1000 m 2 respectively tables 6 and 7 fig 4 comparison of the resources purchased in the four systems showed that there was little discrepancy in the total purchased emergy inputs between the four systems however the structure of these inputs showed differences especially in the emergy inputs of labor soil fertility string and seedlings the emergy of labor used in the eggplant production system was greater than that of the other three systems the main difference in the workforce emergy inputs of these systems was related to the eggplant stringing operation because of the plant s branching vegetative volume and offshoot weights in eggplants are higher than those of the other three plants therefore eggplant requires both a greater amount of string and a larger workforce for tying up the plants in the eggplant production system purchased inputs were 98 86 98 82 98 89 of the total inputs which was the largest portion of the total purchased inputs among the studied systems 3 2 4 yield and output emergy given a similar amount and quality of crop produced the system with a lower emergy input will be more efficient and more sustainable in other words more crops are produced with the same amount of emergy input odum 1996 brown et al 2000 total output emergy levels of the four vegetable systems are presented in table 7 the lowest and highest levels of output emergy of the four systems belonged respectively to the bell pepper 1 15e 16 sej 1000 m 2 1 06e 16 1 18e 16 and eggplant 1 25e 16 sej 1000 m 2 1 21e 16 1 29e 16 production systems the main reason for the difference in the output emergy levels of bell pepper and eggplant production systems was related to the labor required 3 3 emergy based indices the analysis of emergy based indices was used to distinguish between the four vegetable production systems these indices compared the following functional characteristics of the four studied systems viz environmental impacts resource use efficiency competitive ability in the market and ecological sustainability the production status of individual systems can be analyzed by comparing the emergy indices of the four systems the values of the emergy based indices are presented in table 8 3 3 1 unit emergy value for the economic yield ueve ueve is an effective indicator for assessing the emergy yield of crop production brown and ulgiati 2004 higher values of ueve in a similar production system indicate lower economic and environmental effectuality of the emergy use lu et al 2010 the calculated ueve values for the four systems cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant were 7 27e 03 7 09e 03 7 45e 03 1 04e 04 1 01e 04 1 07e 04 5 10e 04 4 96e 04 5 25e 04 and 1 26e 04 1 18e 04 1 35e04 sej j 1 respectively table 8 a comparison of the ueve values for the four studied systems showed that the input emergy efficiency of the cucumber production system was 43 88 and 73 higher than that of the tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems since the difference between the input emergy of the systems was far lower than the difference in the transformities of the four studied systems the main reason for the better input emergy efficiency of the cucumber production system was the greater production of cucumber per unit area as an economic crop compared to the other three vegetables jafari et al 2018 reported transformities of 1 16e 06 and 9 97e 05 sej j 1 respectively for pistachio and date crops in iran wang et al 2014 reported a wheat ueve of 1 63e 05 sej j 1 in the north of china while ghaley and porter 2013 reported a ueve for corn of 1 32e 05 sej j 1 for denmark s farms also cavalett and ortega 2009 and zhang et al 2005 found unit emergy values of 1 01e 05 sej j 1 and 8 37e 04 in soybean agroecosystems of brazil and china respectively ueve values of 1 71e 05 and 3 02e 05 sej j 1 were reported in iran for bean production at different levels of input consumption asgharipour et al 2019 the ueve values of the four vegetable crops studied indicate a high emergy effectiveness of the greenhouse production systems examined in the present study 3 3 2 renewable emergy percentage r in general production systems with a higher fraction of their emergy inputs supplied from renewable sources or if production related processes use more renewable resources such systems are more likely to have higher sustainability la rosa et al 2008 in the long run the less the system uses non renewable resources compared to renewable ones the more successful it will be in economic competition brown and ulgiati 2004 lefroy and rydberg 2003 in the present study the renewability percentages for cucumbers tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants were calculated as 19 4 20 1 14 7 18 7 19 4 14 0 18 4 19 1 14 3 and 17 7 17 9 12 6 respectively table 8 although the renewability percentages were not significantly different among the four studied systems these small differences were mainly due to differences in the emergy of r and to the fertilizer inputs used in the various systems compared to the other three cucumber plants respond to organic fertilizer better than many vegetables janoudi and widders 1993 the emergy inputs from renewable sources to the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant systems were 2 28e 15 2 12e 15 2 04e 15 and 2 23e 15 sej 1000 m 2 respectively the reason for the slight difference in the order of r for the four systems was that the r results from variations in the proportion of renewable emergy flows in the total emergy input required by the systems as with most related studies a high proportion of the non renewable emergy input belonged to chemical fertilizers especially nitrogen in the four systems studied ghaley and porter 2013 in this study due to the warm climate of the region the share of fossil fuels and electricity was low in colder regions greenhouse production is associated with high consumption of fossil fuels and electricity thereby increasing the share of non renewable inputs and reducing the r the greenhouse building also accounted for a high portion of non renewable emergy used in the four systems tables 6 and 7 therefore the use of materials and technologies that reduce the input emergy in particular of the non renewable resources used in greenhouse construction has a substantial effect on the sustainability of the greenhouse production systems and their potential for improvement in r srinivasan et al 2012 in a study by zhang et al 2012 the percentage of renewable emergy use was reported to be 27 for corn fields in china in soybean farms of brazil cavalett and ortega 2009 reported a r of 35 6 in iran r values of 53 69 and 3 35 were reported for beans in ecological production and high input systems respectively asgharipour et al 2019 according to asgharipour et al 2019 a change in the type of system inputs consumed was reported to go from a high consumption of conventional and chemical inputs with low renewability towards consumption of more renewable inputs with more use of ecological resources a higher r leading to improved system sustainability similarly a study in brazil of three farms consisting of crops and garden species one with ecological management and the other two with two different levels of conventional management were compared agostinho et al 2008 results showed average r values of 59 in the ecological farm and 27 in the other two systems the most important source of nonrenewability in conventional systems was attributed to the fossil fuel input therefore the reduction of fossil fuel reserves in the future could be a critical factor leading to the unsustainability of systems too dependent on these nonrenewable resources agostinho et al 2008 3 3 3 emergy exchange ratio eery eery is a two purpose indicator for emergy and economic assessments odum 1996 eery is the emergy exchange ratio based on crop yield per unit area and analyzes the emergy benefits gained from crop sales in other words eery evaluates the equilibrium between the emergy that can be purchased ym with the money my gained from the market exchange for the economic output compared to the total system emergy input u incorporated in the crops produced this calculation can be carried on a per unit area basis e g sej ha 1 eery values of the four systems cucumbers tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants were 0 77 0 72 0 82 0 60 0 54 0 66 0 50 0 46 0 54 and 0 37 0 33 0 41 respectively table 8 in other words 77 60 50 and 37 of the emergy inputs to the systems of cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production respectively were turned into the emergy received by the producers from the market exchange rate for the crops lu et al 2009 2017 obtained eery values of 4 2 2 5 2 6 1 9 3 6 1 8 and 2 5 in production systems of lotus fish lotus shrimp lotus guava papaya banana and wampee respectively all of which indicate desirable and high eery levels this means that the purchasing power of money received to buy emergy on the market in exchange for a commodity output from these systems is at least 1 8 times greater than the input emergy used to produce the output in the aforementioned systems our eery values were all less than 1 and thus undesirable for the farmers in all four vegetable production systems to achieve a greater eery in addition to increasing the crop s market price different methods of species specific crop management can be used at the production stage so that the amount of system emergy input required for the crops is reduced while maintaining high production from the standpoint of the consumer the emergy value obtained from greenhouse grown vegetables compared to what is paid for them is considerable with eggplant giving the most value for the ir rial although eery in the cucumber production system was higher than the other three systems the economic output emergy of crops in the market for all four studied systems failed to even reach the point equivalent to the system input emergy the cucumber production system could only convert 77 of marketable system input emergy as a commodity exchangeable for the emergy that could be purchased by the money received for the cucumbers and the relative advantage to the farmer was lower than this in the other three systems the system input emergy the system economic output emergy the yield of vegetables per unit area and the crop sale price were all incorporated in the eery index evaluation giving the index emergetic an economic relevance hence in addition to the fact that reducing the system emergy inputs increases the value of this index increasing production per unit area and a greater crop sale price will also increase the eery index leading to enhanced production sustainability for the moment let us ignore the possibility that the yield per unit area of the crops produced in the studied ecosystems could be greater than the realized amount we now explore the effects of the market price for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant 18 000 20 000 22 000 and 15 000 rials per kg respectively on the results of this study considering the relationship between eery and ym for the eery to be equal to 1 i e equivalent emergy is exchanged for each crop it is necessary to raise the market price for cucumbers tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants to 23 360 33 480 43 960 and 40 320 rials per kg respectively the productivity of greenhouse vegetables can be upgraded per unit area using new knowledge and technology accordingly if we want to determine the amount of the economic crop yield required to bring the eery value to 1 or more instead of the values shown in table 3 we need to increase the minimum economic yield to 2622 2260 2018 and 3360 kg 1000 m 2 for cucumbers tomatoes bell peppers and eggplants or an increase in productivity of 20 40 50 and 60 respectively 3 3 4 emergy yield ratio eyr the emergy yield ratio is the result of dividing the emergy output by the purchased input emergy the eyr represents the effectiveness of the larger system in exploiting the free resources of the system zhang et al 2007 a higher value of this index reflects a greater amount of consumed emergy per unit of invested emergy chen et al 2006 the higher the value of this index the greater the system s dependence on the environmental inputs compared to purchased sources eyr values for the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems were 1 017 1 025 1 022 1 008 1 015 1 014 1 009 1 014 1 013 and 1 016 1 012 1 011 respectively table 8 given the fact that the eyr index is calculated from the ratio of the total system output purchased and free to the purchased inputs the greater use of free flows from the environment in the cucumber production system is due to two reasons first the longer production period of the plant about 60 days meaning that more sunlight is used and second the physiological nature of the cucumber plant in that it has a higher evapotranspiration than the other three plants eyr comparisons of the four studied vegetable systems showed slightly less dependence on purchased resources compared with free environmental resources in the cucumber production system in a large number of emergy analyses the eyr has been reported as one of the major indices in a study in china eyrs calculated for vegetable and rice production fields were 1 05 and 1 15 respectively lu et al 2010 the reported values of the eyr for vegetables though not grown in intensive greenhouse conditions are comparable to those of the vegetables in this study particularly for the cucumber production system in north china an eyr of 1 20 was calculated for corn zhang et al 2012 eyrs for fruit such as banana papaya guava and wampee were 1 04 1 16 1 31 and 1 30 respectively lu et al 2009 3 3 5 standard environmental loading ratio elr and the modified environmental loading ratio elr elr and elr indicate the stress imposed by the growing systems on the environment elr is calculated from the ratio of the non renewable environmental emergy inputs and the purchased inputs to the renewable environmental inputs and elr is obtained from the ratio of non renewable inputs to renewable ones ortega et al 2002 high ratios of these two indices in general mean a high pressure on the environment although elr can underestimate this pressure campbell and garmestani 2012 elr values in the present study were calculated for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production systems as 2 21e 03 2 08e 03 2 30e 03 2 67e 03 2 50e 03 2 78e 03 2 62e 03 2 44e 03 2 72e 03 and 2 69e 03 2 59e 03 2 79e 03 respectively in contrast elr values for the same production system in the same order were 4 18 3 98 5 79 4 35 4 15 6 16 4 46 4 24 6 01 and 4 62 4 60 6 91 respectively based on the elr and elr indices calculated in this study the environmental pressures derived from the cucumber and eggplant production systems were the lowest and the highest respectively the purchased renewable resources fr input to the four systems were not significantly different the value of r had no effect on the values of these two indexes due to its very small fraction of the total input in the eggplant production system fn 1 02e 16 sej 1000 m 2 had the highest amount of non renewable purchased emergy input among the systems examined hence the difference between the elr and elr indices of the four studied systems is mainly due to the differences between fn of these system the major difference among the fn input to these systems was the high level of labor used in the eggplant production system elrs less than 2 above 2 but less than 10 and above 10 generally represent relatively low medium and high environmental stresses cavalett et al 2006 according to this scale all 4 systems produced very high stress on the environment asgharipour et al 2019 calculated elr values of 16 81 and 39 66 for ecological ecosystems and high input systems for growing beans respectively in five different ranges of conventional and chemical inputs also elr levels of the ecological system and high input system for bean culture were reported to be 0 86 and 28 81 respectively in another study in iran elr values were reported to be 1 31 and 1 82 for date and pistachio production systems respectively suggesting relatively low environmental stresses by the two aforementioned garden systems jafari et al 2018 considering that the greatest portions of purchased input sources fn and fr in the present systems are due to the inputs from the workforce the greenhouse building and nitrogen fertilizer any reduction in these three inputs will result in decreasing fn and fr and moving the elr index towards higher sustainability also strategies that boost greater system utilization of environmental renewable sources and raise r and will reduce elr and elr and thereby increase the sustainability of these systems since elr is the ratio of environmental and purchased non renewable inputs to environmental and purchased renewable inputs elr fn n r fr and if the overuse of purchased inputs in the system is inevitable any elevation of fr in relation to fn will reduce elr and move toward more sustainable production systems agostinho et al 2008 reported that the reduction of fn compared to fr in ecologically managed farms decreased environmental stress about 6 times compared with environmental stress in the high fn consumption case 3 3 6 renewable benefit ratio rbr and renewable surplus rs the rbr was proposed in this study to better examine the utilization of outside free renewable environmental inputs in the greenhouse production systems compared to in open fields the formula for rbr is presented in table 5 the rbr indicates the ratio of free renewable environmental emergy r used in an area of open field producing crops equivalent to that produced per unit area in the in the enclosed systems the rbr is determined from the ratio of the renewable flows from free local resources of land per unit area outside the greenhouse rout to the renewable environmental emergy inputs required per unit area inside the greenhouse rin to produce an equivalent quantity of crops when rbr is 1 greenhouse production frees up environmental renewable resources to do work in the regional system whereas when rbr is 1 greenhouse cultivation does not provide an advantage over field cultivation in terms of the conservation of renewable resources overall sustainability might be indicated by a similar ratio that considers the use of all resources renewable and nonrenewable required to produce the same quantity of crop per unit area the greater the ratio of utilization of outside free renewable environmental inputs in the greenhouse the greater rbr the rbr values in the four systems cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant were calculated as 0 487 0 758 0 818 0 844 respectively table 8 the lower the rbr the less advantageous the enclosed system is in using r over production in the outdoor environment among the various greenhouse vegetable systems cucumber production had the lowest rbr 0 485 or in other words production of the same quantity of cucumbers in the outside environment would require only 48 5 of the renewable emergy used in the greenhouse in contrast field production of bell pepper and eggplant systems used 82 2 and 82 percent of the renewable emergy required for production of these crops in the greenhouse crops with higher rbrs are most advantageously grown in greenhouses with respect to the use of renewable resources the rs is the result of the difference between rout rin table 5 when this difference is negative it indicates the superiority of open field production in terms of use of r in addition when the rs value is positive this indicates the advantage of the greenhouse in terms of the use of r values close to zero indicate that the greenhouse is a viable choice in terms of renewable resource conservation for these crops e g bell pepper and eggplant in this study the comparison of rs values in this study has shown the superiority of bell pepper eggplant and tomato production over the cucumber systems in terms of the use of r table 8 3 3 7 standard environmental sustainability index esi and modified environmental sustainability index esi the two sustainability indices esi and the esi are intended to identify a process that maximally utilizes free environmental inputs with minimum environmental stress odum 1996 these two indices are an expression of the effectiveness of the production process while considering the system s sustainability the higher the ratio of free environmental inputs r and n to the purchased inputs and the lower the ratio of fn to fr in esi the greater the environmental sustainability of the index ulgiati and brown 1998 esi values 1 represent a high stress on the environment and in general the more intensive the production system the greater the stress on the environment cavalett et al 2006 in this study esi levels of 4 60e 04 4 92e 04 4 44e 04 3 77e 04 4 05e 04 3 65e 04 3 85e 04 4 15e 04 3 73e 03 and 3 77e 04 3 91e 04 3 67e 04 were calculated for the cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant systems respectively esi values for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production ecosystems were 0 246 0 258 0 176 0 234 0 245 0 164 0 229 0 239 0 169 and 0 218 0 220 0 146 respectively table 8 in the studied systems esi values showed a somewhat higher sustainability than the esi values because elr and elr are involved in the calculations of esi and esi the distance between esis and the esi s of the four systems was due to the differences between the elrs and elr s the trend in corresponding changes between esis and esi s are almost identical in the four studied systems indicating a slight difference between the frs of the four systems the frs of the four systems accounted for similar percentages of the total emergy input to each system the fr fractions of the total emergy inputs of cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant systems were 19 3 18 7 18 4 and 17 7 respectively regarding fr in the elr and elr formulae a higher fr percentage results in a greater per system difference between esi and esi lu et al 2003 multiple studies suggest high pressures on the environment exerted by various agricultural systems reported esi values include 0 45 for a chinese corn field zhang et al 2012 less than 0 40 for four fruit production systems banana papaya wampee and guava in china h f lu et al 2009 0 03 0 08 for five different bean production systems in iran asgharipour et al 2019 and 0 03 and 0 30 for a wheat field and a multi culture farm of clover ryegrass wheat barley and some tree species in denmark ghaley and porter 2013 when agricultural systems use more non organic inputs and are more intensive with lower portions of fr n and r as well as less diversity the index will show lower sustainability the present systems are greenhouses which are intensive agricultural systems gupta and chandra 2002 3 3 8 emergy index for sustainable development eisd the eisd examines the effects of market feedback on the system s environmental sustainability and the effects of market exchange on the emergy performance of the system the eisd integrates the results of the eery and the esi indices a greater value of this index is directly associated with the system s sustainability including the effects of the economic relationships lu et al 2003 the eisd values showed that the cucumber production system s sustainability was 1 5 2 5 times as high as the other three systems the eisd values of the four systems cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant were 3 54e 04 3 55e 04 3 64e 04 2 62e 04 2 19e 04 2 41e 04 1 92e 04 1 91e 04 2 01e 04 and 1 39e 04 1 29e 04 1 51e 04 respectively table 8 lu et al 2009 reported eisd values of 0 73 0 71 0 55 and 0 24 in the production systems of four fruits viz wampee guava papaya and banana comparison of our eisd values with those of lu et al in china showed lower sustainability of the present production systems for the four vegetables in iran compared to the chinese production systems for four fruits the higher sustainability of garden ecosystems as reported in lu et al 2009 compared to these greenhouse production systems is reasonable due to the much lower comparative intensiveness of the garden production systems nicolosi et al 2018 3 3 9 standard and modified emergy investment ratios eir and eir the eir ratio is obtained from the ratio of purchased inputs to free inputs wang et al 2014 the eir ratio is the ratio of purchased resources to renewable environmental resources alone amiri et al 2019 eir and eir explain the ratio of investment in non free resources to both free and free renewable environmental inputs in each system lan et al 2002 and amiri et al 2019 eirs in the four systems cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant were calculated as 43 44 40 53 45 11 70 00 65 36 72 90 74 82 69 35 77 37 and 82 73 83 43 89 00 respectively table 8 in the eggplant production system the eir was about twice as high as for that of cucumber production higher r 15 and n 89 percentages for cucumber compared to eggplant resulted in an eir value half of that in the eggplant systems accordingly cucumber production with fewer purchased inputs than the other three systems especially that of eggplant had greater competitive power and comparative advantage in the market relative to the other three vegetable production systems according to campbell and laherrere 1998 it is not a correct notion to consider n as a free input hence the equation fn fr r was defined as eir by amiri et al 2019 due to the deletion of n from the free input group in the eir formula the differences between eir and eir were very high however in studies in which n is significant and unavoidable due to environmental conditions not controllable within the production system amiri et al 2019 and when it includes a high fraction of the system s total emergy input eir better reflects differences in sustainability of the production systems and are much more realistic and useful for comparison than are the eir values amiri et al 2019 showed that while the difference between commercial and subsistence canola production systems was about 2 5 times based on the eir index however there was little difference between the two systems according to eir index soil loss and degradation are major contributors to the use of local non renewable resources n and n0 in agricultural production systems in iran and in many other places in the world soil loss is a major problem in many agricultural field systems in iran however it is almost zero in greenhouse systems which may offer a path toward a solution to some of the soil loss problems in arid climates cheng et al 2017 compared three crop production systems fish and chicken rearing and reported average eir values of 3 98 and 5 87 respectively indicating lower percentages of free emergy investments in agronomic systems than those of intensive chicken and fish production systems asgharipour et al 2019 reported eir values of 3 57 and 6 03 respectively for organic and high input bean production systems in iran an eir of 1 25 was reported for soybean production systems in brazil cavalett and ortega 2009 our eir values are much higher than those reported in the past for many agricultural production systems which is due to the high inputs of purchased emergy used for greenhouse construction and equipment and to the low utilization of free environmental inputs in production 4 conclusion greenhouse production is a new and effective method for the production of certain crops especially in arid climates due to the lack of water resources which is one of the main limiting factors for agriculture in iran one of the most effective methods for optimal use of water is the expansion of the off season for production by pursuing cultivation in greenhouses greenhouses have experienced growth and expansion in recent years due to favorable market prices for their produce high yields government support and payment facilities the expansion of greenhouses particularly in central and southern iran where droughts often cause many problems for farmers may be a solution to increase income and employment in the agricultural sector given the benefits of greenhouse production government support and increased demand for out of season vegetables this method of production has become one of the most attractive and profitable agricultural activities in the country however many proponents of sustainable agriculture believe that the new styles of intensive farming including greenhouse production systems do not address important issues such as the conservation of natural resources and the health of the food production system that depends on developing sustainable agricultural systems our study shows that such assumptions may be need to be qualified in the case of greenhouse production in arid climates we provide an initial index to help gage the relative efficacy of greenhouse versus field production for various crops with regard to the use of limited renewable resources in arid climates this index can be further developed to consider the overall and specific use of different types of resources and greenhouse systems in other climates in the future the present research was conducted to evaluate the socio ecological sustainability of four greenhouse systems for vegetable production in jiroft iran based on emergy analyses and the social status of the users in this study the ecological sustainabilities of four systems for cucumber tomato bell pepper and eggplant production were compared using different emergy indices and considering market conditions based on the results of the sustainability of greenhouse vegetable production a decision can be made to select the most beneficial plants in the production process to achieve the uppermost environmental and economic benefits our findings from the emergy analysis and calculation of the thermodynamic indices indicated overall a greater sustainability of the cucumber production system compared to the other three vegetables also the results of surveys on the producers social status using the analytic hierarchy process indicates that cucumber producers have different socio technical indicators including more agricultural labor experience greater cultivation areas under their control higher education status higher access to family labor greater participation in agricultural skills training courses and higher rates of membership in rural cooperatives and councils compared to the other three groups of producers leading to the prediction that cucumber greenhouse production is more likely to be more sustainable thus the results of the sociological analysis are consistent with the biophysical analysis of greenhouse production our calculated ueve values of these greenhouse vegetable crops generally had a favorable status compared to the uevs of open farm and garden production systems for example the uev of cucumbers in this study is 7 27e 03 sej j 1 7 09e 03 7 45e 03 compared favorably to that of cucumbers grown in florida 3 58e 04 sej j 1 which have a transformity almost 5 times that of greenhouse grown cucumbers in this study brandt williams 2002 the highest 5 10e 04 4 96e 04 5 25e 04 and lowest 7 27e 03 7 09e 03 7 45e 03 ueve levels were calculated for bell pepper and cucumber plants respectively the high fn of the eggplant production system resulted from the large amount of labor emergy required which led to a dramatic drop in the eggplant system s sustainability compared to that of the other systems to increase the sustainability of greenhouse systems similar to those in this study strategies to reduce or make more efficient use of labor are recommended considering its high contribution to the inputs of all four systems 30 39 of production inputs and that 24 28 for greenhouse building construction additionally technologies should be utilized that allocate the least emergy input especially from non renewable sources into the greenhouse building itself due to the intensiveness of the greenhouse production system attempts should also be made in the production process to reduce the ratio of purchased fr to fn since it involves a high use of purchased resources possibly through the use of fertilizers with higher renewable content rather than chemical fertilizers in fact a form of management should be applied that involves non chemical methods biological mechanical and physical such as the use of organic and biological materials for fertilizers as well as for pest disease and weed control the high market prices of healthy organic crops and the role of crop prices in increasing the eery index on the one hand and proponents of healthy lifestyles seeking high quality organic crops on the other hand call for a management system for the ecological production of crops fortunately this is more possible in greenhouse systems owing to their nature which includes a greater ability to control and manage inputs compared to production in open fields ultimately leading to the production of healthy and organic products with the least use of or even without the use of synthetic chemicals according to wei et al 2009 an approach that benefits from the different types of renewable energy sources in the greenhouse is also a practical approach to increase sustainability in other words given the high share of non renewable inputs in the studied greenhouse systems increasing the share of renewable inputs especially renewable environmental inputs will lead to increased sustainability the present emergy analysis compared the sustainability of four greenhouse vegetable production systems in jiroft iran the results of which can be generalized to similar climates elsewhere in iran and to other arid climates around the world for a more detailed assessment of the sustainability of greenhouse systems besides the indoor greenhouse evaluations performed in this study it is necessary to examine environmental impacts around the greenhouse and its related systems credit authorship contribution statement mohammad reza asgharipour

24869,poyang lake located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is the largest freshwater lake in china and the most important habitat for the yangtze finless porpoise with the operation of the three gorges dam the water ecosystem functions of poyang lake are deteriorating which has negatively influenced the habitat of yangtze finless porpoise in this research quantitative functions of the three environmental factors flow velocity water depth and food availability which have the greatest impact on the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise were constructed and then a habitat model of the yangtze finless porpoise was established based on hydrodynamic model the model results are in good agreement with the observed data and the simulation well reproduces the spatial position distribution and abundance of the yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake then the proposed model is applied to compare three scenarios before and after the operation of three gorges dam and simulate the evolution of hydrodynamics feeding environment and yangtze finless porpoise habitat in poyang lake two typical parts of river lake connection channel and the main lake area were analyzed separately results show that the water depth surface area and food availability in poyang lake are gradually decreasing which lead to the weakening and plaque like fragmentation of the yangtze finless porpoise habitat the findings in this study could help to understand how changes in aquatic conditions affect the ecological habitat and provide scientific guidance for the future protection of yangtze finless porpoise graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords poyang lake yangtze finless porpoise habitat model hydrodynamic evolution food availability 1 background the construction of hydraulic engineering projects is of great significance to the development and safety of human economy and society but it can also cause a series of ecological problems santucci et al 2005 ban et al 2019 as the largest freshwater lake of china poyang lake is one of the only two lakes that are directly connected with yangtze river mainstream it is located 900 km downstream of the three gorges dam connecting to the balijiang section of the yangtze river at hukou station see fig 1 poyang lake is an important habitat for a variety of aquatic animals and plants with rich biodiversity and habitat suitability lai et al 2014 in recent years with the operation of the three gorges dam the sediment carried from the upper reaches of yangtze river has been intercepted by the dam resulting in aggravation of riverbed erosion in the middle and lower reaches of the riverbed huang et al 2019 the water level at hukou station has been continuously reduced lai et al 2014 fang et al 2014 resulting in the increase of discharge from poyang lake towards the yangtze river gao et al 2014 the water surface area of poyang lake continues to shrink wang et al 2019 the low flow condition occurs earlier than before and the duration of the low flow in poyang lake becomes longer such trend becomes worse however with the deterioration of water environment conditions the ecological habitat of poyang lake is weakening and the biological diversity and abundance of benthic animals and fish are declining li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 yangtze finless porpoise is the only freshwater dolphins in the world it is a kind of migratory aquatic organism in the rivers and lakes and only exists in the mainstream of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and two large connecting lakes huang et al 2017 yangtze finless porpoise enters the poyang lake from the balijiang river section through the hukou station due to the deterioration of water ecological habitat function the number of yangtze finless porpoise in the mainstream of the yangtze river has decreased from around 2500 in 1990 to around 500 in 2012 mei et al 2014 according to previous survey data in november of each year see fig 2 the number of yangtze finless porpoise in balijiang river section has decreased by about half from 1996 to 2008 with a significant reduction trend wei et al 2002 zhao et al 2011 at present the yangtze river finless porpoise has been included in the icun red list of threatened species kimura et al 2010 wang et al 2013 according to the current population decline trend the finless porpoise is expected to disappear within 100 years mei et al 2012 the in depth investigation and protection work is very necessary and urgent to conduct the habitat of yangtze finless porpoise is influenced by both abiotic and biological factors recent studies have shown that water depth flow velocity substrate type distance from the shore water quality and availability of food all affect the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise wei et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 the number of dead yangtze finless porpoise discovered from 2008 to 2014 was 176 of which 61 4 were identified as the cause of abnormal aging death xu et al 2015 the main factors of abnormal deaths include shipping disturbances small water depth leading to stranding and hunger due to food deprivation zhao et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 heavy ship traffic increases the physical consumption of yangtze finless porpoise interferes with the swimming routes and the huge noise is also an unfavorable physiological stimulus nabi et al 2018 the ship s navigation route mainly depends on the water depth when the water level is too shallow the available water surface will be narrowed which will reduce the safety distance between ship traffic and the yangtze finless porpoise habitat wang et al 2015 for the swimming aquatic animals with strong current tropism characterizes water flow has an important impact on habitat selection goodwin et al 2006 fang et al 2016a b yangtze finless porpoise often occur in areas where water flows confluence and this area is also rich in fish resources wei et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 in order to get enough food intake yangtze finless porpoise often chooses to enter the port area with great influence on human activities at dusk and night which further shows that the lack of food resources has very adverse effects on the finless porpoise wang et al 2015 previous research has mainly used field surveys to record the population number and habitat environment changes of yangtze finless porpoise but field observations tend to be limited in both time and space scale establishing habitat models for studying the abundance and spatial distribution of aquatic animals is a necessary step for prediction and protection habit et al 2007 torres et al 2013 poyang lake is the most important habitat for feeding and activities of yangtze finless porpoise however the research on the habitat model for yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake area has not been conducted this study will analyze the quantitative effects of water depth flow velocity and food availability on the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise and then develop a habitat model for yangtze finless porpoise based on the survey data the developed model will be applied to simulate scenarios to quantitatively calculate the potential changes of hydrodynamics food resources and yangtze finless porpoise habitat in poyang lake finally the scenario results will be compared with each other to analyze the reasons for the decrease of yangtze finless porpoise abundance in different regions of poyang lake which will provide scientific evidences for the future protection work 2 study area poyang lake is located on the south bank of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river with a drainage area of 162 000 km2 accounting for 9 of the yangtze river drainage area gao et al 2014 the inflowing rivers including xiu river gan river fu river xin river and rao river lai et al 2014 enter the lake from qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng stations and then flow towards the mainstream of yangtze river through hukou station see fig 3 a the topography of poyang lake is complex and undulating including many narrow river channels and butterfly lakes showing an overall trend of higher in the south and lower in the north the topographic map uses the elevation of the yellow sea base level the water level involved in the following adopts the same base level which changes between 3 0 m and 14 0 m see fig 3b the whole poyang lake can be divided into two typical parts one is the main lake area with wide surface and shallow water depth south of xingzi station and the other is river lake connection channel area with small width and large water depth north of xingzi station influenced by the precipitation of monsoon climate the flow discharge into poyang lake appears obviously seasonal characteristics from june to august the flow discharge of rivers entering the lake is relatively large which is the wet season of poyang lake from november to february the upstream flow discharge is relatively low which is the drought season of poyang lake most areas are exposed to shoals other times are the normal seasons the maximum water level difference of wet and drought period in the lake area is around 8 8 m zhang and werner 2015 with the change of the inflow discharge poyang lake presents the transformation of the lake and river phases and the water surface area also varies between approximately 100 and 3000 km2 lai et al 2014 the study area includes the main lake area and the river lake connection channel of poyang lake the model adopts orthogonal structured grids dividing the calculation area into 305 rows and 375 columns with the grid size of 300 300 m the partial grid is shown in fig 3a the calculation of hydrodynamic model in poyang lake generally begins with the high water level period and simulates a complete hydrological year in this study the upper boundary condition of the hydrodynamic model uses the inflow discharge of the five rives and the lower boundary condition uses the water level of hukou station fig 4 3 model configuration 3 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic calculations are controlled by two dimensional reynolds average navier stokes theory integrated along the vertical direction fang et al 2006 including continuity and two momentum equations the continuous equation of hydrodynamic model is 1 z t h u x h v y 0 the momentum equations of hydrodynamic model are 2 u t u u x v u y g z x g u 2 v 2 c 2 h ν t 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 3 v t u v x v v y g z y g u 2 v 2 c 2 h ν t 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where z is the water level h is the water depth u and v are the vertically averaged velocities in the x and y directions respectively g is the gravitational acceleration vt is the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient of turbulent using 2 0 m2 s at the beginning of the calculation and c is the chezy resistance coefficient which is usually calculated through the manning formula 4 c 1 n h 1 6 where n is the manning s roughness coefficient of riverbed using 0 025 as the initial value of the calculation 3 2 yangtze finless porpoise model swimming behavior is the most important feature of aquatic animals such as finless porpoise through swimming aquatic animals can search for food resources seek benefits and avoid harm and actively select suitable areas of habitat goodwin et al 2006 fang et al 2016a 2016b boltzmann equation is based on the theory of continuity and momentum which is the most classical equation used to describe the relationship between particle velocity spatial position and external force in the large spatial scale aquatic animals can be regarded as moving particles fang et al 2016a 2016b has adopted boltzmann theory to establish a motion model for aquatic animals under the euler framework the basic form of the boltzmann equation for aquatic animals is 5 f f t v i f f x i f i f f v i f f t c where i represents two dimensions ff ff ui xi t is the distribution function of aquatic animals within a unit volume with velocity vi at the coordinates of xi at the time t fi is the resultant of external forces on aquatic animals the right hand side term is the molecule collision parameter due to the small size and low concentration of aquatic animals in space the collision term of the eq 5 can be negligible that is and the right hand term can be assumed as zero when the motion reaches a stable equilibrium state the distribution function f belongs to a time independent form using the variational method to solve the number of aquatic animals per unit volume fang et al 2016a 2016b 6 n f

animal and water flow in x and y directions respectively sa is the wetted surface area of aquatic animal ct cp and cf are thrusting drag coefficient profile drag coefficient and friction drag coefficient respectively θ is the angle between aquatic animal and flow direction cps is used to adjust the range of flow velocity for different aquatic animals fang et al 2016a 2016b used the above model to simulate the distribution of river chub in the laboratory flume under different velocity conditions webb 1998 and the spatial distribution of yangtze finless porpoise observed in 2008 and 2010 at balijiang river section kimura et al 2010 the rationality and validity of the model were verified and a set of parameters which are applicable to yangtze finless porpoise were calibrated see table 1 considering that yangtze finless porpoise can perch in static water this study assumes the relative number to be 0 2 under the most unfavorable flow condition then the relationship between the relative number of yangtze finless porpoise and flow velocity can be obtained as shown as the black solid curve in fig 5 the other two curves show that the model can be applied to more aquatic animals with different adaptation range by adjusting cps eqs 8 10 reflect the suitability requirement of yangtze finless porpoise for the flow velocity in the above applications the spatial scale of simulation area is relatively small so other environment variables can be considered to have less spatially variability water depth and food availability are both important factors affecting the distribution of finless porpoise in the yangtze river and poyang lake to simulate the yangtze finless porpoise habitat in a large water area such as poyang lake the model needs to investigate the influences of water depth and food availability kimura et al 2012 mei et al 2017 then the yangtze finless porpoise model is improved as follows 9 c n f f h f f a n f v where cnf is the number of yangtze finless porpoise after combining various factors f h is the function of water depth influence f fa is the function of food availability influence the quantitative effect of water depth on yangtze finless porpoise can be directly obtained from the survey data wei et al 2003 fig 6 shows the relative relationship between the observation times of yangtze finless porpoise and water depth yangtze finless porpoise mainly exists in waters between 2 0 m and 9 0 m deep when the water depth is more than 3 0 m the number of yangtze finless porpoise decreases exponentially in the present study it is assumed that the optimal water depth of yangtze finless porpoise is 3 0 m when the water depth is greater than or less than 3 0 m the exponential function and linear function are used to fit the relative relationship see fig 6 10 f h 0 333 h h 3 0 m 1 393 e 0 1116 h h 3 0 m investigation results at balijiang river section indicate that the observation probability of yangtze finless porpoise in the water areas with fish distribution is more than 40 and that in the areas without fish distribution is less than 20 kimura et al 2009 however the quantitative relationship between the yangtze finless porpoise abundance and its food availability lacks more detailed data tableau et al 2016 summarized the measured data and divided the impact of food availability on predator abundance into two categories one is that food availability is the necessary limiting factor for predator distribution shown as a positive correlation fig 7 a the other is that food availability is not the limiting factor for predator distribution and there is no significant relationship between them fig 7b for yangtze finless porpoise food availability is undoubtedly an important limiting factor based on the actual situation of food utilization by predators this study assumes that when the food availability is low the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise positively increases with the increment of food availability and when the food availability reaches the sufficient state yangtze finless porpoise is no longer affected this assumption is similar to the definition of logistic equation thornley et al 2007 so the same form is adopted to describe the quantitative relationship between yangtze finless porpoise abundance and food availability 11 f f a k k 0 e r f a k k 0 e r f a 1 where fa is the food availability f fa is the influence function of food availability k is used to define the relative maximum predator abundance in the present study k is set to 1 0 k0 represents the tolerance ability of predator when the food availability is 0 a larger k0 represents a greater tolerance ability when k0 is equal to 1 0 the abundance of predator is not affected by food r is a control parameter that is used to adjust the critical value as food availability increases to the sufficient state the larger value of r and then the smaller food availability required for the sufficient state yangtze finless porpoise mainly feeds on small fish located on the surface of water bodies wei et al 2003 zhang et al 2013 the main kinds of fish in poyang lake are carps zhang et al 2011 whose distribution is mainly affected by flow velocity water depth and temperature wang and lin 2013 yi et al 2014 these environmental variables have a relatively clear suitability index for carps fig 8 the abundance of small fish assemblages is the indicator of the food availability can be determined by the habitat suitability index equation yi et al 2014 12 f a g v g h g t 1 3 where g v g h and g t are the influence of flow velocity water depth and temperature on the carps respectively to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of the theoretical model fig 10 shows a conceptual diagram of the whole model 4 model calibration results 4 1 hydrodynamic calibration firstly the current scenario of the period from 2006 to 2007 was calculated the manning coefficient and horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient were mainly adjusted and the parameters were calibrated through the measured water level data of four hydrological stations at xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan see fig 11 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and pearson correlation coefficient pearson r are used to characterize the difference between measured and simulated water level when the best simulation effect is eventually determined manning coefficient and horizontal viscosity coefficient are 0 02 and 2 0 m2 s respectively the four hydrological stations are evenly distributed in space which can reflect the simulation effectiveness of the whole lake from the overall perspective of the whole year the simulation results can successfully reproduce the observed flow field with higher accuracy due to the existence of certain sand dredging working in poyang lake which cannot be considered in the model calculation the simulated value in the low water level period is higher than the measured value but it does not affect the supporting foundation of the hydrodynamic simulation results for the subsequent calculation fig 12 a is the hydrodynamic calculation result on june 26th 2006 when the inflow discharge of the five rivers is 7088 50 m3 s and the outflow s water level at hukou station is 14 22 m poyang lake is in the high water level season presenting a lake s pattern with the water surface area greater than 0 25 m of 2806 24 m2 and the water surface area greater than 2 0 m of 2371 83 m2 the water depth of the river lake connection channel is mainly over 8 0 m and the flow velocity is around 0 3 m s while the water depth of the main lake area is mainly less than 6 0 m and the flow velocity is around 0 2 m s fig 12b is the hydrodynamic calculation result on february 11st 2007 when the inflow discharge of the five rivers is 893 06 m3 s and the outflow s water level at hukou station is 5 45 m poyang lake is in the low water level drought season presenting a river s pattern with the water surface area of more than 0 25 m is only 791 98 m2 about 1 3 of that of the wet season and the water surface area of over 2 0 m is only 173 43 m2 at this time only the main channel area of river lake connection area can maintain a water depth of more than 2 0 m and the flow velocity is around 0 15 m s 4 2 yangtze finless porpoise calibration the simulation results of yangtze finless porpoise model are presented at the normal water period that is more representative in the hydrological year the selected date is may 1st 2007 when the simulated water level of xingzi station is 9 62 m the water surface area greater than 0 25 m is 1808 66 m2 and that greater than 2 0 m is 376 37 m2 which is between the wet and drought season the average flow velocity in the lake area is 0 30 m s to 0 40 m s see fig 13 a when calculating the fish abundance the same water temperature is used in the whole lake the water temperature on may 1st is 21 4 and the corresponding g t is 1 0 the most abundant area of fish is the main lake area between duchang and kangshan which is also the spawning place and protection area for carps see fig 13b the water depth in this area mainly varies from 0 5 m to 1 5 m and the flow velocity is between 0 3 m s and 0 5 m s which is the most suitable niche for carps the distribution of fish in the river lake connection channel between hukou and xingzi is relatively average especially the east beach side is more suitable for fish distribution while the difference in denisty of fish in the main lake between xingzi and kangshan is larger then the spatial distribution pattern of yangtze finless porpoise was simulated under the comprehensive hydrodynamic food availability conditions see fig 13c fig 13d is the main occurrence locations of yangtze finless porpoise over the years in poyang lake recorded by liu et al 2016 the two gray circles mark the yangtze finless porpoise nature reserve one is near the south of xingzi station and the other is located in the main area between tangyin and kangshan the value of fish abundance was directly used as the food availability parameter for yangtze finless porpoise and the parameter r in eq 11 was calibrated to make the simulation result best to reproduce the observed spatial distribution pattern finally 10 0 was chosen as the value of r and the influence curve of food availability on yangtze finless porpoise was determined as the black solid line in fig 8b it can be seen that the simulation results of yangtze finless porpoise are in good agreement with the measured results and it successfully reproduce the dense distribution of finless porpoise in the nature reserve the total number of yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake can be computed by eq 13 combined with the observation record ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china 2016 the value of a in eq 6 is determined to be 50 13 t s n f i 1 m a c s n f i where tsnf is the total number of yangtze finless porpoise ac is the area of the computing gird 5 model application results 5 1 computing scenarios setting the primary purpose of this study is to analyze the changes in hydrodynamics and feeding environment brought about by the construction of three gorges dam using the developed habitat model three different scenarios are designed in the model application the flow discharge condition at the upper boundary only refers to seasonal variation with the same flow time process for three scenarios in contrast the lower boundary adopts different water level time process at hukou station see fig 14 among the three scenarios the 1959 2002 average scenario describes the historically averaged flow conditions this scenario uses the averaged water levels from 1959 to 2002 which represents the flow conditions before the construction of three gorges dam the 2030 2031 scenario describes the future forecasting situation this scenario uses the water level conditions at around 30 years later after the construction of the three georges dam the change of water levels is mainly caused by the riverbed erosion of the yangtze river mainstream fang et al 2014 the 2006 2007 scenario is the current situation after the beginning of the operation of three gorges dam this scenario is a baseline situation where the same conditions are used in the model calibration in order to facilitate the comparison of the differences among the three scenarios 2006 2007 scenario is still shown in fig 14 5 2 hydrodynamic evolution the water level in poyang lake area is generally characterized by the value at xingzi station fig 15 a shows the monthly water level decrease between the 2006 2007 and 1959 2002 average scenario results indicate that the largest alternation in water levels occurs during the normal water level period including september october and may with a decline of about 5 5 m the water level change does not change dramatically in the wet and drought seasons and water level does not change during the driest season between the two scenarios fig 15b shows the monthly water level decrease of 2030 2031 scenario compared with the 2006 2007 scenario the water level in the wet season and drought season will decrease significantly in the future with the continuous operation of the three gorges dam the riverbed of yangtze river mainstream has been eroding and then the water level of the poyang lake continues to decrease fig 16 shows the shallow water areas and deep water areas the shallow water areas are less than 0 25 m deep and the water surface area with water deeper than 0 25 m a shallow water depth and greater than 2 0 m a deep water depth under three scenarios respectively it is obviously that in the past average scenario the period to maintain a low water depth exists much longer than that in the current scenario especially in september october and may after the operation of three gorges dam the water surface area of poyang lake has a significant shrinking trend for the high water depth even in the wet season from june to august the current scenario is still 30 less than the past average scenario and will further decrease in the future forecasting scenario during drought season the area of the larger water depth is around 200 km2 accounting for only 8 of the whole lake area the decline of water level and the narrowing of water surface in the lake area will inevitably have an adverse impact on the ecological function of poyang lake 5 3 yangtze finless porpoise habitat decline fig 17 shows the calculation results of hydrodynamic model and yangtze finless porpoise abundance model under 1959 2002 average and 2030 2031 scenarios in the 1959 2002 average scenario the simulated water level of xingzi station is m and the water area greater than 0 25 m in the lake area is 2101 84 m2 and the water area greater than 2 0 m is 629 30 m2 the river lake connection channel is full of water and only a few areas in the main lake area cannot maintain a certain depth of water the average flow velocity in the lake area is 0 3 m s fig 17a in the 2030 2031 scenario the simulated water level of xingzi station is 9 24 m and the water area greater than 0 25 m in the lake area is 1761 96 m2 an the water area greater than 2 0 m is 357 92 m2 the water area in the river lake connection channel area also has obvious decreased the flow velocity in the lake area is usually over 0 5 m s fig 17b in the 1959 2002 average scenario the spatial distribution of carps in the river lake connection channel is relatively uniform and the fish abundance in most areas is around 0 6 the largest abundance occurs between duchang and kangshan and the maximum abundance reaches 1 0 fig 17c in the 2030 2031 scenario the fish distribution area in the river lake connection channel shows obvious horizontal contraction and more areas are not suitable for fish distribution due to the shallow water depth fig 17d comparison of results shows that the distribution area of fish in the main lake area is also further narrowed with a trend of patching and the fish abundance near duchang has decreased significantly finally the abundance and spatial distribution of yangtze finless porpoise were simulated the simulated number of yangtze finless porpoise of three scenarios are 711 536 and 513 respectively implying an apparent downward trend in the 1959 2002 average scenario the habitats of yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake are highly dense and yangtze finless porpoise is densely distributed and rich in abundance in the two nature reserve areas fig 17c in the 2030 2031 scenario the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise in both the river lake connection channel and main lake area decreases significantly with patches yangtze finless porpoise does not show obviously dominant distributions in the two nature reserves fig 17d to further quantitatively analyze the changes of hydrodynamics and yangtze finless porpoise habitat in poyang lake area under the three different scenarios the water surface area average food availability and yangtze finless porpoise abundance of the two parts of river lake connection channel and main lake area were counted separately table 2 the average food availability is defined as follows 14 f a 1 m i 1 m f a i comparison between 2006 2007 scenario and 1959 2002 average scenario see fig 18 the water surface area of the low water depth in the river lake connection channel decreases more significantly down by 20 while the water surface area of the high water depth in the main lake area decreases more significantly down by 36 because the hydrodynamic conditions for fish are suitable in both circumstances the average availability of fish remains stable merely increases by 3 however the main lake area has a significant variation of hydrodynamics and the average availability of fish has dropped by 15 the total abundances of yangtze finless porpoise in the river lake connection channel and main lake area decrease by 31 and 23 respectively compared with the past average scenario the reduction of yangtze porpoise abundance in the river lake connection channel is mainly due to the decline of water area while the reduction in the main lake area is mainly due to the decline of food availability in addition the proposed model does not directly quantify the impact of shipping and its interference will further intensify as the large water depth of the main lake area decrease comparison between the 2030 2031 and 2006 2007 scenarios see fig 18 shows that the water surface area of shallow water depth deep water depth average food availability and yangtze finless porpoise in the river lake connection channel have still greatly changed by 12 46 24 and 23 respectively because of the further decline of the water level the water depth in the river lake connection channel has also become too shallow leading to further narrowing of the water surface area the river lake connection channel is the only waterway for yangtze finless porpoise to enter and exit poyang lake the narrowing of its water surface will reduce the habitat space and increase the impact of shipping which will be unfavorable for the swimming routes of yangtze finless porpoise on the contrary in the main lake area the changes of water surface area average food availability and yangtze finless porpoise abundance tend to be gentle decreasing by around 2 respectively however the fragmentation of habitat patches in the main lake area is still increasing overall the abundance of finless porpoise in the whole lake still decreased to a large extent 6 conclusions to investigate how the changes of aquatic environment in poyang lake affect the yangtze finless porpoise three key variables flow velocity water depth and food availability were selected and their impacts on the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise were determined then a habitat model of yangtze finless porpoise was established the model results have successfully reproduced the hydrodynamic characteristics and the spatial distribution pattern of yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake and the simulation results show good agreement with the field observation data the main findings of this study are as follows 1 after the operation of three gorges dam the hydrodynamic conditions in poyang lake has deteriorated with decreasing water level and water surface area the existence period of the high water depth are becoming shorter moreover the declining trend of water level will continue in the future 2 with the changes of hydrodynamics the habitat suitability of small fish in poyang lake has been declined the reduction of water area and food availability have resulted in a decrease in the number of yangtze finless porpoise populations a shrinking spatial distribution area and fragmentation of habitat 3 in the future forecasting scenario as the habitat suitability of river lake connecting part is still declining the possibility of yangtze finless porpoise swimming from the yangtze river mainstream into poyang lake will be greatly reduced although the habitat environment changes in the main lake area tend to be stable the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake still remains pessimistic 4 the impact of human activities on the yangtze finless porpoise such as shipping traffic and fishing is closely related to water depth and surface area improving the hydrodynamic conditions of poyang lake is the key point to protecting the yangtze finless porpoise this research provides a model tool to explore the habitat of yangtze finless porpoise moreover the findings could provide guidance for the protection and habitat restoration works in the future due to the scarcity of field investigation data of yangtze finless porpoise the model calibration in this study is still weak the follow up study will continue to focus on the increase of field data and further optimize model parameters credit

24869,poyang lake located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is the largest freshwater lake in china and the most important habitat for the yangtze finless porpoise with the operation of the three gorges dam the water ecosystem functions of poyang lake are deteriorating which has negatively influenced the habitat of yangtze finless porpoise in this research quantitative functions of the three environmental factors flow velocity water depth and food availability which have the greatest impact on the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise were constructed and then a habitat model of the yangtze finless porpoise was established based on hydrodynamic model the model results are in good agreement with the observed data and the simulation well reproduces the spatial position distribution and abundance of the yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake then the proposed model is applied to compare three scenarios before and after the operation of three gorges dam and simulate the evolution of hydrodynamics feeding environment and yangtze finless porpoise habitat in poyang lake two typical parts of river lake connection channel and the main lake area were analyzed separately results show that the water depth surface area and food availability in poyang lake are gradually decreasing which lead to the weakening and plaque like fragmentation of the yangtze finless porpoise habitat the findings in this study could help to understand how changes in aquatic conditions affect the ecological habitat and provide scientific guidance for the future protection of yangtze finless porpoise graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords poyang lake yangtze finless porpoise habitat model hydrodynamic evolution food availability 1 background the construction of hydraulic engineering projects is of great significance to the development and safety of human economy and society but it can also cause a series of ecological problems santucci et al 2005 ban et al 2019 as the largest freshwater lake of china poyang lake is one of the only two lakes that are directly connected with yangtze river mainstream it is located 900 km downstream of the three gorges dam connecting to the balijiang section of the yangtze river at hukou station see fig 1 poyang lake is an important habitat for a variety of aquatic animals and plants with rich biodiversity and habitat suitability lai et al 2014 in recent years with the operation of the three gorges dam the sediment carried from the upper reaches of yangtze river has been intercepted by the dam resulting in aggravation of riverbed erosion in the middle and lower reaches of the riverbed huang et al 2019 the water level at hukou station has been continuously reduced lai et al 2014 fang et al 2014 resulting in the increase of discharge from poyang lake towards the yangtze river gao et al 2014 the water surface area of poyang lake continues to shrink wang et al 2019 the low flow condition occurs earlier than before and the duration of the low flow in poyang lake becomes longer such trend becomes worse however with the deterioration of water environment conditions the ecological habitat of poyang lake is weakening and the biological diversity and abundance of benthic animals and fish are declining li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2011 yangtze finless porpoise is the only freshwater dolphins in the world it is a kind of migratory aquatic organism in the rivers and lakes and only exists in the mainstream of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and two large connecting lakes huang et al 2017 yangtze finless porpoise enters the poyang lake from the balijiang river section through the hukou station due to the deterioration of water ecological habitat function the number of yangtze finless porpoise in the mainstream of the yangtze river has decreased from around 2500 in 1990 to around 500 in 2012 mei et al 2014 according to previous survey data in november of each year see fig 2 the number of yangtze finless porpoise in balijiang river section has decreased by about half from 1996 to 2008 with a significant reduction trend wei et al 2002 zhao et al 2011 at present the yangtze river finless porpoise has been included in the icun red list of threatened species kimura et al 2010 wang et al 2013 according to the current population decline trend the finless porpoise is expected to disappear within 100 years mei et al 2012 the in depth investigation and protection work is very necessary and urgent to conduct the habitat of yangtze finless porpoise is influenced by both abiotic and biological factors recent studies have shown that water depth flow velocity substrate type distance from the shore water quality and availability of food all affect the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise wei et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 the number of dead yangtze finless porpoise discovered from 2008 to 2014 was 176 of which 61 4 were identified as the cause of abnormal aging death xu et al 2015 the main factors of abnormal deaths include shipping disturbances small water depth leading to stranding and hunger due to food deprivation zhao et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 heavy ship traffic increases the physical consumption of yangtze finless porpoise interferes with the swimming routes and the huge noise is also an unfavorable physiological stimulus nabi et al 2018 the ship s navigation route mainly depends on the water depth when the water level is too shallow the available water surface will be narrowed which will reduce the safety distance between ship traffic and the yangtze finless porpoise habitat wang et al 2015 for the swimming aquatic animals with strong current tropism characterizes water flow has an important impact on habitat selection goodwin et al 2006 fang et al 2016a b yangtze finless porpoise often occur in areas where water flows confluence and this area is also rich in fish resources wei et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 in order to get enough food intake yangtze finless porpoise often chooses to enter the port area with great influence on human activities at dusk and night which further shows that the lack of food resources has very adverse effects on the finless porpoise wang et al 2015 previous research has mainly used field surveys to record the population number and habitat environment changes of yangtze finless porpoise but field observations tend to be limited in both time and space scale establishing habitat models for studying the abundance and spatial distribution of aquatic animals is a necessary step for prediction and protection habit et al 2007 torres et al 2013 poyang lake is the most important habitat for feeding and activities of yangtze finless porpoise however the research on the habitat model for yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake area has not been conducted this study will analyze the quantitative effects of water depth flow velocity and food availability on the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise and then develop a habitat model for yangtze finless porpoise based on the survey data the developed model will be applied to simulate scenarios to quantitatively calculate the potential changes of hydrodynamics food resources and yangtze finless porpoise habitat in poyang lake finally the scenario results will be compared with each other to analyze the reasons for the decrease of yangtze finless porpoise abundance in different regions of poyang lake which will provide scientific evidences for the future protection work 2 study area poyang lake is located on the south bank of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river with a drainage area of 162 000 km2 accounting for 9 of the yangtze river drainage area gao et al 2014 the inflowing rivers including xiu river gan river fu river xin river and rao river lai et al 2014 enter the lake from qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng stations and then flow towards the mainstream of yangtze river through hukou station see fig 3 a the topography of poyang lake is complex and undulating including many narrow river channels and butterfly lakes showing an overall trend of higher in the south and lower in the north the topographic map uses the elevation of the yellow sea base level the water level involved in the following adopts the same base level which changes between 3 0 m and 14 0 m see fig 3b the whole poyang lake can be divided into two typical parts one is the main lake area with wide surface and shallow water depth south of xingzi station and the other is river lake connection channel area with small width and large water depth north of xingzi station influenced by the precipitation of monsoon climate the flow discharge into poyang lake appears obviously seasonal characteristics from june to august the flow discharge of rivers entering the lake is relatively large which is the wet season of poyang lake from november to february the upstream flow discharge is relatively low which is the drought season of poyang lake most areas are exposed to shoals other times are the normal seasons the maximum water level difference of wet and drought period in the lake area is around 8 8 m zhang and werner 2015 with the change of the inflow discharge poyang lake presents the transformation of the lake and river phases and the water surface area also varies between approximately 100 and 3000 km2 lai et al 2014 the study area includes the main lake area and the river lake connection channel of poyang lake the model adopts orthogonal structured grids dividing the calculation area into 305 rows and 375 columns with the grid size of 300 300 m the partial grid is shown in fig 3a the calculation of hydrodynamic model in poyang lake generally begins with the high water level period and simulates a complete hydrological year in this study the upper boundary condition of the hydrodynamic model uses the inflow discharge of the five rives and the lower boundary condition uses the water level of hukou station fig 4 3 model configuration 3 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic calculations are controlled by two dimensional reynolds average navier stokes theory integrated along the vertical direction fang et al 2006 including continuity and two momentum equations the continuous equation of hydrodynamic model is 1 z t h u x h v y 0 the momentum equations of hydrodynamic model are 2 u t u u x v u y g z x g u 2 v 2 c 2 h ν t 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 3 v t u v x v v y g z y g u 2 v 2 c 2 h ν t 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where z is the water level h is the water depth u and v are the vertically averaged velocities in the x and y directions respectively g is the gravitational acceleration vt is the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient of turbulent using 2 0 m2 s at the beginning of the calculation and c is the chezy resistance coefficient which is usually calculated through the manning formula 4 c 1 n h 1 6 where n is the manning s roughness coefficient of riverbed using 0 025 as the initial value of the calculation 3 2 yangtze finless porpoise model swimming behavior is the most important feature of aquatic animals such as finless porpoise through swimming aquatic animals can search for food resources seek benefits and avoid harm and actively select suitable areas of habitat goodwin et al 2006 fang et al 2016a 2016b boltzmann equation is based on the theory of continuity and momentum which is the most classical equation used to describe the relationship between particle velocity spatial position and external force in the large spatial scale aquatic animals can be regarded as moving particles fang et al 2016a 2016b has adopted boltzmann theory to establish a motion model for aquatic animals under the euler framework the basic form of the boltzmann equation for aquatic animals is 5 f f t v i f f x i f i f f v i f f t c where i represents two dimensions ff ff ui xi t is the distribution function of aquatic animals within a unit volume with velocity vi at the coordinates of xi at the time t fi is the resultant of external forces on aquatic animals the right hand side term is the molecule collision parameter due to the small size and low concentration of aquatic animals in space the collision term of the eq 5 can be negligible that is and the right hand term can be assumed as zero when the motion reaches a stable equilibrium state the distribution function f belongs to a time independent form using the variational method to solve the number of aquatic animals per unit volume fang et al 2016a 2016b 6 n f

integrated for different velocities per unit volume v is scalar swimming velocity of aquatic animal which is related to flow velocity α and β are kinetic energy coefficients a is a parameter to be

animal and water flow in x and y directions respectively sa is the wetted surface area of aquatic animal ct cp and cf are thrusting drag coefficient profile drag coefficient and friction drag coefficient respectively θ is the angle between aquatic animal and flow direction cps is used to adjust the range of flow velocity for different aquatic animals fang et al 2016a 2016b used the above model to simulate the distribution of river chub in the laboratory flume under different velocity conditions webb 1998 and the spatial distribution of yangtze finless porpoise observed in 2008 and 2010 at balijiang river section kimura et al 2010 the rationality and validity of the model were verified and a set of parameters which are applicable to yangtze finless porpoise were calibrated see table 1 considering that yangtze finless porpoise can perch in static water this study assumes the relative number to be 0 2 under the most unfavorable flow condition then the relationship between the relative number of yangtze finless porpoise and flow velocity can be obtained as shown as the black solid curve in fig 5 the other two curves show that the model can be applied to more aquatic animals with different adaptation range by adjusting cps eqs 8 10 reflect the suitability requirement of yangtze finless porpoise for the flow velocity in the above applications the spatial scale of simulation area is relatively small so other environment variables can be considered to have less spatially variability water depth and food availability are both important factors affecting the distribution of finless porpoise in the yangtze river and poyang lake to simulate the yangtze finless porpoise habitat in a large water area such as poyang lake the model needs to investigate the influences of water depth and food availability kimura et al 2012 mei et al 2017 then the yangtze finless porpoise model is improved as follows 9 c n f f h f f a n f v where cnf is the number of yangtze finless porpoise after combining various factors f h is the function of water depth influence f fa is the function of food availability influence the quantitative effect of water depth on yangtze finless porpoise can be directly obtained from the survey data wei et al 2003 fig 6 shows the relative relationship between the observation times of yangtze finless porpoise and water depth yangtze finless porpoise mainly exists in waters between 2 0 m and 9 0 m deep when the water depth is more than 3 0 m the number of yangtze finless porpoise decreases exponentially in the present study it is assumed that the optimal water depth of yangtze finless porpoise is 3 0 m when the water depth is greater than or less than 3 0 m the exponential function and linear function are used to fit the relative relationship see fig 6 10 f h 0 333 h h 3 0 m 1 393 e 0 1116 h h 3 0 m investigation results at balijiang river section indicate that the observation probability of yangtze finless porpoise in the water areas with fish distribution is more than 40 and that in the areas without fish distribution is less than 20 kimura et al 2009 however the quantitative relationship between the yangtze finless porpoise abundance and its food availability lacks more detailed data tableau et al 2016 summarized the measured data and divided the impact of food availability on predator abundance into two categories one is that food availability is the necessary limiting factor for predator distribution shown as a positive correlation fig 7 a the other is that food availability is not the limiting factor for predator distribution and there is no significant relationship between them fig 7b for yangtze finless porpoise food availability is undoubtedly an important limiting factor based on the actual situation of food utilization by predators this study assumes that when the food availability is low the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise positively increases with the increment of food availability and when the food availability reaches the sufficient state yangtze finless porpoise is no longer affected this assumption is similar to the definition of logistic equation thornley et al 2007 so the same form is adopted to describe the quantitative relationship between yangtze finless porpoise abundance and food availability 11 f f a k k 0 e r f a k k 0 e r f a 1 where fa is the food availability f fa is the influence function of food availability k is used to define the relative maximum predator abundance in the present study k is set to 1 0 k0 represents the tolerance ability of predator when the food availability is 0 a larger k0 represents a greater tolerance ability when k0 is equal to 1 0 the abundance of predator is not affected by food r is a control parameter that is used to adjust the critical value as food availability increases to the sufficient state the larger value of r and then the smaller food availability required for the sufficient state yangtze finless porpoise mainly feeds on small fish located on the surface of water bodies wei et al 2003 zhang et al 2013 the main kinds of fish in poyang lake are carps zhang et al 2011 whose distribution is mainly affected by flow velocity water depth and temperature wang and lin 2013 yi et al 2014 these environmental variables have a relatively clear suitability index for carps fig 8 the abundance of small fish assemblages is the indicator of the food availability can be determined by the habitat suitability index equation yi et al 2014 12 f a g v g h g t 1 3 where g v g h and g t are the influence of flow velocity water depth and temperature on the carps respectively to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of the theoretical model fig 10 shows a conceptual diagram of the whole model 4 model calibration results 4 1 hydrodynamic calibration firstly the current scenario of the period from 2006 to 2007 was calculated the manning coefficient and horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient were mainly adjusted and the parameters were calibrated through the measured water level data of four hydrological stations at xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan see fig 11 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and pearson correlation coefficient pearson r are used to characterize the difference between measured and simulated water level when the best simulation effect is eventually determined manning coefficient and horizontal viscosity coefficient are 0 02 and 2 0 m2 s respectively the four hydrological stations are evenly distributed in space which can reflect the simulation effectiveness of the whole lake from the overall perspective of the whole year the simulation results can successfully reproduce the observed flow field with higher accuracy due to the existence of certain sand dredging working in poyang lake which cannot be considered in the model calculation the simulated value in the low water level period is higher than the measured value but it does not affect the supporting foundation of the hydrodynamic simulation results for the subsequent calculation fig 12 a is the hydrodynamic calculation result on june 26th 2006 when the inflow discharge of the five rivers is 7088 50 m3 s and the outflow s water level at hukou station is 14 22 m poyang lake is in the high water level season presenting a lake s pattern with the water surface area greater than 0 25 m of 2806 24 m2 and the water surface area greater than 2 0 m of 2371 83 m2 the water depth of the river lake connection channel is mainly over 8 0 m and the flow velocity is around 0 3 m s while the water depth of the main lake area is mainly less than 6 0 m and the flow velocity is around 0 2 m s fig 12b is the hydrodynamic calculation result on february 11st 2007 when the inflow discharge of the five rivers is 893 06 m3 s and the outflow s water level at hukou station is 5 45 m poyang lake is in the low water level drought season presenting a river s pattern with the water surface area of more than 0 25 m is only 791 98 m2 about 1 3 of that of the wet season and the water surface area of over 2 0 m is only 173 43 m2 at this time only the main channel area of river lake connection area can maintain a water depth of more than 2 0 m and the flow velocity is around 0 15 m s 4 2 yangtze finless porpoise calibration the simulation results of yangtze finless porpoise model are presented at the normal water period that is more representative in the hydrological year the selected date is may 1st 2007 when the simulated water level of xingzi station is 9 62 m the water surface area greater than 0 25 m is 1808 66 m2 and that greater than 2 0 m is 376 37 m2 which is between the wet and drought season the average flow velocity in the lake area is 0 30 m s to 0 40 m s see fig 13 a when calculating the fish abundance the same water temperature is used in the whole lake the water temperature on may 1st is 21 4 and the corresponding g t is 1 0 the most abundant area of fish is the main lake area between duchang and kangshan which is also the spawning place and protection area for carps see fig 13b the water depth in this area mainly varies from 0 5 m to 1 5 m and the flow velocity is between 0 3 m s and 0 5 m s which is the most suitable niche for carps the distribution of fish in the river lake connection channel between hukou and xingzi is relatively average especially the east beach side is more suitable for fish distribution while the difference in denisty of fish in the main lake between xingzi and kangshan is larger then the spatial distribution pattern of yangtze finless porpoise was simulated under the comprehensive hydrodynamic food availability conditions see fig 13c fig 13d is the main occurrence locations of yangtze finless porpoise over the years in poyang lake recorded by liu et al 2016 the two gray circles mark the yangtze finless porpoise nature reserve one is near the south of xingzi station and the other is located in the main area between tangyin and kangshan the value of fish abundance was directly used as the food availability parameter for yangtze finless porpoise and the parameter r in eq 11 was calibrated to make the simulation result best to reproduce the observed spatial distribution pattern finally 10 0 was chosen as the value of r and the influence curve of food availability on yangtze finless porpoise was determined as the black solid line in fig 8b it can be seen that the simulation results of yangtze finless porpoise are in good agreement with the measured results and it successfully reproduce the dense distribution of finless porpoise in the nature reserve the total number of yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake can be computed by eq 13 combined with the observation record ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china 2016 the value of a in eq 6 is determined to be 50 13 t s n f i 1 m a c s n f i where tsnf is the total number of yangtze finless porpoise ac is the area of the computing gird 5 model application results 5 1 computing scenarios setting the primary purpose of this study is to analyze the changes in hydrodynamics and feeding environment brought about by the construction of three gorges dam using the developed habitat model three different scenarios are designed in the model application the flow discharge condition at the upper boundary only refers to seasonal variation with the same flow time process for three scenarios in contrast the lower boundary adopts different water level time process at hukou station see fig 14 among the three scenarios the 1959 2002 average scenario describes the historically averaged flow conditions this scenario uses the averaged water levels from 1959 to 2002 which represents the flow conditions before the construction of three gorges dam the 2030 2031 scenario describes the future forecasting situation this scenario uses the water level conditions at around 30 years later after the construction of the three georges dam the change of water levels is mainly caused by the riverbed erosion of the yangtze river mainstream fang et al 2014 the 2006 2007 scenario is the current situation after the beginning of the operation of three gorges dam this scenario is a baseline situation where the same conditions are used in the model calibration in order to facilitate the comparison of the differences among the three scenarios 2006 2007 scenario is still shown in fig 14 5 2 hydrodynamic evolution the water level in poyang lake area is generally characterized by the value at xingzi station fig 15 a shows the monthly water level decrease between the 2006 2007 and 1959 2002 average scenario results indicate that the largest alternation in water levels occurs during the normal water level period including september october and may with a decline of about 5 5 m the water level change does not change dramatically in the wet and drought seasons and water level does not change during the driest season between the two scenarios fig 15b shows the monthly water level decrease of 2030 2031 scenario compared with the 2006 2007 scenario the water level in the wet season and drought season will decrease significantly in the future with the continuous operation of the three gorges dam the riverbed of yangtze river mainstream has been eroding and then the water level of the poyang lake continues to decrease fig 16 shows the shallow water areas and deep water areas the shallow water areas are less than 0 25 m deep and the water surface area with water deeper than 0 25 m a shallow water depth and greater than 2 0 m a deep water depth under three scenarios respectively it is obviously that in the past average scenario the period to maintain a low water depth exists much longer than that in the current scenario especially in september october and may after the operation of three gorges dam the water surface area of poyang lake has a significant shrinking trend for the high water depth even in the wet season from june to august the current scenario is still 30 less than the past average scenario and will further decrease in the future forecasting scenario during drought season the area of the larger water depth is around 200 km2 accounting for only 8 of the whole lake area the decline of water level and the narrowing of water surface in the lake area will inevitably have an adverse impact on the ecological function of poyang lake 5 3 yangtze finless porpoise habitat decline fig 17 shows the calculation results of hydrodynamic model and yangtze finless porpoise abundance model under 1959 2002 average and 2030 2031 scenarios in the 1959 2002 average scenario the simulated water level of xingzi station is m and the water area greater than 0 25 m in the lake area is 2101 84 m2 and the water area greater than 2 0 m is 629 30 m2 the river lake connection channel is full of water and only a few areas in the main lake area cannot maintain a certain depth of water the average flow velocity in the lake area is 0 3 m s fig 17a in the 2030 2031 scenario the simulated water level of xingzi station is 9 24 m and the water area greater than 0 25 m in the lake area is 1761 96 m2 an the water area greater than 2 0 m is 357 92 m2 the water area in the river lake connection channel area also has obvious decreased the flow velocity in the lake area is usually over 0 5 m s fig 17b in the 1959 2002 average scenario the spatial distribution of carps in the river lake connection channel is relatively uniform and the fish abundance in most areas is around 0 6 the largest abundance occurs between duchang and kangshan and the maximum abundance reaches 1 0 fig 17c in the 2030 2031 scenario the fish distribution area in the river lake connection channel shows obvious horizontal contraction and more areas are not suitable for fish distribution due to the shallow water depth fig 17d comparison of results shows that the distribution area of fish in the main lake area is also further narrowed with a trend of patching and the fish abundance near duchang has decreased significantly finally the abundance and spatial distribution of yangtze finless porpoise were simulated the simulated number of yangtze finless porpoise of three scenarios are 711 536 and 513 respectively implying an apparent downward trend in the 1959 2002 average scenario the habitats of yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake are highly dense and yangtze finless porpoise is densely distributed and rich in abundance in the two nature reserve areas fig 17c in the 2030 2031 scenario the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise in both the river lake connection channel and main lake area decreases significantly with patches yangtze finless porpoise does not show obviously dominant distributions in the two nature reserves fig 17d to further quantitatively analyze the changes of hydrodynamics and yangtze finless porpoise habitat in poyang lake area under the three different scenarios the water surface area average food availability and yangtze finless porpoise abundance of the two parts of river lake connection channel and main lake area were counted separately table 2 the average food availability is defined as follows 14 f a 1 m i 1 m f a i comparison between 2006 2007 scenario and 1959 2002 average scenario see fig 18 the water surface area of the low water depth in the river lake connection channel decreases more significantly down by 20 while the water surface area of the high water depth in the main lake area decreases more significantly down by 36 because the hydrodynamic conditions for fish are suitable in both circumstances the average availability of fish remains stable merely increases by 3 however the main lake area has a significant variation of hydrodynamics and the average availability of fish has dropped by 15 the total abundances of yangtze finless porpoise in the river lake connection channel and main lake area decrease by 31 and 23 respectively compared with the past average scenario the reduction of yangtze porpoise abundance in the river lake connection channel is mainly due to the decline of water area while the reduction in the main lake area is mainly due to the decline of food availability in addition the proposed model does not directly quantify the impact of shipping and its interference will further intensify as the large water depth of the main lake area decrease comparison between the 2030 2031 and 2006 2007 scenarios see fig 18 shows that the water surface area of shallow water depth deep water depth average food availability and yangtze finless porpoise in the river lake connection channel have still greatly changed by 12 46 24 and 23 respectively because of the further decline of the water level the water depth in the river lake connection channel has also become too shallow leading to further narrowing of the water surface area the river lake connection channel is the only waterway for yangtze finless porpoise to enter and exit poyang lake the narrowing of its water surface will reduce the habitat space and increase the impact of shipping which will be unfavorable for the swimming routes of yangtze finless porpoise on the contrary in the main lake area the changes of water surface area average food availability and yangtze finless porpoise abundance tend to be gentle decreasing by around 2 respectively however the fragmentation of habitat patches in the main lake area is still increasing overall the abundance of finless porpoise in the whole lake still decreased to a large extent 6 conclusions to investigate how the changes of aquatic environment in poyang lake affect the yangtze finless porpoise three key variables flow velocity water depth and food availability were selected and their impacts on the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise were determined then a habitat model of yangtze finless porpoise was established the model results have successfully reproduced the hydrodynamic characteristics and the spatial distribution pattern of yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake and the simulation results show good agreement with the field observation data the main findings of this study are as follows 1 after the operation of three gorges dam the hydrodynamic conditions in poyang lake has deteriorated with decreasing water level and water surface area the existence period of the high water depth are becoming shorter moreover the declining trend of water level will continue in the future 2 with the changes of hydrodynamics the habitat suitability of small fish in poyang lake has been declined the reduction of water area and food availability have resulted in a decrease in the number of yangtze finless porpoise populations a shrinking spatial distribution area and fragmentation of habitat 3 in the future forecasting scenario as the habitat suitability of river lake connecting part is still declining the possibility of yangtze finless porpoise swimming from the yangtze river mainstream into poyang lake will be greatly reduced although the habitat environment changes in the main lake area tend to be stable the abundance of yangtze finless porpoise in poyang lake still remains pessimistic 4 the impact of human activities on the yangtze finless porpoise such as shipping traffic and fishing is closely related to water depth and surface area improving the hydrodynamic conditions of poyang lake is the key point to protecting the yangtze finless porpoise this research provides a model tool to explore the habitat of yangtze finless porpoise moreover the findings could provide guidance for the protection and habitat restoration works in the future due to the scarcity of field investigation data of yangtze finless porpoise the model calibration in this study is still weak the follow up study will continue to focus on the increase of field data and further optimize model parameters credit
