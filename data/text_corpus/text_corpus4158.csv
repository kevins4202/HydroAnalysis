20790,aiming at the problem that the exciting force induced by the propeller is excessive and the hull vibration noise exceeds certain limits for a certain surface ship a type of triangular vortex generator is designed in this paper which is installed on the surface of ship stern to improve the quality of ship wake and solve the vibration problem firstly the size and installing position of the vortex generator are designed based on the ship body lines then the numerical calculation is conducted both for the bare hull and hull propeller vortex generator system to investigate the effectiveness of the vortex generator with the installation of the vortex generator the wake changes mainly occur in the region near the 12 o clock the velocity in the high wake area gains effective acceleration and the circumference transition of wake becomes more moderate which contributes to the smooth transition of the blade unsteady cavitation in circumference direction what s more the changes of wake can delay the circumference angle of the blade cavitation collapse it increases the distance between the positions where the blade cavitation collapsed and the ship bottom shell it is also beneficial to reduce the amplitude of fluctuating pressure the calculated results show that the fluctuation pressure energy is spread from 1st 2nd to 3rd or more high order harmonic components with help of vortex generator so the level of fluctuation pressure drops significantly for the 1st and 2nd harmonic components which are the main exciting sources for the hull vibration keywords vortex generator propeller exciting force wake non uniformity unsteady cavitation 1 introduction the ship stern vibration in most cases may originate from the excessive propeller exciting force especially fluctuating pressure induced by unsteady propeller cavitation there are many measures that can be taken to reduce the stern vibration such as redesigning the ship stern form adopting a wake adapted propeller increasing the distance between the propeller tip and ship hull or adding a wake modification device however for an existing ship redesign the ship stern or the propeller costs too much it is better to solve the vibration problem through some added devices that can be installed easily and quickly the common choices are prepositive fins duct and vortex generator nowadays more and more ship owners would prefer to choose vortex generator to modify the old ship type huang et al 2011 saydam et al 2018 vortex generator is wildly applied in the field of aviation fluid machine

aircraft corporation in 1947 in the ship field vortex generator is mainly used to reduce the wake non uniformity to improve the propeller unsteady cavitation behavior for the ships that have severe flow separation at the aft end lee lee et al 2008 explored the influences that the vortex generator has on the wake of the low speed ship using cfd method a series of installation schemes of vortex generator for different longitudinal position horizontal position and attack angle were calculated the streamline and velocity distribution behind the vortex generator were obtained the calculation results show that the axial velocity at downstream is accelerated about 10 percent as long as the vortex generator was properly installed lu lu et al 2009 observed the severe propeller hull vortex during the propeller model cavitation for a bulk carrier and the pressure fluctuations were induced by the propeller cavitation which was much higher than permitted then the propeller hull vortex was eliminated successfully through the application of vortex generator as a result the pressure fluctuations were reduced by nearly 1 2 1 3 saydam saydam et al 2018 used cfd methods to select the vortex generator design parameters and it is concluded that the position and angle attack of vortex generator had prime effect on the magnitude of the nominal wake distribution then 3 vortex generators on each side for a small tanker with a high block coefficient hull form were designed the full scale test showed that the ship vibration was reduced 20 on both longitudinal and vertical direction with the installation of vortex generator huang huang et al 2020 investigated how vortex generator influences propeller cavitation and hull pressure fluctuation by model test in large cavitation channel it is found that the vortex generator with proper geometry can make the change of propeller cavitation to be milder which decreases the pressure fluctuations as cfd plays an important role in the design process of the vortex generator lots of work about numerical simulation technique has also been done ahmed ahmed and elbatran 2015 had given some guidance on the cfd computational mesh generation around the vortex generator region dudek 2011 had described a numerical methodology to include the effect of the vortex generator without changing the geometry in the computational domain the effectiveness of vortex generator is suggested to be checked by model or full scale tests but considering the costs of time and money the cfd method is still the one of mainly assistant tools for the vortex generator designer to control the whole design state however it is far from enough to check the design scheme only by the wake change especially in model scale dymarski and kraskowski 2011 it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of vortex generator through a complete process which begins from design of the vortex generator geometry to the ship wake to the propeller unsteady cavitation behavior and to the hull fluctuating pressure in the current paper a certain surface ship with stern vibration problem is used as the research object a type of triangle vortex generator is designed and installed on the ship stern to improve the quality of ship wake the characteristics of wake and the behavior of the propeller unsteady cavitation are analyzed in detail to reveal the principle how the vortex generator reduce the ship vibration after that the calculation results of the hull fluctuating pressure are analyzed to give a final judgments for the vortex generator the successful application of the vortex generator in this paper can provide some reference when dealing with the surface ship vibration problem based on the vortex generator design through the cfd method 2 mathematic base 2 1 governing equations fluid flow is governed by physical conservation laws basic conservation laws include the law of conservation of mass the law of conservation of momentum and the law of conservation of energy wang 2004 as the medium in the calculation water is an incompressible fluid whose heat exchange is little enough to ignore only the mass conservation equation and the momentum conservation equation are solved 1 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j p x j x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s j here u i and u j are the averaged cartesian components of the velocity vector i j 1 2 3 p is the mean pressure ρ is the fluid density and μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ u i u j is the reynolds stresses s j is the generalized source term of the momentum equation the governing equations are solved using the segregated method based on pressure velocity in which the second upwind scheme is used for the discretization of convective term and the second central differencing scheme is used for the discretization of dissipation term in order to simulate the flow separation and strong adverse pressure gradients well the shear stress transport sst k w turbulence model is

cavitating flows are modeled by the volume of fluid vof method zheng 2019 cavitation is a complex hydrodynamic phenomenon and is generally simplified as the transition of water into vapor in the region where the local pressure is lower than the water saturation pressure during the numerical simulation the transition is caused by the small gas nuclei in the water in order to mimic the phase change between water and vapor the schnerr sauer cavitation model is adopted 3 m s i g n p v p n 0 1 n 0 4 3 π r 3 4 π r 2 2 3 p v p ρ w here m is the mass transfer rate n 0 is the number of micro gas

plesset equation describing the bubble dynamics 3 vortex generator design 3 1 ship and propeller model the research object of this paper is a certain surface ship with twin propeller which is bothered by serious vibration problem in vertical direction modeled at the reduced scale of 10 5 the propellers that go with the ship are a couple of five blades with outward rotation direction both the principle parameters of ship and propeller model are listed in table 1 fig 1 shows geometry models it is found in the sea trials that the severity of the hull vibration is greatly related with the cavitation number and the high vibration positions are mainly located in the close vicinity of the propeller plane all kinds of phenomenon indicate that the vibration that the hull experienced is induced mainly by propeller unsteady cavitation the reason behind that is excessive non uniformity due to the flow separation at the aft end fig 2 gives the schematic of the perhaps flow separation zone 3 2 vortex generator model the working principle of vortex generator is to create vortices upstream then the vortices mix with low energy boundary flow downstream and the energy is transferred from vortices to boundary flow hence boundary flow in the adverse pressure gradient can continue to move against the hull surface without separation this helps accelerate the axial velocity at the propeller plane especially at the top dead center position falchi et al 2014 shape size and installation position are three key parameters for vortex generator design regarding the shape there are many kinds of geometries for vortex generator such as foils rectangular plates triangular plates doublet etc however the most commonly used geometry of vortex generator in the ship field is triangular plates as shown in fig 3 the balance between the effectiveness and its induced appendage resistance is very important the size of vortex generator should not be too large or small the excessive size of the vortex generator can even result in a resistance increase by 1 2 percent the proposed value for the height of the vortex generator is equal to 0 5 0 8 local boundary layer thickness huang et al 2011 finally a small triangular vortex generator is designed for the current ship through the estimation of the stern boundary layer thickness fig 4 shows the size and installation position of the designed vortex generator the length of right angle sides of vortex generator is 100 mm and 50 mm in the model scale the thickness of the plate is 6 mm the side ab is tangent to the hull surface and the side ac is perpendicular to the hull surface the attack angle of vortex generator is set as 23 to have the greatest improvement the vortex generator is placed in 2 5 d propeller diameter in front of propeller plane in longitudinal direction and 0 1 d below the propeller center point in vertical direction 4 computational settings 4 1 computational domain and boundary condition as the ship and propeller are right and left symmetrical the starboard half model is selected for calculation to save the computation resources the computational domain is divided into two sub domains including the ship domain and propeller domain the ship domain is a static region and it is set as a cuboid water basin referring to the towing tank as fig 5 shows the inlet is 2 lpp from the bow to ensure the inflow is uniform the domain side and bottom from the hull surface are both 2 lpp to avoid the hull flow field affected by the basin wall regarding the full development of the hull wake the outlet from the stern is 3 lpp li et al 2019 the inlet is set as a velocity inlet the outlet is set as a pressure outlet the domain top plane on the free surface is set as symmetry the other boundaries are set as a wall the propeller domain only contains propeller it is set as a cylinder region with rotating motion 4 2 grid division the trimmer mesh is adopted in the current study to calculate the wake flow better the grids within the range of kelvin angle are properly refined in the state without vortex generator the total grids number is set as 4 5 million for the bare ship and 5 5 million for the propeller ship system in the state with vortex generator more grids should be put into the region near the vortex generator to capture the growth and propagation of vortices well so it leads to a growth of grids number about 1 5 million on the basis of state without vortex generator the grid details are shown in fig 6 4 3 calculation conditions the effectiveness of vortex generator is checked by two steps at the first step the bare hull model with and without vortex generator is calculated the effectiveness is analyzed from the view of flow field at the second step the calculation is performed for the ship propeller vortex generator system at the propeller design point the effectiveness is analyzed from the view of propeller cavitation behavior and hull fluctuation pressure signal the inlet flow speed is always set as 2 73 m s the propeller revolution speed is set as 19 19 rps and the cavitation number is set as 1 545 at the second step the definition of cavitation number is as follows here ρ is the water density d m is the diameter of propeller model 4 σ n 0 8 r p p v 0 5 ρ 0 8 π n d m 2 5 wake analysis 5 1 stern streamlines the aim of the vortex generator is to prevent or delay the flow separation at the high risk separation zone as shown in fig 2 the flow separation can be located by the streamlines on the stern surface which is drawn by wall shear stress from fig 7 we can see that flow separation for the current ship mainly occur at the region1 and region 2 that is marked by the circle line in the figure this is the reason to lead to the high wake factor at the upper half propeller plane with the installation of vortex generator the above condition is greatly improved the upstream flow is accelerated and changes its moving direction when it passes through the vortex generator more flow energy is forced to be transferred to the separation regions it is clear to see that the flow separation is successfully prevented at the region1 and delayed at region 2 5 2 wake non uniformity the circumferential angle is defined as fig 8 shows the 0 is located at the 12 o clock position fig 9 gives the axial nominal wake factor contour at propeller plane including the calculated results and experimental results the experimental results are only available for the original ship without vortex generator in general the calculated results of the current ship nominal wake show good agreements with the experimental data the calculation method is validated in order to analyze the deviation between cfd and efd further the nominal wake curves at different radial position are shown in fig 10 the differences between the two are mainly reflected in the position at 180 where it is beneath the hub the wake peak value obtained by efd method is a little higher than cfd calculated value from the wake vector graph in fig 15 b vortex flow is captured beneath the hub by cfd method however it is not shown in the experimental data the possible reason for this is that the dummy propeller hub is ignored when we perform the cfd calculation which leads to a strong vortex flow shedding from the end of the hub to the propeller plane it can be called hub vortex to some degrees although it is not the real hub vortex behind the propeller or it is closer to a bilge vortex whatever it takes the flow beneath the hub at the propeller plane is accelerated by this type of vortex and velocity is rather larger than the efd data it is noteworthy that axial wake peak at 12 o clock reach up to 0 8 due to the flow separation the axial velocity at the propeller has sharply changes in gradient it is believed that this is the root cause to the excessive hull vibration as there is no experimental validation for the case with vortex generator three systematic refined grids for the ship with vortex generator are generated to investigate the grid independency these three refined grids have the same grid topology and the grid refinement ratio is 2 1 3 the number of cells and grid distribution are shown in fig 11 the calculated nominal wake factor contour for three refined grids are shown in fig 12 we can see that the wake characteristics for the three calculated results look incredibly similar the differences only occurs in the region from the 0 to 40 where are influenced strongly by the vortex generator it seems like that the grid2 and grid3 with more cells has higher wake resolution ratio to capture more flow details the nominal wake curves at 0 8r and 1 0r from 0 to 50 for three refined grids are drawn in fig 13 for the reason that this region with high wake peak is the most concern for the propeller cavitation behavior it can be seen that as the cell number grows the calculated nominal wake results gradually converge the calculated results for grid2 and grid3 have reached a relative stable state although there are still small fluctuations in view of the calculation time cost the grid2 is finally chosen to perform the next calculation for the hull propeller vortex generator system there are obvious improvements for the wake peak at the position near 12 o clock after installing the vortex generator based on the calculated results using the grid2 the flow velocity at high wake peak area has got effective compensation from the vortex flow induced by the upstream vortex generator the created vortex flow can be seen clearly in the wake vector graph in fig 15 c the maximum wake factor in circumferential direction drop largely which drops from 0 85 to 0 57 at 0 4r from 0 78 to 0 50 at 0 6r from 0 76 to 0 62 at 0 8r and from 0 84 to 0 70 at 1 0r with the comparison of wake curves in fig 14 it can be found that the slop of the wake curves with vortex generator from 330 to 90 becomes smaller it means the wake transition of this region in circumferential direction is more moderate which will contribute to calming down flaring up of the propeller unsteady cavitation the wake non uniformity is expressed as follow 5 u x r 1 2 π 0 2 π u x r θ d θ 6 δ u x r u x r max u x r min u x r here u x is the dimensionless axial velocity u x r is the circumferential average of dimensionless axial velocity in a specific radius u x r max is the peak value in a specific radius and u x r min is the valley value δ u x r is the wake non uniformity the bigger the wake non uniformity is the worse the propeller unsteady hydrodynamics performance is expected to be fig 16 gives the distribution curve of non uniformity in radial direction the calculated results show that the non uniformity is significantly improved the non uniformity drop amplitude is up to 7 57 from 0 3r to 1 2r in general the inside radius received better results than the outside radius however the improvements at 0 9r are also acceptable as it has a drop amplitude about 38 which is very important to control the tip cavitation fluctuation 6 unsteady cavitation analysis the dynamic changes the process of propeller cavitation pattern with the circumferential angle directly determines the level of hull fluctuation pressure fig 17 shows the comparison of propeller cavitation pattern without vg between cfd and efd the cavitation pattern observation tests are conducted in the cssrc cavitation tunnel in which the ship wake is simulated by grid method the tested condition is chosen as k t 0 2012 σ v 1 545 for the listed three different position the propeller cavitation pattern of cfd and efd results are similar on the whole except for some details of tip vortex the cfd results can reflect the change tendency of cavitation pattern effectively in order to investigate the influence of vortex generator on cavitation pattern further fig 18 shows the calculated results of growth and collapse of the propeller cavitation from 340 to 80 for the conditions with and without vortex generator we can see that cavitation starts at the leading edge the cavitation inceptive angle is close for the two at the angle about 340 very much because the wake changes caused by vortex generator basically cover from 330 to 90 in the circumferential direction little disturbances are brought to the wake at the region from 270 to 330 with blade entrancing to the high wake field the cavitation grows the cavitation area increase continuously from 0 to 30 for the condition without vortex generator the cavitation seems to reach the max area at about 30 the inner radius cavitation starts to roll up and has a tendency to shed from the blade surface as a result the inner radius cavitation area shrinks little by little however for the condition with vortex generator the cavitation pattern is more stable because the drop of wake peak and the broaden width of high peak band are helpful for the cavitation to stay in a comparatively stable state as the blade rotates from 30 to 60 for the condition without vortex generator the blade cavitation collapses violently and its area also decreases sharply when the blade come to the 60 the cavitation has almost fully shed from the blade surface only a little part of cavitation occurred at the propeller tip it is worth noting that some parts of sheet cavitation do not develop and move towards the tip smoothly during the shedding process as a result they do not mix with the tip vortex cavitation and finally shed from the trailing edge in this condition there is the risk of roughening of the propeller and it should be paid attention to however for the condition with vortex generator the cavitation area and intensity do not change too much during this angle range at the position of 60 the shedding and collapsing of cavitation are just getting started for the angle from 70 to 80 the cavitation with vortex generator becomes weak gradually the difference of the cavitation pattern between the condition with vortex generator and without vortex generator is more obvious so with the above analysis the benefits coming from the vortex generator can be summed up as follows 1 the vortex generator can make the propeller unsteady cavitation become more stable as well as the changes of the cavitation area or volume in circumferential direction becomes more moderate it can contribute to decreasing the fluctuation pressure induced by the collapse of the cavitation 2 the vortex generator can make the cavitation expand to larger rotation angle and hence delay the collapse angles of the cavitation it means the distance between the positions where the blade cavitation collapsed and the ship bottom shell increase this will also be beneficial to the reduction of fluctuation pressure as the propagation distance of dynamic pressure increase the vortex generator changes the wake on the propeller plane so the propeller hydrodynamic performance is influenced the variation of the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient over the last full propeller revolution are recorded in fig 19 the results show that it is obviously periodic and the peak numbers is in accordance with the propeller blade numbers table 2 lists the calculated time average values of the propeller thrust coefficient and torque coefficient the propeller load with vg increase about 3 5 percent compared with the case without vg however the hydrodynamic efficiency is almost the same the increase of propeller load cause larger cavitation patterns this correspond with the above propeller cavitation analysis results then the fft transform is performed for the time domain signal of the propeller thrust coefficient and torque coefficient fig 20 shows the fft analysis results as the wake uniformity is improved by vortex generator the fluctuations of the bear force for the 1st harmonic 2nd harmonic and 3rd harmonic components also drop a little to a certain degree it will do some good to reduce longitudinal vibration 7 fluctuation pressure analysis five monitor points for the dynamic pressure from p1 to p5 are arranged referring to fig 21 the fluctuation pressure is obtained as table 3 and fig 22 show after performing the fast fourier transform for the time domain signal of the pressure it is discovered that the peak value of fluctuating pressure at p4 point is maximum among the five points both for 1st harmonic and 2nd harmonic although the distance from p3 point to the propeller tip is the shortest the peak value in p3 point is still smaller than it at p4 point because the sheet cavitation is still growing when it reaches the p3 point it does not collapse violently until the blade comes to the near field of p4 point corresponding to the angle about 25 as the p4 is the closest monitor point to the cavitation collapsing site there is no doubt that it suffers the strongest fluctuation pressure table 4 gives the changes of fluctuation pressure after installing the vortex generator with the influence of vortex generator the fluctuation pressure drops significantly at every monitor point for the 1st harmonic and 2nd harmonic the average changes are 27 3 for the 1st harmonic and 81 91 for the 2nd harmonic it can be seen that the vortex generator is more skilled in dealing with the 2nd harmonic than the 1st harmonic however the peak value increases a lot for the3rd harmonic compared with the condition without vortex generator it means that the fluctuation energy is transferred from 1st 2nd to 3rd or more high order harmonic components due to the existence of vortex generator of course it is glad to see that happens as the high order components are far less than the 1st and 2nd 8 conclusions a type of triangular vortex generator is designed for a certain surface ship to solve the excessive vibration problem by improving its wake uniformity and reduce propeller cavitation fluctuation pressure the effectiveness of the vortex generator is checked by cfd method the conclusions are obtained as follows 1 the calculated stern wake distribution agrees reasonably well with the experimental results it indicates that the calculation methods in this paper are accurate and reliable the main deviation is shown in the position at 180 where it is beneath the hub due to the ignoring of dummy propeller hub when we conduct the numerical calculation 2 the obvious improvements for the wake at the position near 12 o clock are observed after installing the vortex generator the velocity in the high wake area is caused by the flow separation gains effective compensation and the circumference transition of wake becomes more moderate the beneficial changes of wake non uniformity reach up to 7 57 from 0 3r to 1 2r 3 the vortex generator makes the propeller unsteady cavitation become more stable and transit more smoothly in circumferential direction what s more vortex generator delays the collapse angles of the cavitation it increases the distance between the blade tip and ship surface when the blade cavitation collapse it is also beneficial to reduce the amplitude of fluctuating pressure 4 the fluctuation pressure energy is transferred from 1st 2nd to 3rd or more high order harmonic components with the influence of vortex generator so the level of fluctuation pressure drops significantly for the 1st and 2nd harmonic components which are the main exciting sources for the hull vibration the analysis results show that the average changes are 27 3 for the 1st harmonic and 81 91 for the 2nd harmonic the wake uniformity and propeller cavitation fluctuation pressure performance are successfully improved through the design of the vortex generator in the current study but the effectiveness is only checked in model scale we believe that it is very important for us to gather full scale ship tests data as much as possible in the future it will be helpful to understand the scale effect of the vortex generator

the side ac is perpendicular to the hull surface the attack angle of vortex generator is set as 23 to have the greatest improvement the vortex generator is placed in 2 5 d propeller diameter in front of propeller plane in longitudinal direction and 0 1 d below the propeller center point in vertical direction 4 computational settings 4 1 computational domain and boundary condition as the ship and propeller are right and left symmetrical the starboard half model is selected for calculation to save the computation resources the computational domain is divided into two sub domains including the ship domain and propeller domain the ship domain is a static region and it is set as a cuboid water basin referring to the towing tank as fig 5 shows the inlet is 2 lpp from the bow to ensure the inflow is uniform the domain side and bottom from the hull surface are both 2 lpp to avoid the hull flow field affected by the basin wall regarding the full development of the hull wake the outlet from the stern is 3 lpp li et al 2019 the inlet is set as a velocity inlet the outlet is set as a pressure outlet the domain top plane on the free surface is set as symmetry the other boundaries are set as a wall the propeller domain only contains propeller it is set as a cylinder region with rotating motion 4 2 grid division the trimmer mesh is adopted in the current study to calculate the wake flow better the grids within the range of kelvin angle are properly refined in the state without vortex generator the total grids number is set as 4 5 million for the bare ship and 5 5 million for the propeller ship system in the state with vortex generator more grids should be put into the region near the vortex generator to capture the growth and propagation of vortices well so it leads to a growth of grids number about 1 5 million on the basis of state without vortex generator the grid details are shown in fig 6 4 3 calculation conditions the effectiveness of vortex generator is checked by two steps at the first step the bare hull model with and without vortex generator is calculated the effectiveness is analyzed from the view of flow field at the second step the calculation is performed for the ship propeller vortex generator system at the propeller design point the effectiveness is analyzed from the view of propeller cavitation behavior and hull fluctuation pressure signal the inlet flow speed is always set as 2 73 m s the propeller revolution speed is set as 19 19 rps and the cavitation number is set as 1 545 at the second step the definition of cavitation number is as follows here ρ is the water density d m is the diameter of propeller model 4 σ n 0 8 r p p v 0 5 ρ 0 8 π n d m 2 5 wake analysis 5 1 stern streamlines the aim of the vortex generator is to prevent or delay the flow separation at the high risk separation zone as shown in fig 2 the flow separation can be located by the streamlines on the stern surface which is drawn by wall shear stress from fig 7 we can see that flow separation for the current ship mainly occur at the region1 and region 2 that is marked by the circle line in the figure this is the reason to lead to the high wake factor at the upper half propeller plane with the installation of vortex generator the above condition is greatly improved the upstream flow is accelerated and changes its moving direction when it passes through the vortex generator more flow energy is forced to be transferred to the separation regions it is clear to see that the flow separation is successfully prevented at the region1 and delayed at region 2 5 2 wake non uniformity the circumferential angle is defined as fig 8 shows the 0 is located at the 12 o clock position fig 9 gives the axial nominal wake factor contour at propeller plane including the calculated results and experimental results the experimental results are only available for the original ship without vortex generator in general the calculated results of the current ship nominal wake show good agreements with the experimental data the calculation method is validated in order to analyze the deviation between cfd and efd further the nominal wake curves at different radial position are shown in fig 10 the differences between the two are mainly reflected in the position at 180 where it is beneath the hub the wake peak value obtained by efd method is a little higher than cfd calculated value from the wake vector graph in fig 15 b vortex flow is captured beneath the hub by cfd method however it is not shown in the experimental data the possible reason for this is that the dummy propeller hub is ignored when we perform the cfd calculation which leads to a strong vortex flow shedding from the end of the hub to the propeller plane it can be called hub vortex to some degrees although it is not the real hub vortex behind the propeller or it is closer to a bilge vortex whatever it takes the flow beneath the hub at the propeller plane is accelerated by this type of vortex and velocity is rather larger than the efd data it is noteworthy that axial wake peak at 12 o clock reach up to 0 8 due to the flow separation the axial velocity at the propeller has sharply changes in gradient it is believed that this is the root cause to the excessive hull vibration as there is no experimental validation for the case with vortex generator three systematic refined grids for the ship with vortex generator are generated to investigate the grid independency these three refined grids have the same grid topology and the grid refinement ratio is 2 1 3 the number of cells and grid distribution are shown in fig 11 the calculated nominal wake factor contour for three refined grids are shown in fig 12 we can see that the wake characteristics for the three calculated results look incredibly similar the differences only occurs in the region from the 0 to 40 where are influenced strongly by the vortex generator it seems like that the grid2 and grid3 with more cells has higher wake resolution ratio to capture more flow details the nominal wake curves at 0 8r and 1 0r from 0 to 50 for three refined grids are drawn in fig 13 for the reason that this region with high wake peak is the most concern for the propeller cavitation behavior it can be seen that as the cell number grows the calculated nominal wake results gradually converge the calculated results for grid2 and grid3 have reached a relative stable state although there are still small fluctuations in view of the calculation time cost the grid2 is finally chosen to perform the next calculation for the hull propeller vortex generator system there are obvious improvements for the wake peak at the position near 12 o clock after installing the vortex generator based on the calculated results using the grid2 the flow velocity at high wake peak area has got effective compensation from the vortex flow induced by the upstream vortex generator the created vortex flow can be seen clearly in the wake vector graph in fig 15 c the maximum wake factor in circumferential direction drop largely which drops from 0 85 to 0 57 at 0 4r from 0 78 to 0 50 at 0 6r from 0 76 to 0 62 at 0 8r and from 0 84 to 0 70 at 1 0r with the comparison of wake curves in fig 14 it can be found that the slop of the wake curves with vortex generator from 330 to 90 becomes smaller it means the wake transition of this region in circumferential direction is more moderate which will contribute to calming down flaring up of the propeller unsteady cavitation the wake non uniformity is expressed as follow 5 u x r 1 2 π 0 2 π u x r θ d θ 6 δ u x r u x r max u x r min u x r here u x is the dimensionless axial velocity u x r is the circumferential average of dimensionless axial velocity in a specific radius u x r max is the peak value in a specific radius and u x r min is the valley value δ u x r is the wake non uniformity the bigger the wake non uniformity is the worse the propeller unsteady hydrodynamics performance is expected to be fig 16 gives the distribution curve of non uniformity in radial direction the calculated results show that the non uniformity is significantly improved the non uniformity drop amplitude is up to 7 57 from 0 3r to 1 2r in general the inside radius received better results than the outside radius however the improvements at 0 9r are also acceptable as it has a drop amplitude about 38 which is very important to control the tip cavitation fluctuation 6 unsteady cavitation analysis the dynamic changes the process of propeller cavitation pattern with the circumferential angle directly determines the level of hull fluctuation pressure fig 17 shows the comparison of propeller cavitation pattern without vg between cfd and efd the cavitation pattern observation tests are conducted in the cssrc cavitation tunnel in which the ship wake is simulated by grid method the tested condition is chosen as k t 0 2012 σ v 1 545 for the listed three different position the propeller cavitation pattern of cfd and efd results are similar on the whole except for some details of tip vortex the cfd results can reflect the change tendency of cavitation pattern effectively in order to investigate the influence of vortex generator on cavitation pattern further fig 18 shows the calculated results of growth and collapse of the propeller cavitation from 340 to 80 for the conditions with and without vortex generator we can see that cavitation starts at the leading edge the cavitation inceptive angle is close for the two at the angle about 340 very much because the wake changes caused by vortex generator basically cover from 330 to 90 in the circumferential direction little disturbances are brought to the wake at the region from 270 to 330 with blade entrancing to the high wake field the cavitation grows the cavitation area increase continuously from 0 to 30 for the condition without vortex generator the cavitation seems to reach the max area at about 30 the inner radius cavitation starts to roll up and has a tendency to shed from the blade surface as a result the inner radius cavitation area shrinks little by little however for the condition with vortex generator the cavitation pattern is more stable because the drop of wake peak and the broaden width of high peak band are helpful for the cavitation to stay in a comparatively stable state as the blade rotates from 30 to 60 for the condition without vortex generator the blade cavitation collapses violently and its area also decreases sharply when the blade come to the 60 the cavitation has almost fully shed from the blade surface only a little part of cavitation occurred at the propeller tip it is worth noting that some parts of sheet cavitation do not develop and move towards the tip smoothly during the shedding process as a result they do not mix with the tip vortex cavitation and finally shed from the trailing edge in this condition there is the risk of roughening of the propeller and it should be paid attention to however for the condition with vortex generator the cavitation area and intensity do not change too much during this angle range at the position of 60 the shedding and collapsing of cavitation are just getting started for the angle from 70 to 80 the cavitation with vortex generator becomes weak gradually the difference of the cavitation pattern between the condition with vortex generator and without vortex generator is more obvious so with the above analysis the benefits coming from the vortex generator can be summed up as follows 1 the vortex generator can make the propeller unsteady cavitation become more stable as well as the changes of the cavitation area or volume in circumferential direction becomes more moderate it can contribute to decreasing the fluctuation pressure induced by the collapse of the cavitation 2 the vortex generator can make the cavitation expand to larger rotation angle and hence delay the collapse angles of the cavitation it means the distance between the positions where the blade cavitation collapsed and the ship bottom shell increase this will also be beneficial to the reduction of fluctuation pressure as the propagation distance of dynamic pressure increase the vortex generator changes the wake on the propeller plane so the propeller hydrodynamic performance is influenced the variation of the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient over the last full propeller revolution are recorded in fig 19 the results show that it is obviously periodic and the peak numbers is in accordance with the propeller blade numbers table 2 lists the calculated time average values of the propeller thrust coefficient and torque coefficient the propeller load with vg increase about 3 5 percent compared with the case without vg however the hydrodynamic efficiency is almost the same the increase of propeller load cause larger cavitation patterns this correspond with the above propeller cavitation analysis results then the fft transform is performed for the time domain signal of the propeller thrust coefficient and torque coefficient fig 20 shows the fft analysis results as the wake uniformity is improved by vortex generator the fluctuations of the bear force for the 1st harmonic 2nd harmonic and 3rd harmonic components also drop a little to a certain degree it will do some good to reduce longitudinal vibration 7 fluctuation pressure analysis five monitor points for the dynamic pressure from p1 to p5 are arranged referring to fig 21 the fluctuation pressure is obtained as table 3 and fig 22 show after performing the fast fourier transform for the time domain signal of the pressure it is discovered that the peak value of fluctuating pressure at p4 point is maximum among the five points both for 1st harmonic and 2nd harmonic although the distance from p3 point to the propeller tip is the shortest the peak value in p3 point is still smaller than it at p4 point because the sheet cavitation is still growing when it reaches the p3 point it does not collapse violently until the blade comes to the near field of p4 point corresponding to the angle about 25 as the p4 is the closest monitor point to the cavitation collapsing site there is no doubt that it suffers the strongest fluctuation pressure table 4 gives the changes of fluctuation pressure after installing the vortex generator with the influence of vortex generator the fluctuation pressure drops significantly at every monitor point for the 1st harmonic and 2nd harmonic the average changes are 27 3 for the 1st harmonic and 81 91 for the 2nd harmonic it can be seen that the vortex generator is more skilled in dealing with the 2nd harmonic than the 1st harmonic however the peak value increases a lot for the3rd harmonic compared with the condition without vortex generator it means that the fluctuation energy is transferred from 1st 2nd to 3rd or more high order harmonic components due to the existence of vortex generator of course it is glad to see that happens as the high order components are far less than the 1st and 2nd 8 conclusions a type of triangular vortex generator is designed for a certain surface ship to solve the excessive vibration problem by improving its wake uniformity and reduce propeller cavitation fluctuation pressure the effectiveness of the vortex generator is checked by cfd method the conclusions are obtained as follows 1 the calculated stern wake distribution agrees reasonably well with the experimental results it indicates that the calculation methods in this paper are accurate and reliable the main deviation is shown in the position at 180 where it is beneath the hub due to the ignoring of dummy propeller hub when we conduct the numerical calculation 2 the obvious improvements for the wake at the position near 12 o clock are observed after installing the vortex generator the velocity in the high wake area is caused by the flow separation gains effective compensation and the circumference transition of wake becomes more moderate the beneficial changes of wake non uniformity reach up to 7 57 from 0 3r to 1 2r 3 the vortex generator makes the propeller unsteady cavitation become more stable and transit more smoothly in circumferential direction what s more vortex generator delays the collapse angles of the cavitation it increases the distance between the blade tip and ship surface when the blade cavitation collapse it is also beneficial to reduce the amplitude of fluctuating pressure 4 the fluctuation pressure energy is transferred from 1st 2nd to 3rd or more high order harmonic components with the influence of vortex generator so the level of fluctuation pressure drops significantly for the 1st and 2nd harmonic components which are the main exciting sources for the hull vibration the analysis results show that the average changes are 27 3 for the 1st harmonic and 81 91 for the 2nd harmonic the wake uniformity and propeller cavitation fluctuation pressure performance are successfully improved through the design of the vortex generator in the current study but the effectiveness is only checked in model scale we believe that it is very important for us to gather full scale ship tests data as much as possible in the future it will be helpful to understand the scale effect of the vortex generator

20791,rotating stall in centrifugal pumps takes place frequently under part load conditions along with high pressure pulsation the major focus for studies is rotating stall inside the impeller rarely paying attention to that in the vaned diffuser in this study rotating stall behavior in a vaned diffuser centrifugal pump has been numerically investigated and the cross power spectrum method is adopted to identify low frequency pressure signals the applied numerical method has been validated by experimental results including flow structures provided by piv measurements for the vaned diffuser pump a hump region in head curve is observed between 0 25q d and 0 5q d conditions under 0 41q d condition rotating stall occurs in the vaned diffuser of the pump with three stall cells rotating opposite to the direction of impeller rotation and the rotating frequency being 0 083 hz equal to 1 600 of the impeller rotating frequency rotating stall takes place under 0 5q d condition as well whereas only a periodic process of stall cell from inception to disappearance appears in the diffuser channel under 0 35q d condition furthermore the effect of number of diffuser vanes on rotating stall characteristics has been analyzed in detail keywords centrifugal pump vaned diffuser rotating stall cross power spectrum pressure pulsation 1 introduction electric submersible pumps esps are widely used in the offshore petroleum industry because of their advantages in pumping high flowrate crude oil minette et al 2016 takacs 2017 they are installed in the production well generally in deep or ultra deep water greatly improving their installation and maintenance costs reges et al 2021 castillo et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2005 the research on the reliability of esps to reduce risk has attracted much attention especially centrifugal pumps core components of esps with the development of offshore oil production equipment in large scale and high power orientation centrifugal pumps have been extensively used on non optimal conditions li et al 2020a zhang et al 2020a rotating stall usually occurs with pressure pulsation under low flow rate conditions caused by single or coupled effects of backflow flow separation rotor stator interaction and jet wake resulting in performance deterioration and the instability of the pump units pei et al 2014 fu et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 for the research on the rotating stall in centrifugal pumps the experimental and numerical methods are currently used experiments first promoted the study of rotating stall in pumps yoshida et al 1991 concluded for a centrifugal pump that a diffuser made interference to the propagation speed of rotating stall on low flow conditions moreover rotating stall in the diffuser weakened and then disappeared with the decreasing of the radial gap between the blade and vane based on the results obtained from pressure pulsation measurement and particle image velocimetry piv sinha et al 2001 demonstrated that the rotating stall in the diffuser originated from high speed leakage flow berten et al 2009 reported that the type propagation speed and number of stalls in pumps are affected by pump s flow and speed zhang 2010 detected unstable flow inside pump s diffuser using a two dimensional laser doppler velocimeter ldv and pointed out that the expansion angle at the inlet of the diffuser was a key factor affecting the rotating stall xue et al 2019 revealed the evolution for rotating stall during pumping condition by piv which greatly affects the performance of the pump turbine although the rotating stall in centrifugal pumps can be detected by experiments its evolution in space and time cannot be visualized well the continuous progress in computational fluid dynamics cfd during the past two decades has accelerated the mechanism research on the evolution of rotating stalls in centrifugal pumps sano et al 2002 barrio et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020b ren et al 2019 feng et al 2009 2011 focused on the field of velocity and turbulence in a radial pump especially rotating stall inside its impeller at off design conditions anciger et al 2010 estimated rotating stall inception in pump turbines during pump mode lucius and brenner 2010 2011 investigated the velocity pulsation under rotating stall conditions of centrifugal pumps based on a scale adaptive simulation sas model they found that the propagation direction for rotating stall cells was reverse of the impeller under 30 rated operating conditions and the frequency is approximately 0 7 times the impeller rotation frequency xia et al 2014 revealed that the rotating stall led to the outward jetting flow in the vaned diffuser alternatively blocking the channel with high pressure pulsation and flow separation zhao et al 2018 examined the evolution for rotating stalls in a pump under 0 4 0 6 design flow conditions and reported that the frequency of rotating stalls was lower than that of the impeller rotation zhou et al 2017a b revealed the propagation speed and frequency for rotating stall inside the impeller decreased as the flow reduced whereas its number remained constant with the increasing size li et al 2020b reported that the stall vortex changing in the flow path of certain fluids is the main cause of the propagation of the rotating stall and the confused flow near the shroud induced the pre stall with tip initial stall zhang et al 2021 demonstrated that the frequencies of rotating stall are always the same using numerical simulation and the coherence analysis method independent of pump operating conditions in summary the research on rotating stall in centrifugal pumps experiences from simple parameter signal measurement to visualization of flow field by non intrusive ldv and piv and from simple two dimensional non viscous calculations to full three dimensional viscous turbulence simulations although numerous researches on rotating stall in centrifugal pumps have been conducted mainly on low frequency pressure pulsations the number of rotating stall cells with stalled channels and the propagation speed rarely on rotating stall characteristic inside the pump vaned diffuser generally vaned diffusers are installed on the electric submersible pump the vaned diffuser can gather the high speed liquid thrown out by the impeller and evenly lead it to the inlet of the next stage impeller or the outlet pipe meanwhile part of the kinetic energy of the liquid can be converted into pressure energy in the vaned diffuser moreover the stall vortex is easier to form because of the pressurization effect of the vaned diffuser and the influence of the wake from the impeller therefore due to the differences of function and structure the rotating stall characteristics in vaned diffuser requires further investigation for identification methods of the rotating stall in centrifugal pumps the cfd and non intrusive methods are currently used the piv ldv and pressure pulsation measurement are first used to capture the rotating stall based on the velocity spectrum sinha et al 2001 pressure spectrum berten et al 2009 and vibration spectrum botero et al 2014 these visualization experiments are mainly qualitative researches while quantitative research needs to be further deepened then with the help of cfd the numerical simulation is used to predict the inception of the rotating stall based on the verification of experimental results different turbulence models are applied to analyze the velocity and pressure spectrum to obtain the frequency of the rotating stall such as sst k ω des detached eddy simulation sas etc feng et al 2009 lucius and brenner 2010 zhou et al 2017a in this study rotating stall characteristics inside a centrifugal pump s vaned diffuser was investigated based on commercial software ansys cfx experimental results including external characteristic curves and internal velocity field provided by piv from the reference krause et al 2005 were adopted to validate the applied numerical method in addition the signal frequency domain analysis method of the cross power spectrum is adopted to identify rotating stalls and the effect of diffuser vanes number on rotating stall is also studied 2 numerical methodology 2 1 geometric model in this study the original model of a low specific speed centrifugal pump from the fluid mechanics laboratory of magdeburg university in germany was adopted krause et al 2005 lucius and brenner 2010 consisting of an impeller with a vaneless diffuser for the pump rotating stall behavior in the impeller has been experimentally examined more details about the experiment can be taken from the reference krause et al 2005 for the purpose of examining the stall characteristics in vaned diffuser seven vanes were designed for the diffuser in the vaneless area of the original model see fig 1 gülich 2020 table 1 shows main parameters of the diffuser pump 2 2 mesh generation computational meshes with a high quality hexahedral structure were generated for the flow domains of the original and modified geometries using ansys icem the mesh of the modified pump consists of an inlet pipe an impeller with a vaned diffuser part of which are shown in fig 2 to eliminate the interference of grid size five groups of meshes for the modified model are selected and presented in table 2 as shown in fig 3 mesh independence is performed by considering the pump s head on the design condition as targets the head h change is less than 1 when the mesh size is greater than 2 95 million mesh 2 which was applied in further numerical simulations 2 3 numerical settings the flow characteristics is calculating using ansys cfx as shown in fig 2 total pressure is specified at the inlet and mass flow rate is given at the outlet the research medium is water the k ω based sst shear stress transport turbulence model with an automatic near wall treatment is adopted due to its advantage in predicting the rotating stall and flow separation in pumps feng et al 2010 tao et al 2014 ye et al 2019 solid walls are defined as no slip boundary conditions both convection and spatial terms can be discretized by the second order scheme the timestep was set to 0 000833 s during which the impeller rotates 3 the total time of transient simulation is 2 s which corresponding to the time required for impeller to rotate 20 revolutions the target of maximal residual in each step was defined as 10 4 with maximal iterations of 15 the transient rotor stator has been employed for data transfer on the interface between rotating and non rotating components at each time step the steady calculation result under the same condition is used as the initial value for the unsteady simulation 2 4 validation of numerical model the correctness of the original model under simulation was firstly verified by the experimental results from the reference krause et al 2005 fig 4 depicts the comparison for flow fields at q d and 0 5q d conditions between simulated method and experiment showing good agreement for the non stalled channel at q d the streamlines are smooth with slight shedding at the blade surface for the stalled channel at 0 5q d 8 shaped stall cells near the suction side of the impeller blade are observed consisting of two vortices in different sizes the size and shape of the vortices are similar except some differences in the position of the vortices because of some simplifications in the model structure and ideal simulation settings during simulation calculations i e the smooth wall assumption and without considering the clearance fig 5 shows performance parameters for the modified centrifugal pump by cfd which are also compared with those of the original model by cfd and experiments the simulated results of the original model are consistent with the experimental values except for the overestimation when the flow rate is less than 0 4q d further validating the accuracy of the original model one of the reasons could be that the experimental efficiency is the total efficiency consisting of the hydraulic efficiency volumetric efficiency and mechanical efficiency while the simulated efficiency is only the hydraulic efficiency on the basis of the original model verification the external characteristics and flow field of modified model under investigation have been calculated using the same simulation method the trend of the above variables predicted by numerical simulation with a vaned diffuser is similar to that of both experiment and simulation with a vaneless diffuser original model although nearly all of the values decreased this phenomenon may be attributed to the design of the vaned diffuser that increases the mechanical loss of the modified model interestingly the hump phenomenon appears in the centrifugal pump with vaned diffuser under 0 25q d to 0 5q d conditions which also occurs in the pump turbine accompanied by unstable flow li et al 2018b yang et al 2018 in general the hump phenomenon in the head curve is an important sign of the rotating stall in the impeller or vaned diffuser of centrifugal pumps therefore 0 25q d to 0 5q d operating conditions are adopted as main conditions in this study 3 results 3 1 investigation of pressure pulsation to obtain the relationship between the unstable flow and pressure pulsation in the pump diffuser 10 monitor points are positioned at the midspan in different diffuser channels as shown in fig 6 the diffuser channel abbreviated to ch is narrow and there are many unstable flow phenomena in the diffuser channel in order to reduce the effect of the vane surface on the monitor points all monitor points are set in the middle of the flow channel including g1 g4 in the vaneless space and m1 m5 with s1 in the diffuser channel to make the pressure at monitor points dimensionless pressure coefficient is used as expressed in eq 1 1 c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 2 where p is the pressure ρ is the density u 2 is the circumferential velocity at the impeller outlet and p is the average value of pressure fig 7 describes the time domain analysis for the pressure pulsation of six points and the instantaneous pressure distribution in the circumferential direction at different radii under 0 5q d condition during a rotating period as shown in fig 7 a the pressure at the monitor point has five obvious peaks and valleys in one rotating period under the rotor stator interaction as the radial distance of the diffuser vane increases i e from the vaneless space g1 to the diffuser outlet m5 the rotor stator interaction slowly weakens in addition the pressure of pressure side at the diffuser inlet is obviously larger compared to the suction side fig 7 b in short large pressure pulsations with huge pressure difference on both sides of vanes may result in flow separation and recirculation near suction side at pump s diffuser inlet which is most prone to stall vortex the frequency spectra for pressure pulsation analyzed by fast fourier transformation fft at monitor points g1 g4 under 0 41q d condition is shown in fig 8 the hanning window is used to deal with pressure signals and the simulated pressures are calculated with root mean square rms values the sampling frequency is 1200 hz and the number of samples is 600 large amplitudes appear on the blade passing frequency bpf with its multiple frequency meanwhile low frequency pulsations with different amplitudes occurred even relatively high which may be caused by the combined action of the steady and unsteady vortices to better obtain the source of low frequency the cross power spectrum is adopted to analyze the pressure signals of different monitor points charley and carta 2001 li et al 2016 through the method the correlation of two detected signals and the phase difference of the corresponding frequency components can be obtained the larger the amplitude of the two signals is the higher the correlation at the frequency will be it can eliminate the possibility of accidental correlation and provide data support for the subsequent internal flow analysis the cross correlation function r xy τ of the two groups of signals i e x t and y t in eq 2 describes the correlation for two different random processes evaluated at two different moments of interval τ 2 r x y τ e x t y t τ lim t 1 t 0 t x t y t τ d τ then the cross power can be defined as eq 3 3 s x y fft x t fft y t z n 2 where z is the conjugate function n represents the number of data fig 9 shows the cross power spectrum for four monitor points i e g1 g2 m1 s1 under different low flow rate conditions according to the rules given in table 3 the presence or absence of a rotating stall can be determined li et al 2016 if an extremely high amplitude is observed at the same frequency it shows that these two monitor points have a strong correlation at this frequency the time domain figure shows the correlation between the two signals at a certain frequency i e whether the frequency is triggered by the same disturbance source which is mainly shown by the periodicity of the same monitor point and the phase difference of different monitor points if the frequency is triggered by the same vibration source the phase difference between the two points is consistent because of the fixed position of the monitor point for the monitor points g1 g2 and m1 s1 the angle differences in circumference are both 51 43 as long as the different monitor points have higher amplitudes at the same frequency and the phase difference between them is approximately 51 43 the low frequency signal can be considered from the same disturbance source that is the rotating stall occurs at 0 41q d condition fig 9 c the amplitude at 0 005f n is high and the time domain signal presents an obvious periodicity with the same phase difference of 51 43 between g1 and g2 therefore the frequency comes from the rotating stall rotating stall takes place also at 0 5q d fig 9 d despite the certain phase difference in time signal under 0 25q d condition fig 9 a no strong correlation frequency exists between the monitor points moreover high amplitudes with different frequencies are observed at 0 35q d condition fig 9 b that is several kinds of stall vortices exist simultaneously in the channels of the diffuser under 0 35q d condition 3 2 analysis of internal flow structure obtaining the rotating frequency of stall cells does not only involve obtaining the frequency for pressure pulsation at each point but also determining the number of stall cells fig 10 depicts distributions for pressure and streamline at the midsection of the diffuser channel at four moments under 0 41q d condition ch represents channel obviously the pressure in the channel of the diffuser is unevenly distributed in the circumferential direction and three stall cells exist thus the rotating frequency of the stall cell is 0 083 hz with a period t of 12s t 0 represents the period of three stall cells as a whole from the previous flow path to the next flow path in the rotation direction i e t 0 t 7 1 7 s as shown in fig 10 a stall cells 1 2 and 3 are respectively located at ch1 ch3 and ch6 then stall cell 2 moves to ch4 at t t 0 t 0 3 while the other two do not change fig 10 b similarly stall cell 1 travels to ch2 fig 10 c and stall cell 3 shifts to ch7 fig 10 d the three stall cells show obvious asynchronous characteristics during the rotation process which continues for 6 t 0 within a complete rotating period that is the stall cell rotates in the channel of the diffuser and returns to its original channel in addition the stall cell in the channel of the diffuser rotates towards the opposite direction for the impeller fig 11 presents the pressure distribution at the diffuser outlet at t t 0 t 0 3 the circumferential pressure gradient in the stalled channel is milder than that in the non stalled channel probably because the formation of stall cell weakens the unevenness of circumferential pressure distribution moreover the maximum pressure gradient appears between stall cells 1 and 2 and the pressure of stall cell 1 is far higher than that of stall cell 2 resulting in the movement of stall cell 1 in the next moment to analyze the components of the complex low frequency under 0 35q d condition the flow pattern in a channel of the diffuser during a period from the onset of stall cell to its disappearance is shown in fig 12 in general the stall cell in the channel does not have a regular forward or reverse rotation relative to the impeller and the stall cell in a part of the channel does not exhibit an obvious periodic behaviour such as in ch3 as shown in fig 12 a a large stall cell appears near the inlet of the channel at t t 0 which then divides into two small cells at t t 0 t 0 4 and move to the outlet with increased size at t t 0 2t 0 4 fig 12 b c at t t 0 3t 0 4 the mentioned two cells vanish in ch3 fig 12 d the periodic process of stall cell in ch3 from appearance to disappearance is bound to cause pressure pulsation and this phenomenon in each channel of the diffuser is different which may lead to the complex low frequency the form of stall cell inside the diffuser is identified based on the q criterion fig 13 which represents the rotation and strain rate tensors in eq 4 zhang et al 2018b han and tan 2020 when ω ij s ij the fluid is affected by the rotation force more than the strain force i e q c 0 vortex appears 4 q c 1 2 ω i j 2 s i j 2 where 5 ω i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i stall vortices are mainly generated at the diffuser inlet which then develop into streamwise spanwise and longitudinal vortices at various conditions under 0 5q d condition the streamwise vortex appears near the leading edge and the spanwise vortex is generated near the trailing edge of the diffuser vane fig 13 a under 0 41q d condition the increase in attack angle weakens the streamwise vortex and longitudinal vortex is observed at the diffuser inlet with strong spanwise vortex near the trailing edge fig 13 b with the flow further decreasing to 0 35q d longitudinal vortex accounts for the main part of the diffuser probably because the fluid directly impacts the diffuser vane pressure side with flowing longitudinally towards the suction side fig 13 c however no horseshoe shaped vortex is observed in the diffuser channel which is reported inside the impeller of a centrifugal pump qi et al 2012 and in the guide vane of a pump turbine li et al 2018a 3 3 effect of number of diffuser vanes to investigate the effect of number of diffuser vanes on stall characteristics fig 14 compares distributions of stall cell inside the diffuser with different vanes the numbers of stall cells are 3 for three cases seven eight and nine vanes for the diffuser with seven vanes stall cells travel from ch1 ch3 and ch6 to ch2 ch4 and ch7 during t 0 fig 14 a and d for the diffuser with eight vanes stall cells travel from ch1 ch3 and ch7 to ch2 ch4 and ch7 during t 0 fig 14 b and e meanwhile stall cells remain in ch3 ch6 and ch9 after t 0 for nine vanes which may be called the alternative stall fig 14 c and f therefore the type of stall cells inside the diffuser is affected by the numbers of diffuser vanes and stall cells if the number of diffuser vanes is a multiple of the number of stall cells alternative stall will occur otherwise the change in the number of diffuser vanes only affects the rotating frequency of stall cell rather than the type of it fig 15 shows the frequency spectra of pressure pulsation at the vaneless space and the inlet and outlet of the diffuser under 0 41q d condition for the cases of different numbers of diffuser vanes compared with the amplitude at the bpf of seven diffuser vanes at vaneless space the nine is 20 higher whereas the eight is 50 lower fig 15 a meanwhile the amplitude of the pump with seven diffuser vanes is the largest at the inlet of the diffuser vane i e 38 5 higher than that of eight diffuser vanes fig 15 b as shown in fig 15 c the amplitudes at the bpf are nearly the same at the outlet of the diffuser in addition low frequency pulsations with different amplitudes can be observed for the pump with nine diffuser vanes even relatively high which may be mainly caused by alternative stall fig 14 c and f generally the amplitudes for eight diffuser vanes at three positions are lower than those of the other two although the rotating stall cell appears therefore the appropriate number of diffuser vanes may help to eliminate the adverse effects of the rotating stall furthermore in order to eliminate or delay the stall in centrifugal pumps some other methods have been examined including adopting slotted blade ni et al 2019 splitter blades zhang et al 2018a and gap drainage blade zhang et al 2019 and improving inflow conditions by grooving inlet pipe feng et al 2018 it can help to eliminate the rotating stall and optimize the design of centrifugal pumps 4 conclusions in this study the rotating stall characteristics in the vaned diffuser of a centrifugal pump under part load conditions have been numerically investigated in detail numerical results of the original model are validated by experiments the rotating stall inside pump s diffuser channel with flow pattern evolution are captured by analyzing the pressure pulsation and internal flow structure in addition the effect of number of diffuser vanes on stall characteristics is also examined some major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the flow field and performance curves of the original pump agree well with experimental ones the numerical methodology is therefore verified meanwhile the hump phenomenon in the head curve is observed at part load conditions from 0 25q d to 0 5q d for the modified pump equipped with a vaned diffuser the phenomenon may be caused by the stall vortex in the vaned diffuser 2 the large pressure pulsation with pressure difference on both sides of vanes may cause stall vortex on the suction side at the diffuser inlet where the main frequency is blade passing frequency with a low frequency pulsation the cross power spectrum method is adopted on pressure signals to identify rotating stall phenomenon in the vaned diffuser of the pump according to the analysis on the correlation and phase difference characteristics obtained between different pressure signals rotating stall has been identified under both 0 5q d and 0 41q d conditions but not for 0 35qd or 0 25q d condition 3 under 0 41q d condition rotating stall phenomenon has been observed in the vaned diffuser of the pump with three stall cells rotating opposite to the direction of impeller rotation and the rotating frequency being 0 083 hz equal to f n 600 the stall cells reduce the uneven distribution for circumferential pressure at the diffuser outlet under 0 35q d condition a periodic process of stall cell can be observed from inception to disappearance in some channels of the diffuser in addition vortices are mainly observed in the streamwise and spanwise directions under rotating stall conditions such as 0 41q d and 0 5q d while longitudinal vortices dominate under 0 35q d condition 4 the type of stall in the diffuser channel is affected by both the number of diffuser vanes and the number of stall cells if the number of diffuser vanes is a multiple of the number of stall cells alternative stall will occur otherwise the change in the number of diffuser vanes only affects the rotating frequency of stall cell rather than the type of it furthermore a reasonable number of diffuser vanes can greatly reduce the amplitudes of pressure pulsation at the vaneless space

20791,rotating stall in centrifugal pumps takes place frequently under part load conditions along with high pressure pulsation the major focus for studies is rotating stall inside the impeller rarely paying attention to that in the vaned diffuser in this study rotating stall behavior in a vaned diffuser centrifugal pump has been numerically investigated and the cross power spectrum method is adopted to identify low frequency pressure signals the applied numerical method has been validated by experimental results including flow structures provided by piv measurements for the vaned diffuser pump a hump region in head curve is observed between 0 25q d and 0 5q d conditions under 0 41q d condition rotating stall occurs in the vaned diffuser of the pump with three stall cells rotating opposite to the direction of impeller rotation and the rotating frequency being 0 083 hz equal to 1 600 of the impeller rotating frequency rotating stall takes place under 0 5q d condition as well whereas only a periodic process of stall cell from inception to disappearance appears in the diffuser channel under 0 35q d condition furthermore the effect of number of diffuser vanes on rotating stall characteristics has been analyzed in detail keywords centrifugal pump vaned diffuser rotating stall cross power spectrum pressure pulsation 1 introduction electric submersible pumps esps are widely used in the offshore petroleum industry because of their advantages in pumping high flowrate crude oil minette et al 2016 takacs 2017 they are installed in the production well generally in deep or ultra deep water greatly improving their installation and maintenance costs reges et al 2021 castillo et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2005 the research on the reliability of esps to reduce risk has attracted much attention especially centrifugal pumps core components of esps with the development of offshore oil production equipment in large scale and high power orientation centrifugal pumps have been extensively used on non optimal conditions li et al 2020a zhang et al 2020a rotating stall usually occurs with pressure pulsation under low flow rate conditions caused by single or coupled effects of backflow flow separation rotor stator interaction and jet wake resulting in performance deterioration and the instability of the pump units pei et al 2014 fu et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 for the research on the rotating stall in centrifugal pumps the experimental and numerical methods are currently used experiments first promoted the study of rotating stall in pumps yoshida et al 1991 concluded for a centrifugal pump that a diffuser made interference to the propagation speed of rotating stall on low flow conditions moreover rotating stall in the diffuser weakened and then disappeared with the decreasing of the radial gap between the blade and vane based on the results obtained from pressure pulsation measurement and particle image velocimetry piv sinha et al 2001 demonstrated that the rotating stall in the diffuser originated from high speed leakage flow berten et al 2009 reported that the type propagation speed and number of stalls in pumps are affected by pump s flow and speed zhang 2010 detected unstable flow inside pump s diffuser using a two dimensional laser doppler velocimeter ldv and pointed out that the expansion angle at the inlet of the diffuser was a key factor affecting the rotating stall xue et al 2019 revealed the evolution for rotating stall during pumping condition by piv which greatly affects the performance of the pump turbine although the rotating stall in centrifugal pumps can be detected by experiments its evolution in space and time cannot be visualized well the continuous progress in computational fluid dynamics cfd during the past two decades has accelerated the mechanism research on the evolution of rotating stalls in centrifugal pumps sano et al 2002 barrio et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020b ren et al 2019 feng et al 2009 2011 focused on the field of velocity and turbulence in a radial pump especially rotating stall inside its impeller at off design conditions anciger et al 2010 estimated rotating stall inception in pump turbines during pump mode lucius and brenner 2010 2011 investigated the velocity pulsation under rotating stall conditions of centrifugal pumps based on a scale adaptive simulation sas model they found that the propagation direction for rotating stall cells was reverse of the impeller under 30 rated operating conditions and the frequency is approximately 0 7 times the impeller rotation frequency xia et al 2014 revealed that the rotating stall led to the outward jetting flow in the vaned diffuser alternatively blocking the channel with high pressure pulsation and flow separation zhao et al 2018 examined the evolution for rotating stalls in a pump under 0 4 0 6 design flow conditions and reported that the frequency of rotating stalls was lower than that of the impeller rotation zhou et al 2017a b revealed the propagation speed and frequency for rotating stall inside the impeller decreased as the flow reduced whereas its number remained constant with the increasing size li et al 2020b reported that the stall vortex changing in the flow path of certain fluids is the main cause of the propagation of the rotating stall and the confused flow near the shroud induced the pre stall with tip initial stall zhang et al 2021 demonstrated that the frequencies of rotating stall are always the same using numerical simulation and the coherence analysis method independent of pump operating conditions in summary the research on rotating stall in centrifugal pumps experiences from simple parameter signal measurement to visualization of flow field by non intrusive ldv and piv and from simple two dimensional non viscous calculations to full three dimensional viscous turbulence simulations although numerous researches on rotating stall in centrifugal pumps have been conducted mainly on low frequency pressure pulsations the number of rotating stall cells with stalled channels and the propagation speed rarely on rotating stall characteristic inside the pump vaned diffuser generally vaned diffusers are installed on the electric submersible pump the vaned diffuser can gather the high speed liquid thrown out by the impeller and evenly lead it to the inlet of the next stage impeller or the outlet pipe meanwhile part of the kinetic energy of the liquid can be converted into pressure energy in the vaned diffuser moreover the stall vortex is easier to form because of the pressurization effect of the vaned diffuser and the influence of the wake from the impeller therefore due to the differences of function and structure the rotating stall characteristics in vaned diffuser requires further investigation for identification methods of the rotating stall in centrifugal pumps the cfd and non intrusive methods are currently used the piv ldv and pressure pulsation measurement are first used to capture the rotating stall based on the velocity spectrum sinha et al 2001 pressure spectrum berten et al 2009 and vibration spectrum botero et al 2014 these visualization experiments are mainly qualitative researches while quantitative research needs to be further deepened then with the help of cfd the numerical simulation is used to predict the inception of the rotating stall based on the verification of experimental results different turbulence models are applied to analyze the velocity and pressure spectrum to obtain the frequency of the rotating stall such as sst k ω des detached eddy simulation sas etc feng et al 2009 lucius and brenner 2010 zhou et al 2017a in this study rotating stall characteristics inside a centrifugal pump s vaned diffuser was investigated based on commercial software ansys cfx experimental results including external characteristic curves and internal velocity field provided by piv from the reference krause et al 2005 were adopted to validate the applied numerical method in addition the signal frequency domain analysis method of the cross power spectrum is adopted to identify rotating stalls and the effect of diffuser vanes number on rotating stall is also studied 2 numerical methodology 2 1 geometric model in this study the original model of a low specific speed centrifugal pump from the fluid mechanics laboratory of magdeburg university in germany was adopted krause et al 2005 lucius and brenner 2010 consisting of an impeller with a vaneless diffuser for the pump rotating stall behavior in the impeller has been experimentally examined more details about the experiment can be taken from the reference krause et al 2005 for the purpose of examining the stall characteristics in vaned diffuser seven vanes were designed for the diffuser in the vaneless area of the original model see fig 1 gülich 2020 table 1 shows main parameters of the diffuser pump 2 2 mesh generation computational meshes with a high quality hexahedral structure were generated for the flow domains of the original and modified geometries using ansys icem the mesh of the modified pump consists of an inlet pipe an impeller with a vaned diffuser part of which are shown in fig 2 to eliminate the interference of grid size five groups of meshes for the modified model are selected and presented in table 2 as shown in fig 3 mesh independence is performed by considering the pump s head on the design condition as targets the head h change is less than 1 when the mesh size is greater than 2 95 million mesh 2 which was applied in further numerical simulations 2 3 numerical settings the flow characteristics is calculating using ansys cfx as shown in fig 2 total pressure is specified at the inlet and mass flow rate is given at the outlet the research medium is water the k ω based sst shear stress transport turbulence model with an automatic near wall treatment is adopted due to its advantage in predicting the rotating stall and flow separation in pumps feng et al 2010 tao et al 2014 ye et al 2019 solid walls are defined as no slip boundary conditions both convection and spatial terms can be discretized by the second order scheme the timestep was set to 0 000833 s during which the impeller rotates 3 the total time of transient simulation is 2 s which corresponding to the time required for impeller to rotate 20 revolutions the target of maximal residual in each step was defined as 10 4 with maximal iterations of 15 the transient rotor stator has been employed for data transfer on the interface between rotating and non rotating components at each time step the steady calculation result under the same condition is used as the initial value for the unsteady simulation 2 4 validation of numerical model the correctness of the original model under simulation was firstly verified by the experimental results from the reference krause et al 2005 fig 4 depicts the comparison for flow fields at q d and 0 5q d conditions between simulated method and experiment showing good agreement for the non stalled channel at q d the streamlines are smooth with slight shedding at the blade surface for the stalled channel at 0 5q d 8 shaped stall cells near the suction side of the impeller blade are observed consisting of two vortices in different sizes the size and shape of the vortices are similar except some differences in the position of the vortices because of some simplifications in the model structure and ideal simulation settings during simulation calculations i e the smooth wall assumption and without considering the clearance fig 5 shows performance parameters for the modified centrifugal pump by cfd which are also compared with those of the original model by cfd and experiments the simulated results of the original model are consistent with the experimental values except for the overestimation when the flow rate is less than 0 4q d further validating the accuracy of the original model one of the reasons could be that the experimental efficiency is the total efficiency consisting of the hydraulic efficiency volumetric efficiency and mechanical efficiency while the simulated efficiency is only the hydraulic efficiency on the basis of the original model verification the external characteristics and flow field of modified model under investigation have been calculated using the same simulation method the trend of the above variables predicted by numerical simulation with a vaned diffuser is similar to that of both experiment and simulation with a vaneless diffuser original model although nearly all of the values decreased this phenomenon may be attributed to the design of the vaned diffuser that increases the mechanical loss of the modified model interestingly the hump phenomenon appears in the centrifugal pump with vaned diffuser under 0 25q d to 0 5q d conditions which also occurs in the pump turbine accompanied by unstable flow li et al 2018b yang et al 2018 in general the hump phenomenon in the head curve is an important sign of the rotating stall in the impeller or vaned diffuser of centrifugal pumps therefore 0 25q d to 0 5q d operating conditions are adopted as main conditions in this study 3 results 3 1 investigation of pressure pulsation to obtain the relationship between the unstable flow and pressure pulsation in the pump diffuser 10 monitor points are positioned at the midspan in different diffuser channels as shown in fig 6 the diffuser channel abbreviated to ch is narrow and there are many unstable flow phenomena in the diffuser channel in order to reduce the effect of the vane surface on the monitor points all monitor points are set in the middle of the flow channel including g1 g4 in the vaneless space and m1 m5 with s1 in the diffuser channel to make the pressure at monitor points dimensionless pressure coefficient is used as expressed in eq 1 1 c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 2 where p is the pressure ρ is the density u 2 is the circumferential velocity at the impeller outlet and p is the average value of pressure fig 7 describes the time domain analysis for the pressure pulsation of six points and the instantaneous pressure distribution in the circumferential direction at different radii under 0 5q d condition during a rotating period as shown in fig 7 a the pressure at the monitor point has five obvious peaks and valleys in one rotating period under the rotor stator interaction as the radial distance of the diffuser vane increases i e from the vaneless space g1 to the diffuser outlet m5 the rotor stator interaction slowly weakens in addition the pressure of pressure side at the diffuser inlet is obviously larger compared to the suction side fig 7 b in short large pressure pulsations with huge pressure difference on both sides of vanes may result in flow separation and recirculation near suction side at pump s diffuser inlet which is most prone to stall vortex the frequency spectra for pressure pulsation analyzed by fast fourier transformation fft at monitor points g1 g4 under 0 41q d condition is shown in fig 8 the hanning window is used to deal with pressure signals and the simulated pressures are calculated with root mean square rms values the sampling frequency is 1200 hz and the number of samples is 600 large amplitudes appear on the blade passing frequency bpf with its multiple frequency meanwhile low frequency pulsations with different amplitudes occurred even relatively high which may be caused by the combined action of the steady and unsteady vortices to better obtain the source of low frequency the cross power spectrum is adopted to analyze the pressure signals of different monitor points charley and carta 2001 li et al 2016 through the method the correlation of two detected signals and the phase difference of the corresponding frequency components can be obtained the larger the amplitude of the two signals is the higher the correlation at the frequency will be it can eliminate the possibility of accidental correlation and provide data support for the subsequent internal flow analysis the cross correlation function r xy τ of the two groups of signals i e x t and y t in eq 2 describes the correlation for two different random processes evaluated at two different moments of interval τ 2 r x y τ e x t y t τ lim t 1 t 0 t x t y t τ d τ then the cross power can be defined as eq 3 3 s x y fft x t fft y t z n 2 where z is the conjugate function n represents the number of data fig 9 shows the cross power spectrum for four monitor points i e g1 g2 m1 s1 under different low flow rate conditions according to the rules given in table 3 the presence or absence of a rotating stall can be determined li et al 2016 if an extremely high amplitude is observed at the same frequency it shows that these two monitor points have a strong correlation at this frequency the time domain figure shows the correlation between the two signals at a certain frequency i e whether the frequency is triggered by the same disturbance source which is mainly shown by the periodicity of the same monitor point and the phase difference of different monitor points if the frequency is triggered by the same vibration source the phase difference between the two points is consistent because of the fixed position of the monitor point for the monitor points g1 g2 and m1 s1 the angle differences in circumference are both 51 43 as long as the different monitor points have higher amplitudes at the same frequency and the phase difference between them is approximately 51 43 the low frequency signal can be considered from the same disturbance source that is the rotating stall occurs at 0 41q d condition fig 9 c the amplitude at 0 005f n is high and the time domain signal presents an obvious periodicity with the same phase difference of 51 43 between g1 and g2 therefore the frequency comes from the rotating stall rotating stall takes place also at 0 5q d fig 9 d despite the certain phase difference in time signal under 0 25q d condition fig 9 a no strong correlation frequency exists between the monitor points moreover high amplitudes with different frequencies are observed at 0 35q d condition fig 9 b that is several kinds of stall vortices exist simultaneously in the channels of the diffuser under 0 35q d condition 3 2 analysis of internal flow structure obtaining the rotating frequency of stall cells does not only involve obtaining the frequency for pressure pulsation at each point but also determining the number of stall cells fig 10 depicts distributions for pressure and streamline at the midsection of the diffuser channel at four moments under 0 41q d condition ch represents channel obviously the pressure in the channel of the diffuser is unevenly distributed in the circumferential direction and three stall cells exist thus the rotating frequency of the stall cell is 0 083 hz with a period t of 12s t 0 represents the period of three stall cells as a whole from the previous flow path to the next flow path in the rotation direction i e t 0 t 7 1 7 s as shown in fig 10 a stall cells 1 2 and 3 are respectively located at ch1 ch3 and ch6 then stall cell 2 moves to ch4 at t t 0 t 0 3 while the other two do not change fig 10 b similarly stall cell 1 travels to ch2 fig 10 c and stall cell 3 shifts to ch7 fig 10 d the three stall cells show obvious asynchronous characteristics during the rotation process which continues for 6 t 0 within a complete rotating period that is the stall cell rotates in the channel of the diffuser and returns to its original channel in addition the stall cell in the channel of the diffuser rotates towards the opposite direction for the impeller fig 11 presents the pressure distribution at the diffuser outlet at t t 0 t 0 3 the circumferential pressure gradient in the stalled channel is milder than that in the non stalled channel probably because the formation of stall cell weakens the unevenness of circumferential pressure distribution moreover the maximum pressure gradient appears between stall cells 1 and 2 and the pressure of stall cell 1 is far higher than that of stall cell 2 resulting in the movement of stall cell 1 in the next moment to analyze the components of the complex low frequency under 0 35q d condition the flow pattern in a channel of the diffuser during a period from the onset of stall cell to its disappearance is shown in fig 12 in general the stall cell in the channel does not have a regular forward or reverse rotation relative to the impeller and the stall cell in a part of the channel does not exhibit an obvious periodic behaviour such as in ch3 as shown in fig 12 a a large stall cell appears near the inlet of the channel at t t 0 which then divides into two small cells at t t 0 t 0 4 and move to the outlet with increased size at t t 0 2t 0 4 fig 12 b c at t t 0 3t 0 4 the mentioned two cells vanish in ch3 fig 12 d the periodic process of stall cell in ch3 from appearance to disappearance is bound to cause pressure pulsation and this phenomenon in each channel of the diffuser is different which may lead to the complex low frequency the form of stall cell inside the diffuser is identified based on the q criterion fig 13 which represents the rotation and strain rate tensors in eq 4 zhang et al 2018b han and tan 2020 when ω ij s ij the fluid is affected by the rotation force more than the strain force i e q c 0 vortex appears 4 q c 1 2 ω i j 2 s i j 2 where 5 ω i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i stall vortices are mainly generated at the diffuser inlet which then develop into streamwise spanwise and longitudinal vortices at various conditions under 0 5q d condition the streamwise vortex appears near the leading edge and the spanwise vortex is generated near the trailing edge of the diffuser vane fig 13 a under 0 41q d condition the increase in attack angle weakens the streamwise vortex and longitudinal vortex is observed at the diffuser inlet with strong spanwise vortex near the trailing edge fig 13 b with the flow further decreasing to 0 35q d longitudinal vortex accounts for the main part of the diffuser probably because the fluid directly impacts the diffuser vane pressure side with flowing longitudinally towards the suction side fig 13 c however no horseshoe shaped vortex is observed in the diffuser channel which is reported inside the impeller of a centrifugal pump qi et al 2012 and in the guide vane of a pump turbine li et al 2018a 3 3 effect of number of diffuser vanes to investigate the effect of number of diffuser vanes on stall characteristics fig 14 compares distributions of stall cell inside the diffuser with different vanes the numbers of stall cells are 3 for three cases seven eight and nine vanes for the diffuser with seven vanes stall cells travel from ch1 ch3 and ch6 to ch2 ch4 and ch7 during t 0 fig 14 a and d for the diffuser with eight vanes stall cells travel from ch1 ch3 and ch7 to ch2 ch4 and ch7 during t 0 fig 14 b and e meanwhile stall cells remain in ch3 ch6 and ch9 after t 0 for nine vanes which may be called the alternative stall fig 14 c and f therefore the type of stall cells inside the diffuser is affected by the numbers of diffuser vanes and stall cells if the number of diffuser vanes is a multiple of the number of stall cells alternative stall will occur otherwise the change in the number of diffuser vanes only affects the rotating frequency of stall cell rather than the type of it fig 15 shows the frequency spectra of pressure pulsation at the vaneless space and the inlet and outlet of the diffuser under 0 41q d condition for the cases of different numbers of diffuser vanes compared with the amplitude at the bpf of seven diffuser vanes at vaneless space the nine is 20 higher whereas the eight is 50 lower fig 15 a meanwhile the amplitude of the pump with seven diffuser vanes is the largest at the inlet of the diffuser vane i e 38 5 higher than that of eight diffuser vanes fig 15 b as shown in fig 15 c the amplitudes at the bpf are nearly the same at the outlet of the diffuser in addition low frequency pulsations with different amplitudes can be observed for the pump with nine diffuser vanes even relatively high which may be mainly caused by alternative stall fig 14 c and f generally the amplitudes for eight diffuser vanes at three positions are lower than those of the other two although the rotating stall cell appears therefore the appropriate number of diffuser vanes may help to eliminate the adverse effects of the rotating stall furthermore in order to eliminate or delay the stall in centrifugal pumps some other methods have been examined including adopting slotted blade ni et al 2019 splitter blades zhang et al 2018a and gap drainage blade zhang et al 2019 and improving inflow conditions by grooving inlet pipe feng et al 2018 it can help to

20792,the vertical transport system vts is the main part of the total integrated system for deep sea mining which attracts increasing attention owing to the shortage of mineral resources the influences of irregular waves due to wave induced hydrodynamic forces and wave induced vessel motions on the vts dynamic responses are estimated based on the lumped mass method results show that the wave induced hydrodynamic forces mainly act on the equilibrium position of the vts whereas the wave induced vessel motions are the determining factor in the vts dynamic responses waves with the specific spectrum peak period would induce parametric instability in the vts the most adverse heading for the vts is found to be 90 the dynamic responses of the vts will increase with wave heights however the buffer miner slant range is found to be insensitive to wave conditions heave motions are the most dominant factor influencing the effective tension of the rigid pipe the effective tension on the rigid pipe directly affect the load response of the hose particularly the bending moment on the rigid pipe presents non gaussian characteristics under extreme environments therefore the

could potentially add to the global raw material supply in the future petersen et al 2016 the design concept of the total integrated system tis has been widely regarded as the most profitable prospective system for deep sea mining chung 1996 a tis comprises a mining vessel a vertical transport system vts and a seabed collector miner a mining vessel is designed for the purpose of mining operations it is equipped with sufficient storage space for mined nodules or crusts and heave compensated cranes winches to perform lift operations for the installation and recovery of subsea equipment a vts comprises a rigid pipe one or more lifting pumps a buffer and a hose the rigid pipe is employed as the main part of the vts with lifting pumps combined within the pipe s diameter at one or several pump stages the buffer is a free hanging container installed at the bottom of the rigid pipe it serves as a temporary storage space in case the mining operation at the seabed is conducted at a higher speed than the transport process in the rigid pipe can handle knodt et al 2016 a hose connects the collector to the buffer transporting the mineral nodules or crusts from the collector to the rigid pipe the seabed miner conducts the actual mining operation on the seabed various studies and analyses have been carried out to evaluate the dynamic responses of vtss in recent decades in terms of numerical methods chung et al 1994a 1994b developed a nonlinear finite element method fem to simulate the three dimensional nonlinear coupled axial bending and torsional responses of a 4000 ft vts the authors considered periodic horizontal and vertical motions at the top of the pipe the internal slurry flow and the external hydrodynamic forces due to the current flow subsequently an improved discrete element method based on multi body dynamics was proposed by baorong et al 1997 it could be used to calculate the frequencies static deflections and dynamic responses of beam structures hong et al 1997 employed a lumped parameter method and an incremental iterative scheme to analyse the axial vibrations and towing responses of lifting pipes in deep seabed mining morison equations were used to estimate the external forces on the lifting pipe while the vessel motion and surface waves were neglected the bottom end of the lifting pipe was considered as free and the underwater pumps and buffer were regarded as rigid elements in terms of the effect of the boundary conditions babu and ahmad 1999 developed a finite element formulation for the nonlinear coupled responses of two pipe systems with different boundary conditions in one condition the bottom end was connected to the collector in the other the bottom end was kept free of the collector the effects of the current force internal slurry flow and vessel motion due to regular waves were discussed the results showed that the boundary conditions significantly influenced the determination of the frequencies of the mining pipes and hence the overall dynamic response for the effect of currents thorsen et al 2019 studied the vortex induced vibration viv response of a mining riser using a coupled analysis framework for the riser responses and internal flow they focused on the effect of time varying internal slurry flows with density waves traveling along the risers and found that the internal flow could produce significant changes to the viv fatigue damage under specific internal flow density conditions for the influence of vessel motions wu et al 2019 discussed the effect of the heave motion on the global dynamic responses of a deep sea mining system based on the lumped mass method three different scenarios caused by harmonic heave motions corresponding to different heave motion frequencies were introduced besides numerical studies several experimental investigations have been conducted to explore the response characteristics of vtss chung 2010 published the first ever measurements of a full scale pipe response coupled with the motion of the surface vessel in the deep ocean a pipe with a length of 5000 m and outer diameter of 15 in deployed from the moon pool of the hughes glomar explorer surface mining vessel in the north pacific ocean was measured the field data showed that the axial stress could be an order of magnitude larger than the bending stress for a long pipe and the bending is less of an issue for mining pipes yamamoto et al 2013 experimentally investigated the effect of a pulsating internal flow on the dynamics of a flexible pipe in a jumper configuration which could be used in deep sea mining to convey the mineral ore slurry from the seafloor collector to the buffer they found that the pulsating internal flow generated a vibration of the initially straight pipe increasing the internal flow rate had a negligible effect on the amplitude response in the inline direction the response in the cross direction was caused by viv rather than the internal flow it can be seen from the literature review above that previous studies have primarily focused on the effect of regular waves on the vts most of the published papers did not establish a complete vts model that could be used in practical engineering most of these previous studies utilized a simplified boundary condition for the rigid pipe in these studies two boundary conditions for the rigid pipe are commonly discussed one is completely free of the miner and the other is directly connected to the miner in the actual operation condition of the tis the buffer at the bottom end of the rigid pipe is connected to the seabed miner through a hose which is different from the two boundary conditions mentioned above moreover previous studies on vtss for deep sea mining have been limited to the responses of the rigid pipe while failing to reveal the response characteristics of the buffer and the hose at the same time as one of the most essential subsystems the vts is responsible for transporting minerals and connecting the seabed operation with the surface mineral processing thus a full understanding of the coupled axial and bending behaviours of the vts including the rigid pipe the buffer and the hose under the random sea states is essential for the design and safety of a tis system this study focuses on the dynamic behaviour of the vts under operation conditions and provides a quantitative assessment of the influence of the irregular waves in section 2 a deep sea tis designed for a sea trial in china is introduced then the finite element method and wave theories utilized in this article are presented in section 3 the modelling data fem meshing scheme and calculation set up process are introduced in section 4 the effects of wave induced hydrodynamic forces and wave induced vessel motions on the vts dynamic responses are explored based on the results of simulations the influences of the wave spectrum peak periods wave headings and significant wave heights on the surface vessel motions and the axial tension bending moment and von mises stress of the vts as well as the buffer responses are discussed the most fragile parts of the vts are noted finally the conclusions are summarised in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 pipeline model and governing equations fig 1 shows a concept model of the deep sea mining system designed for a sea trial in china to collect polymetallic manganese nodules in a water depth of 1700 m it should be noted that manganese nodules are usually found in deep sea areas at depths of approximately 4000 6000 m the sea trial site at 1700 m is a shallower site selected specially for the trial for simplicity the lifting pump attached to the rigid pipe and the buoyancy modules on the hose are modelled as pipelines with their own geometric and structural parameters it is assumed that the pipelines are homogeneous and isotropic tubes and that minerals with a uniform density fill the entire pipelines with a specific flow rate the symbols used in the following sections are defined in the nomenclature in this study the linear axial stiffness is used to derive the strain expression as follows 1 ε l l

this paper this parameter will be referred to when discussing the tension response of the pipelines instead of the wall tension 2 2 2 2 boundary conditions the top and bottom ends of the rigid pipe are connected to the surface vessel and the buffer respectively using universal flexible joints ufjs fig 2 shows the stiffness profile of the ufjs it can be deduced that the bending stiffness of the joints is small when the angle between the flexible joint and the rigid pipe is less than 8 whereas it will become relatively high when the angle is greater than 8 the top and bottom end of the hose are fixed to the buffer and seabed miner respectively which means that the connection points have an infinite bending stiffness hence the boundary conditions for the vts can be expressed as follows 6

enhancement factor which is given a value of 3 3 in this paper the equal energy approach is applied to discretise the wave spectrum and two hundred linear wave components with constant amplitude are generated irregular wave elevations η t are constructed through linear superposition of the discretised wave components by equation 11 where ω i φ i and κ i are the angular frequency phase lag and wave number of the ith wave component respectively 11 η t i 1 n f i 1 f i 2 p f d f 1 2 cos ω i t φ i κ i x in which x is the offset distance from the wave origin in the direction where the surface

by displacement raos response amplitude operators a vessel has three translational degrees of freedom surge sway and heave and three rotational degrees of freedom roll pitch and yaw at the centre of gravity each degree of freedom under a specific wave condition has its own response characteristic which is known as the displacement rao each displacement rao consists of two parameters one is the ratio of the movement amplitude of the vessel to that of the surface wave the other is the phase that defines the timing lag of the vessel motion relative to the wave gong and xu 2016 the movement of a single freedom is obtained as follows 16 s i 1 n r i f i 1 f i 2 s f d f 1 2 cos ω i t φ i κ i x α i where s is the scalar vessel displacement r i is the rao amplitude of the vessel to a wave of frequency ω i α i is the phase angle correspondingly orcina 2014 effects induced by second order wave potential on the vessel are not included 2 3 4 buffer the buffer is treated as a rigid body with three degrees of translational freedom the effects of the weight buoyancy and hydrodynamic loads on the buffer are taken into consideration the hydrodynamic loads are calculated using morison s equations with components of the drag force and fluid inertia force in the x y and z directions orcina 2014 for the x direction and similarly for the y and z directions the hydrodynamic components are as follows 17 f d x b 1 2 ρ o c d x b a b x u b x u b 18 f m x b c m x b ρ o v b u b t where c d x b c m x b a b x and u b x are the x direction components of the buffer with respect to the drag coefficient inertial coefficient drag area and velocity respectively 2 4 discretization by lumped mass method in this study the lumped mass method is used to discretise the continuous pipeline model into a finite number of elements the pipelines are first divided into n elements the sectional properties remain constant within an element the mass of each element is evenly lumped at two end nodes hong 1995 a straight massless segment connects the two nodes within an element and models the axial bending and material damping properties of the element the external forces and moments of each element are lumped and assigned to the nodes fig 3 shows the modelling of the pipelines the matrix equation describing the vts structural dynamics is given by equation 19 where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively f is the vector of the applied loads and a given function of time x is the vector of the displacement and the superposed dots indicate differentiation with respect to time 19 m x c x k x f this equation is solved with the generalised α integration scheme which is an unconditionally stable second order accurate algorithm with controllable numerical damping in addition it has an optimal algorithm that minimises the low frequency dissipation chung and hulbert 1993 at the start of the time simulation the initial position and orientation are known from the static analysis and the initial conditions can be expressed as follows 20 x 0 d 21 x 0 v where d and v are the vectors of the initial displacement and velocity respectively for t n 0 t the forms of d n v n and a n are specified as approximations of x t n x t n and x t n respectively according to chung and hulbert 1993 the expressions for d n 1 and v n 1 are given as combinations of d n v n a n and a n 1 as shown below 22 d n 1 d n δ t v n δ t 2 1 2 β a n β a n 1 23 v n 1 v n δ t 1 γ a n γ a n 1 24 m a n 1 α m c v n 1 α f k d n 1 α f f t n 1 α f where 25 d n 1 α f 1 α f d n 1 α f d n

accuracy orcina 2014 2 5 von mises stress the von mises stress vms is one of the main design criteria used to determine whether a pipeline will experience structural failure it is a combination of three principal stresses given by the following 32 σ v m 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 where σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the three principal stresses i e the radial stress hoop stress and axial compound stress respectively in this paper we refer to σ v m as the vms on the outside edge of the pipeline for the σ v m in this position the radial stress and hoop stress can be calculated using lamé s formula as follows 33 σ 1 a 4 b d o 2 34 σ 2 a 4 b d o 2 where a and b are values that satisfy the following 35 a 4 b d i 2 p i 36 a 4 b d o 2 p o the axial stress is given as follows 37 σ 3 t w π 4 d o 2 d i 2 m i x y d o 2 3 case study 3 1 modelling data the main parameters of the surface vessel in this study are summarised in table 1 fig 4 shows the rao results for the surface mining vessel which are calculated by the software sesam hrdrod hydrod 2015 the main parameters of the pipelines buffer and hydrodynamic coefficients are listed in table 2 table 3 and table 4 respectively to model the desired initial shape of the hose additional buoyancy modules are set with the locations determined by a series of static tests the buffer is modelled as a free floating body with three translational degrees of freedom the flow rates for the rigid pipe and the hose are 121 kg s and 138 kg s respectively both the pipelines and the buffer are considered cylinders and the same hydrodynamic coefficients are applied for simplicity from j r morison 1950 the average values of hydrodynamic coefficients obtained through horizontal pile experiments were 38 c m 1 508 0 197 39 c d 1 626 0 414 in order to get a more conservative result the drag coefficients for c d x and c d y are chosen as 1 2 the mass coefficients for c m x and c m y are chosen as 1 5 the axial drag and mass coefficients are chosen respectively as 0 024 and 1 0 according to shunfeng gong and pu xu 2016 the hydrodynamic coefficients utilized in this paper are summarised in table 4 the lifting pump is located at a length of 521 m 528 5 m relative to the top end of the rigid pipe the buffer is set at a water depth of 1610 2 m the coordinate origin of the vts is located at the still sea surface of the vessel s centre of gravity and the x y and z coordinates are indicated in fig 1 the wave heading direction is defined as the angle between the positive x coordinate direction and the direction of the wave progress for example a 0 wave direction means the wave progresses toward the positive x direction a 90 wave heading means the wave progresses toward the positive y direction thus it is assumed that wave directions of 0 and 180 are in plane directions for the vts while other wave directions are out of plane directions the boundary condition of the vts is simulated by setting the bending stiffness values of the connection points rather than establishing physical mechanical models 3 2 fem meshing and calculation set up the entire calculation process is realised using orcaflex which is a program widely accepted as the industrial software for analysis of offshore pipelines gong et al 2014 2020 considering the influence of the weight buoyancy and internal forces a static analysis is first carried out to determine the global equilibrium configuration of the vts which provides an initial starting position for the subsequent dynamic simulation the dynamic simulations under random sea states are carried out using the implicit dynamic integration method with the generalised α integration scheme at each time step all of the forces and moments acting on the vessel and the nodes of the line are calculated next the motion equations for the vessel and all of the line nodes are established and then solved for the acceleration vector at the end of each time step the time duration for the dynamic simulations is as much as 3 h and the time step is 0 1 s the model segmentations and the corresponding node numbers are listed in table 5 to ensure the computational convergence a sensitivity analysis of the node values and the time step is made under a regular wave with ϕ w equaling to 135 wave height equaling to 4 m and wave period equaling to 8 s the dynamic displacement u z t v z t and ω z t at the mid point of the rigid pipe i e the displacement deviating the static equilibrium position are presented in table 6 r nv means the ratio of the node values in the changed cases to those adopted in our simulations r ts means the ratio of the time step in the changed cases to the adopted one the convergence behaviour of the prescribed discretization scheme and the chosen time step in this paper is examined for different node values at different time step it can be observed that almost all the solutions converge to the values with two significant digits while a small part of solutions converge to the values with one significant digits when r ts is larger than 1 when r ts is equal to or less than 1 the displacement values do not change much with node values and the time step verifying the good long time numerical stability of the prescribed discretization scheme used in this paper the chosen scheme is also time saving since a smaller time step and more node values will extend the calculation time significantly 4 results and discussions the response characteristic of the vts under the effect of irregular waves is highly noticeable and directly dominates the design of the deep sea mining system and the operation feasibility in practice a comprehensive finite element model for vts using the software orcaflex is developed to explore the influences of irregular waves on the pipeline dynamic responses the vts dynamic behaviour in terms of effective tension bending moment von mises stress and dynamic amplification factors are estimated quantitatively and shown in this section 4 1 overall performances of the vts to illustrate the overall responses of the vts to irregular waves a sea condition with h s equal to 6 m t p equal to 8 16 s and ϕ w equal to 135 is selected to model the dynamic responses of the vts the heading of 135 is chosen because there are significant movements at the same time in all six dofs with this heading as shown in the rao results for the surface vessel fig 4 the relationships between the vessel motions and the vts dynamic responses are explored by obtaining time series results of the dynamic simulations thus the six dof motions of the vessel effective tension on the top end of the rigid pipe t e r t o p bending moment on the top end of the rigid pipe b r t o p effective tension on the top end of the hose t e h t o p and bending moment on the top of the hose b h t o p are summarised in fig 5 the elements on the diagonal show the histogram for each variable the scatter plots below the diagonal present the interaction between two random variables and the corresponding correlation coefficient r is noted on each plot in fig 5 it can be seen that t e r t o p has strong negative correlations with the vessel heave and yaw motions with correlation coefficients of 0 82 and 0 72 respectively in addition t e r t o p has positive correlations with the vessel roll r 0 62 and pitch r 0 58 motions however for b r t o p none of the six dof vessel motions exhibit a linear correlation with the result the shape of the histogram for b r t o p is skewed to the right and not as symmetric as others which indicates that the bending response of the rigid pipe under harsh sea states is a non gaussian distribution this phenomenon is due to the nonlinearities of the vts system the nonlinear properties of such pipe system can transform the wave frequency gaussian excitation i e waves and 1st order floater motion into non gaussian system responses the nonlinearities considered for the vts come from the following facts 1 geometric stiffness i e contribution from effective tension to transverse stiffness tension variation is hence a nonlinear effect for the rigid pipe 2 hydrodynamic loading nonlinearities are introduced by the quadratic drag term in the morison equation expressed by the relative structure fluid velocity and by integration of hydrodynamic loading to actual surface elevation the degree of the nonlinearities is dependent on the system and excitation in the case when the vts is exposed to a sea condition with h s equal to 6 m t p equal to 8 16 s and ϕ w equal to 135 the nonlinearities are intensified through the existence of negative tensions on the rigid pipe thus the bending response of the rigid pipe presents obvious non gaussian distribution characteristics for the hose the correlation coefficient for t e h t o p and b h t o p is 0 98 which indicates that there is a strong positive association between these two variables in addition the load responses of the hose to the vessel motions t e h t o p and b h t o p present similar characteristics to that of t e r t o p like t e r t o p t e h t o p and b h t o p exhibit strongly positive relationships with the vessel roll pitch and sway and strongly negative relationships with the vessel heave surge and yaw the correlation coefficient for the relationship between t e r t o p and t e h t o p is 0 80 while that for the relationship between t e r t o p and b h t o p is 0 75 therefore it can be deduced that the effective tension on the top end of the rigid pipe is the main factor that influences the load responses of the hose in summary the effective tension on the rigid pipe is most affected by the vessel heave motion both the effective tension and the bending moment on the hose show similar response characteristics to the effective tension on the rigid pipe none of the six degrees of freedom exhibit an obvious relationship with the bending moment on the rigid pipe moreover the shape of the histogram for b r t o p indicates that the bending response of the rigid pipe is a non gaussian process the high correlation coefficients between t e r t o p and the loads on the top of the hose t e h t o p and b h t o p reveal that the effective tension on the rigid pipe will directly affect the load responses of the hose therefore the rigid pipe on the vts is the most noteworthy part when designing the vts for deep sea mining 4 2 effects of wave induced hydrodynamic forces the wave effects on the vts discussed in this paper come from two parts the one part lies on the hydrodynamic forces determined by morison s equations the other part is manifested through the vessel responses in this section the effect of the wave induced hydrodynamic forces on the vts is explored by comparing the results from two cases 1 the one numerical case that considers both the surface vessel motions and hydrodynamic forces on the vts induced by the surface wave and 2 the other one that considers only the hydrodynamic forces on the vts due to surface wave with the displacement rao of the vessel being zero the dynamic simulation results are presented for the two cases with the parameter distributions shown in fig 6 and the statistical results for the buffer miner slant range summarised in table 7 as shown in fig 6 the distribution curve patterns with and without the vessel motion are similar whereas the maximum response loads with the vessel motion are generally larger than those in the case without the vessel motion the maximum effective tension at the top end of the rigid pipe with vessel motion is 2438 kn which is an increase of 13 9 compared to the value of 2165 kn calculated without the vessel motion the maximum bending moment at the top of the rigid pipe with vessel motion is 69 9 kn m which is 4 6 times greater than the value of 12 4 kn m calculated without the vessel motion the maximum vms at the top of the rigid pipe is increased by 44 1 with the addition of vessel motion compared with the corresponding value considering only the wave effect for the hose the maximum effective tension and bending moment are increased by 8 3 and 28 7 respectively by the vessel motion for the buffer miner slant range presented in table 7 the mean value with the vessel motion is the same as the static value whereas the value with only the wave effect is 8 2 less than the static value this is because waves with ϕ w equal to 135 will exert a continuous force on the rigid pipe toward the miner causing the equilibrium position of the buffer to be changed with the vessel motions induced by the waves the buffer will oscillate around the static equilibrium position and maintain a similar mean slant range to the static mean value comparing the results with and without vessel motions it can be concluded that the hydrodynamic forces due to the surface waves have only a slight effect on the equilibrium position of the vts whereas the vessel motions induced by the waves can greatly amplify the loads on the vts especially the bending moment on the rigid pipe 4 3 sensitivity study on wave parameters generally the surface waves are characterized by three important parameters including wave spectrum peak periods wave headings and significant wave heights these three parameters are important to determine the movements of the surface vessel therefore affecting the vts responses through the vessel s motions as shown in section 4 2 thus it is necessary to make sensitivity studies of wave parameters when examining the effects of wave induced vessel motions on the vts in the following sections different sea states are selected to illustrate the effects of irregular waves on the vts dynamic behaviour manifested through the vessel responses 4 3 1 white noise tests in this section white noise waves are applied under different wave directions of 0 45 90 135 and 180 to obtain the raos of the rigid pipe when the system is exposed to irregular wave excitations fig 7 presents the results of white noise simulations on the vts the frequency range of the white noise is set from 0 02 hz to 3 00 hz which can cover most of the natural frequencies of the pipelines the natural frequencies of the rigid pipe excited by the white noise waves are noted in fig 7 the rao amplitude reaches a maximum value of 3 87 when ϕ w is equal to 90 in the z direction under in plane wave directions such as 0 and 180 the vibrations of the vts are in a 2d plane defined by the x axis and z axis for the out of plane waves the vibrations of the vts exhibit 3d behaviour the lateral vibrations vibrate at an extremely low frequency near zero when ϕ w is in the range of 0 45 and 135 180 the axial vibration exists in all directions which indicates that it is the main motion pattern of the rigid pipe in particular it can be seen that the 90 wave direction is the most dangerous direction there are two reasons to support this conclusion one is that the rao amplitude reaches its maximum in this direction compared with the other cases another is that both the axial displacements and the lateral displacements are excited and coupled with similar frequencies under 90 waves 4 3 2 influence of wave spectrum peak periods for the sake of intuitively understanding the effect of t p on the dynamic behaviour of the vts the sea state is specially defined with h s equal to 6 m and ϕ w equal to 90 which represents a harsh state for deep sea mining operations the values of t p are assumed to be 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s which correspond to one two three and four times the first axial natural period 1 f a 1 respectively fig 8 shows the maximum and minimum distributions with respect to the effective tension bending moment and von mises stress at different positions of the rigid pipe and hose with different t p during the simulations the parameter distributions under static conditions are also presented in fig 8 with dotted lines fig 8 a f show the load results on the rigid pipe in the static condition t e reaches the maximum value of 2152 kn at the top of the rigid pipe and decreases linearly to a value of 262 kn at the bottom of the rigid pipe in fig 8 a and b it can be noted that the tension response under waves with t p equal to 2 04 s is quite different from the other three cases the highest t e max values for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 4509 kn 3321 kn 3175 kn and 3147 kn respectively corresponding to 2 1 times 1 5 times 1 5 times and 1 5 times the static value respectively the lowest t e min for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 582 kn 82 kn 167 kn and 127 kn respectively the t e min curve in fig 8 a for t p equal to 2 04 s is always below zero and does not linearly decrease from the occurrence of the large tension variance range and compression forces it can be deduced that the rigid pipe has become unstable due to local buckling when t p is larger than the first natural period of the rigid pipe the dynamic responses of the rigid pipe will be mitigated and the pipe will be in a sustainable state the bending moment on the rigid pipe is highest at the bottom end with a value of 9 kn m under the static condition under irregular waves the b max of the rigid pipe occurs at the top end which is different from the static condition the highest rigid pipe b max for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 197 kn m 130 kn m 363 kn m and 844 kn m respectively corresponding to 20 8 times 13 6 times 38 2 times and 88 7 times the static value respectively comparing the growth of b to that of t e for the rigid pipe indicates that b on the rigid pipe is more sensitive to the wave periods than t e closer inspection of the results shows that the most severe wave state in terms of b on the rigid pipe is the case with t p equal to 8 16 s while the most severe condition with respect to t e occurs with t p equal to 2 04 s in the static condition the highest rigid pipe σ v m is 2 2 105 mpa which occurs at the top end under waves with different periods the highest rigid pipe σ v m max are 6 7 105 mpa 4 2 105 mpa 8 7 105 mpa and 1 8 106 mpa for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s respectively it can be seen that the wave condition with t p equal to 8 16 s is the harshest condition for the rigid pipe with respect to σ v m it should be noted that the value of σ v m sharply decreases to the minimum value at the position of the lifting pump in all five cases including the static condition fig 8 g j shows the parameter distributions along the length of the hose the highest hose t e max for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 38 4 kn 29 3 kn 27 4 kn and 30 5 kn respectively the highest hose b max for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 27 9 kn m 21 5 kn m 19 5 kn m and 22 0 kn m respectively from the perspective of the absolute values in terms of the effective tension and bending moment the effect of t p on the hose is small however it should be noted that negative tensions exist near the top of the hose in all four cases this suggests that the hose is more susceptible to local buckling and instability due to surface waves to reveal the relationship between t p and the loads on the rigid pipe further a spectrum analysis of the dynamic displacements at the top end of the rigid pipe is carried out for t p equal to 2 04 s and 8 16 s as shown in fig 9 the rigid pipe responses to the wave excitations are at a higher frequency for t p equal to 2 04 s than for t p equal to 8 16 s however the response magnitudes for the displacements excited by waves with t p equal to 8 16 s are much higher than those for the case with t p equal to 2 04 s these results can be explained by the response characteristics of the vessel and rigid pipe when exposed to wave excitations the surface vessel mainly responds to waves with periods in the range of 5 35 s as shown in fig 4 in contrast the rigid pipe mainly responds to waves with periods of no more than 2 04 s as shown in fig 7 when t p is equal to 8 16 s the main parts of the wave energy occur in the region where the surface vessel significantly responds to surface waves the axial and lateral displacements will be directly amplified due to the movements of the surface vessel thus a higher σ v m will occur in this condition when t p is equal to 2 04 s corresponding to the first axial natural period of the rigid pipe the irregular waves will lead the surface vessel to move in a high frequency even the response magnitude is small such high frequency excitations on the top of the rigid pipe directly results in extremely high effective tension as well as negative tension on parts of the pipe as a consequence the rigid pipe will become unstable due to local buckling which is known as parametric instability thampi and niedzwecki 1992 apart from the rigid pipe and hose discussed above the buffer is also an essential element for flow assurance within the vts and this also covers the interfaces connectors for the power and data transmission knodt et al 2016 the buffer miner slant range i e the buffer position relative to the miner on the seafloor is one of the key parameters for slurry transport flows and the design of miner buffer links chung 1998 the buffer must stay within an allowed distance from the miner during operation table 8 lists the statistical results of the buffer miner slant ranges under waves with different t p in the static condition the slant range between the buffer and miner is 209 4 m of the four dynamic conditions the waves with t p equal to 8 16 s produce the largest range 211 3 m which is merely 0 9 greater than the static value the smallest range of 207 9 m occurs for t p equal to 8 16 s which is 0 7 lower than the static value therefore it can be concluded that t p has little effect on the buffer miner slant range 4 3 3 influence of the wave heading the wave heading is another essential factor that will influence the vts responses in this study a significant wave height of 6 m and peak wave period of 8 16 s are selected five wave headings i e 0 45 90 135 and 180 are chosen to perform the sensitivity analysis as shown in fig 10 the results under waves with headings of 0 45 135 and 180 are similar however the results under waves with a heading of 90 differ owing to their largest variance ranges compared with the other headings fig 11 shows the dynamic amplification factor daf results with varying ϕ w the daf is a widely used parameter to quantify structural dynamic responses in linear structural analyses it is defined as the ratio of the dynamic response amplitude of the system to the corresponding static response amplitude with this method the maximum dynamic responses of the vts in terms of the effective tension bending moment σ v m and buffer miner slant range can be conveniently compared with the maximum static values it can be seen from fig 11 that all of the parameters experience a significant increase under all wave headings except the buffer miner slant range in fig 11 d the daf values of the buffer miner slant range remain equal to 1 0 under all wave headings which indicates that ϕ w has no effect on the buffer miner slant range it can be seen that the daf values for the effective tension on the rigid pipe effective tension on the hose and bending moment on the hose are all less than 2 0 whereas the variation range of the bending moment on the rigid pipe is from 2 5 to 88 7 this indicates that the bending moment on the rigid pipe is the most affected by the wave heading fig 12 presents the standard deviations of the surface vessel in terms of the six dof motions under different wave headings since vessel motions in different cases have the same equilibrium position a higher standard deviation value would mean a larger motion amplitude of the vessel in the specific degree of freedom it can be seen that the sway heave and rolling movements under 90 waves are highest compared with those motions under other wave headings it is noteworthy that the rolling motion is extremely amplified by the 90 waves this would directly result in the situation that the daf values reach the peak under the wave heading of 90 therefore it can be concluded that the most adverse wave heading for the vts response is 90 in which the rolling motion of the surface vessel react more significantly than other degree of freedoms waves from 0 to 180 are similarly favourable for the vts as these result in smaller dafs compared with the other headings 4 3 4 influence of significant wave heights the significant wave height is also deemed to be an important factor influencing the dynamic responses of the vts to explore the extent of this influence the most adverse wave heading i e ϕ w equal to 90 is selected to simulate the dynamic responses of the vts under different significant wave heights the spectrum peak period is set as 8 16 s four different heights are chosen 2 m 4 m 6 m and 8 m it can be seen from fig 13 that the sway heave and rolling motions are all enlarged by the wave heights under a wave heading of 90 as shown in fig 14 an increase in the wave height results in increased responses in both the rigid pipe and the hose whereas the gaps due to different wave heights are decreased as the water depth increases at the bottom end of the rigid pipe and at the hose the loads under different wave heights are similar thus the effect of the wave height is mainly concentrated at the top end of the rigid pipe and the hose fig 15 shows the effect of h s on the maximum responses of the vts it can be seen from fig 15 d that the daf for the slant range slightly increases from 1 00 to 1 01 when h s increases from 2 m to 8 m this indicates that the buffer movements are unaffected by h s the bending moment on the rigid pipe has the largest daf compared with the other parameters its daf increases from 7 45 to 146 90 as h s increases from 2 m to 8 m the variance ranges for the daf of the t e and vms on the rigid pipe are 1 17 1 65 and 1 67 13 17 respectively therefore the bending moment is the main factor that causes the difference between the maximum dynamic vms and the static vms the variation ranges of the daf for the t e and b on the hose are 1 16 1 91 and 1 35 2 30 respectively these results indicate that an increase in h s has less effect on the hose than on the rigid pipe 5 conclusion this paper presents a comprehensive numerical investigation of the dynamic performances of the vts in deep sea mining using the lumped mass method the main effort of this paper has been devoted to the characterization of the dynamic responses of a vts concept model which is designed for a sea trial in china under a water depth of 1700 m the irregular waves are used as the only control parameters to perform sensitivity analyses both the wave induced vessel motions and the wave induced hydrodynamic forces are investigated to study their effects on the vts load and displacements responses the relevance of the wave spectrum peak period wave height wave direction and resulting vessel motions to the dynamic responses of the vts are observed and presented the results allow to find out some important phenomena that characterize the vts response features when imposed to the irregular waves the main conclusions are summarised as follows 1 the wave induced hydrodynamic forces due to the surface waves have only a slight effect on the equilibrium position of the vts whereas the wave induced vessel motions are the determining factor in the vts dynamic responses 2 of the six dofs of wave induced vessel motions the heave motion is the most important degree of freedom that determines the effective tension on the rigid pipe none of the six dofs exhibit an obvious relationship with the bending moment on the rigid pipe the shape of the histogram for b r t o p indicates that the bending response on the rigid pipe is a non gaussian process both the effective tension and the bending moment on the hose present high positive correlations with the effective tension on the rigid pipe which means the effective tension on the rigid pipe will directly affect the load responses of the hose thus the rigid pipe is the most noteworthy part of the vts 3 the values of 1 4 times the first axial natural period are chosen to investigate the influence of t p on the vts responses when t p is equal to the first axial natural period of the rigid pipe i e 2 04 s waves will introduce the first resonant frequency in the rigid pipe and result in compression forces and extremely high effective tensions even though the amplitudes of the vessel movements are small when t p is equal to four times the first axial natural period i e 8 16 s the surface vessel responds significantly to the surface waves which directly amplifies both the lateral and axial displacements of the rigid pipe in this case the bending moment on the rigid pipe will be greatly increased as will the von mises stress 4 the wave heading is another essential factor influencing the vts dynamic responses the most adverse wave heading for the vts response is 90 in which the rolling motion of the surface vessel reacts more significantly than other degree of freedoms waves from 0 to 180 are similarly favourable for the vts as they result in smaller dafs compared with the other headings thus reasonable control of the heading of the surface vessel can significantly decrease the response amplitude of the vts 5 the significant wave height is also an important factor that will affect the vts dynamic responses in general an increase in the wave height results in increasing vessel motions and thus increasing loads on the vts the effect of the wave height is mainly concentrated at the top end of the rigid pipe and decreases as the water depth increases as h s increases from 2 m to 8 m the dafs of the effective tension on the rigid pipe changes from 1 17 to 1 65 while the dafs of the bending moment on the rigid pipe changes from 7 45 to 146 9 thus h s has a greater effect on the bending moment than the effective tension on the rigid pipe 6 the difference in the buffer miner slant range in cases with different sea states is negligible which indicates that the irregular waves and vessel motions

20792,the vertical transport system vts is the main part of the total integrated system for deep sea mining which attracts increasing attention owing to the shortage of mineral resources the influences of irregular waves due to wave induced hydrodynamic forces and wave induced vessel motions on the vts dynamic responses are estimated based on the lumped mass method results show that the wave induced hydrodynamic forces mainly act on the equilibrium position of the vts whereas the wave induced vessel motions are the determining factor in the vts dynamic responses waves with the specific spectrum peak period would induce parametric instability in the vts the most adverse heading for the vts is found to be 90 the dynamic responses of the vts will increase with wave heights however the buffer miner slant range is found to be insensitive to wave conditions heave motions are the most dominant factor influencing the effective tension of the rigid pipe the effective tension on the rigid pipe directly affect the load response of the hose particularly the bending moment on the rigid pipe presents non gaussian characteristics under extreme environments therefore the coupling effect of the vessel motions under irregular waves should be considered to study the complete vts dynamic responses keywords total integrated system vertical transport system deep sea mining

could potentially add to the global raw material supply in the future petersen et al 2016 the design concept of the total integrated system tis has been widely regarded as the most profitable prospective system for deep sea mining chung 1996 a tis comprises a mining vessel a vertical transport system vts and a seabed collector miner a mining vessel is designed for the purpose of mining operations it is equipped with sufficient storage space for mined nodules or crusts and heave compensated cranes winches to perform lift operations for the installation and recovery of subsea equipment a vts comprises a rigid pipe one or more lifting pumps a buffer and a hose the rigid pipe is employed as the main part of the vts with lifting pumps combined within the pipe s diameter at one or several pump stages the buffer is a free hanging container installed at the bottom of the rigid pipe it serves as a temporary storage space in case the mining operation at the seabed is conducted at a higher speed than the transport process in the rigid pipe can handle knodt et al 2016 a hose connects the collector to the buffer transporting the mineral nodules or crusts from the collector to the rigid pipe the seabed miner conducts the actual mining operation on the seabed various studies and analyses have been carried out to evaluate the dynamic responses of vtss in recent decades in terms of numerical methods chung et al 1994a 1994b developed a nonlinear finite element method fem to simulate the three dimensional nonlinear coupled axial bending and torsional responses of a 4000 ft vts the authors considered periodic horizontal and vertical motions at the top of the pipe the internal slurry flow and the external hydrodynamic forces due to the current flow subsequently an improved discrete element method based on multi body dynamics was proposed by baorong et al 1997 it could be used to calculate the frequencies static deflections and dynamic responses of beam structures hong et al 1997 employed a lumped parameter method and an incremental iterative scheme to analyse the axial vibrations and towing responses of lifting pipes in deep seabed mining morison equations were used to estimate the external forces on the lifting pipe while the vessel motion and surface waves were neglected the bottom end of the lifting pipe was considered as free and the underwater pumps and buffer were regarded as rigid elements in terms of the effect of the boundary conditions babu and ahmad 1999 developed a finite element formulation for the nonlinear coupled responses of two pipe systems with different boundary conditions in one condition the bottom end was connected to the collector in the other the bottom end was kept free of the collector the effects of the current force internal slurry flow and vessel motion due to regular waves were discussed the results showed that the boundary conditions significantly influenced the determination of the frequencies of the mining pipes and hence the overall dynamic response for the effect of currents thorsen et al 2019 studied the vortex induced vibration viv response of a mining riser using a coupled analysis framework for the riser responses and internal flow they focused on the effect of time varying internal slurry flows with density waves traveling along the risers and found that the internal flow could produce significant changes to the viv fatigue damage under specific internal flow density conditions for the influence of vessel motions wu et al 2019 discussed the effect of the heave motion on the global dynamic responses of a deep sea mining system based on the lumped mass method three different scenarios caused by harmonic heave motions corresponding to different heave motion frequencies were introduced besides numerical studies several experimental investigations have been conducted to explore the response characteristics of vtss chung 2010 published the first ever measurements of a full scale pipe response coupled with the motion of the surface vessel in the deep ocean a pipe with a length of 5000 m and outer diameter of 15 in deployed from the moon pool of the hughes glomar explorer surface mining vessel in the north pacific ocean was measured the field data showed that the axial stress could be an order of magnitude larger than the bending stress for a long pipe and the bending is less of an issue for mining pipes yamamoto et al 2013 experimentally investigated the effect of a pulsating internal flow on the dynamics of a flexible pipe in a jumper configuration which could be used in deep sea mining to convey the mineral ore slurry from the seafloor collector to the buffer they found that the pulsating internal flow generated a vibration of the initially straight pipe increasing the internal flow rate had a negligible effect on the amplitude response in the inline direction the response in the cross direction was caused by viv rather than the internal flow it can be seen from the literature review above that previous studies have primarily focused on the effect of regular waves on the vts most of the published papers did not establish a complete vts model that could be used in practical engineering most of these previous studies utilized a simplified boundary condition for the rigid pipe in these studies two boundary conditions for the rigid pipe are commonly discussed one is completely free of the miner and the other is directly connected to the miner in the actual operation condition of the tis the buffer at the bottom end of the rigid pipe is connected to the seabed miner through a hose which is different from the two boundary conditions mentioned above moreover previous studies on vtss for deep sea mining have been limited to the responses of the rigid pipe while failing to reveal the response characteristics of the buffer and the hose at the same time as one of the most essential subsystems the vts is responsible for transporting minerals and connecting the seabed operation with the surface mineral processing thus a full understanding of the coupled axial and bending behaviours of the vts including the rigid pipe the buffer and the hose under the random sea states is essential for the design and safety of a tis system this study focuses on the dynamic behaviour of the vts under operation conditions and provides a quantitative assessment of the influence of the irregular waves in section 2 a deep sea tis designed for a sea trial in china is introduced then the finite element method and wave theories utilized in this article are presented in section 3 the modelling data fem meshing scheme and calculation set up process are introduced in section 4 the effects of wave induced hydrodynamic forces and wave induced vessel motions on the vts dynamic responses are explored based on the results of simulations the influences of the wave spectrum peak periods wave headings and significant wave heights on the surface vessel motions and the axial tension bending moment and von mises stress of the vts as well as the buffer responses are discussed the most fragile parts of the vts are noted finally the conclusions are summarised in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 pipeline model and governing equations fig 1 shows a concept model of the deep sea mining system designed for a sea trial in china to collect polymetallic manganese nodules in a water depth of 1700 m it should be noted that manganese nodules are usually found in deep sea areas at depths of approximately 4000 6000 m the sea trial site at 1700 m is a shallower site selected specially for the trial for simplicity the lifting pump attached to the rigid pipe and the buoyancy modules on the hose are modelled as pipelines with their own geometric and structural parameters it is assumed that the pipelines are homogeneous and isotropic tubes and that minerals with a uniform density fill the entire pipelines with a specific flow rate the symbols used in the following sections are defined in the nomenclature in this study the linear axial stiffness is used to derive the strain expression as follows 1 ε l l 0 l 0 therefore the wall tension t w z t of the pipelines can be expressed as 2 t w z t e a ε z t 2 ν p o a o p i a i considering the axial force bending stiffness internal flow and combined hydraulic loads the fourth order partial differential equations of a 3d euler bernoulli beam column model are applied as the governing equations for the pipelines according to païdoussis 1998 3 2 z 2 e i 2 u z

force of the internal flow combining the effects of the internal and external pressures acting on the pipelines the effective tension can be derived as equation 5 5 t e z t t w z t a o p o a i p i in this paper this parameter will be referred to when discussing the tension response of the pipelines instead of the wall tension 2 2 2 2 boundary conditions the top and bottom ends of the rigid pipe are connected to the surface vessel and the buffer respectively using universal flexible joints ufjs fig 2 shows the stiffness profile of the ufjs it can be deduced that the bending stiffness of the joints is small when the angle between the flexible joint and the rigid pipe is less than 8 whereas it will become relatively high when the angle is greater than 8 the top and bottom end of the hose are fixed to the buffer and seabed miner respectively which means that the connection points have an infinite bending stiffness hence the boundary conditions for the vts can be expressed as follows 6 u 0 t v 0 t w 0 t u t 0 t v t 0 t w t 0 t t s x s y s z s x x s y y s z z t 7 2 u z 2 z 0 k u e i u z z 0 8 2 v z 2 z 0 k v e i v z z 0 9 w z t z s e a b e d 0 w z t t z s e a b e d 0 where z 0 and z s e a b e d indicate the vertical positions of the surface level and the seabed respectively 2 3 irregular waves 2 3 1 wave kinematics in the analysis presented in this paper linear wave theory is applied the standard joint north sea wave project jonswap frequency spectra shown in equation 10 was employed to simulate the surface wave 10 p f α g 2 16 π 4 f 5 exp 5 4 f f p 4 γ β in equation 10 α

enhancement factor which is given a value of 3 3 in this paper the equal energy approach is applied to discretise the wave spectrum and two hundred linear wave components with constant amplitude are generated irregular wave elevations η t are constructed through linear superposition of the discretised wave components by equation 11 where ω i φ i and κ i are the angular frequency phase lag and wave number of the ith wave component respectively 11 η t i 1 n f i 1 f i 2 p f d f 1 2 cos ω i t φ i κ i x in which x is the offset distance from the wave origin in the direction where the surface wave progresses similarly the horizontal particle velocity and acceleration in the wave progressing direction are expressed by superposition of airy wave components as follows 12 v w i 1 n f i 1 f i 2

on the vts due to the relative movement of the surrounding fluid particles are determined by the morison s equations morison et al 1950 as follows 14 f x ρ w c d x d o 2 v w cos ϕ w u z t t v w cos ϕ

t 2 where ϕ w means the relative angle between the positive x direction and the wave progressing direction i e the wave direction 2 3 3 wave induced vessel motions vessel motions in waves are defined by displacement raos response amplitude operators a vessel has three translational degrees of freedom surge sway and heave and three rotational degrees of freedom roll pitch and yaw at the centre of gravity each degree of freedom under a specific wave condition has its own response characteristic which is known as the displacement rao each displacement rao consists of two parameters one is the ratio of the movement amplitude of the vessel to that of the surface wave the other is the phase that defines the timing lag of the vessel motion relative to the wave gong and xu 2016 the movement of a single freedom is obtained as follows 16 s i 1 n r i f i 1 f i 2 s f d f 1 2 cos ω i t φ i κ i x α i where s is the scalar vessel displacement r i is the rao amplitude of the vessel to a wave of frequency ω i α i is the phase angle correspondingly orcina 2014 effects induced by second order wave potential on the vessel are not included 2 3 4 buffer the buffer is treated as a rigid body with three degrees of translational freedom the effects of the weight buoyancy and hydrodynamic loads on the buffer are taken into consideration the hydrodynamic loads are calculated using morison s equations with components of the drag force and fluid inertia force in the x y and z directions orcina 2014 for the x direction and similarly for the y and z directions the hydrodynamic components are as follows 17 f d x b 1 2 ρ o c d x b a b x u b x u b 18 f m x b c m x b ρ o v b u b t where c d x b c m x b a b x and u b x are the x direction components of the buffer with respect to the drag coefficient inertial coefficient drag area and velocity respectively 2 4 discretization by lumped mass method in this study the lumped mass method is used to discretise the continuous pipeline model into a finite number of elements the pipelines are first divided into n elements the sectional properties remain constant within an element the mass of each element is evenly lumped at two end nodes hong 1995 a straight massless segment connects the two nodes within an element and models the axial bending and material damping properties of the element the external forces and moments of each element are lumped and assigned to the nodes fig 3 shows the modelling of the pipelines the matrix equation describing the vts structural dynamics is given by equation 19 where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively f is the vector of the applied loads and a given function of time x is the vector of the displacement and the superposed dots indicate differentiation with respect to time 19 m x c x k x f this equation is solved with the generalised α integration scheme which is an unconditionally stable second order accurate algorithm with controllable numerical damping in addition it has an optimal algorithm that minimises the low frequency dissipation chung and hulbert 1993 at the start of the time simulation the initial position and orientation are known

forms of d n v n and a n are specified as approximations of x t n x t n and x t n respectively according to chung and hulbert 1993 the expressions for d n 1 and v n 1 are given as combinations of d n

accuracy orcina 2014 2 5 von mises stress the von mises stress vms is one of the main design criteria used to determine whether a pipeline will experience structural failure it is a combination of three principal stresses given by the following 32 σ v m 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 where σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the three principal stresses i e the radial stress hoop stress and axial compound stress respectively in this paper we refer to σ v m as the vms on the outside edge of the pipeline for the σ v m in this position the radial stress and hoop stress can be calculated using lamé s formula as follows 33 σ 1 a 4 b d o 2 34 σ 2 a 4 b d o 2 where a and b are values that satisfy the following 35 a 4 b d i 2 p i 36 a 4 b d o 2 p o the axial stress is given as follows 37 σ 3 t w π 4 d

which are calculated by the software sesam hrdrod hydrod 2015 the main parameters of the pipelines buffer and hydrodynamic coefficients are listed in table 2 table 3 and table 4 respectively to model the desired initial shape of the hose additional buoyancy modules are set with the locations determined by a series of static tests the buffer is modelled as a free floating body with three translational degrees of freedom the flow rates for the rigid pipe and the hose are 121 kg s and 138 kg s respectively both the pipelines and the buffer are considered cylinders and the same hydrodynamic coefficients are applied for simplicity from j r morison 1950 the average values of hydrodynamic coefficients obtained through horizontal pile experiments were 38 c m 1 508 0 197 39 c d 1 626 0 414 in order to get a more conservative result the drag coefficients for c d x and c d y are chosen as 1 2 the mass coefficients for c m x and c m y are chosen as 1 5 the axial drag and mass coefficients are chosen respectively as 0 024 and 1 0 according to shunfeng gong and pu xu 2016 the hydrodynamic coefficients utilized in this paper are summarised in table 4 the lifting pump is located at a length of 521 m 528 5 m relative to the top end of the rigid pipe the buffer is set at a water depth of 1610 2 m the coordinate origin of the vts is located at the still sea surface of the vessel s centre of gravity and the x y and z coordinates are indicated in fig 1 the wave heading direction is defined as the angle between the positive x coordinate direction and the direction of the wave progress for example a 0 wave direction means the wave progresses toward the positive x direction a 90 wave heading means the wave progresses toward the positive y direction thus it is assumed that wave directions of 0 and 180 are in plane directions for the vts while other wave directions are out of plane directions the boundary condition of the vts is simulated by setting the bending stiffness values of the connection points rather than establishing physical mechanical models 3 2 fem meshing and calculation set up the entire calculation process is realised using orcaflex which is a program widely accepted as the industrial software for analysis of offshore pipelines gong et al 2014 2020 considering the influence of the weight buoyancy and internal forces a static analysis is first carried out to determine the global equilibrium configuration of the vts which provides an initial starting position for the subsequent dynamic simulation the dynamic simulations under random sea states are carried out using the implicit dynamic integration method with the generalised α integration scheme at each time step all of the forces and moments acting on the vessel and the nodes of the line are calculated next the motion equations for the vessel and all of the line nodes are established and then solved for the acceleration vector at the end of each time step the time duration for the dynamic simulations is as much as 3 h and the time step is 0 1 s the model segmentations and the corresponding node numbers are listed in table 5 to ensure the computational convergence a sensitivity analysis of the node values and the time step is made under a regular wave with ϕ w equaling to 135 wave height equaling to 4 m and wave period equaling to 8 s the dynamic displacement u z t v z t and ω z t at the mid point of the rigid pipe i e the displacement deviating the static equilibrium position are presented in table 6 r nv means the ratio of the node values in the changed cases to those adopted in our simulations r ts means the ratio of the time step in the changed cases to the adopted one the convergence behaviour of the prescribed discretization scheme and the chosen time step in this paper is examined for different node values at different time step it can be observed that almost all the solutions converge to the values with two significant digits while a small part of solutions converge to the values with one significant digits when r ts is larger than 1 when r ts is equal to or less than 1 the displacement values do not change much with node values and the time step verifying the good long time numerical stability of the prescribed discretization scheme used in this paper the chosen scheme is also time saving since a smaller time step and more node values will extend the calculation time significantly 4 results and discussions the response characteristic of the vts under the effect of irregular waves is highly noticeable and directly dominates the design of the deep sea mining system and the operation feasibility in practice a comprehensive finite element model for vts using the software orcaflex is developed to explore the influences of irregular waves on the pipeline dynamic responses the vts dynamic behaviour in terms of effective tension bending moment von mises stress and dynamic amplification factors are estimated quantitatively and shown in this section 4 1 overall performances of the vts to illustrate the overall responses of the vts to irregular waves a sea condition with h s equal to 6 m t p equal to 8 16 s and ϕ w equal to 135 is selected to model the dynamic responses of the vts the heading of 135 is chosen because there are significant movements at the same time in all six dofs with this heading as shown in the rao results for the surface vessel fig 4 the relationships between the vessel motions and the vts dynamic responses are explored by obtaining time series results of the dynamic simulations thus the six dof motions of the vessel effective tension on the top end of the rigid pipe t e r t o p bending moment on the top end of the rigid pipe b r t o p effective tension on the top end of the hose t e h t o p and bending moment on the top of the hose b h t o p are summarised in fig 5 the elements on the diagonal show the histogram for each variable the scatter plots below the diagonal present the interaction between two random variables and the corresponding correlation coefficient r is noted on each plot in fig 5 it can be seen that t e r t o p has strong negative correlations with the vessel heave and yaw motions with correlation coefficients of 0 82 and 0 72 respectively in addition t e r t o p has positive correlations with the vessel roll r 0 62 and pitch r 0 58 motions however for b r t o p none of the six dof vessel motions exhibit a linear correlation with the result the shape of the histogram for b r t o p is skewed to the right and not as symmetric as others which indicates that the bending response of the rigid pipe under harsh sea states is a non gaussian distribution this phenomenon is due to the nonlinearities of the vts system the nonlinear properties of such pipe system can transform the wave frequency gaussian excitation i e waves and 1st order floater motion into non gaussian system responses the nonlinearities considered for the vts come from the following facts 1 geometric stiffness i e contribution from effective tension to transverse stiffness tension variation is hence a nonlinear effect for the rigid pipe 2 hydrodynamic loading nonlinearities are introduced by the quadratic drag term in the morison equation expressed by the relative structure fluid velocity and by integration of hydrodynamic loading to actual surface elevation the degree of the nonlinearities is dependent on the system and excitation in the case when the vts is exposed to a sea condition with h s equal to 6 m t p equal to 8 16 s and ϕ w equal to 135 the nonlinearities are intensified through the existence of negative tensions on the rigid pipe thus the bending response of the rigid pipe presents obvious non gaussian distribution characteristics for the hose the correlation coefficient for t e h t o p and b h t o p is 0 98 which indicates that there is a strong positive association between these two variables in addition the load responses of the hose to the vessel motions t e h t o p and b h t o p present similar characteristics to that of t e r t o p like t e r t o p t e h t o p and b h t o p exhibit strongly positive relationships with the vessel roll pitch and sway and strongly negative relationships with the vessel heave surge and yaw the correlation coefficient for the relationship between t e r t o p and t e h t o p is 0 80 while that for the relationship between t e r t o p and b h t o p is 0 75 therefore it can be deduced that the effective tension on the top end of the rigid pipe is the main factor that influences the load responses of the hose in summary the effective tension on the rigid pipe is most affected by the vessel heave motion both the effective tension and the bending moment on the hose show similar response characteristics to the effective tension on the rigid pipe none of the six degrees of freedom exhibit an obvious relationship with the bending moment on the rigid pipe moreover the shape of the histogram for b r t o p indicates that the bending response of the rigid pipe is a non gaussian process the high correlation coefficients between t e r t o p and the loads on the top of the hose t e h t o p and b h t o p reveal that the effective tension on the rigid pipe will directly affect the load responses of the hose therefore the rigid pipe on the vts is the most noteworthy part when designing the vts for deep sea mining 4 2 effects of wave induced hydrodynamic forces the wave effects on the vts discussed in this paper come from two parts the one part lies on the hydrodynamic forces determined by morison s equations the other part is manifested through the vessel responses in this section the effect of the wave induced hydrodynamic forces on the vts is explored by comparing the results from two cases 1 the one numerical case that considers both the surface vessel motions and hydrodynamic forces on the vts induced by the surface wave and 2 the other one that considers only the hydrodynamic forces on the vts due to surface wave with the displacement rao of the vessel being zero the dynamic simulation results are presented for the two cases with the parameter distributions shown in fig 6 and the statistical results for the buffer miner slant range summarised in table 7 as shown in fig 6 the distribution curve patterns with and without the vessel motion are similar whereas the maximum response loads with the vessel motion are generally larger than those in the case without the vessel motion the maximum effective tension at the top end of the rigid pipe with vessel motion is 2438 kn which is an increase of 13 9 compared to the value of 2165 kn calculated without the vessel motion the maximum bending moment at the top of the rigid pipe with vessel motion is 69 9 kn m which is 4 6 times greater than the value of 12 4 kn m calculated without the vessel motion the maximum vms at the top of the rigid pipe is increased by 44 1 with the addition of vessel motion compared with the corresponding value considering only the wave effect for the hose the maximum effective tension and bending moment are increased by 8 3 and 28 7 respectively by the vessel motion for the buffer miner slant range presented in table 7 the mean value with the vessel motion is the same as the static value whereas the value with only the wave effect is 8 2 less than the static value this is because waves with ϕ w equal to 135 will exert a continuous force on the rigid pipe toward the miner causing the equilibrium position of the buffer to be changed with the vessel motions induced by the waves the buffer will oscillate around the static equilibrium position and maintain a similar mean slant range to the static mean value comparing the results with and without vessel motions it can be concluded that the hydrodynamic forces due to the surface waves have only a slight effect on the equilibrium position of the vts whereas the vessel motions induced by the waves can greatly amplify the loads on the vts especially the bending moment on the rigid pipe 4 3 sensitivity study on wave parameters generally the surface waves are characterized by three important parameters including wave spectrum peak periods wave headings and significant wave heights these three parameters are important to determine the movements of the surface vessel therefore affecting the vts responses through the vessel s motions as shown in section 4 2 thus it is necessary to make sensitivity studies of wave parameters when examining the effects of wave induced vessel motions on the vts in the following sections different sea states are selected to illustrate the effects of irregular waves on the vts dynamic behaviour manifested through the vessel responses 4 3 1 white noise tests in this section white noise waves are applied under different wave directions of 0 45 90 135 and 180 to obtain the raos of the rigid pipe when the system is exposed to irregular wave excitations fig 7 presents the results of white noise simulations on the vts the frequency range of the white noise is set from 0 02 hz to 3 00 hz which can cover most of the natural frequencies of the pipelines the natural frequencies of the rigid pipe excited by the white noise waves are noted in fig 7 the rao amplitude reaches a maximum value of 3 87 when ϕ w is equal to 90 in the z direction under in plane wave directions such as 0 and 180 the vibrations of the vts are in a 2d plane defined by the x axis and z axis for the out of plane waves the vibrations of the vts exhibit 3d behaviour the lateral vibrations vibrate at an extremely low frequency near zero when ϕ w is in the range of 0 45 and 135 180 the axial vibration exists in all directions which indicates that it is the main motion pattern of the rigid pipe in particular it can be seen that the 90 wave direction is the most dangerous direction there are two reasons to support this conclusion one is that the rao amplitude reaches its maximum in this direction compared with the other cases another is that both the axial displacements and the lateral displacements are excited and coupled with similar frequencies under 90 waves 4 3 2 influence of wave spectrum peak periods for the sake of intuitively understanding the effect of t p on the dynamic behaviour of the vts the sea state is specially defined with h s equal to 6 m and ϕ w equal to 90 which represents a harsh state for deep sea mining operations the values of t p are assumed to be 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s which correspond to one two three and four times the first axial natural period 1 f a 1 respectively fig 8 shows the maximum and minimum distributions with respect to the effective tension bending moment and von mises stress at different positions of the rigid pipe and hose with different t p during the simulations the parameter distributions under static conditions are also presented in fig 8 with dotted lines fig 8 a f show the load results on the rigid pipe in the static condition t e reaches the maximum value of 2152 kn at the top of the rigid pipe and decreases linearly to a value of 262 kn at the bottom of the rigid pipe in fig 8 a and b it can be noted that the tension response under waves with t p equal to 2 04 s is quite different from the other three cases the highest t e max values for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 4509 kn 3321 kn 3175 kn and 3147 kn respectively corresponding to 2 1 times 1 5 times 1 5 times and 1 5 times the static value respectively the lowest t e min for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 582 kn 82 kn 167 kn and 127 kn respectively the t e min curve in fig 8 a for t p equal to 2 04 s is always below zero and does not linearly decrease from the occurrence of the large tension variance range and compression forces it can be deduced that the rigid pipe has become unstable due to local buckling when t p is larger than the first natural period of the rigid pipe the dynamic responses of the rigid pipe will be mitigated and the pipe will be in a sustainable state the bending moment on the rigid pipe is highest at the bottom end with a value of 9 kn m under the static condition under irregular waves the b max of the rigid pipe occurs at the top end which is different from the static condition the highest rigid pipe b max for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 197 kn m 130 kn m 363 kn m and 844 kn m respectively corresponding to 20 8 times 13 6 times 38 2 times and 88 7 times the static value respectively comparing the growth of b to that of t e for the rigid pipe indicates that b on the rigid pipe is more sensitive to the wave periods than t e closer inspection of the results shows that the most severe wave state in terms of b on the rigid pipe is the case with t p equal to 8 16 s while the most severe condition with respect to t e occurs with t p equal to 2 04 s in the static condition the highest rigid pipe σ v m is 2 2 105 mpa which occurs at the top end under waves with different periods the highest rigid pipe σ v m max are 6 7 105 mpa 4 2 105 mpa 8 7 105 mpa and 1 8 106 mpa for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s respectively it can be seen that the wave condition with t p equal to 8 16 s is the harshest condition for the rigid pipe with respect to σ v m it should be noted that the value of σ v m sharply decreases to the minimum value at the position of the lifting pump in all five cases including the static condition fig 8 g j shows the parameter distributions along the length of the hose the highest hose t e max for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 38 4 kn 29 3 kn 27 4 kn and 30 5 kn respectively the highest hose b max for t p equal to 2 04 s 4 08 s 6 12 s and 8 16 s are 27 9 kn m 21 5 kn m 19 5 kn m and 22 0 kn m respectively from the perspective of the absolute values in terms of the effective tension and bending moment the effect of t p on the hose is small however it should be noted that negative tensions exist near the top of the hose in all four cases this suggests that the hose is more susceptible to local buckling and instability due to surface waves to reveal the relationship between t p and the loads on the rigid pipe further a spectrum analysis of the dynamic displacements at the top end of the rigid pipe is carried out for t p equal to 2 04 s and 8 16 s as shown in fig 9 the rigid pipe responses to the wave excitations are at a higher frequency for t p equal to 2 04 s than for t p equal to 8 16 s however the response magnitudes for the displacements excited by waves with t p equal to 8 16 s are much higher than those for the case with t p equal to 2 04 s these results can be explained by the response characteristics of the vessel and rigid pipe when exposed to wave excitations the surface vessel mainly responds to waves with periods in the range of 5 35 s as shown in fig 4 in contrast the rigid pipe mainly responds to waves with periods of no more than 2 04 s as shown in fig 7 when t p is equal to 8 16 s the main parts of the wave energy occur in the region where the surface vessel significantly responds to surface waves the axial and lateral displacements will be directly amplified due to the movements of the surface vessel thus a higher σ v m will occur in this condition when t p is equal to 2 04 s corresponding to the first axial natural period of the rigid pipe the irregular waves will lead the surface vessel to move in a high frequency even the response magnitude is small such high frequency excitations on the top of the rigid pipe directly results in extremely high effective tension as well as negative tension on parts of the pipe as a consequence the rigid pipe will become unstable due to local buckling which is known as parametric instability thampi and niedzwecki 1992 apart from the rigid pipe and hose discussed above the buffer is also an essential element for flow assurance within the vts and this also covers the interfaces connectors for the power and data transmission knodt et al 2016 the buffer miner slant range i e the buffer position relative to the miner on the seafloor is one of the key parameters for slurry transport flows and the design of miner buffer links chung 1998 the buffer must stay within an allowed distance from the miner during operation table 8 lists the statistical results of the buffer miner slant ranges under waves with different t p in the static condition the slant range between the buffer and miner is 209 4 m of the four dynamic conditions the waves with t p equal to 8 16 s produce the largest range 211 3 m which is merely 0 9 greater than the static value the smallest range of 207 9 m occurs for t p equal to 8 16 s which is 0 7 lower than the static value therefore it can be concluded that t p has little effect on the buffer miner slant range 4 3 3 influence of the wave heading the wave heading is another essential factor that will influence the vts responses in this study a significant wave height of 6 m and peak wave period of 8 16 s are selected five wave headings i e 0 45 90 135 and 180 are chosen to perform the sensitivity analysis as shown in fig 10 the results under waves with headings of 0 45 135 and 180 are similar however the results under waves with a heading of 90 differ owing to their largest variance ranges compared with the other headings fig 11 shows the dynamic amplification factor daf results with varying ϕ w the daf is a widely used parameter to quantify structural dynamic responses in linear structural analyses it is defined as the ratio of the dynamic response amplitude of the system to the corresponding static response amplitude with this method the maximum dynamic responses of the vts in terms of the effective tension bending moment σ v m and buffer miner slant range can be conveniently compared with the maximum static values it can be seen from fig 11 that all of the parameters experience a significant increase under all wave headings except the buffer miner slant range in fig 11 d the daf values of the buffer miner slant range remain equal to 1 0 under all wave headings which indicates that ϕ w has no effect on the buffer miner slant range it can be seen that the daf values for the effective tension on the rigid pipe effective tension on the hose and bending moment on the hose are all less than 2 0 whereas the variation range of the bending moment on the rigid pipe is from 2 5 to 88 7 this indicates that the bending moment on the rigid pipe is the most affected by the wave heading fig 12 presents the standard deviations of the surface vessel in terms of the six dof motions under different wave headings since vessel motions in different cases have the same equilibrium position a higher standard deviation value would mean a larger motion amplitude of the vessel in the specific degree of freedom it can be seen that the sway heave and rolling movements under 90 waves are highest compared with those motions under other wave headings it is noteworthy that the rolling motion is extremely amplified by the 90 waves this would directly result in the situation that the daf values reach the peak under the wave heading of 90 therefore it can be concluded that the most adverse wave heading for the vts response is 90 in which the rolling motion of the surface vessel react more significantly than other degree of freedoms waves from 0 to 180 are similarly favourable for the vts as these result in smaller dafs compared with the other headings 4 3 4 influence of significant wave heights the significant wave height is also deemed to be an important factor influencing the dynamic responses of the vts to explore the extent of this influence the most adverse wave heading i e ϕ w equal to 90 is selected to simulate the dynamic responses of the vts under different significant wave heights the spectrum peak period is set as 8 16 s four different heights are chosen 2 m 4 m 6 m and 8 m it can be seen from fig 13 that the sway heave and rolling motions are all enlarged by the wave heights under a wave heading of 90 as shown in fig 14 an increase in the wave height results in increased responses in both the rigid pipe and the hose whereas the gaps due to different wave heights are decreased as the water depth increases at the bottom end of the rigid pipe and at the hose the loads under different wave heights are similar thus the effect of the wave height is mainly concentrated at the top end of the rigid pipe and the hose fig 15 shows the effect of h s on the maximum responses of the vts it can be seen from fig 15 d that the daf for the slant range slightly increases from 1 00 to 1 01 when h s increases from 2 m to 8 m this indicates that the buffer movements are unaffected by h s the bending moment on the rigid pipe has the largest daf compared with the other parameters its daf increases from 7 45 to 146 90 as h s increases from 2 m to 8 m the variance ranges for the daf of the t e and vms on the rigid pipe are 1 17 1 65 and 1 67 13 17 respectively therefore the bending moment is the main factor that causes the difference between the maximum dynamic vms and the static vms the variation ranges of the daf for the t e and b on the hose are 1 16 1 91 and 1 35 2 30 respectively these results indicate that an increase in h s has less effect on the hose than on the rigid pipe 5 conclusion this paper presents a comprehensive numerical investigation of the dynamic performances of the vts in deep sea mining using the lumped mass method the main effort of this paper has been devoted to the characterization of the dynamic responses of a vts concept model which is designed for a sea trial in china under a water depth of 1700 m the irregular waves are used as the only control parameters to perform sensitivity analyses both the wave induced vessel motions and the wave induced hydrodynamic forces are investigated to study their effects on the vts load and displacements responses the relevance of the wave spectrum peak period wave height wave direction and resulting vessel motions to the dynamic responses of the vts are observed and presented the results allow to find out some important phenomena that characterize the vts response features when imposed to the irregular waves the main conclusions are summarised as follows 1 the wave induced hydrodynamic forces due to the surface waves have only a slight effect on the equilibrium position of the vts whereas the wave induced vessel motions are the determining factor in the vts dynamic responses 2 of the six dofs of wave induced vessel motions the heave motion is the most important degree of freedom that determines the effective tension on the rigid pipe none of the six dofs exhibit an obvious relationship with the bending moment on the rigid pipe the shape of the histogram for b r t o p indicates that the bending response on the rigid pipe is a non gaussian process both the effective tension and the bending moment on the hose present high positive correlations with the effective tension on the rigid pipe which means the effective tension on the rigid pipe will directly affect the load responses of the hose thus the rigid pipe is the most noteworthy part of the vts 3 the values of 1 4 times the first axial natural period are chosen to investigate the influence of t p on the vts responses when t p is equal to the first axial natural period of the rigid pipe i e 2 04 s waves will introduce the first resonant frequency in the rigid pipe and result in compression forces and extremely high effective tensions even though the amplitudes of the vessel movements are small when t p is equal to four times the first axial natural period i e 8 16 s the surface vessel responds significantly to the surface waves which directly amplifies both the lateral and axial displacements of the rigid pipe in this case the bending moment on the rigid pipe will be greatly increased as will the von mises stress 4 the wave heading is another essential factor influencing the vts dynamic responses the most adverse wave heading for the vts response is 90 in which the rolling motion of the surface vessel reacts more significantly than other degree of freedoms waves from 0 to 180 are similarly favourable for the vts as they result in smaller dafs compared with the other headings thus reasonable control of the heading of the surface vessel can significantly decrease the response amplitude of the vts 5 the significant wave height is also an important factor that will affect the vts dynamic responses in general an increase in the wave height results in increasing vessel motions and thus increasing loads on the vts the effect of the wave height is mainly concentrated at the top end of the rigid pipe and decreases as the water depth increases as h s increases from 2 m to 8 m the dafs of the effective tension on the rigid pipe changes from 1 17 to 1 65 while the dafs of the bending moment on the rigid pipe changes from 7 45 to 146 9 thus h s has a greater effect on the bending moment than the effective tension on the rigid pipe 6 the difference in the buffer miner slant range in cases with different sea states is negligible which indicates that the irregular waves and vessel motions have little effect on the buffer miner slant range credit authorship contribution statement qi wu conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft

20793,in the present study the stress concentration factors scfs in circular hollow section x connections retrofitted with fiber reinforced polymer frp under compressive load are evaluated after validation of the fe model with several available experimental data a set of 279 fe models was created to parametrically investigates the efficacy of the frp and connection geometry on the scfs and scf ratios in the fe models the contact between the frp layers and steel members chord weld and braces was modeled results showed that the rise of the frp sheet number causes a considerable drop in the scfs moreover the use of frp causes the propagation of stresses in steel and frp moreover the rise of the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers causes the more drop in the scfs despite the notable efficacy of the frp on the drop of the scfs in the x joints there is not any study or formula in x connections with frp hence the fe results were used to propose two precise formulas for quantifying the scfs in x connections with frp layers at the saddle and crown points also the proposed equations were checked according to the uk doe acceptance standard keywords scf x connection frp

wind gholizad et al 2012 these platforms are generally welded with numerous circular tube structures among them the weld points have a critical role in the platform tang et al 2015 for example the weld and complex geometry in the connections of these platforms usually results in high stress concentration nie et al 2018 due to this reason the investigation of the stress concentration factors scfs in tubular joints is necessary chang and dover 1999 established some equations for determining the scfs in unreinforced x connections liu et al 2016 indicated that the hotspot points of dx

indicated that the tubular joints need to be reinforced to ensure enough fatigue life for offshore platforms qian et al 2014 revealed that the reinforcing of the chord by the ultra high capacity

numerically evaluated the scfs in circular hollow section chs k connections with cfrp in axial load also they proposed some formulas for predicting the scfs hosseini et al 2019 2020 evaluated the scfs in t joints with frp in basic loads nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 evaluated the efficacy of the frp layer number on the scfs in t y joint with gfrp in compression bharti et al 2020 reveal that the frp layers can notably reduce the scfs in t connections in compressive load also aguilera e al 2013 lesani et al 2013 and qiu et al 2017 indicated the use of frp causes to a notable increase of the ultimate capacity in this research work the effect of the frp layer number orientation and material and joint geometry β γ τ on the scfs in tubular x connections retrofitted with frp under brace compressive load fig 1 are investigated because 1 there was not available any study or formula on the x connections with frp 2 frp could notably reduce the scfs in tubular x connections 3 previous research works conducted on the scfs in tubular joints with frp tong et al 2019 xu et al 2020 showed that the scfs for the compressive load are generally bigger than the corresponding values for the tensile load 4 it can be applied for strengthening tubular connections in the structures during both fabrication and service consequently there was a necessary demand for further investigations so that comprehensive guidelines on scf assessment in the x connections retrofitted with frp under compression can be formulated in this study in the first step a fe model is introduced and verified by the experimental tests carried out by swensson et al 1986 ma 1988 dijkstra and deback 1980 tong et al 2019 and hosseini et al 2020 in the next step 279 fe models are generated fig 1 22 of these 279 fe models which are unreinforced x connections are compared with the predictions of formulas of the efthymiou 1999 uk health and safety executive 1997 chang and dover 1999 and api rp2a 2007 after that using these 279 fe models the effect of the frp layer number orientation and material and the connection geometry β γ and τ is investigated on the scfs in the x connections finally two formulas are derived for the predicting of the scfs in x connections retrofitted with the frp at the saddle and crown points applicability of the presented formulas is checked according to the uk department of energy 1983 criteria 2 fe modeling the details of the weld profile as reported by the american welding society aws 2002 are presented in fig 2 and table 1 because of the intricate shape of the brace chord intersecting curve it is very hard to exactly model the weld profile hence a few simplifying techniques provided by lee 1993 and chiew et al 1999 were used to model an adequately accurate weld profile for the meshing of the frp layers the shell 281 was utilized the shell 281 element has eight nodes having six degrees of freedom every node also for the meshing of the chord braces and weld the element types solid186 was used the solid186 element has by 20 nodes having three degrees of freedom each node a meshed frp strengthened tubular x connection is showed in fig 3 moreover fig 4 shows the number and order of frp layers in the layup and the orientation because of the symmetry in the geometry of the connections and loading conditions only one eighth of the x joints were generated moreover for the boundary condition of two chord ends both of them were free in the present study for defining the contact which happens between the down faces of the frp sheets and the external faces of the chord braces and weld the ansys contact capability was utilized to model the interplay between them in problems involving contact between two boundaries one of them is usually defined to be to the contact surface and the other is the target surface in this research the outer surfaces of the members were selected as the contact surface and inner surfaces of the frp laminates were considered as the target surface also flexible to flexible surface to surface contact elements were used to simulate the interaction the behavior of the contact surface was defined to be always bonded contact was set to be detected on nodes normal to target moreover the type of the contact constraint was auto assembly detection the load step number for ramping was 1 the linearly static analysis is suitable for obtaining the scfs in chs connections ahmadi et al 2012 the hot spot introduces as the location along the toe of the weld where the extrapolated stress shows a peak amount jiang et al 2018 therefore as suggested by the api rp2a 2007 and international institute of welding iiw 2008 the stress perpendicular to the weld toe is selected to conduct the line extrapolation for calculating the hot spot stress hss the extrapolation region according to iiw 2008 is depicted in fig 5 the hss fig 6 can be determined by eq 1 jiang et al 2018 1 σ w 1 4 σ e 1 0 4 σ e 2 the σ e1 and σ e2 are the stresses at the interval of 0 4t and 1 4t from the weld toe severally the stress at an extrapolation point is calculated by 2 σ e σ n 1 σ n 2 σ 1 σ 2 δ σ 2 σ n 2 in eq 2 σ n 1 and σ n 2 are the nodal stresses at the instant near of the extrapolation point along the direction perpendicular to the weld toe σ 1 and σ 2 are the interval between the nodes and the weld toe δ for the first and second extrapolation points is equal to 0 4t and 1 4t respectively fig 6 the scf value can be calculated by 3 scf σ w σ n where σ n is the nominal stress σ n can be obtained by 4 σ n f π r 2 r t 2 where f is brace compressive load also r and t are the radius and thickness of the brace severally 3 verification as per the authors knowledge there is not available any experimental fe theoretical data on the x connections strengthened with frp due to this reason the results of the following experimental tests are used four unreinforced x joints under compression conducted by swensson et al 1986 ma 1988 dijkstra and deback 1980 three t connections strengthened with gfrp in compression carried out by hosseini et al 2020 and four k joints reinforced with cfrp under axial load performed by tong et al 2019 the geometrical parameters of the specimens are tabulated in table 2 table 3 presents the scfs in both crown and saddle points of the 11 tubular joints with and without with frp the comparison results indicate that a fine agreement is between the numerical results and the experimental data therefore the numerical model can well evaluate the scfs in the x joints retrofitted with frp in compression also in the parametric section of this paper the results of all un strengthened x connections will be compared with the predictions of formulas of efthymiou 1999 uk health and safety executive 1997 chang and dover 1999 and api rp2a 2007 4 parametric investigation 4 1 characteristics of the parametric investigation a total of 279 fe models was generated using the commercial software ansys v 19 to analyze the effect of the frp sheet number direction and material and joint s geometric parameters β γ and τ on the scfs and the scf ratios of retrofitted connections to the associated un retrofitted connections subjected to brace s compression in the generated 279 fe models the scfs and scf ratios in both the saddle and crown positions are investigated the fe models table 4 follow six various frp materials table 5 three various frp sheet number n 4 8 and 12 six various frp sheet orientations table 6 seven various γ proportions γ 12 16 20 24 28 30 and 32 seven various β proportions β 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 six various τ proportions τ 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 the frp layer length is equal to 12 dt nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 the weld properties are the same as the steel member properties such as research works gao et al 2007 ahmadi and zavvar 2015 bao et al 2019 the e and ν of steel members are equal to 207 gpa and 0 3 severally in the present parametric study 22 fe models of the total 279 fe models are unreinforced joints the scfs values of the 22 fe modes at both crown and saddle points are compared with the empirical formulas established by efthymiou 1999 uk health and safety executive 1997 chang and dover 1999 and api rp2a 2007 table 7 lists the fe results and the extracted values of the formulas the comparison shows that the fe results are reasonable 4 2 efficacy of γ and frp on the scfs this section investigates the effects of the γ cfrp layers carbon epoxy as 3501 and gfrp layers glass epoxy scotch ply 1002 on the scfs and the scf proportion of the retrofitted to the associated un retrofitted connection r frp scffrp scfun for this aim 42 fe models with three different values of the γ γ 16 20 and 24 two various values of the β β 0 3 and 0 5 three different values of the frp layer number n n 4 8 and 12 were generated and analyzed the properties of the two frp materials are listed in table 5 fig 7 shows the scfs at the crown position of the connections with two various values of the β results show that in all joints reinforced with cfrp or gfrp the rise of the γ causes the decrement of the scfs moreover the increase of cfrp or gfrp laminate number causes the notable drop in the scfs because the growth of the sheet number results in a redistribution of stresses in cfrp or gfrp sheets and metal substrate also the results show that the scfs in the joints with cfrp fig 7a and b are smaller than the scfs in the associated joints with gfrp fig 7c and d because the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers e 1 in cfrp is bigger than that in gfrp fig 8 indicates the scfs at the saddle points of the connections the comparison between figs 7 and 8 shows that the values of the scfs at the saddle points are considerably bigger than the associated values at the crown points hence in the frp retrofitted x connections under compression the saddle points are critical positions also fig 8 indicates that the increment of the γ causes the increment of the scfs at the saddle points in all the connections reinforced with cfrp or gfrp also the rise of the cfrp or gfrp layer number causes the notable decrement of the scfs to give an instance in a connection with τ 0 7 γ 16 β 0 5 fig 8b the rise of the cfrp layer number from 4 to 12 causes the reduction of the scf value from 13 68 to 9 47 also in the same joint with gfrp fig 8d the raise of the gfrp layer number from 4 to 12 causes the decrease of the scf value from 15 18 to 12 64 as a result both cfrp and gfrp are valuable techniques for decreasing of the scfs and increasing of the fatigue life in the x connections however the use of the cfrp because of the higher e 1 cause to the more decrease in the scfs fig 9 a d shows the scf ratios of the reinforced to the associated unreinforced connections the results present that the rise of the cfrp or gfrp layer number causes the considerable decrement of the scf ratios also this result is clearer in the joints with cfrp to give a sample in the connections with τ 0 7 γ 20 β 0 3 n 12 at the saddle point fig 9a the scf ratios in the connections with cfrp or gfrp are equal to 0 52 or 0 73 respectively moreover the efficacy of the frp on the decreasing of the scfs is more considerable at saddle points rather than the crown points for instance in the connections with gfrp γ 16 β 0 5 τ 0 7 n 8 fig 9b and d the scf ratios at the crown and saddle points are equal to 0 93 and 0 86 respectively also fig 9 indicates that the scf of a joint strengthened with cfrp or gfrp can be down to 42 or 63 of the scf of the associated un strengthened joint respectively hence both of the methods can notably improve the fatigue life of the x joints 4 3 efficacy of τ and frp on the scfs fig 10 shows the variations of the scfs at the saddle points because of the variations in the amount of τ and the number of the frp layers n in the connections with two various γ γ 12 and 32 the comparison among fig 10a d shows that in all joints with cfrp or gfrp the rise of the τ causes the notable growth of the scfs moreover fig 10 shows that the increase of the cfrp or gfrp layer number n causes the notable decrement of the scfs this conclusion is clearer in the retrofitted connections with big γ fig 10b also the scfs in the connections retrofitted with cfrp are smaller than the scfs in the related connections reinforced with gfrp for example when an unreinforced joint γ 12 τ 0 6 β 0 5 is reinforced with 12 cfrp layers fig 10a the scfs at the saddle point is decreased from 9 55 to 6 01 but when the unreinforced joint is reinforced with 12 gfrp layers fig 10c the scfs at the saddle point is decreased from 9 55 to 7 81 fig 11 shows the variation of the scf ratios r scf scffrp scfun at the saddle positions because of the variations in the value of τ and the number of the cfrp and gfrp sheets in the connections with small and big γ results show that the efficacy of the τ on the scf ratios is slight and it can be ignored also the increment of the frp layers causes the decrement of the scf ratios because the increase of the frp sheet number can lead to the change in the stiffness distribution along the brace chord intersection results show that the cfrp and gfrp layers can reduce the scfs up to 71 and 49 respectively 4 4 efficacy of the β and frp on the scfs the present section investigates the efficacy of the β and the frp layer number on the scfs and the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun for this aim 42 fe models with three various values of the β β 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 two different values of the τ τ 0 5 and 0 9 three different values of cfrp and gfrp layer numbers n n 4 8 and 12 are generated and analyzed fig 12 shows that the decrease of the β results in a notable growth of the scfs at the crown points of the joints with cfrp or gfrp this conclusion can be seen in all reinforced joints with small and large τ τ 0 5 and 0 9 in addition the use of the cfrp or gfrp layers can lead to the considerable decrement of the scfs since the increase of the cfrp and gfrp sheet number results in a redistribution of stresses in metal and frp also the use of the cfrp leads to a more drop in the scfs because the e 1 of the cfrp layers is bigger than the e 1 of the gfrp layers to give an example when an unreinforced joint γ 28 τ 0 9 β 0 2 is reinforced with eight cfrp layers fig 12b the scfs at the crown point is decreased from 5 94 to 3 79 but when the unreinforced joint is reinforced with eight gfrp layers fig 12d the scfs at the crown point is decreased from 5 94 to 4 72 unlike the efficacy of the β on the scfs in the crown points figs 12 fig 13 shows that the decrease of the β causes the remarkable drop in the scfs at the saddle points in the connections with cfrp or grrp in addition the results show that the rise of the cfrp or gfrp layer number causes the remarkable decrease of the scfs since the increment of the frp sheet number causes the redistribution of stresses in metal and frp to give an instance in the connections with τ 0 5 γ 28 and β 0 6 at the saddle point fig 13a the rise of the cfrp layer number from 4 to 12 leads to a decrease of the scfs from 15 07 to 6 95 also in the same joint geometry fig 13c the rise of the gfrp layer number from 4 to 12 causes a decrease of the scfs from 18 86 to 12 33 moreover it can be concluded that the influence of the cfrp layers on the decrement of the scfs is more than the efficacy of the gfrp layers on the drop in scfs fig 14 shows the scf ratios of the reinforced to the related unreinforced connections at the saddle points it shows that the scf ratios decrease with increasing the frp layer number moreover the results show that the increment of the β causes the notable decrement of the scf ratios in the cfrp reinforced connections with various τ values however this is clearer in the connections with smaller τ to give an example in the connections with τ 0 5 γ 28 n 4 fig 14a the increment of the β from 0 2 to 0 6 causes to the decrease of the scf ratios from 0 82 to 0 69 but in the same joints with τ 0 9 fig 14b the increment of the β from 0 2 to 0 6 results in a drop in the scf ratios from 0 75 to 0 70 in the gfrp retrofitted connections with mean τ fig 14a the efficacy of the β on the scf ratios is remarkable but in the gfrp retrofitted connections with large τ value fig 14b the change of the β on the scf ratios is very slight and it can be ignored 4 5 efficacy of the direction of the frp layers a set of 74 fe models was created to investigate the efficacy of the orientations of the frp laminates on the scfs for this aim the scfs and scf ratios in the connections with six various directions of the frp sheets table 6 two different β β 0 2 and 0 6 two different frp materials cfrp and gfrp and three different frp layer number n n 4 8 and 12 are studied figs 15 and 16 show the scfs at the crown and saddle positions respectively from figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the use of sketch 4 leads to a biggest scfs hence in all joints reinforced with cfrp or gfrp at both the crown and saddle points sketch 4 is the inappropriate choice for the wrapping of the x joints with frp also the scfs in the frp reinforced joints with sketch 5 and sketch 6 are close results show that at the crown points fig 15 the use of sketch 3 leads to a smallest scfs however in the reinforced joints with big cfrp layer numbers the difference among sketches 1 3 is slight and it can be ignored at the saddle points fig 16 sketch 2 leads to a more decrease of the scfs it should be noted that in the x joint under compressive load the saddle point is a critical position also the use of all frp layers with one direction sketch 3 and 4 is not reasonable because of peeling effect in the crown heel and toe positions hence sketch 2 is recommended for covering the steel members in all reinforced joints with six different cfrp or gfrp layer orientations the scfs in the retrofitted connections are smaller than the scf in the related un retrofitted joint fig 17 also in the same situations the comparison between the scfs in the connections with cfrp or gfrp shows that the use of the cfrp causes the more decrement of the scfs moreover the increment of the layer number causes the decrease of the scfs at both saddle and crown points in reinforced connections with different frp layer orientations 4 6 effect of frp materials ξ and number n on the scfs in this section the efficacy of frp material parameters on the scf ratios is investigated the scf ratios are studied in the connections with various geometrical details and frp layers to normalize the frp material specifications the shear and elastic modulus of the frp were divided by the shear and elastic modulus of the steel members respectively figs 18 and 19 show that a fixed correlation only observes between e 1 and scf ratios moreover the amount of the e 1 is notably bigger than the other material parameters of the frp see table 5 consequently e 1 can be taken as a representative specification for investigating the efficacy of frp materials on scf ratios fig 20 shows the influence of the frp materials ξ ξ e 1 e s on the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun and their interplay with the β and γ are investigated the material parameters of the frp are presented in table 5 also the elastic modulus of the steel is kept constant e s 207 gpa fig 20a and b shows the result for the joints with β 0 7 τ 1 γ 12 and 28 fig 20c and d presents the result for the connections with τ 0 8 γ 32 β 0 2 and 0 8 the results show that in the joints with different joint geometry the rise of the frp sheet number with all six different materials causes the considerable drop in the scf ratios because the rise of the frp layer number causes the redistribution of stresses in metal and frp this is more significant for the joints with more e 1 because the increase of the e 1 leads to a more its contribution to stiffness to give an instance in the connections with τ 0 8 γ 32 β 0 2 η 8 fig 20c the scf ratios for the joints with ge glass epoxy stock ply 1002 and cea carbon epoxy as 3501 are 0 72 and 0 49 respectively hence the rise of the ξ causes the significant decrease of the scf ratios also the results indicated that among the positions the maximum and minimum scfs happen in the joints reinforced with carbon epoxy t300 5208 and glass vinyl ester respectively eq 5 5 scfgv scfge scfse scfae scfcea scfcet 4 7 the effect of the frp on the von mises stress distributions fig 21 indicates the von mises stress propagation in the un retrofitted cfrp retrofitted and gfrp retrofitted joints with β 0 4 γ 20 τ 1 0 n 12 the results show the biggest scfs are happened in the connection junction besides the scfs at the saddle point are higher than other points moreover the scfs in the retrofitted connections fig 21b and c are notably smaller than the scfs in the associated un retrofitted connections fig 21a since the use of the frp sheets causes the propagation of stresses in frp and steel substrate in the connections retrofitted with gfrp and cfrp fig 21b and c the biggest scf is happened in the saddle points and its amount is 19 21 and 13 18 respectively hence the gfrp and cfrp could remarkably decrease the scfs because of its contribution to stiffness of the x connection 5 parametric design formula until now no formula has been proposed for predicting the scfs in x connections with frp therefore two design equations are proposed for determining the scfs at saddle and crown points in the x joints with frp in this research work by using the results of the present fe analyses and the statistical software package spss v22 following parametric formulas are proposed 6 scffrp crown 8 187n 0 295 γ 0 697 β 1 411 τ 0 856 ξ 0 155 0 001 141 956β 5 005γ r 2 0 951 7 scffrp saddle 10 446n 0 103 γ 0 726 β 0 205 τ 0 275 ξ 0 059 1 143 24 994β 1 463γ r 2 0 936 in eqs 6 and 7 the scffrp crown and scffrp saddle show the scf at the crown and saddle points in x connections with frp respectively also in these two equations n shows the frp layer number the frp layer orientation is according to fig 4 because as it is discussed in section 4 5 this layer orientation leads to a more decrease in the scf r 2 indicates the factor of determination its value for the derived formulas and fig 22 show that the derived formula can be safely used for producing valid results the validity ranges of dimensionless geometrical parameters and frp properties for the proposed formulas have been given in eq 8 8 12 γ 32 0 5 τ 1 0 0 2 β 0 8 4 n 12 0 14 ξ 0 87 the uk department of energy 1983 suggests the below assessment criteria in the assessment standard p r is the proportion of the predicted to the measured value if p r 0 8 5 and p r 1 0 25 the formula is confirmed if also p r 1 5 50 the equation is considered as commonly prudent if 5 p r 0 8 7 5 and or 25 p r 1 0 30 the formula is considered as borderline therefore more evaluation is necessary otherwise the proposed equation cannot be accepted because it is too optimistic it should be noted that bomel consulting engineers 1994 recommended that the necessity for connections with p r 1 0 can be eliminated in the evaluating of the equation evaluating eqs 6 and 7 according to the uk doe 1983 standard is listed in table 8 it can be seen that the equations need revision to revise the equations the scffrp crown and scffrp saddle values achieved from the equations were multiplied by a factor in such a way that resulted in scffrp crown and scffrp saddle values pass the uk doe 1983 acceptation standard the factors introduce by 9 design factor for eq 6 scffrp crown design scffrp crown 10 design factor for eq 7 scffrp saddle design scffrp saddle in eqs 9 and 10 the values of scfcfrp crown design and scfcfrp saddle design are expected to satisfy the uk doe 1983 standard and the values of scfcfrp crown eq 6 and scfcfrp saddle eq 7 are determined from eq 6 and eq 7 respectively multiple comparative analyses were conducted to calculate the optimum value of the design factors the following formulas are introduced for design purposes 11 scfcfrp crown design 1 073 scfcfrp crown scfcfrp saddle design 1 020 scfcfrp saddle 12 evaluation results for the modified equation based on the uk doe 1983 criteria are listed in table 8 6 conclusions a total of 279 fe models validated against experimental results was created to evaluate the scfs and the scf proportion in the x connections strengthened with frp in compressive load the following observations can be made validation of the present fe model with the experimental results of 11 tubular connections in compression showed that the present fe model can well predict the scfs in the x connections reinforced with frp under compression the increment of frp sheet number leads to a notable decrement of the scfs and scf ratios because the increment of the sheet number results in a redistribution of stresses in metal and frp among the frp material parameters e 1 has a higher contribution to capacity of the frp materials moreover the increment of the e 1 causes the decrement of the scfs the scf of a frp strengthened connection can be down to 29 of the scf of the associated un strengthened joint in the frp reinforced joints at the crown points the rise of γ causes the decrement of the scfs however the reinforced connections at the saddle points the rise of γ causes the growth of the scfs the rise of the τ causes the notable increment of the scfs but the efficacy of the τ on the scf ratios is slight and it can be ignored the decrease of the β results in a notable growth of the scfs at the crown points of the joints with frp also the decrement of the β leads to a remarkable decrease of the scfs at the saddle points in the retrofitted connections also the increment of the β causes the notable decrement of the scf ratios in the cfrp reinforced connections however the efficacy of the β on the scf ratios in the connections retrofitted with gfrp depends to the values of the τ two novel formulas were derived for obtaining the scfs in tubular x connections retrofitted with frp in compressive load the r 2 and satisfaction of acceptation standard proposed by the uk doe guaranty the precision of the presented formulas thus the equations can well be applied for obtaining the scf in the tubular connections in engineering works author contributions section hossein nassiraei

20793,in the present study the stress concentration factors scfs in circular hollow section x connections retrofitted with fiber reinforced polymer frp under compressive load are evaluated after validation of the fe model with several available experimental data a set of 279 fe models was created to parametrically investigates the efficacy of the frp and connection geometry on the scfs and scf ratios in the fe models the contact between the frp layers and steel members chord weld and braces was modeled results showed that the rise of the frp sheet number causes a considerable drop in the scfs moreover the use of frp causes the propagation of stresses in steel and frp moreover the rise of the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers causes the more drop in the scfs despite the notable efficacy of the frp on the drop of the scfs in the x joints there is not any study or formula in x connections with frp hence the fe results were used to propose two precise formulas for quantifying the scfs in x connections with frp layers at the saddle and crown points also the proposed equations were checked according to the uk doe acceptance standard keywords scf x connection frp parametric study parametric formulas 1 introduction during the use of offshore platforms their structures suffer from different damages under long term multiple environmental loads of current wave and wind gholizad et al 2012 these platforms are generally welded with numerous circular tube structures among them the weld points have a critical role in the platform tang et al 2015 for example the weld and complex geometry in the connections of these platforms usually results in high stress concentration nie et al 2018 due to this reason the investigation of the stress concentration factors scfs in tubular joints is necessary chang and dover 1999 established some equations for determining the scfs in unreinforced x connections liu et al 2016 indicated that the hotspot points of dx connections generally happen at the saddle point huang et al 2020 showed that diamond bird beak x connections are more possible to fatigue crack than square bird beak x joints n diaye et al 2009 indicated that the tubular joints need to be reinforced to ensure enough fatigue life for offshore platforms qian et al 2014 revealed that the reinforcing of the chord by the ultra high capacity concrete leads to a more change in the scfs near the weld toe of the chord in the circular hollow section chs x joints than those in the brace tong et al 2019 and xu et al 2020 experimentally and numerically evaluated the scfs in circular hollow section chs k connections with cfrp in axial load also they proposed some formulas for predicting the scfs hosseini et al 2019 2020 evaluated the scfs in t joints with frp in basic loads nassiraei and rezadoost 2020 evaluated the efficacy of the frp layer number on the scfs in t y joint with gfrp in compression bharti et al 2020 reveal that the frp layers can notably reduce the scfs in t connections in compressive load also aguilera e al 2013 lesani et al 2013 and qiu et al 2017 indicated the use of frp causes to a notable increase of the ultimate capacity in this research work the effect of the frp layer number orientation and material and joint geometry β γ τ on the scfs in tubular x connections retrofitted with frp under brace compressive load fig 1 are investigated because 1 there was not available any study or formula on the x connections with frp 2 frp could notably reduce the scfs in tubular x connections 3 previous research works conducted on the scfs in tubular joints with frp tong et al 2019 xu et al 2020 showed that the scfs for the compressive load are generally bigger than the corresponding values for the tensile load 4 it can be applied for strengthening tubular connections in the structures during both fabrication and service consequently there was a necessary demand for further investigations so that comprehensive guidelines on scf assessment in the x connections retrofitted with frp under compression can be formulated in this study in the first step a fe model is introduced and verified by the experimental tests carried out by swensson et al 1986 ma 1988 dijkstra and deback 1980 tong et al 2019 and hosseini et al 2020 in the next step 279 fe models are generated fig 1 22 of these 279 fe models which are unreinforced x connections are compared with the predictions of formulas of the efthymiou 1999 uk health and safety executive 1997 chang and dover 1999 and api rp2a 2007 after that using these 279 fe models the effect of the frp layer number orientation and material and the connection geometry β γ and τ is investigated on the scfs in the x connections finally two formulas are derived for the predicting of the scfs in x connections retrofitted with the frp at the saddle and crown points applicability of the presented formulas is checked according to the uk department of energy 1983 criteria 2 fe modeling the details of the weld profile as reported by the american welding society aws 2002 are presented in fig 2 and table 1 because of the intricate shape of the brace chord intersecting curve it is very hard to exactly model the weld profile hence a few simplifying techniques provided by lee 1993 and chiew et al 1999 were used to model an adequately accurate weld profile for the meshing of the frp layers the shell 281 was utilized the shell 281 element has eight nodes having six degrees of freedom every node also for the meshing of the chord braces and weld the element types solid186 was used the solid186 element has by 20 nodes having three degrees of freedom each node a meshed frp strengthened tubular x connection is showed in fig 3 moreover fig 4 shows the number and order of frp layers in the layup and the orientation because of the symmetry in the geometry of the connections and loading conditions only one eighth of the x joints were generated moreover for the boundary condition of two chord ends both of them were free in the present study for defining the contact which happens between the down faces of the frp sheets and the external faces of the chord braces and weld the ansys contact capability was utilized to model the interplay between them in problems involving contact between two boundaries one of them is usually defined to be to the contact surface and the other is the target surface in this research the outer surfaces of the members were selected as the contact surface and inner surfaces of the frp laminates were considered as the target surface also flexible to flexible surface to surface contact elements were used to simulate the interaction the behavior of the contact surface was defined to be always bonded contact was set to be detected on nodes normal to target moreover the type of the contact constraint was auto assembly detection the load step number for ramping was 1 the linearly static analysis is suitable for obtaining the scfs in chs connections ahmadi et al 2012 the hot spot introduces as the location along the toe of the weld where the extrapolated stress shows a peak amount jiang et al 2018 therefore as suggested by the api rp2a 2007 and international institute of welding iiw 2008 the stress perpendicular to the weld toe is selected to conduct the line extrapolation for calculating the hot spot stress hss the extrapolation region according to iiw 2008 is depicted in fig 5 the hss fig 6 can be determined by eq 1 jiang et al 2018 1 σ w 1 4 σ e 1 0 4 σ e 2 the σ e1 and σ e2 are the stresses at the interval of 0 4t and 1 4t from the weld toe severally the stress at an extrapolation point is calculated by 2 σ e σ n 1 σ n 2 σ 1 σ 2 δ σ 2 σ n 2 in eq 2 σ n 1 and σ n 2 are the nodal stresses at the instant near of the extrapolation point along the direction perpendicular to the weld toe σ 1 and σ 2 are the interval between the nodes and the weld toe δ for the first and second extrapolation points is equal to 0 4t and 1 4t respectively fig 6 the scf value can be calculated by 3 scf σ w σ n where σ n is the nominal stress σ n can be obtained by 4 σ n f π r 2 r t 2 where f is brace compressive load also r and t are the radius and thickness of the brace severally 3 verification as per the authors knowledge there is not available any experimental fe theoretical data on the x connections strengthened with frp due to this reason the results of the following experimental tests are used four unreinforced x joints under compression conducted by swensson et al 1986 ma 1988 dijkstra and deback 1980 three t connections strengthened with gfrp in compression carried out by hosseini et al 2020 and four k joints reinforced with cfrp under axial load performed by tong et al 2019 the geometrical parameters of the specimens are tabulated in table 2 table 3 presents the scfs in both crown and saddle points of the 11 tubular joints with and without with frp the comparison results indicate that a fine agreement is between the numerical results and the experimental data therefore the numerical model can well evaluate the scfs in the x joints retrofitted with frp in compression also in the parametric section of this paper the results of all un strengthened x connections will be compared with the predictions of formulas of efthymiou 1999 uk health and safety executive 1997 chang and dover 1999 and api rp2a 2007 4 parametric investigation 4 1 characteristics of the parametric investigation a total of 279 fe models was generated using the commercial software ansys v 19 to analyze the effect of the frp sheet number direction and material and joint s geometric parameters β γ and τ on the scfs and the scf ratios of retrofitted connections to the associated un retrofitted connections subjected to brace s compression in the generated 279 fe models the scfs and scf ratios in both the saddle and crown positions are investigated the fe models table 4 follow six various frp materials table 5 three various frp sheet number n 4 8 and 12 six various frp sheet orientations table 6 seven various γ proportions γ 12 16 20 24 28 30 and 32 seven

are the same as the steel member properties such as research works gao et al 2007 ahmadi and zavvar 2015 bao et al 2019 the e and ν of steel members are equal to 207 gpa and 0 3 severally in the present parametric study 22 fe models of the total 279 fe models are unreinforced joints the scfs values of the 22 fe modes at both crown and saddle points are compared with the empirical formulas established by efthymiou 1999 uk health and safety executive 1997 chang and dover 1999 and api rp2a 2007 table 7 lists the fe results and the extracted values of the formulas the comparison shows that the fe results are reasonable 4 2 efficacy of γ and frp on the scfs this section investigates the effects of the γ cfrp layers carbon epoxy as 3501 and gfrp layers glass epoxy scotch ply 1002 on the scfs and the scf proportion of the retrofitted to the associated un retrofitted connection r frp scffrp scfun for this aim 42 fe models with three different values of the γ γ 16 20 and 24 two various values of the β β 0 3 and 0 5 three different values of the frp layer number n n 4 8 and 12 were generated and analyzed the properties of the two frp materials are listed in table 5 fig 7 shows the scfs at the crown position of the connections with two various values of the β results show that in all joints reinforced with cfrp or gfrp the rise of the γ causes the decrement of the scfs moreover the increase of cfrp or gfrp laminate number causes the notable drop in the scfs because the growth of the sheet number results in a redistribution of stresses in cfrp or gfrp sheets and metal substrate also the results show that the scfs in the joints with cfrp fig 7a and b are smaller than the scfs in the associated joints with gfrp fig 7c and d because the elastic modulus of frp along the fibers e 1 in cfrp is bigger than that in gfrp fig 8 indicates the scfs at the saddle points of the connections the comparison between figs 7 and 8 shows that the values of the scfs at the saddle points are considerably bigger than the associated values at the crown points hence in the frp retrofitted x connections under compression the saddle points are critical positions also fig 8 indicates that the increment of the γ causes the increment of the scfs at the saddle points in all the connections reinforced with cfrp or gfrp also the rise of the cfrp or gfrp layer number causes the notable decrement of the scfs to give an instance in a connection with τ 0 7 γ 16 β 0 5 fig 8b the rise of the cfrp layer number from 4 to 12 causes the reduction of the scf value from 13 68 to 9 47 also in the same joint with gfrp fig 8d the raise of the gfrp layer number from 4 to 12 causes the decrease of the scf value from 15 18 to 12 64 as a result both cfrp and gfrp are valuable techniques for decreasing of the scfs and increasing of the fatigue life in the x connections however the use of the cfrp because of the higher e 1 cause to the more decrease in the scfs fig 9 a d shows the scf ratios of the reinforced to the associated unreinforced connections the results present that the rise of the cfrp or gfrp layer number causes the considerable decrement of the scf ratios also this result is clearer in the joints with cfrp to give a sample in the connections with τ 0 7 γ 20 β 0 3 n 12 at the saddle point fig 9a the scf ratios in the connections with cfrp or gfrp are equal to 0 52 or 0 73 respectively moreover the efficacy of the frp on the decreasing of the scfs is more considerable at saddle points rather than the crown points for instance in the connections with gfrp γ 16 β 0 5 τ 0 7 n 8 fig 9b and d the scf ratios at the crown and saddle points are equal to 0 93 and 0 86 respectively also fig 9 indicates that the scf of a joint strengthened with cfrp or gfrp can be down to 42 or 63 of the scf of the associated un strengthened joint respectively hence both of the methods can notably improve the fatigue life of the x joints 4 3 efficacy of τ and frp on the scfs fig 10 shows the variations of the scfs at the saddle points because of the variations in the amount of τ and the number of the frp layers n in the connections with two various γ γ 12 and 32 the comparison among fig 10a d shows that in all joints with cfrp or gfrp the rise of the τ causes the notable growth of the scfs moreover fig 10 shows that the increase of the cfrp or gfrp layer number n causes the notable decrement of the scfs this conclusion is clearer in the retrofitted connections with big γ fig 10b also the scfs in the connections retrofitted with cfrp are smaller than the scfs in the related connections reinforced with gfrp for example when an unreinforced joint γ 12 τ 0 6 β 0 5 is reinforced with 12 cfrp layers fig 10a the scfs at the saddle point is decreased from 9 55 to 6 01 but when the unreinforced joint is reinforced with 12 gfrp layers fig 10c the scfs at the saddle point is decreased from 9 55 to 7 81 fig 11 shows the variation of the scf ratios r scf scffrp scfun at the saddle positions because of the variations in the value of τ and the number of the cfrp and gfrp sheets in the connections with small and big γ results show that the efficacy of the τ on the scf ratios is slight and it can be ignored also the increment of the frp layers causes the decrement of the scf ratios because the increase of the frp sheet number can lead to the change in the stiffness distribution along the brace chord intersection results show that the cfrp and gfrp layers can reduce the scfs up to 71 and 49 respectively 4 4 efficacy of the β and frp on the scfs the present section investigates the efficacy of the β and the frp layer number on the scfs and the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun for this aim 42 fe models with three various values of the β β 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 two different values of the τ τ 0 5 and 0 9 three different values of cfrp and gfrp layer numbers n n 4 8 and 12 are generated and analyzed fig 12 shows that the decrease of the β results in a notable growth of the scfs at the crown points of the joints with cfrp or gfrp this conclusion can be seen in all reinforced joints with small and large τ τ 0 5 and 0 9 in addition the use of the cfrp or gfrp layers can lead to the considerable decrement of the scfs since the increase of the cfrp and gfrp sheet number results in a redistribution of stresses in metal and frp also the use of the cfrp leads to a more drop in the scfs because the e 1 of the cfrp layers is bigger than the e 1 of the gfrp layers to give an example when an unreinforced joint γ 28 τ 0 9 β 0 2 is reinforced with eight cfrp layers fig 12b the scfs at the crown point is decreased from 5 94 to 3 79 but when the unreinforced joint is reinforced with eight gfrp layers fig 12d the scfs at the crown point is decreased from 5 94 to 4 72 unlike the efficacy of the β on the scfs in the crown points figs 12 fig 13 shows that the decrease of the β causes the remarkable drop in the scfs at the saddle points in the connections with cfrp or grrp in addition the results show that the rise of the cfrp or gfrp layer number causes the remarkable decrease of the scfs since the increment of the frp sheet number causes the redistribution of stresses in metal and frp to give an instance in the connections with τ 0 5 γ 28 and β 0 6 at the saddle point fig 13a the rise of the cfrp layer number from 4 to 12 leads to a decrease of the scfs from 15 07 to 6 95 also in the same joint geometry fig 13c the rise of the gfrp layer number from 4 to 12 causes a decrease of the scfs from 18 86 to 12 33 moreover it can be concluded that the influence of the cfrp layers on the decrement of the scfs is more than the efficacy of the gfrp layers on the drop in scfs fig 14 shows the scf ratios of the reinforced to the related unreinforced connections at the saddle points it shows that the scf ratios decrease with increasing the frp layer number moreover the results show that the increment of the β causes the notable decrement of the scf ratios in the cfrp reinforced connections with various τ values however this is clearer in the connections with smaller τ to give an example in the connections with τ 0 5 γ 28 n 4 fig 14a the increment of the β from 0 2 to 0 6 causes to the decrease of the scf ratios from 0 82 to 0 69 but in the same joints with τ 0 9 fig 14b the increment of the β from 0 2 to 0 6 results in a drop in the scf ratios from 0 75 to 0 70 in the gfrp retrofitted connections with mean τ fig 14a the efficacy of the β on the scf ratios is remarkable but in the gfrp retrofitted connections with large τ value fig 14b the change of the β on the scf ratios is very slight and it can be ignored 4 5 efficacy of the direction of the frp layers a set of 74 fe models was created to investigate the efficacy of the orientations of the frp laminates on the scfs for this aim the scfs and scf ratios in the connections with six various directions of the frp sheets table 6 two different β β 0 2 and 0 6 two different frp materials cfrp and gfrp and three different frp layer number n n 4 8 and 12 are studied figs 15 and 16 show the scfs at the crown and saddle positions respectively from figs 15 and 16 it can be seen that the use of sketch 4 leads to a biggest scfs hence in all joints reinforced with cfrp or gfrp at both the crown and saddle points sketch 4 is the inappropriate choice for the wrapping of the x joints with frp also the scfs in the frp reinforced joints with sketch 5 and sketch 6 are close results show that at the crown points fig 15 the use of sketch 3 leads to a smallest scfs however in the reinforced joints with big cfrp layer numbers the difference among sketches 1 3 is slight and it can be ignored at the saddle points fig 16 sketch 2 leads to a more decrease of the scfs it should be noted that in the x joint under compressive load the saddle point is a critical position also the use of all frp layers with one direction sketch 3 and 4 is not reasonable because of peeling effect in the crown heel and toe positions hence sketch 2 is recommended for covering the steel members in all reinforced joints with six different cfrp or gfrp layer orientations the scfs in the retrofitted connections are smaller than the scf in the related un retrofitted joint fig 17 also in the same situations the comparison between the scfs in the connections with cfrp or gfrp shows that the use of the cfrp causes the more decrement of the scfs moreover the increment of the layer number causes the decrease of the scfs at both saddle and crown points in reinforced connections with different frp layer orientations 4 6 effect of frp materials ξ and number n on the scfs in this section the efficacy of frp material parameters on the scf ratios is investigated the scf ratios are studied in the connections with various geometrical details and frp layers to normalize the frp material specifications the shear and elastic modulus of the frp were divided by the shear and elastic modulus of the steel members respectively figs 18 and 19 show that a fixed correlation only observes between e 1 and scf ratios moreover the amount of the e 1 is notably bigger than the other material parameters of the frp see table 5 consequently e 1 can be taken as a representative specification for investigating the efficacy of frp materials on scf ratios fig 20 shows the influence of the frp materials ξ ξ e 1 e s on the scf ratios r frp scffrp scfun and their interplay with the β and γ are investigated the material parameters of the frp are presented in table 5 also the elastic modulus of the steel is kept constant e s 207 gpa fig 20a and b shows the result for the joints with β 0 7 τ 1 γ 12 and 28 fig 20c and d presents the result for the connections with τ 0 8 γ 32 β 0 2 and 0 8 the results show that in the joints with different joint geometry the rise of the frp sheet number with all six different materials causes the considerable drop in the scf ratios because the rise of the frp layer number causes the redistribution of stresses in metal and frp this is more significant for the joints with more e 1 because the increase of the e 1 leads to a more its contribution to stiffness to give an instance in the connections with τ 0 8 γ 32 β 0 2 η 8 fig 20c the scf ratios for the joints with ge glass epoxy stock ply 1002 and cea carbon epoxy as 3501 are 0 72 and 0 49 respectively hence the rise of the ξ causes the significant decrease of the scf ratios also the results indicated that among the positions the maximum and minimum scfs happen in the joints reinforced with carbon epoxy t300 5208 and glass vinyl ester respectively eq 5 5 scfgv scfge scfse scfae scfcea scfcet 4 7 the effect of the frp on the von mises stress distributions fig 21 indicates the von mises stress propagation in the un retrofitted cfrp retrofitted and gfrp retrofitted joints with β 0 4 γ 20 τ 1 0 n 12 the results show the biggest scfs are happened in the connection junction besides the scfs at the saddle point are higher than other points moreover the scfs in the retrofitted connections fig 21b and c are notably smaller than the scfs in the associated un retrofitted connections fig 21a since the use of the frp sheets causes the propagation of stresses in frp and steel substrate in the connections retrofitted with gfrp and cfrp fig 21b and c the biggest scf is happened in the saddle points and its amount is 19 21 and 13 18 respectively hence the gfrp and cfrp could remarkably decrease the scfs because of its contribution to stiffness of the x connection 5 parametric design formula until now no formula has been proposed for predicting the scfs in x connections with frp therefore two design equations are proposed for determining the scfs at saddle and crown points in the x joints with frp in this research work by using the results of the present fe analyses and the statistical software package spss v22 following parametric formulas are proposed 6 scffrp crown 8 187n 0 295 γ 0 697 β 1 411 τ 0 856 ξ 0 155 0 001 141 956β 5 005γ r 2 0 951 7 scffrp saddle 10 446n 0 103 γ 0 726 β 0 205 τ 0 275 ξ 0 059 1 143 24 994β 1 463γ r 2 0 936 in eqs 6 and 7 the scffrp crown and scffrp saddle show the scf at the crown and saddle points in x connections with frp respectively also in these two equations n shows the frp layer number the frp layer orientation is according to fig 4 because as it is discussed in section 4 5 this layer orientation leads to a more decrease in the scf r 2 indicates the factor of determination its value for the derived formulas and fig 22 show that the derived formula can be safely used for producing valid results the validity ranges of dimensionless geometrical parameters and frp properties for the proposed formulas have been given in eq 8 8 12 γ 32 0 5 τ 1 0 0 2 β 0 8 4 n 12 0 14 ξ 0 87 the uk department of energy 1983 suggests the below assessment criteria in the assessment standard p r is the proportion of the predicted to the measured value if p r 0 8 5 and p r 1 0 25 the formula is confirmed if also p r 1 5 50 the equation is considered as commonly prudent if 5 p r 0 8 7 5 and or 25 p r 1 0 30 the formula is considered as borderline therefore more evaluation is necessary otherwise the proposed equation cannot be accepted because it is too optimistic it should be noted that bomel consulting engineers 1994 recommended that the necessity for connections with p r 1 0 can be eliminated in the evaluating of the equation evaluating eqs 6 and 7 according to the uk doe 1983 standard is listed in table 8 it can be seen that the equations need revision to revise the equations the scffrp crown and scffrp saddle values achieved from the equations were multiplied by a factor in such a way that resulted in scffrp crown and scffrp saddle values pass the uk doe 1983 acceptation standard the factors introduce by 9 design factor for eq 6 scffrp crown design scffrp crown 10 design factor for eq 7 scffrp saddle design scffrp saddle in eqs 9 and 10 the values of scfcfrp crown design and scfcfrp saddle design are expected to satisfy the uk doe 1983 standard and the values of scfcfrp crown eq 6 and scfcfrp saddle eq 7 are determined from eq 6 and eq 7 respectively multiple comparative analyses were conducted to calculate the optimum value of the design factors the following formulas are introduced for design purposes 11 scfcfrp crown design 1 073 scfcfrp crown scfcfrp saddle design 1 020 scfcfrp saddle 12 evaluation results for the modified equation based on the uk doe 1983 criteria are listed in table 8 6 conclusions a total of 279 fe models validated against experimental results was created to evaluate the scfs and the scf proportion in the x connections strengthened with frp in compressive load the following observations can be made validation of the present fe model with the experimental results of 11 tubular connections in compression showed that the present fe model can well predict the scfs in the x connections reinforced with frp under compression the increment of frp sheet number leads to a notable decrement of the scfs and scf ratios because the increment of the sheet number results in a redistribution of stresses in metal and frp among the frp material parameters e 1 has a higher contribution to capacity of the frp materials moreover the increment of the e 1 causes the decrement of the scfs the scf of a frp strengthened connection can be down to 29 of the scf of the associated un strengthened joint in the frp reinforced joints at the crown points the rise of γ causes the decrement of the scfs however the reinforced connections at the saddle points the rise of γ causes the growth of the scfs the rise of the τ causes the notable increment of the scfs but the efficacy of the τ on the scf ratios is slight and it can be ignored the decrease of the β results in a notable growth of the scfs at the crown points of the joints with frp also the decrement of the β leads to a remarkable decrease of the scfs at the saddle points in the retrofitted connections also the increment of the β causes the notable decrement of the scf ratios in the cfrp reinforced connections however the efficacy of the β on the scf ratios in the connections retrofitted with gfrp depends to the values of the τ two novel formulas were derived for obtaining the scfs in tubular x connections retrofitted with frp in compressive load the r 2 and satisfaction of acceptation standard proposed by the uk doe guaranty the precision of the presented formulas thus the equations can well be applied for obtaining the scf in the tubular connections in engineering works author contributions section hossein nassiraei

20794,the analysis of ocean surface waves is essential to ensure safe navigation since 2010 different on board observation data from bulk carriers including those navigating high risk shipping regions in the southern hemisphere with strong ocean currents have been collected for 6 years high resolution numerical simulations of ocean waves for four rough sea cases considering the effect of wave current interaction on ship navigation have been performed using the wavewatch iii model the simulations considered the ocean surface wind force from the widely used reanalysis database of the national centers for environmental prediction final and european center for medium range weather forecasts interim reanalysis to provide practical suggestions for safe navigation by avoiding possible high risk ocean regions and construct a more effective and efficient optimum ship routing system the model results were validated based on on board observations followed by discussions on the responses of ship motion and navigation to sea states at different levels finally early warning criteria including various operational ocean parameters for ballast and loaded ships sailing in rough seas were identified keywords ship responses rough seas wave simulation shipboard measurements ncep fnl era interim 1 introduction according to the international maritime organization s technical cooperation programme marine transportation delivers 80 90 of global trade products making it an important aspect of international commerce the increase in ship size and the number of shipping activities have increased the risk of ship accidents and the potential harm to life and property moreover ocean pollution has increased accordingly from the viewpoint of ship weather routing the accurate forecast of rough ocean surface sea states and the effects of waves on ship navigation is essential to the safe economical and environment friendly ship navigation many researchers have employed both the statistical analysis of ship accident databases and sea state hindcasts to determine the relationship between sea states and ship safety as well as formulate a set of warning criteria to identify adequate warning criteria for safe navigation toffoli et al 2005 studied the sea state parameters and ship characteristics from 270 ship accidents attributed to bad weather in their analysis on critical aspects they provided statistical conclusions about sea state parameters such as significant wave height wave steepness cross seas and rapid sea state development however they argued that due to the coarse resolution of the wave model the sea states were apparently underestimated especially for strong tropical storms and wave current interaction effects besides the information on the exact time and ship characteristics of each accident was not available thus restricting the details and accuracy of the discussion the review study of niclasen et al 2010 on wave forecasts and small sea vessels focused on sea state parameters that are important for the safety of these vessels they attempted to determine the high risk situations that were not resolved by considering the traditional wave parameters such as wave height wave period and direction they found that combining the wave height and steepness or calculating the risk of synchronous waves was useful for small vessels and that wave dissipation could be used to highlight potentially dangerous seas despite the dearth of complete physics further they argued that the statistical predictions of dangerous waves were possible however the level of risk was highly dependent on the vessel size ship stability properties ship heading and ship speed based on the ship accident statistics they concluded that moderate seas that rapidly developed and seas whose waves were more severe than the average waves generated by the local climate were closely related to the higher risk of ship accidents according to zhang and li 2017 complex sea states with the co occurrence of wind sea waves and swell conditions represent threats to sailing vessels especially when these conditions include similar wave periods and oblique wave directions they performed two case studies whose results were in good agreement with the general conditions leading to the possible occurrence of dangerous waves based on statistical analyses however the detailed relationship between rough seas and ship navigation conditions was not derived because of the lack of necessary ship information the statistical analysis of sea states and related ship accidents from the database can be used as a basis for issuing notifications regarding the most dangerous sea parameters associated with different ship accidents however due to the lack of detailed information on ship motion and dimensions on each accident the sea states were underestimated because of the coarse resolution of the meteorological databases used cavaleri and bertotti 2006 moreover the possible underestimation of wave steepness resulted from the lack of consideration of wave current interaction as pointed out by rapizo et al 2018 who conducted a qualitative analysis using high resolution currents in a fine grid nested in the coarser global grid their results showed that the typical resolution of global hydrodynamic reanalysis was insufficient to resolve mesoscale eddies consequently the simulation of mesoscale wave patterns can be compromised other studies related to the foregoing were also implemented cavaleri 2009 gramcianinov et al 2020 rogers et al 2012a therefore despite the considerable contributions of the aforementioned researchers to provide worthy information and suggestions to ship operators their conclusions should be further validated using on board observations and higher resolution information on sea states toffoli et al 2005 as a continuation of previous studies focusing on the wave modeling of high wind seas during typhoon periods chen et al 2013 2015 and the study on wave current interactions considering the kuroshio current in the east china sea chen 2018 the present study further analyzes the relationship between sea states and ship navigational responses using ship board observation data obtained from a bulk carrier the study employs both high resolution numerical wave modeling and detailed on board observations of ship motion affected by rough weather conditions it aims to provide ship operators practical suggestions for safe navigation by identifying the high risk sea states and a few possible warning criteria especially for rough sea navigation additionally it should be noticed here that with such on board observation for continuous days during practical operations the ship can be treated as a wave buoy iseki and ohtsu 2000 nielsen 2006 and also able to provide important information for guidance and decision support as well as serve as black box when ship accidents occurred to determine the relationship between sea states and ship responses in actual navigation the relationship between the important sea state parameters navigational parameters and effects of ship responses to sea states has been analyzed additionally several ship responses in practical navigations to sea states of different levels are also considered as warning criteria that quantitatively exhibit the relationship between ship navigational parameters and ocean parameters these provide practical suggestions for a safer marine navigation this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the on board observation facility and brief information on data collection are presented the numerical wave simulations are described in section 3 the validation of model results with observations are presented in section 4 the relationship between sea states and ship navigation safety is explicated in section 5 the conclusions of this study and suggestions for future studies are summarized in section 6 2 on board observations for this study an on board observation of weather and ship motion using a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier was conducted from 2010 to 2016 covering high risk shipping regions in the southern hemisphere the length of the ship i e length between perpendiculars lpp and width are 160 4 and 27 2 m respectively with a draft of 9 82 m when fully loaded as listed in table 1 the routes of the ship mainly cover the oceans between asian countries and areas of the southern hemisphere such as oceania and south america where sea states are generally rougher than those in the northern hemisphere owing to strong swells the ship has a limited ability to avoid rough sea states because of its low operational speed of approximately 12 kn which negatively influences its safety and efficiency to clearly understand the relationship between sea state parameters and rough sea navigation four observation cases with sufficient temporal and spatial variability covering high risk shipping regions in the southern hemisphere are selected from the experiment period for analysis in case 1 the crew practically lost control of the ship as recorded in the logbook information on navigation time ship location and ship loading condition in each case is summarized in table 2 the colored rectangles in fig 1 indicate all the ocean regions set for the high resolution wave model simulation for the four cases toffoli et al 2003 proposed a map of ship accidents worldwide 1995 1999 caused by severe weather the map is derived from the lmis casualty database as given in fig 2 peter kjeldsen 2004 identified 21 ocean areas where atypical waves occur causing ship accidents as shown in fig 3 a comparison of these three figures illustrates the high navigational risk in the four selected rough sea navigation cases especially in the locations marked 12 13 and 18 in fig 3 which show a higher risk of experiencing aberrant waves in addition according to cattrell et al 2018 the frequency of occurrence of these waves as well as their generating mechanism are not spatially uniform and the locations are likely to exhibit unique sensitivities thus the atypical waves occurring in ocean regions with different characteristics can be attributed to different reasons such as the opposite current effects in the kuroshio region the swell and wind sea interactions in the southern hemisphere and the severe storms in the tropical regions accordingly the detailed on board observations and the high resolution wave model simulation are used here to conduct a clear investigation the case measurements mainly include navigational parameters such as weather data wind speed wind direction etc engine data engine revolution engine power fuel oil consumption and exhaust gas temperatures on all six cylinders of the main engine voyage data ship speed ship position ship course loading condition etc and ship motion data pitch roll and yaw additional details on instrument observations and the measurement parameters are provided by sasa et al 2015 other representative studies related to both dynamic ocean environment and on board measurements can be found in vettor and guedes soares 2016 2018 to obtain detailed ship information for implementing an accurate analysis the ship motion data were treated as significant values meaning the average of values of the one third highest values and are generated using the zero upcrossing method for a 10 min time series with an interval of 0 1 s all other parameters were the averaged values in the course of a 10 min time series obtained every 1 s with details given in sasa et al 2015 3 numerical simulations 3 1 model descriptions as a third generation phase averaged wave model wavewatch iii ww3 model version 4 18 booij and holthuijsen 1987 tolman 1989 2014 has been used for the hindcast wave simulations for all the four cases with the implicit assumption that the random phase spectral action density balance equation applies because the properties of the medium water depth and current and the wave field itself vary with time and space scales that are considerably larger than the variation scales of a single wave the wavewatchiii model can solve the wavenumber direction spectra by explicitly parameterizing all physical processes such as wind input growth actions nonlinear resonant wave wave interactions wave bottom interaction and whitecap dissipation the spectrum action balance equation can be solved as follows tolman 2014 1 n t x c g u n k k ˆ n θ θ ˆ n s σ 2 k ˆ σ d d s k u s 3 θ ˆ 1 k σ d d m k u m where n is the wave spectral density as a function of wavenumber c g is the wave group velocity u is the current velocity s is the coordinate in the direction of θ d is the mean water depth k is the wave number as a scalar k is the wavenumber vector m is the coordinate perpendicular to s s is the net source term for the spectrum and σ is the intrinsic wave radian frequency in this study s was determined as the summation of the linear input s l n to provide a more realistic initial wave growth for the consistent spin up of the model under quiescent conditions cavaleri and malanotte rizzoli 1981 the wind input s i n and wave dissipation s d s tolman and chalikov 1996 were calculated by a non dimensional wind wave interaction parameter the nonlinear wave wave interaction s n l was obtained by the discrete interaction approximation hasselmann et al 1985 the wave bottom interaction s b o t hasselmann et al 1973 was calculated using the empirical linear joint north sea wave project parameterization for additional processes in shallow water areas high order conservative numerical schemes were used for spatial discretization and the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition for binding the discretization in time and space existed 3 2 model settings and input data a two way nesting method ww3 multi with horizontal resolutions of 0 5 and 0 1 for large global and inner nested local domains respectively was used considering the cfl condition the minimum wave propagation time steps were set to 330 and 300 s for the larger and inner domains respectively for all rough sea cases the wave model has a spectral resolution of 10 covering 36 directions the calculated wave frequencies were set starting from 0 0345 hz with a logarithmic frequency factor of 1 1 for 38 steps additionally a one month spin up before the ship motion analysis period had been run for all cases to initiate the model from a resting condition the outputs were obtained every 10 min to parallel the on board observation data to accurately simulate the ocean wave model a critical input is wind field forcing which generates a time varying map of wind speed and directions teixeira et al 1995 holthuijsen et al 1996 meanwhile wave model errors usually result from the errors in the wind field therefore as reported by previous studies tolman et al 2002 feng et al 2006 campos and guedes soares 2016 to reduce the model uncertainty originating from the sensitivity of the wind input the reanalysis databases i e national centers for environmental prediction final ncep fnl operation model global tropospheric analyses ncep f 2000 http rda ucar edu datasets ds083 2 ds083 2 doi 10 5065 d6m043c6 and european center for medium range weather forecasts interim reanalysis era interim davis et al 2008 had been utilized as input wind forces for the ocean wave generation the ncep fnl analyses provided a 1 1 grid covering the global region whereas the era interim provided a spatial resolution of approximately 80 km 0 75 both of these wind input sources were updated every 6 h a linear interpolation method was utilized for applying these two gpv database values i e 1 and 0 75 to wave modeling i e 0 5 and 0 1 to drive wavewatchiii using the gpv datasets the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock 2008 was used to generate the necessary near surface wind fields as a next generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications the wrf model has been widely employed for typhoon simulations and real time forecasting davis et al 2008 cha and wang 2013 as for the input and boundary condition data both ncep fnl and era interim were used for the generation of near surface winds the wrf model was run for the same time period as wavewatchiii with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and a 3 h time step for output the detailed configurations for the wrf model are summarized in table 3 to calculate the wave current interaction the ocean surface current analysis real time ocean current data which are generated by earth space research have been used for wave modeling bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the ocean current data on a 1 3 grid have also been interpolated into the 0 1 grid furthermore the wave ice interactions are calculated using the wavewatchiii model thus sea ice and icebergs have been included in the calculation for the four cases the sea ice coverage was calculated in the global domain using nimbus 7 scanning multichannel microwave radiometer defense meteorological satellite program s special sensor microwave imager and special sensor microwave imager sounder cavalieri et al 1996 4 model results and validations 4 1 distributions of ocean surface wind and waves by model simulations using the phase average wavewatchiii model the gridded fields of mean wave parameters such as the significant wave height directions and frequencies are obtained the detailed settings are provided in section 3 2 the surface wave distributions at the moment of maximum pitch motion of all rough sea cases are presented in fig 4 4 2 validations of simulation results with ship on board observations as mentioned in section 1 the observed wind speeds for all cases have been averaged for a 10 min time series obtained every 1 s for validation with the wrf results as shown in fig 5 generally the gpv wind data reasonably replicate the temporal variations of both wind direction and speed whereas the ncep data tend to perform better for the peak wind speed than the era interim the detailed evaluation and discussion of the model results versus on board observations are provided in a previous study conducted by chen et al 2020 instead of validation with reanalysis data which are based on model results the wave simulation are validated against observed ship motion chen et al 2020 5 relationship between sea state parameters and ship responses 5 1 sea states the correlations between the significant wave height representative of sea severity and other wave parameters generated by the ww3 model of all the rough sea cases are focused at first as shown in fig 6 the formulae used in the wave model for generating the wave parameters are also summarized in table 4 here the variance of surface elevation is e 0 2 π 0 f f r θ d f r d θ where σ 2 π f r is the intrinsic wave radian frequency and f f r θ is the frequency direction spectrum a 0 2 π 0 cos θ f σ θ d σ d θ and b 0 2 π 0 sin θ f σ θ d σ d θ it should be noted that the definition of wave steepness employed by toffoli et al 2005 is given as 2 π h m 0 g t m 10 2 the definition of h m 0 by toffoli et al 2005 also represents the significant wave height which is the definition of h s the definition of t m 10 by toffoli et al 2005 is the energy wave period given by t m 10 m 1 m 0 where m n is the nth order moment of the wave spectrum see wmo 1998 to improve the ship safety in rough seas and the efficacy of optimum ship routing in real scenarios different loading conditions should be considered here three different groups are presented half loaded cases 3 and 4 ballast cases 1 and 2 and total or whole cases cases 1 4 the numbers inside each panel indicate the correlation coefficients of the relevant two wave parameters a 10 min average representing a duration of approximately 20 day results in a total of approximately 3000 data points for these 4 cases covering high risk shipping regions in the southern hemisphere fig 1 and table 2 as shown in fig 6 regardless of the sea states encountered by the two different loading conditions the mean directional spread mds and wave steepness have small differences between the half loaded and ballast cases for instance with a negative correlation coefficient of 0 66 the mds is found to decrease as the significant wave height increases similarly toffoli et al 2005 found that an mds reduction was observed during the growth of sea state conditions for approximately 60 of the selected cases in their nalysis of the global ship accident as shown in fig 7 according to their results the magnitude of the mds decreases to 0 5 approximately 25 top left panel in fig 6 as the significant wave height increases the foregoing agrees with the results of the present study moreover the wave height has a strong positive correlation with a wave steepness of 0 85 the maximum wave steepness is 0 0342 in the present study according to the study of toffoli et al 2005 this indicates that the ship in rough seas approaches the accident limit they reported that more than 50 of the incidents occurred in sea states characterized by a steepness larger than 0 035 fully developed seas as shown in fig 8 however a stronger correlation exists among the half loaded cases than among the ballast cases when considering other ocean parameters such as wavelength wave period and wave direction which are wave parameters with a relatively weak correlation this can be attributed to the greater effects of ocean waves including the resonances induced by the similar length and period of the ship and encountered waves these are necessary for generating the ship responses in the half loaded cases to the same extent as those in the ballast cases the details of these sea states and corresponding ship responses are presented in section 5 3 5 2 ship responses in addition to the wave parameters the correlations between the observed ship navigation and motion parameters of all the rough sea cases are considered as presented in fig 9 relatively strong positive correlations are observed between the pitch and roll motion 0 660 and between the ship speed and engine rpm 0 760 a strong negative correlation is found between the pitch motion and ship speed 0 854 the foregoing practically agrees with that of a previous study 0 883 for pitch motion and speed loss of sasa et al 2019 focusing on three cases using the same bulk carrier as shown in fig 10 where δ v is the speed loss x p s is the pitch amplitude r x y is the correlation coefficient and r 2 is the coefficient of determination as shown in the top left panel in fig 9 the correlation between the roll and pitch motions in the ballast case 0 838 is stronger than that in the half loaded case 0 510 this indicates a greater possibility of encountering head seas under loaded conditions as shown in the top left panel in fig 13 given in subsection 5 3 2 it is observed at the top of the middle panel that as the pitch amplitude increases the ship operators tend to further reduce the engine rpm with a higher correlation coefficient of 0 717 subsequently when the pitch motion reaches approximately 3 in the half loaded case compared to that in the ballast case the correlation coefficient is 0 513 and the pitch motion is less than 2 as for the correlation between the pitch motion and ship speed top right panel it is observed that the ship experiences a similar speed loss when pitch motion begins to increase i e when the amplitude approaches 3 as the pitch motion increases from 3 to 6 the speed loss under the half loaded condition is more severe and faster than that under the ballast condition the bottom left panel shows that the engine rpm and ship speed loss are more highly correlated in the half loaded cases than in the ballast cases indicating a more difficult control of the ship speed under the ballast conditions this is because of the more complex coupled pitch roll motions induced by ocean waves the pitch motion occupies a relatively large part of the ship motion in the half loaded cases as observed from the bottom middle and bottom right panels the correlations between the roll motions and other ship responses in the ballast loading cases are stronger than those in the half loaded cases because of the higher center of gravity under the ballast loading conditions for instance the correlation differences between the roll motion and engine rpm as well as that between the ship speed in the ballast and half loaded cases are found to be approximately 0 46 and 0 43 respectively finally for the half loaded cases pitch and roll motions of approximately 3 and 5 respectively can lead to a significant drop in engine rpm less than 100 and sog less than 5 kn as shown in the top middle top right bottom middle and bottom right panels engine rpm vs roll and ship speed vs roll this is because the pitch motion is large when the ship undergoes a 5 roll motion as shown in the top left panel pitch vs roll the possible pitch induced ship motions in the longitudinal direction e g slamming deck wetness and propeller racing may lead to the manual operation on the engine and voluntary speed loss as for the ballast cases pitch and roll motions of approximately 5 and 10 respectively can lead to reductions in the engine rpm and sog similarly according to a survey of 140 japanese shipping companies 71 respondents sasa et al 2019 concluded that reducing the engine speed ship speed was ideal immediately before entering turbulent waters and the pitch motion tended to reduce the ship speed 5 3 sea states and ship responses according to the correlations between the wave parameters and ship responses in all rough sea cases table 5 both the wavelength and mean wave period exhibit weak correlations with ship responses therefore the following analysis focuses on the other four wave parameters including hs relative wave direction rwd mds and wave steepness compared with the roll motion and engine rpm the sea states tend to have a stronger correlation with the pitch motion and ship speed 5 3 1 significant wave height the significant wave height is representative of sea severity during rough sea navigations relatively high wave height values significantly influence the ship motion and operation as shown in fig 11 the pitch and roll motions increase with the enhancement of significant wave height with positive correlation coefficients of approximately 0 88 and 0 75 respectively an increase in the significant wave height can lead to the drop in the engine rpm and sog with negative correlation coefficients of approximately 0 54 and 0 68 respectively as shown in the top right panel the correlation difference in the relationship between the significant wave height and roll motion in the ballast and half loaded cases is found to be approximately 0 20 indicating that the influence of ocean waves on the roll motion in the ballast cases is larger 5 3 2 relative wave direction the impact of waves on a ship strongly depends on the relative wave direction as shown in fig 12 for example the head and bow waves can reduce the ship speed by inducing a large pitch motion and the beam and quartering waves can affect the ship stability thus reducing the engine rpm and ship speed accordingly ships usually navigate perpendicular to the crests in rough seas with a considerably low forward speed as shown in fig 13 the largest amplitude of ship pitch motion and the significant drop in engine rpm and sog occur when the relative wave direction is less than 60 i e head and bow waves while the large roll motion also occurs when the relative roll motion reaches approximately 120 i e beam and following waves the relative wave direction increases from 0 to 120 and its effects on the pitch motion decrease faster than that on the roll motion as for the correlation coefficient in the relationship between roll motion and rwd a difference of 0 3 can be found from two loading cases indicating that the rwd has a considerable influence on the roll motion in the ballast cases it can be seen in the top left panel that the maximum pitch motion occurs in the head and bow seas in the half loaded and ballast cases respectively the top right panel shows that another peak of roll motion occurs when the relative wave direction is approximately 240 in the half loaded cases indicating a quartering wave coming from the stern therefore the head bow and beam waves exhibit more considerable effects in both loading cases following quartering waves could also be dangerous because they can induce large roll motions in the half loaded cases additionally the two bottom panels clearly indicate that the head waves exert greater negative effects on the reduction in engine rpm and speed loss in the half loaded cases in the ballast cases these are further reduced by the bow waves 5 3 3 wave steepness as a parameter that indicates the increase in the risk of rough waves wave steepness is assumed to have a close relationship with ship motion e g pitch and navigation e g speed loss toffoli et al 2005 indicated that more than 50 of the incidents that occurred in sea states were characterized by a steepness exceeding 0 035 fully developed seas as shown in the top left panel of fig 14 a high positive correlation of 0 836 can be found in the relationship between wave steepness and pitch motion however in the half loaded cases wave steepness and roll motion are relatively less correlated 0 523 a correlation difference of 0 25 indicates that the influence of wave steepness on roll motion in the ballast cases is larger than that in the half loaded cases typically ship operators begin reducing the engine rpm as wave steepness approaches 0 015 in the ballast cases in the half loaded cases the engine rpm is reduced later when wave steepness exceeds 0 03 as shown in the bottom left panel 5 3 4 mean directional spread according to the experimental tests of the two component directionally spread irregular waves with varying frequencies the directional spreading and component cross angles luxmoore et al 2019 as well as the reduction in the component directional spreading can increase both kurtosis and exceedance probabilities as an important factor for predicting the kurtosis and estimating the probability of rough waves the mean directional spread is important for identification of dangerous ocean regions therefore the mean directional spread was also investigated to better understand the directional information on ocean waves and their effects on ship navigations for the total cases cases 1 2 3 and 4 the pitch and roll motions are negatively correlated with the mds 0 636 and 0 545 respectively as shown in the top left and top right panels in fig 15 respectively compared to the ballast cases 0 685 the mds exhibited a minimal influence in the half loaded cases 0 466 however the effects of mds on roll motion quickly decreased as the mds increased in the ballast cases in the half loaded cases the effects of mds remained relatively large as the mds increased a second peak in roll motion occurred when the mds was approximately 70 5 4 influences of loading conditions on ship responses to sea states the influences of the two different loading conditions on ship responses are discussed in this section as shown in fig 16 the correlation coefficients of ship responses under different loading conditions to sea states were compared the correlations between the sea states and ship responses such as pitch motion fig 16 a engine rpm fig 16 c and ship speed fig 16 d under ballast conditions are of equal or slightly smaller amplitude than those under the half loaded conditions in contrast relatively considerable differences are observed in the case of roll motion fig 16 b because of the high gm metacentric height value and stronger parametric roll resonance in high irregular waves the influences of sea states including hs mds rwd and steepness on roll motion are larger under the ballast conditions than under the half loaded cases the differences among the correlation coefficients are not less than 0 2 therefore compared with other ship responses affected by ocean waves under the half loaded conditions the focus should be set on the roll motion when the ship is under the ballast conditions as mentioned ship operators usually reduce the engine rpm at a later period in the half loaded cases than in the ballast cases to investigate the difference between the two aforementioned loading conditions a significance test was performed the p values are summarized in table 6 source pertains to the parameter for which the significance test has been performed ss means the sum of squares df is the degree of freedom and f ratio is the f value representing the extent of random error effect based on the list in table 6 all the p values between the two loading conditions are zero indicating a significant difference between them 5 5 identifications of warning criteria in sea states of different levels to provide practical suggestions to ship operators for identifying and avoiding high risk sea states it is important to determine the various amplitudes of ship responses induced by the rough seas of different levels in addition to the correlation between each sea state and each ship response given above the ship responses are divided into three ranges to determine the ship responses to sea states of different levels the detailed values are summarized in table 7 the identifications of warning criteria in the sea states of different levels are given in fig 17 where the ship responses to four important ocean parameters are divided into three levels large modest and small responses the values in fig 17 are calculated from the combination of simulated ocean waves and on board observations the averaged value of each sea state of different levels based on the ship response ranges are summarized in table 7 it is not necessary for ship operators to implement any measures when the ship is in the blue regions small responses however they should start to reduce the engine rpm to reduce speed or change the course when the ship is in the purple regions modest responses to avoid the red regions large responses where the ship motion can increase to large amplitudes and cause possible damage to the cargoes or hull of the ship for instance sea states with average hs values exceeding 5 4 and 1 5 m are found for the large modest and small ship responses in the half loaded cases the relatively smaller waves found for the ship responses in the ballast cases are 3 8 3 5 and 1 3 m a difference of 1 5 m between the two loading conditions is found for the large ship responses ship operators should reduce the ship speed or change the course when the ship experiences a modest response with an average hs value of approximately 4 m in rough sea cases it is noteworthy that two out of every three ship accidents have occurred in ocean regions within a 4 m hs value toffoli et al 2005 as for the average rwd for each ship response differences of 53 100 and 20 can be found between the two loading conditions for the large modest and small ship responses respectively the head seas generate modest and large ship responses in the half loaded cases whereas the beam seas tend to have more effects in the ballast cases for the half loaded cases large ship responses also occurred in ocean regions with a wave steepness of 0 031 0 0346 for fully developed waves according to the pierson moskowitz spectrum based on the studies of toffoli et al 2005 on the relationship between sea states and ship accidents 60 of ship accidents occurred in sea states with a wave steepness of 0 03 0 045 by contrast similar to the half loaded cases a smaller wave steepness of approximately 0 02 was observed for the large and modest ship responses in the ballast cases indicating a weaker capability to operate the ship across ocean regions with high steepness similarly an mds difference of approximately 10 is found between the half loaded and ballast cases for both large and modest ship responses moreover corresponding with a limited mds of 25 the probability 98 of ship accidents in cross seas is found to be high toffoli et al 2005 based on figs 17 and 18 the large and modest ship responses in the half loaded cases occur in similar ocean regions in addition bitner gregersen and toffoli 2014 also found that the maximum wave height was affected by the cross angle with a peak of approximately 40 in their numerical studies using directionally spread cross seas in our study the ship under ballast conditions also experienced modest 35 7 to large 37 5 responses the interaction effects i e effect of one parameter influenced by another have also been studied using the statistical regression model to further explain the relationship between ship responses and various sea state variables table 8 initially the large r2 values bold font numbers in table 8 of the regression models of pitch roll and sog versus all four wave parameters as listed in the first second and third rows in table 8 respectively as well as the sog versus two ship navigation parameters pitch and roll as listed in the fifth row in table 8 considerably explain the values of these parameters by contrast the other low r2 values italicized numbers in table 8 explains the low percentage of variance for instance the fourth and last rows listing the regression model of rpm against the wave and ship motion parameters indicate a high possibility of crew operation influence e g human factors on engine rpm rather than the direct effects of ocean waves and wave induced ship motions based on the regression models of roll and sog listed in the second third and last rows spurious correlations figs 10 14 and 15 were found between roll and wave steepness between sog and mds and between rpm and roll respectively 6 conclusions different from the model tests focusing on the wave effects on ship models with human designed waves a detailed analysis of the relationship between ship responses and sea states was performed under real rough sea conditions with the combined real time observations and high resolution wave hindcast for every moment that the ship navigated the four rough seas the information on ship motion engine operation ship speed loss and ship dimension can be accessed from the on board data recording devices two widely used gpv datasets i e ncep fnl analyses and era interim were employed to provide ocean surface wind force to the wave model the ocean surface wind was validated using the on board observations and the relationships between the simulated wave parameters and observed ship responses were quantitatively analyzed suggestions for ship safety under severe weather conditions were also given first the relationship among the different wave parameters in actual rough seas was studied using high resolution wave models a strong positive correlation of 0 85 between hs and wave steepness and a negative correlation of 0 66 between hs and mean directional spread were observed although these relationships generally exhibited stronger correlations in the half loaded cases than in the ballast loaded cases the relationships between hs and other parameters e g wavelength wave period wave direction and relative wave direction were weak second based on the analysis of the correlations among the observed ship responses strong positive correlations between the pitch and roll motion 0 66 and between the ship speed and engine rpm 0 76 were observed a strong negative correlation between the pitch motion and ship speed 0 85 was also found in the four rough sea cases considered the ship operators tended to further reduce the engine rpm at a later period in the half loaded cases than in the ballast cases additionally the correlations between the roll motions and other ship responses were stronger in the ballast cases than in the half loaded cases the differences among the correlation coefficients were not less than 0 2 third based on the studies of ship responses to sea states the correlations between the sea states and pitch motion and ship speed were stronger than those between the sea states and roll motion and engine rpm the wave parameters such as wavelength and mean wave period had relatively weak correlations with ship responses finally the critical ship responses to sea states of different levels were also identified quantitatively showing the relationship between the ship navigational parameters e g pitch and roll motion engine rpm and speed loss and ocean parameters e g significant wave height relative wave direction mean directional spread and wave steepness although only one bulk carrier was investigated in the present study it should be noted that according to the office of data and economic analysis of the us bureau of economic analysis the world s bulk carrier fleet includes 6225 ships of over 10 000 dwt representing 40 and 39 4 of all ships in terms of tonnage and vessel respectively therefore the results of this study can provide practical suggestions to ship operators of bulk carriers of a similar dimension for identifying and avoiding possible high risk ocean regions this can enable them to mitigate the negative effects on navigational safety induced by unexpected large ship responses similar to those of the first logged case in the tasman sea where the crew practically lost ship control in the high waves to date the observed cases remain limited and further analysis of more recent data obtained by another vessel will have to be conducted in future studies the practical suggestions are anticipated to aid in improving the safe operation of autonomous surface vehicles in harsh ocean environments credit authorship contribution statement chen

20794,the analysis of ocean surface waves is essential to ensure safe navigation since 2010 different on board observation data from bulk carriers including those navigating high risk shipping regions in the southern hemisphere with strong ocean currents have been collected for 6 years high resolution numerical simulations of ocean waves for four rough sea cases considering the effect of wave current interaction on ship navigation have been performed using the wavewatch iii model the simulations considered the ocean surface wind force from the widely used reanalysis database of the national centers for environmental prediction final and european center for medium range weather forecasts interim reanalysis to provide practical suggestions for safe navigation by avoiding possible high risk ocean regions and construct a more effective and efficient optimum ship routing system the model results were validated based on on board observations followed by discussions on the responses of ship motion and navigation to sea states at different levels finally early warning criteria including various operational ocean parameters for ballast and loaded ships sailing in rough seas were identified keywords ship responses rough seas wave simulation shipboard measurements ncep fnl era interim 1 introduction according to the international maritime organization s technical cooperation programme marine transportation delivers 80 90 of global trade products making it an important aspect of international commerce the increase in ship size and the number of shipping activities have increased the risk of ship accidents and the potential harm to life and property moreover ocean pollution has increased accordingly from the viewpoint of ship weather routing the accurate forecast of rough ocean surface sea states and the effects of waves on ship navigation is essential to the safe economical and environment friendly ship navigation many researchers have employed both the statistical analysis of ship accident databases and sea state hindcasts to determine the relationship between sea states and ship safety as well as formulate a set of warning criteria to identify adequate warning criteria for safe navigation toffoli et al 2005 studied the sea state parameters and ship characteristics from 270 ship accidents attributed to bad weather in their analysis on critical aspects they provided statistical conclusions about sea state parameters such as significant wave height wave steepness cross seas and rapid sea state development however they argued that due to the coarse resolution of the wave model the sea states were apparently underestimated especially for strong tropical storms and wave current interaction effects besides the information on the exact time and ship characteristics of each accident was not available thus restricting the details and accuracy of the discussion the review study of niclasen et al 2010 on wave forecasts and small sea vessels focused on sea state parameters that are important for the safety of these vessels they attempted to determine the high risk situations that were not resolved by considering the traditional wave parameters such as wave height wave period and direction they found that combining the wave height and steepness or calculating the risk of synchronous waves was useful for small vessels and that wave dissipation could be used to highlight potentially dangerous seas despite the dearth of complete physics further they argued that the statistical predictions of dangerous waves were possible however the level of risk was highly dependent on the vessel size ship stability properties ship heading and ship speed based on the ship accident statistics they concluded that moderate seas that rapidly developed and seas whose waves were more severe than the average waves generated by the local climate were closely related to the higher risk of ship accidents according to zhang and li 2017 complex sea states with the co occurrence of wind sea waves and swell conditions represent threats to sailing vessels especially when these conditions include similar wave periods and oblique wave directions they performed two case studies whose results were in good agreement with the general conditions leading to the possible occurrence of dangerous waves based on statistical analyses however the detailed relationship between rough seas and ship navigation conditions was not derived because of the lack of necessary ship information the statistical analysis of sea states and related ship accidents from the database can be used as a basis for issuing notifications regarding the most dangerous sea parameters associated with different ship accidents however due to the lack of detailed information on ship motion and dimensions on each accident the sea states were underestimated because of the coarse resolution of the meteorological databases used cavaleri and bertotti 2006 moreover the possible underestimation of wave steepness resulted from the lack of consideration of wave current interaction as pointed out by rapizo et al 2018 who conducted a qualitative analysis using high resolution currents in a fine grid nested in the coarser global grid their results showed that the typical resolution of global hydrodynamic reanalysis was insufficient to resolve mesoscale eddies consequently the simulation of mesoscale wave patterns can be compromised other studies related to the foregoing were also implemented cavaleri 2009 gramcianinov et al 2020 rogers et al 2012a therefore despite the considerable contributions of the aforementioned researchers to provide worthy information and suggestions to ship operators their conclusions should be further validated using on board observations and higher resolution information on sea states toffoli et al 2005 as a continuation of previous studies focusing on the wave modeling of high wind seas during typhoon periods chen et al 2013 2015 and the study on wave current interactions considering the kuroshio current in the east china sea chen 2018 the present study further analyzes the relationship between sea states and ship navigational responses using ship board observation data obtained from a bulk carrier the study employs both high resolution numerical wave modeling and detailed on board observations of ship motion affected by rough weather conditions it aims to provide ship operators practical suggestions for safe navigation by identifying the high risk sea states and a few possible warning criteria especially for rough sea navigation additionally it should be noticed here that with such on board observation for continuous days during practical operations the ship can be treated as a wave buoy iseki and ohtsu 2000 nielsen 2006 and also able to provide important information for guidance and decision support as well as serve as black box when ship accidents occurred to determine the relationship between sea states and ship responses in actual navigation the relationship between the important sea state parameters navigational parameters and effects of ship responses to sea states has been analyzed additionally several ship responses in practical navigations to sea states of different levels are also considered as warning criteria that quantitatively exhibit the relationship between ship navigational parameters and ocean parameters these provide practical suggestions for a safer marine navigation this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the on board observation facility and brief information on data collection are presented the numerical wave simulations are described in section 3 the validation of model results with observations are presented in section 4 the relationship between sea states and ship navigation safety is explicated in section 5 the conclusions of this study and suggestions for future studies are summarized in section 6 2 on board observations for this study an on board observation of weather and ship motion using a 28 000 dwt class bulk carrier was conducted from 2010 to 2016 covering high risk shipping regions in the southern hemisphere the length of the ship i e length between perpendiculars lpp and width are 160 4 and 27 2 m respectively with a draft of 9 82 m when fully loaded as listed in table 1 the routes of the ship mainly cover the oceans between asian countries and areas of the southern hemisphere such as oceania and south america where sea states are generally rougher than those in the northern hemisphere owing to strong swells the ship has a limited ability to avoid rough sea states because of its low operational speed of approximately 12 kn which negatively influences its safety and efficiency to clearly understand the relationship between sea state parameters and rough sea navigation four observation cases with sufficient temporal and spatial variability covering high risk shipping regions in the southern hemisphere are selected from the experiment period for analysis in case 1 the crew practically lost control of the ship as recorded in the logbook information on navigation time ship location and ship loading condition in each case is summarized in table 2 the colored rectangles in fig 1 indicate all the ocean regions set for the high resolution wave model simulation for the four cases toffoli et al 2003 proposed a map of ship accidents worldwide 1995 1999 caused by severe weather the map is derived from the lmis casualty database as given in fig 2 peter kjeldsen 2004 identified 21 ocean areas where atypical waves occur causing ship accidents as shown in fig 3 a comparison of these three figures illustrates the high navigational risk in the four selected rough sea navigation cases especially in the locations marked 12 13 and 18 in fig 3 which show a higher risk of experiencing aberrant waves in addition according to cattrell et al 2018 the frequency of occurrence of these waves as well as their generating mechanism are not spatially uniform and the locations are likely to exhibit unique sensitivities thus the atypical waves occurring in ocean regions with different characteristics can be attributed to different reasons such as the opposite current effects in the kuroshio region the swell and wind sea interactions in the southern hemisphere and the severe storms in the tropical regions accordingly the detailed on board observations and the high resolution wave model simulation are used here to conduct a clear investigation the case measurements mainly include navigational parameters such as weather data wind speed wind direction etc engine data engine revolution engine power fuel oil consumption and exhaust gas temperatures on all six cylinders of the main engine voyage data ship speed ship position ship course loading condition etc and ship motion data pitch roll and yaw additional details on instrument observations and the measurement parameters are provided by sasa et al 2015 other representative studies related to both dynamic ocean environment and on board measurements can be found in vettor and guedes soares 2016 2018 to obtain detailed ship information for implementing an accurate analysis the ship motion data were treated as significant values meaning the average of values of the one third highest values and are generated using the zero upcrossing method for a 10 min time series with an interval of 0 1 s all other parameters were the averaged values in the course of a 10 min time series obtained every 1 s with details given in sasa et al 2015 3 numerical simulations 3 1 model descriptions as a third generation phase averaged wave model wavewatch iii ww3 model version 4 18 booij and holthuijsen 1987 tolman 1989 2014 has been used for the hindcast wave simulations for all the four cases with the implicit assumption that the random phase spectral action density balance equation applies because the properties of the medium water depth and current and the wave field itself vary with time and space scales that are considerably larger than the variation scales of a single wave the wavewatchiii model can solve the wavenumber direction spectra by explicitly parameterizing all physical processes such as wind input growth actions nonlinear resonant wave wave interactions wave bottom interaction and whitecap dissipation the spectrum action balance equation can be solved as follows tolman 2014 1 n t x c g u n k k ˆ n θ θ ˆ n s σ 2 k ˆ σ d d s k u s 3 θ ˆ 1 k σ d d m k u m where n is the wave spectral density as a function of wavenumber c g is the wave group velocity u is the current velocity s is the coordinate in the direction of θ d is the mean water depth k is the wave number as a scalar k is the wavenumber vector m is the coordinate perpendicular to s s is the net source term for the spectrum and σ is the intrinsic wave radian frequency in this study s was determined as the summation of the linear input s l n to provide a more realistic initial wave growth for the consistent spin up of the model under quiescent conditions cavaleri and malanotte rizzoli 1981 the wind input s i n and wave dissipation s d s tolman and chalikov 1996 were calculated by a non dimensional wind wave interaction parameter the nonlinear wave wave interaction s n l was obtained by the discrete interaction approximation hasselmann et al 1985 the wave bottom interaction s b o t hasselmann et al 1973 was calculated using the empirical linear joint north sea wave project parameterization for additional processes in shallow water areas high order conservative numerical schemes were used for spatial discretization and the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition for binding the discretization in time and space existed 3 2 model settings and input data a two way nesting method ww3 multi with horizontal resolutions of 0 5 and 0 1 for large global and inner nested local domains respectively was used considering the cfl condition the minimum wave propagation time steps were set to 330 and 300 s for the larger and inner domains respectively for all rough sea cases the wave model has a spectral resolution of 10 covering 36 directions the calculated wave frequencies were set starting from 0 0345 hz with a logarithmic frequency factor of 1 1 for 38 steps additionally a one month spin up before the ship motion analysis period had been run for all cases to initiate the model from a resting condition the outputs were obtained every 10 min to parallel the on board observation data to accurately simulate the ocean wave model a critical input is wind field forcing which generates a time varying map of wind speed and directions teixeira et al 1995 holthuijsen et al 1996 meanwhile wave model errors usually result from the errors in the wind field therefore as reported by previous studies tolman et al 2002 feng et al 2006 campos and guedes soares 2016 to reduce the model uncertainty originating from the sensitivity of the wind input the reanalysis databases i e national centers for environmental prediction final ncep fnl operation model global tropospheric analyses ncep f 2000 http rda ucar edu datasets ds083 2 ds083 2 doi 10 5065 d6m043c6 and european center for medium range weather forecasts interim reanalysis era interim davis et al 2008 had been utilized as input wind forces for the ocean wave generation the ncep fnl analyses provided a 1 1 grid covering the global region whereas the era interim provided a spatial resolution of approximately 80 km 0 75 both of these wind input sources were updated every 6 h a linear interpolation method was utilized for applying these two gpv database values i e 1 and 0 75 to wave modeling i e 0 5 and 0 1 to drive wavewatchiii using the gpv datasets the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock 2008 was used to generate the necessary near surface wind fields as a next generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications the wrf model has been widely employed for typhoon simulations and real time forecasting davis et al 2008 cha and wang 2013 as for the input and boundary condition data both ncep fnl and era interim were used for the generation of near surface winds the wrf model was run for the same time period as wavewatchiii with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and a 3 h time step for output the detailed configurations for the wrf model are summarized in table 3 to calculate the wave current interaction the ocean surface current analysis real time ocean current data which are generated by earth space research have been used for wave modeling bonjean and lagerloef 2002 the ocean current data on a 1 3 grid have also been interpolated into the 0 1 grid furthermore the wave ice interactions are calculated using the wavewatchiii model thus sea ice and icebergs have been included in the calculation for the four cases the sea ice coverage was calculated in the global domain using nimbus 7 scanning multichannel microwave radiometer defense meteorological satellite program s special sensor microwave imager and special sensor microwave imager sounder cavalieri et al 1996 4 model results and validations 4 1 distributions of ocean surface wind and waves by model simulations using the phase average wavewatchiii model the gridded fields of mean wave parameters such as the significant wave height directions and frequencies are obtained the detailed settings are provided in section 3 2 the surface wave distributions at the moment of maximum pitch motion of all rough sea cases are presented in fig 4 4 2 validations of simulation results with ship on board observations as mentioned in section 1 the observed wind speeds for all cases have been averaged for a 10 min time series obtained every 1 s for validation with the wrf results as shown in fig 5 generally the gpv wind data reasonably replicate the temporal variations of both wind direction and speed whereas the ncep data tend to perform better for the peak wind speed than the era interim the detailed evaluation and discussion of the model results versus on board observations are provided in a previous study conducted by chen et al 2020 instead of validation with reanalysis data which are based on model results the wave simulation are validated against observed ship motion chen et al 2020 5 relationship between sea state parameters and ship responses 5 1 sea states the correlations between the significant wave height representative of sea severity and other wave parameters generated by the ww3 model of all the rough sea cases are focused at first as shown in fig 6 the formulae used in the wave model for generating the wave parameters are also summarized in table 4 here the variance of surface elevation is e 0 2 π 0 f f r θ d f r d θ where σ 2 π f r is the intrinsic wave radian frequency and f f r θ is the frequency direction spectrum a 0 2 π 0 cos θ f σ θ d σ d θ and b 0 2 π 0 sin θ f σ θ d σ d θ it should be noted that the definition of wave steepness employed by toffoli et al 2005 is given as 2 π h m 0 g t m 10 2 the definition of h m 0 by toffoli et al 2005 also represents the significant wave height which is the definition of h s the definition of t m 10 by toffoli et al 2005 is the energy wave period given by t m 10 m 1 m 0 where m n is the nth order moment of the wave spectrum see wmo 1998 to improve the ship safety in rough seas and the efficacy of optimum ship routing in real scenarios different loading conditions should be considered here three different groups are presented half loaded cases 3 and 4 ballast cases 1 and 2 and total or whole cases cases 1 4 the numbers inside each panel indicate the correlation coefficients of the relevant two wave parameters a 10 min average representing a duration of approximately 20 day results in a total of approximately 3000 data points for these 4 cases covering high risk shipping regions in the southern hemisphere fig 1 and table 2 as shown in fig 6 regardless of the sea states encountered by the two different loading conditions the mean directional spread mds and wave steepness have small differences between the half loaded and ballast cases for instance with a negative correlation coefficient of 0 66 the mds is found to decrease as the significant wave height increases similarly toffoli et al 2005 found that an mds reduction was observed during the growth of sea state conditions for approximately 60 of the selected cases in their nalysis of the global ship accident as shown in fig 7 according to their results the magnitude of the mds decreases to 0 5 approximately 25 top left panel in fig 6 as the significant wave height increases the foregoing agrees with the results of the present study moreover the wave height has a strong positive correlation with a wave steepness of 0 85 the maximum wave steepness is 0 0342 in the present study according to the study of toffoli et al 2005 this indicates that the ship in rough seas approaches the accident limit they reported that more than 50 of the incidents occurred in sea states characterized by a steepness larger than 0 035 fully developed seas as shown in fig 8 however a stronger correlation exists among the half loaded cases than among the ballast cases when considering other ocean parameters such as wavelength wave period and wave direction which are wave parameters with a relatively weak correlation this can be attributed to the greater effects of ocean waves including the resonances induced by the similar length and period of the ship and encountered waves these are necessary for generating the ship responses in the half loaded cases to the same extent as those in the ballast cases the details of these sea states and corresponding ship responses are presented in section 5 3 5 2 ship responses in addition to the wave parameters the correlations between the observed ship navigation and motion parameters of all the rough sea cases are considered as presented in fig 9 relatively strong positive correlations are observed between the pitch and roll motion 0 660 and between the ship speed and engine rpm 0 760 a strong negative correlation is found between the pitch motion and ship speed 0 854 the foregoing practically agrees with that of a previous study 0 883 for pitch motion and speed loss of sasa et al 2019 focusing on three cases using the same bulk carrier as shown in fig 10 where δ v is the speed loss x p s is the pitch amplitude r x y is the correlation coefficient and r 2 is the coefficient of determination as shown in the top left panel in fig 9 the correlation between the roll and pitch motions in the ballast case 0 838 is stronger than that in the half loaded case 0 510 this indicates a greater possibility of encountering head seas under loaded conditions as shown in the top left panel in fig 13 given in subsection 5 3 2 it is observed at the top of the middle panel that as the pitch amplitude increases the ship operators tend to further reduce the engine rpm with a higher correlation coefficient of 0 717 subsequently when the pitch motion reaches approximately 3 in the half loaded case compared to that in the ballast case the correlation coefficient is 0 513 and the pitch motion is less than 2 as for the correlation between the pitch motion and ship speed top right panel it is observed that the ship experiences a similar speed loss when pitch motion begins to increase i e when the amplitude approaches 3 as the pitch motion increases from 3 to 6 the speed loss under the half loaded condition is more severe and faster than that under the ballast condition the bottom left panel shows that the engine rpm and ship speed loss are more highly correlated in the half loaded cases than in the ballast cases indicating a more difficult control of the ship speed under the ballast conditions this is because of the more complex coupled pitch roll motions induced by ocean waves the pitch motion occupies a relatively large part of the ship motion in the half loaded cases as observed from the bottom middle and bottom right panels the correlations between the roll motions and other ship responses in the ballast loading cases are stronger than those in the half loaded cases because of the higher center of gravity under the ballast loading conditions for instance the correlation differences between the roll motion and engine rpm as well as that between the ship speed in the ballast and half loaded cases are found to be approximately 0 46 and 0 43 respectively finally for the half loaded cases pitch and roll motions of approximately 3 and 5 respectively can lead to a significant drop in engine rpm less than 100 and sog less than 5 kn as shown in the top middle top right bottom middle and bottom right panels engine rpm vs roll and ship speed vs roll this is because the pitch motion is large when the ship undergoes a 5 roll motion as shown in the top left panel pitch vs roll the possible pitch induced ship motions in the longitudinal direction e g slamming deck wetness and propeller racing may lead to the manual operation on the engine and voluntary speed loss as for the ballast cases pitch and roll motions of approximately 5 and 10 respectively can lead to reductions in the engine rpm and sog similarly according to a survey of 140 japanese shipping companies 71 respondents sasa et al 2019 concluded that reducing the engine speed ship speed was ideal immediately before entering turbulent waters and the pitch motion tended to reduce the ship speed 5 3 sea states and ship responses according to the correlations between the wave parameters and ship responses in all rough sea cases table 5 both the wavelength and mean wave period exhibit weak correlations with ship responses therefore the following analysis focuses on the other four wave parameters including hs relative wave direction rwd mds and wave steepness compared with the roll motion and engine rpm the sea states tend to have a stronger correlation with the pitch motion and ship speed 5 3 1 significant wave height the significant wave height is representative of sea severity during rough sea navigations relatively high wave height values significantly influence the ship motion and operation as shown in fig 11 the pitch and roll motions increase with the enhancement of significant wave height with positive correlation coefficients of approximately 0 88 and 0 75 respectively an increase in the significant wave height can lead to the drop in the engine rpm and sog with negative correlation coefficients of approximately 0 54 and 0 68 respectively as shown in the top right panel the correlation difference in the relationship between the significant wave height and roll motion in the ballast and half loaded cases is found to be approximately 0 20 indicating that the influence of ocean waves on the roll motion in the ballast cases is larger 5 3 2 relative wave direction the impact of waves on a ship strongly depends on the relative wave direction as shown in fig 12 for example the head and bow waves can reduce the ship speed by inducing a large pitch motion and the beam and quartering waves can affect the ship stability thus reducing the engine rpm and ship speed accordingly ships usually navigate perpendicular to the crests in rough seas with a considerably low forward speed as shown in fig 13 the largest amplitude of ship pitch motion and the significant drop in engine rpm and sog occur when the relative wave direction is less than 60 i e head and bow waves while the large roll motion also occurs when the relative roll motion reaches approximately 120 i e beam and following waves the relative wave direction increases from 0 to 120 and its effects on the pitch motion decrease faster than that on the roll motion as for the correlation coefficient in the relationship between roll motion and rwd a difference of 0 3 can be found from two loading cases indicating that the rwd has a considerable influence on the roll motion in the ballast cases it can be seen in the top left panel that the maximum pitch motion occurs in the head and bow seas in the half loaded and ballast cases respectively the top right panel shows that another peak of roll motion occurs when the relative wave direction is approximately 240 in the half loaded cases indicating a quartering wave coming from the stern therefore the head bow and beam waves exhibit more considerable effects in both loading cases following quartering waves could also be dangerous because they can induce large roll motions in the half loaded cases additionally the two bottom panels clearly indicate that the head waves exert greater negative effects on the reduction in engine rpm and speed loss in the half loaded cases in the ballast cases these are further reduced by the bow waves 5 3 3 wave steepness as a parameter that indicates the increase in the risk of rough waves wave steepness is assumed to have a close relationship with ship motion e g pitch and navigation e g speed loss toffoli et al 2005 indicated that more than 50 of the incidents that occurred in sea states were characterized by a steepness exceeding 0 035 fully developed seas as shown in the top left panel of fig 14 a high positive correlation of 0 836 can be found in the relationship between wave steepness and pitch motion however in the half loaded cases wave steepness and roll motion are relatively less correlated 0 523 a correlation difference of 0 25 indicates that the influence of wave steepness on roll motion in the ballast cases is larger than that in the half loaded cases typically ship operators begin reducing the engine rpm as wave steepness approaches 0 015 in the ballast cases in the half loaded cases the engine rpm is reduced later when wave steepness exceeds 0 03 as shown in the bottom left panel 5 3 4 mean directional spread according to the experimental tests of the two component directionally spread irregular waves with varying frequencies the directional spreading and component cross angles luxmoore et al 2019 as well as the reduction in the component directional spreading can increase both kurtosis and exceedance probabilities as an important factor for predicting the kurtosis and estimating the probability of rough waves the mean directional spread is important for identification of dangerous ocean regions therefore the mean directional spread was also investigated to better understand the directional information on ocean waves and their effects on ship navigations for the total cases cases 1 2 3 and 4 the pitch and roll motions are negatively correlated with the mds 0 636 and 0 545 respectively as shown in the top left and top right panels in fig 15 respectively compared to the ballast cases 0 685 the mds exhibited a minimal influence in the half loaded cases 0 466 however the effects of mds on roll motion quickly decreased as the mds increased in the ballast cases in the half loaded cases the effects of mds remained relatively large as the mds increased a second peak in roll motion occurred when the mds was approximately 70 5 4 influences of loading conditions on ship responses to sea states the influences of the two different loading conditions on ship responses are discussed in this section as shown in fig 16 the correlation coefficients of ship responses under different loading conditions to sea states were compared the correlations between the sea states and ship responses such as pitch motion fig 16 a engine rpm fig 16 c and ship speed fig 16 d under ballast conditions are of equal or slightly smaller amplitude than those under the half loaded conditions in contrast relatively considerable differences are observed in the case of roll motion fig 16 b because of the high gm metacentric height value and stronger parametric roll resonance in high irregular waves the influences of sea states including hs mds rwd and steepness on roll motion are larger under the ballast conditions than under the half loaded cases the differences among the correlation coefficients are not less than 0 2 therefore compared with other ship responses affected by ocean waves under the half loaded conditions the focus should be set on the roll motion when the ship is under the ballast conditions as mentioned ship operators usually reduce the engine rpm at a later period in the half loaded cases than in the ballast cases to investigate the difference between the two aforementioned loading conditions a significance test was performed the p values are summarized in table 6 source pertains to the parameter for which the significance test has been performed ss means the sum of squares df is the degree of freedom and f ratio is the f value representing the extent of random error effect based on the list in table 6 all the p values between the two loading conditions are zero indicating a significant difference between them 5 5 identifications of warning criteria in sea states of different levels to provide practical suggestions to ship operators for identifying and avoiding high risk sea states it is important to determine the various amplitudes of ship responses induced by the rough seas of different levels in addition to the correlation between each sea state and each ship response given above the ship responses are divided into three ranges to determine the ship responses to sea states of different levels the detailed values are summarized in table 7 the identifications of warning criteria in the sea states of different levels are given in fig 17 where the ship responses to four important ocean parameters are divided into three levels large modest and small responses the values in fig 17 are calculated from the combination of simulated ocean waves and on board observations the averaged value of each sea state of different levels based on the ship response ranges are summarized in table 7 it is not necessary for ship operators to implement any measures when the ship is in the blue regions small responses however they should start to reduce the engine rpm to reduce speed or change the course when the ship is in the purple regions modest responses to avoid the red regions large responses where the ship motion can increase to large amplitudes and cause possible damage to the cargoes or hull of the ship for instance sea states with average hs values exceeding 5 4 and 1 5 m are found for the large modest and small ship responses in the half loaded cases the relatively smaller waves found for the ship responses in the ballast cases are 3 8 3 5 and 1 3 m a difference of 1 5 m between the two loading conditions is found for the large ship responses ship operators should reduce the ship speed or change the course when the ship experiences a modest response with an average hs value of approximately 4 m in rough sea cases it is noteworthy that two out of every three ship accidents have occurred in ocean regions within a 4 m hs value toffoli et al 2005 as for the average rwd for each ship response differences of 53 100 and 20 can be found between the two loading conditions for the large modest and small ship responses respectively the head seas generate modest and large ship responses in the half loaded cases whereas the beam seas tend to have more effects in the ballast cases for the half loaded cases large ship responses also occurred in ocean regions with a wave steepness of 0 031 0 0346 for fully developed waves according to the pierson moskowitz spectrum based on the studies of toffoli et al 2005 on the relationship between sea states and ship accidents 60 of ship accidents occurred in sea states with a wave steepness of 0 03 0 045 by contrast similar to the half loaded cases a smaller wave steepness of approximately 0 02 was observed for the large and modest ship responses in the ballast cases indicating a weaker capability to operate the ship across ocean regions with high steepness similarly an mds difference of approximately 10 is found between the half loaded and ballast cases for both large and modest ship responses moreover corresponding with a limited mds of 25 the probability 98 of ship accidents in cross seas is found to be high toffoli et al 2005 based on figs 17 and 18 the large and modest ship responses in the half loaded cases occur in similar ocean regions in addition bitner gregersen and toffoli 2014 also found that the maximum wave height was affected by the cross angle with a peak of approximately 40 in their numerical studies using directionally spread cross seas in our study the ship under ballast conditions also experienced modest 35 7 to large 37 5 responses the interaction effects i e effect of one parameter influenced by another have also been studied using the statistical regression model to further explain the relationship between ship responses and various sea state variables table 8 initially the large r2 values bold font numbers in table 8 of the regression models of pitch roll and sog versus all four wave parameters as listed in the first second and third rows in table 8 respectively as well as the sog versus two ship navigation parameters pitch and roll as listed in the fifth row in table 8 considerably explain the values of these parameters by contrast the other low r2 values italicized numbers in table 8 explains the low percentage of variance for instance the fourth and last rows listing the regression model of rpm against the wave and ship motion parameters indicate a high possibility of crew operation influence e g human factors on engine rpm rather than the direct effects of ocean waves and wave induced ship motions based on the regression models of roll and sog listed in the second third and last rows spurious correlations figs 10 14 and 15 were found between roll and wave steepness between sog and mds and between rpm and roll respectively 6 conclusions different from the model tests focusing on the wave effects on ship models with human designed waves a detailed analysis of the relationship between ship responses and sea states was performed under real rough sea conditions with the combined real time observations and high resolution wave hindcast for every moment that the ship navigated the four rough seas the information on ship motion engine operation ship speed loss and ship dimension can be accessed from the on board data recording devices two widely used gpv datasets i e ncep fnl analyses and era interim were employed to provide ocean surface wind force to the wave model the ocean surface wind was validated using the on board observations and the relationships between the simulated wave parameters and observed ship responses were quantitatively analyzed suggestions for ship safety under severe weather conditions were also given first the relationship among the different wave parameters in actual rough seas was studied using high resolution wave models a strong positive correlation of 0 85 between hs and wave steepness and a negative correlation of 0 66 between hs and mean directional spread were observed although these relationships generally exhibited stronger correlations in the half loaded cases than in the ballast loaded cases the relationships between hs and other parameters e g wavelength wave period wave direction and relative wave direction were weak second based on the analysis of the correlations among the observed ship responses strong positive correlations between the pitch and roll motion 0 66 and between the ship speed and engine rpm 0 76 were observed a strong negative correlation between the pitch motion and ship speed 0 85 was also found in the four rough sea cases considered the ship operators tended to further reduce the engine rpm at a later period in the half loaded cases than in the ballast cases additionally the correlations between the roll motions and other ship responses were stronger in the ballast cases than in the half loaded cases the differences among the correlation coefficients were not less than 0 2 third based on the studies of ship responses to sea states the correlations between the sea states and pitch motion and ship speed were stronger than those between the sea states and roll motion and engine rpm the wave parameters such as wavelength and mean wave period had relatively weak correlations with ship responses finally the critical ship responses to sea states of different levels were also identified quantitatively showing the relationship between the ship navigational parameters e g pitch and roll motion engine rpm and speed loss and ocean parameters e g significant wave height relative wave direction mean directional spread and wave steepness although only one bulk carrier was investigated in the present study it should be noted that according to the office of data and economic analysis of the us bureau of economic analysis the world s bulk carrier fleet includes 6225 ships of over 10 000 dwt representing 40 and 39 4 of all ships in terms of tonnage and vessel respectively therefore the results of this study can provide practical suggestions to ship operators of bulk carriers of a similar dimension for identifying and avoiding possible high risk ocean regions this can enable them to mitigate the negative effects on navigational safety induced by unexpected large ship responses similar to those of the first logged case in the tasman sea where the crew practically lost ship control in the high waves to date the observed cases remain limited and further analysis of more recent data obtained by another vessel will have to be conducted in future studies the practical suggestions are anticipated to aid in improving the safe operation of autonomous surface vehicles in harsh ocean environments credit authorship contribution statement chen
