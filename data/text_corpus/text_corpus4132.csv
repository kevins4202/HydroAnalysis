20660,closed fish cages have gained increased interest in marine aquaculture however knowledge on the seakeeping behaviour of a floating closed cage and the influence of the contained water inside the cage are still limited in this paper a coupled numerical model is developed for the simulation of closed rigid cages in waves numerical studies are conducted both in the frequency domain and in the time domain and compared with scaled physical experiments special attention has been drawn to the coupling effects of sloshing on cage response and the resulting mooring line forces the comparative analyses show that sloshing of the contained water has large influence on the coupled surge and pitch motions of the cage sloshing is also found to have significant effect on the mean drift forces in regular waves in the tested simulated irregular waves the mooring forces are found to be dominated by the slow drift motions which indicates that the slowly varying wave drift forces need to be considered in the design of the mooring system for a floating closed cage keywords marine aquaculture closed fish cage wave induced response sloshing numerical modelling 1 introduction fish farming in floating closed cages has gained increased interest in recent years as a strategy to mitigate the problems with sea lice and the negative environmental impact which are often associated with the open net cage systems that are widely used for sea based production of atlantic salmon salmo salar the existing concepts of closed fish cages can be categorised as flexible membrane structures fabric semi flexible structures glass fibre and rigid structures steel or concrete based on the construction materials being used and to what degree the cage can deform kristiansen et al 2018a from a marine hydrodynamics perspective a closed cage represents a large volume structure filled with liquid ocean waves may excite free surface oscillation of the contained water inside the cage causing sloshing which is a complex phenomenon with relevance for many applications faltinsen and timokha 2009 the coupling effects of internal hydrodynamics on cage response and structural deformation are important design considerations for floating closed cages however knowledge on and experience with these problems are quite limited as sea based fish farming in closed cages is still a novel concept solaas et al 1993 presented some important design parameters for closed flexible cages which are typically made of coated fabric the flexible nature of these structures implies that hydroelasticity is important to consider in the marine environment løland 1994 a study of drag forces and associated deformations of closed flexible cages was presented in lader et al 2015 and strand et al 2016 followed up by an experimental study on the wave induced responses of the same closed flexible structure lader et al 2017 a combined structural and hydrodynamic model was developed by kristiansen et al 2018b to study the drainage and collapse of a closed flexible cage under specific operational conditions a linear model of two dimensional closed flexible cage in waves was developed by strand and faltinsen 2019 to investigate the coupling effects of sloshing on cage response and structural deformation this model was further developed for the analysis of semi flexible cages including the effect of bending stiffness strand and faltinsen 2020 kristiansen et al 2018a presented a dedicated experimental study of cylindrical closed rigid cages in regular waves and comparison with numerical simulations using linear potential theory in the frequency domain sloshing of the contained water was shown to have large influence on the coupled surge and pitch motions of the cage tan et al 2019 used a single dominant multi modal method for the simulation of sloshing and coupled rigid body motions of a cylindrical closed cage in regular waves it was found that the multi modal method was able to model the swirling waves inside the cage which could lead to violent cage motions even in the direction perpendicular to the incident waves liang et al 2020 used a fully nonlinear time domain harmonic polynomial cell hpc method shao and faltinsen 2014 to study the liquid sloshing problem in a circular cylindrical tank under periodic and transient excitations the sloshing response in terms of free surface elevation as well as hydrodynamic force and moments were evaluated and compared with analytical predictions from the weakly nonlinear multi modal theory in general good agreement was found tsarau et al 2021 presented experimental and numerical studies of a circular cylindrical tank filled with water and subjected to forced oscillations a weakly nonlinear multi modal method faltinsen and timokha 2009 was shown to be able to model both the planar and swirling waves with similar amplitudes to the experiments sloshing experiments with a rotating liquid were also conducted and the results showed that the internal flows might significantly modify the sloshing regimes observed in the non rotating liquid as a continuation of the previous work kristiansen et al 2018a this paper presents an integrated numerical model for analysing the seakeeping behaviour of closed rigid cages and the mooring forces in regular and irregular waves numerical studies are conducted both in the frequency domain and in the time domain and compared with scaled physical experiments the time domain simulation enables the implementation of nonlinear hydrodynamic models and offers the possibility for a complete system analysis e g cage response structural deformation moorings and fish behaviour that most of the existing simulation codes do not provide a model for slowly varying wave drift forces which have great importance in the design of the mooring system for floating large volume structures is implemented sloshing of the contained water inside the cage is modelled based on the weakly nonlinear multi modal method faltinsen and timokha 2009 the coupling effects of sloshing on cage response and the resulting mooring line forces are investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 wamit wamit is a state of the art simulation code distributed and licenced by wamit inc massachusetts usa for analysing wave interactions with floating or submerged marine structures the wave induced response of a three dimensional body in waves is simulated in the frequency domain by evaluating the hydrodynamic pressure and forces on the body surface as well as the fluid velocities the flow is assumed to be potential free of separation or lifting effects and the linearization of the problem permits the decomposition of the velocity potential into the radiation and diffraction components in the present study the so called low order method is used where the geometry of the body is represented by an ensemble of flat quadrilateral panels and the solutions for the velocity potential are approximated by piecewise constant values on each panel www wamit com manual htm wamit provides the option to analyse the linear hydrodynamic parameters for a fluid inside an oscillatory tank or to analyse the coupled problem where one or more tanks are placed within the interior of the body including the dynamic coupling this option is utilized in the present study to simulate the effect of the contained water with a free surface inside the closed cage the tank geometry is defined in the same manner as for the exterior surface of the cage using the low order method the solution for the velocity potential in the tank is computed simultaneously with the velocity potential in the exterior fluid domain outside the cage using an extended linear system which includes all of the fluid domains 2 2 the fhsim framework fhsim is a software platform and framework for mathematical modelling and numerical simulation with a focus on applications within fisheries and aquaculture reite et al 2014 su et al 2019 it has been under continuous development at sintef ocean since 2006 which features a large collection of mathematical models for time domain simulations based on ordinary differential equations odes model development in fhsim is modular where complex systems are modelled as interconnected sub models in the present study new sub models are implemented in fhsim for the simulation of closed rigid cages and sloshing which will be described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 in the following the existing fhsim sub models for the simulation of waves and mooring lines are described in brief 2 2 1 fhsim sub model for the simulation of waves fhsim contains implementations of sea environment models simulating water current and wave fields and a generalized interface for other sub models to query about environmental features such as sea depth current velocity wave elevation and wave induced particle velocity at a specified point in the water volume the implemented wave model supports both eulerian and lagrangian linear wave theories and realization of jonswap and issc wave spectra based on the superposition principle the generated wave field is in general assumed to be undisturbed by other sub models however wave radiation and diffraction faltinsen 1993 can be considered in other sub models see e g in section 2 3 for the calculation of wave induced forces 2 2 2 fhsim sub model for the simulation of mooring lines a generic cable model in fhsim is used for the simulation of mooring lines which are attached to other sub models e g a fish cage or a fixed point in space e g an anchor point the cable model is essentially a collection of 6 degrees of freedom dof rigid bar elements which are connected with axial and angular constraints the constraints are regularized through an elastic version of the baumgarte stabilization method baumgarte 1972 in effect the rigid bar elements can be thought of as connected with axial and angular springs like a traditional spring mass damper model but without some of the numerical instability problems associated with high stiffness the behaviour of the springs is regularized with three parameters α β and ε where α is the damping factor β controls the rate at which the constraint seeks towards equilibrium and ε is the constraint compliance the effective spring stiffness is a combination of β ε and the mathematical formulation of the constraint function for the axial spring the effective stiffness is β 2 ε e a l where e is the young s modulus of the material a is the element s cross sectional area and l is the element s length for the bending angular spring the effective stiffness is β 2 ε e i l where i is the element s second moments of area for bending for the torsional angular spring the effective stiffness is β 2 ε g j l where g is the shear modulus of the material and j is the element s second moments of area for torsion the mooring lines are subject to gravity buoyancy hydrodynamic and viscous forces and forces exerted by other sub models attached to them these forces are computed separately for each element comprising the cable as well as the constraint equations providing desired structural properties for modelling the dynamic response the cable model has been used for the simulation of a full aquaculture net cage system in waves and current and validated through comparison with experimental data endresen et al 2014 a thorough description of the theoretical and mathematical background for the cable model can be found in johansen 2007 2 3 modelling of closed rigid cages the 6dof motions denoted by η i i 1 6 of a floating closed rigid cage are modelled in fhsim by cummins equation cummins 1962 in time domain 1 j 1 6 m i j a i j η j t 0 t k i j t τ η j τ d τ c i j η j t f i s u m t where m i j is the component of the generalized mass matrix a i j is the added mass coefficient at infinity frequency k i j is the impulse response function representing the fluid memory effects c i j is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient and f i s u m t represents the sum of wave excitation forces slow drift forces nonlinear viscous damping mooring forces and forces induced by the contained water note that all the forces and coefficients are defined with respect to the cage fixed coordinate system in the present study the added mass damping and hydrostatic restoring coefficients are obtained from the frequency domain calculations in wamit without internal tank for a range of frequencies the frequency domain data are also used for a state space approximation of the convolution term of cummins equation and calculation of the wave excitation and slow drift forces 2 3 1 state space approximation of the radiation forces associated with fluid memory effects the convolution term of cummins equation can be approximated by a linear state space model kristiansen and egeland 2003 fossen 2005 2 μ i j t 0 t k i j t τ η j τ d τ 3 χ i j t a i j χ i j t b i j η j t 4 μ i j t c i j χ i j t d i j η j t where μ i j t is the output of the state space model that approximates the impulse response function in dof i to an impulse velocity in dof j χ i j t is the state vector of the state space model a i j b i j c i j and d i j are the parametric system matrices as compared with the direct computation of the convolution integral the state space approximation has advantages in terms of the computation speed which can improve up to two orders of magnitude depending on the number of dofs considered taghipour et al 2008 in the present study the vector fitting system identification method gustavsen and semlyen 1999 gustavsen 2006 is used to select the system matrices a i j b i j c i j and d i j for each dof combination i 1 6 j 1 6 based on the calculated added mass and damping coefficients for a range of frequencies a thorough description of the frequency domain identification of parametric state space models can be found in kristiansen 2005 and pérez and fossen 2008 2 3 2 convolution integral and state space approximation of the excitation forces the first order wave excitation force in time domain can be expressed as 5 f i e x c t 0 t h i e x c t τ ξ i n c τ d τ where ξ i n c is the incident wave elevation at the centre of the structure and h i e x c is the impulse response function for the excitation force which can be calculated using the inverse fourier transform of the corresponding force coefficient in frequency domain similar to the radiation force a state space model can be used to approximate the convolution integral for the excitation force yu and falnes 1995 taghipour et al 2008 in the present study the first order excitation forces for long crested irregular waves are evaluated based on the superposition principle 6 f i e x c t j 1 n a j t j h i cos ω j t ε j where n is the number of regular wave components used for the time domain realization of jonswap spectrum a j ω j and ε j are the wave amplitude circular frequency and relative phase angle of wave component number j and t i h i is the transfer function of the wave excitation force for dof i which can be obtained from the first order frequency domain solution for each regular wave component 2 3 3 newman s approximation of the slow drift forces for a moored large volume structure the restoring provided by the mooring lines leads to large resonance periods of the horizontal motions and slow drift motions can occur in the horizontal plane in the present study the newman s approximation newman 1974 is used to calculate the slowly varying wave drift forces for long crested irregular waves considering the second order difference frequency effects 7 f i s d t j 1 n k 1 n a j a k t j d i t k d i cos ω k ω j t ε k ε j where t j d i is the transfer function of the mean drift force for dof i which depends only on the first order frequency domain solution for each regular wave component for example in wamit the mean drift force can be evaluated based on either pressure integration or momentum conservation principle without calculation of the second order velocity potential this expression is also valid for regular wave i e these is only one wave component in this case the calculated slow drift force is equal to the constant mean drift force 2 4 modelling of sloshing a weakly nonlinear multi modal method faltinsen and timokha 2009 using the fourier modal approximate solution of the free surface elevation with time dependent coefficients is implemented in fhsim to simulate sloshing of the contained water inside a closed rigid cage the cage is considered to be a vertical cylindrical tank of radius r which is partially filled with an inviscid incompressible liquid of depth h 2 4 1 natural sloshing modes following modal theory the free surface elevation ξ inside the cage is expanded as a series in terms of so called natural sloshing modes χ m i k x y 8 ξ x y t m i k β m i k t χ m i k x y where β m i k are the generalized coordinates for liquid motion which are infinite in number and the sum goes over all β according to linear potential flow theory the natural modes for an upright circular cylinder in a cylindrical coordinate system r θ z read as 9 χ m i k x y χ m i k r cos θ r sin θ j m l m i r r j m l m i cos m θ sin m θ where j m is the bessel function of the first kind of order m and l m i are the nondimensional roots of the equation j m l m i 0 and index k 1 or 2 corresponds to the cosine or sine mode terms respectively for each natural mode the corresponding natural frequencies are 10 σ m i 2 g r l m i tanh l m i h r where g is the acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s2 and m 0 1 2 i 1 2 are the so called azimuthal and radial mode numbers respectively 2 4 2 modal equations for prescribed tank motions when rigid body motions η i are known the following ordinary differential equations describe liquid motion in terms of the generalized coordinates 11 β 1 j 1 σ 1 j 2 β 1 j 1 2 σ 1 j δ 1 j β 1 j b 1 j 1 p j η 1 g η 5 s j η 5 12 β 1 j 2 σ 1 j 2 β 1 j 2 2 σ 1 j δ 1 j β 1 j b 1 j 2 p j η 2 g η 4 s j η 4 13 β 2 j k σ 2 j 2 β 2 j k 2 σ 2 j δ 2 j β 2 j b 2 j k 0 k 1 2 14 β 0 j 1 σ 0 j 2 β 0 j

have a nonzero contribution and index k 1 or 2 corresponds to the cosine or sine mode terms respectively and b i j k are the nonlinear terms defined below the linear damping term with modal damping ratios denoted by δ m j is introduced artificially in order to achieve steady state solutions of the modal equations possible values of δ m j are discussed in section 2 4 3 the nonlinear terms in the above modal equations for tank excitation frequencies close to σ 1 1 was derived by lukovsky 1990 following faltinsen and timokha 2009 we use the traditional notations p 1 β 1 1 1 r 1 β 1 1 2 p 0 β 0 1 1 p 2 β 2 1 1 r 2 β 2 1 2 such that the nonlinear terms read 17 b 1 1 1 d 1 r 2 p 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 2 r 1 r 1 r 1 2 d 2 r 2 r 1 2 p 1 2 r 1 r 1 p 1 r 1 p 1 r 1 2 p 1 r 1 2 d 3 r p 2 p 1 r 2 r 1 r 1 r 2 p 1 p 2 d 4 r p 1 p 2 r 1 r 2 d 5 r p 0 p 1 p 1 p 0 d 6 r p 1 p 0 18 b 1 1 2 d 1 r 2 r 1 r 1 r 1 r 1 2 p 1 p 1 p 1 2 d 2 r 2 p 1 2 p 1 2 p 1 r 1 p 1 r 1 p 1 p 1 2 r 1 p 1 2 d 3 r p 2 r 1 r 2 p 1 r 1 p

r 1 2 d 7 r r 1 p 1 the coefficient d 1 d 10 in these nonlinear terms are tabulated by faltinsen and timokha 2009 for a range of h r between 0 2 and 3 0 the presented model includes nonlinear terms only for the two primary excited modes 1 1 1 and 1 1 2 and the secondary modes 0 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 thus there is no coupling between the third order modes and higher 2 4 3 viscous energy dissipation although potential theory assumes inviscid liquid viscous energy dissipation in the liquid can be included in the modal equations for liquid motion as shown in the previous section in general there is viscous dissipation in both the boundary layers and in the bulk of the fluid however bulk damping is often considered small relative to boundary layer damping and is usually neglected faltinsen and timokha 2009 royon lebeaud et al 2007 have shown that for dissipation at the boundaries of a circular cylindrical tank the damping ratios can be estimated using the following analytical expression 22 δ m n 1 2 r ν 2 σ m n 1 2 2 l m n sinh 2 l m n h r 2 l m n cosh 2 l m n h r sinh 2 l m n h r 1 m l m n 2 1 m l m n 2 2 l m n h r sinh 2 l m n h r where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid note however that royon lebeaud et al 2007 used this expression for smooth wall cylinders aquaculture cages for salmon production may have nonsmooth walls e g due to biofouling and are typically equipped with pipe systems for generating a liquid flow inside the cage which may contribute to the viscous damping 2 4 4 hydrodynamic force the total hydrodynamic force on the cage can be expressed via the generalized coordinates following faltinsen and timokha 2009 23 f η 1 π ρ r 2 h g η 5 η 1 1 2 h η 5 j 1 i r π ρ r 3 l 1 j 2 β 1 j 1 24 f η 2 π ρ r 2 h g η 4 η 2 1 2 h η 4 j 1 i r π ρ r 3 l 1 j 2 β 1 j 2 25 f η 3 π ρ r 2 h g η 3 where ρ is the liquid density likewise the hydrodynamic moment can also be expressed via the generalized coordinates for an axisymmetric cylinder the expressions for the non zero components reduce to 26 f η 4 π ρ r 2 h 2 2 g η 4 η 2 j 01 1 η 4 j 1 i r g π ρ r 3 l 1 j 2 β 1 j 1 2 π ρ r 4 tanh h 2 r l 1 j l 1 j 3 β 1 j 1 27 f η 5 π ρ r 2 h 2 2 g η 5 η 1 j 02 1 η 5 j 1 i r g π ρ r 3 l 1 j 2 β 1 j 2 2 π ρ r 4 tanh h 2 r l 1 j l 1 j 3 β 1 j 2 28 j 01 1 j 02 1 π ρ r 2 1 3 h 3 3 4 h r 2 16 r 3 j 1 i r tanh h 2 r l 1 j l 1 j 3 l 1 j 2 1 where the non zero components j 01 1 and j 02 1 of the so called joukowsky inertial tensor are given as in tan et al 2019 after correcting the typo in the original expression by faltinsen and timokha 2009 note also that eqs 23 27 are given in the cage fixed coordinate system with the origin in the centre of the equilibrium free surface of the liquid 2 5 scaled physical experiment physical experiments with a scaled model of cylindrical closed rigid cage were performed in the ocean basin of sintef ocean to ensure similarity of relevant physical parameters e g velocities forces and moments between full scale and model scale froude scaling was applied with a chosen scale factor of 1 27 the basin is 80 m long 50 m wide and equipped with an adjustable floor the depth was set to 5 m equivalent to 135 m in full scale thereby assuming deep water condition for the selected waves the main dimensions and a sketch of the model are given in fig 1 where the ratio of cage depth to cage diameter is equal to 0 5 h d 0 5 the model was made of polycarbonate resin lexan reinforced with aluminium plates along the side wall and steel tubes exterior to the bottom to reduce the flexibility of the cage the cage tank was filled with water up to the design mean water line the freeboard was 0 35 m from the mean water line to the top rim of the model to ensure sufficient stability and buoyancy a torus shaped floating collar made of plastic electrical tube and reinforced with two aluminium rings was attached to the cage model the model was located in the centre of the basin with incoming waves generated in line with the global x axis as shown in fig 1 the mooring configuration consisted of four equally spaced mooring lines which were attached to the floating collar centred in the design mean water line of the cage the other end of each mooring line was attached far away to a horizontal free hanging coil spring the stiffness of each coil spring was 60 n m and a pretension of 45 n was applied to all mooring lines yielding an equivalent horizontal stiffness in x and in y directions as shown in fig 1 of 170 n m for the system the pretension in the mooring lines also provided an additional pitch restoring coefficient of 67 5 nm rad approximated as the mooring line pretension multiplied by cage diameter the model was tested in regular waves with the wave periods in the range between 0 63 s and 2 5 s some of the test runs were not performed due to time constrains corresponding to the relative wavelengths i e the ratio of wavelength to cage diameter λ d in the range from 0 41 to 6 5 irregular wave tests were performed using a typical jonswap spectrum with four different combinations of peak period t p and significant wave height h s prior to the testing the wave field was calibrated without the presence of the model and a wave probe wave2 was used to measure wave elevations in the centre of the basin where the model would be located all tests were performed with 100 filling ratio such that the water level inside the model was same as the external mean free surface in the testing motions of the cage were measured using an optical positioning system where the positions of the reflective markers pos1 8 mounted along the cage side wall 32 328 with respect to the positive x axis were tracked from camera images three accelerometers acc1 3 were also mounted on the model for a benchmark check of the measured motions from the optical positioning markers sloshing of the contained water inside the cage and the wave elevation outside were measured by a set of wave probes rw1 8 internal wave probe rw9 16 external wave probe distributed along the circumferential direction 22 337 with respect to the positive x axis of the cage and with a radial distance of d 40 from the side wall two more wave probes wave1 and wave3 were installed 5 m away from the model to measure the front and side waves tensions in the mooring lines were measured by the uni axial load cells l1 4 installed between the cage and each mooring line a thorough description of the model and instrumentation setup can be found in shen et al 2021 as well as the measurement accuracy e g the specified measurement errors of the optical positioning marker and the wave probe were below 0 2 mm and 1 0 mm respectively and processing of the experimental data these are not further discussed in the present paper while the analysed data by shen et al 2021 are used for comparisons with the numerical simulation results 2 6 simulation experiments the closed cage was modelled in wamit as a moored floating body in the water of infinite depth the geometry of the physical model was discretized by an ensemble of flat quadrilateral panels as shown in fig 2 where the geometrical representation of the floating collar was simplified to avoid numerical problems simplifications of the geometry representation were made such that the water plane area and the displacement of the cage was conserved an interior liquid tank represented by the green panels in fig 2 was applied to model the coupling effects of the contained water on the rigid body motions of the cage the moorings were modelled as linear restoring forces with equivalent spring constants from the physical experiment the time domain simulation model in fhsim consists of the waves the closed cage the contained water and the mooring lines as shown in fig 3 which were set up similarly to the physical experiment the methods introduced in sections 2 2 to 2 4 and the frequency domain data obtained from the calculations with wamit were used to simulate the instantaneous responses of the cage and the mooring lines in both regular and irregular wave conditions in a previous experimental study kristiansen et al 2018a two model configurations were tested i e a wet model where the closed cage was filled with water and a dry model where the contained water was replaced by fixed weights to resemble frozen water these two cage models were made of same materials and had same dimensions as in the present experiment except for the depth h d 0 25 which was 1 2 of the present model as shown in figs 3 and 4 the same mooring lines and pretensions were used for the wet and dry models which provided an equivalent horizontal stiffness of 180 n m close to the present setup both of the wet and dry models were simulated in fhsim as a supplementation to the present model for a better understanding of the influence of sloshing on the wave induced responses of closed cages 3 results the experimental data described in section 2 5 and the corresponding numerical simulation results are presented in this section with a focus on the global response of the cage the results of decay tests are presented in the first place followed by the results in regular and irregular waves all values are presented in full scale i e scaled up by froude scaling with a chosen scale factor of 1 27 3 1 results of decay tests free decay tests were performed to identify the natural periods of cage motions and the corresponding damping levels the testes were started by giving the model an initial perturbation from equilibrium in the considered mode of motion trying to minimize the coupling with other modes the nonlinear viscous damping was considered in the time domain simulations fhsim by using a drag coefficient of 0 6 which was evaluated based on the model test data of a similar cylindrical structure in current fokk 2010 as shown in fig 5 the simulated surge decay responses are in good agreement with the experimental results the surge natural periods obtained from the experiment and the time domain simulation are 116 4 s and 115 6 s respectively the corresponding damping ratios are 0 026 and 0 024 the heave natural period obtained from the time domain simulation fig 6 is 10 6 s and the corresponding damping ratio is 0 055 while there is no experimental data on the heave decay response the pitch natural period obtained from the experiment fig 7 is 14 4 s the simulation result is about 9 smaller i e 13 1 s the corresponding damping ratios are 0 095 and 0 066 respectively the differences between the numerical and model test results especially for the pitch response are mainly attributed to the simplified body geometry in the numerical model where the hydrostatic restoring coefficients were assumed to be constant corresponding to the mean water plane while it was observed in the model tests that the floating collar could easily go in and out of water due to small draft causing time dependent restoring force or moment shen et al 2021 the decay tests do not provide information about the coupled natural periods between cage motions surge and pith and sloshing as it takes a long transient phase with given forcing frequency to develop steady state internal waves the natural sloshing periods t m i associated with the first four azimuthal m 0 1 2 3 and two radial i 1 2 modes defined by the multi modal method eq 10 are presented in table 1 as well as the calculated natural periods of cage motions 3 2 results in regular waves in the physical experiments the incident waves were documented by wave calibration tests for all wave conditions with no model present in the basin the generated incident waves at the model location were found to be in agreement with the wave parameters input to the wavemaker for the major part of the test wave conditions typical time series obtained from the regular wave tests and the corresponding time domain simulations are presented in figs 8 10 for each test simulation a time window was chosen from where steady state values of incident wave height and corresponding rigid body motion amplitudes were extracted the calculated response amplitude operators rao s for surge heave and pitch are presented in figs 11 13 respectively where the steady state motion amplitudes are normalized by the measured simulated incident wave amplitudes the obtained time series from the simulation and the calculated surge heave and pitch rao s are in good agreement with the experimental results for wave periods shorter than 7 s the increased deviations for longer wave periods are attributed to the difference in the pitch natural period predicted by fhsim 13 1 s relative to that obtained from the experiment 14 9 s the rao s obtained from the frequency domain simulation wamit are also presented in figs 11 13 and they are in good agreement with the time domain simulation results for the major part of wave periods in addition the surge heave and pitch natural periods predicted by wamit coincide with those predicted by fhsim due to coupling effects large surge motions are predicted around the pitch resonance period by applying an additional pitch damping ratio ζ p 0 05 added damping equal to 5 of critical damping in the time domain simulation the obtained surge rao s around the pitch natural period are more comparable with the experimental results fig 14 shows the time series of the simulated pitch responses around the resonance period and comparison with the experimental results the response amplitudes obtained from the experiment and simulation tend to be in the same range however the measured responses seem to be unsteady during the limited testing time and the dominant period is not associated with the wave period therefore the pitch rao is not calculated for this test wave condition period t 12 99 s steepness h λ 1 60 the cage model used in the physical experiment was not fully rigid this could have influenced the comparisons between the experimental and numerical results as well as the nonlinear hydrodynamic effects that have not been considered in the numerical models for example submergence of local sections of the floating collar due to the waves will cause a time dependent pitch restoring moment this effect is not included in the present numerical model where a linear restoring moment corresponding to the mean water plane area is used in the experiments a nonlinear phenomenon of sub harmonic response in pitch is observed for the wave period t 12 99 s as shown in fig 14 the same behaviour is not observed in the simulations the pitch response in the first part of the measured time series follows the wave period while about 550 s after start up a process with the doubling of the response period is seen to emerge following the doubling of the response period is a significant increase of the response amplitude a typical example of sub harmonic response in marine hydrodynamics is so called parametric rolling of ships where a time dependent quasi static restoring moment in roll due to the waves causing a parametric excitation this effect is not further discussed in the present paper due to the limited experimental data only for the wave period t 12 99 s 3 3 results in irregular waves the long crested irregular wave tests and simulations were performed using a standard jonswap spectrum peakedness factor 3 3 with four different combinations of the input peak periods and significant wave heights t p 5 0 s 6 0 s 7 8 s 10 0 s h s 1 5 m 2 0 m 3 0 m 3 0 m examples of the time series obtained from the experiments and the time domain simulations in irregular waves are presented in figs 15 18 the power spectra of the corresponding surge responses are shown in fig 19 the obtained time series from the simulation are in general comparable with the experimental results the measured pitch motions fig 16 and internal water surface elevations fig 17 show a higher degree of nonlinearities which can be attributed to the time dependent pitch restoring coefficient and the ovalizing deformation modes of the cage according to shen et al 2021 these effects are not considered in the present numerical models and remain to be further investigated as shown in fig 19 the dominant low frequency responses in irregular waves correspond to the resonance oscillations excited around the surge natural frequency 0 009 hz of the moored system due to the slow drift forces the amplitudes of the slow drift motions of the cage are found to be considerably larger than the first order responses associated with the incoming wave frequencies in the four tested simulated irregular wave conditions 4 discussions 4 1 the influence of sloshing on cage responses comparisons of obtained rao s from the experiments kristiansen et al 2018a and the corresponding numerical simulations wamit and fhsim with the dry and wet model configurations in regular waves show large impact of sloshing on the surge and pitch motions of the cage figs 20 and 22 while no visible impact on the heave motion fig 21 the heave rao s obtained from the experiments with the dry and wet model configurations were almost identical this is consistent with linear potential flow theory that there is no influence of sloshing on the heave motion newman 2005 faltinsen and timokha 2009 as shown in fig 20 the surge response amplitudes are amplified by about 200 for wave periods around the natural period t 2 1 5 40 s of sloshing corresponding to the symmetric mode shape σ 2 1 see the definition in eq 10 however according to linear potential flow theory symmetric sloshing modes does not yield any surge force the local maximum of the surge rao around t 2 1 5 40 s for the wet model is attributed to the frequency dependent added mass of the contained water being negative for the actual frequency and hence cancelling out parts of the inertia force reducing the effective mass of the structure by applying an additional modal damping ratio ζ m 0 05 in the time domain simulation fhsim with the wet model configuration i e when sloshing was damped lower surge rao s were obtained around this frequency this result further indicates the influence of sloshing on the surge motion of the cage in the experiments with the wet model configuration a nonlinear effect of wave steepness on the surge response was observed around t 2 1 which could not be captured by the linear wamit and weakly nonlinear fhsim sloshing models it is noted that the nonlinearity appears as an excitation causing the response to increase with increasing wave steepness in the experiments the cage model was also observed to perform elastic deformations characterized by ovalizing of the water plane cross section for this case as shown in fig 22 the pitch motion amplitudes of the wet model are largely reduced compared to those of the dry model around the pitch resonance period this is because the presence of internal free surface has a destabilizing effect that increases the pitch natural period of the cage for both the dry and wet model configurations deviations were observed between the measured and simulated pitch motions this is also attributed to the difference in the pitch natural period predicted by wamit and fhsim relative to that obtained from the experiment the results obtained from the time domain simulations fhsim are in general more comparable with the experimental results when an additional modal damping ratio ζ m 0 05 was applied for longer wave periods especially around the pitch natural period of the cage 4 2 mean drift forces in regular waves comparisons of the measured and simulated time series of mooring line tensions in regular waves show that the mean drift forces are considerable and influenced by sloshing fig 23 in the experiments with the dry and wet model configurations kristiansen et al 2018a wave reflections from the side walls of the towing tank were also found to have large influence on the mean drift forces and result in large scatter of the measurement results these effects were negligible in the present experiments as the ocean basin is considerably wide and equipped with absorption beaches along both the short and long basin sides which reduce wave reflections to a minimum the present experimental results fig 24 show a clear influence of sloshing on the mean drift forces when the surge response is amplified due to sloshing for wave periods around 5 5 s as shown in fig 11 which is consistent with the numerical results other effects that could have influenced the measured mean drift forces were the precision of the load cells when measuring small quantities the nonlinear hydrodynamic effects due to the in and out of water motion of the floating collar in waves and the elastic deformation of the cage 4 3 slow drift forces in irregular waves the surge motion of the cage and the resulting mooring line forces were found to be dominated by the slow drift effects in the four tested simulated irregular wave conditions fig 25 shows the time series of the measured and simulated surge responses in the irregular wave t p 7 8 s h s 3 0 m where the dominant frequency 0 009 hz corresponds to the surge natural frequency of the cage fig 26 fig 27 shows the time series of the simulated surge responses in a comparative regular wave condition t 7 8 s h 3 0 m where the dominant frequency 0 128 hz is associated with the incoming wave frequency fig 28 the amplitudes of the dominant slow drift motions in the irregular wave are about 500 larger than the dominant first order motions in the regular wave the corresponding mooring forces are also considerably larger in the irregular wave fig 29 as compared with the forces in the regular wave fig 30 fig 31 shows the filtered time series of the mooring forces using band pass filtering in the irregular wave where the calculated standard deviations of the low frequency components 0 0 05 hz are found to be much larger than the high frequency components 0 1 0 15 hz and very close to the standard deviations of the total forces original this further indicates that the slow drift forces are of great importance in the mooring system analysis for a closed cage similar to the present configuration 5 conclusions in the present paper the seakeeping behaviour of a closed rigid fish cage in waves has been studied by numerical modelling both in the frequency domain wamit and in the time domain fhsim the numerical simulation results are compared with the measurement data obtained from scaled physical experiments the main findings from the numerical and comparative studies are as follows the linear frequency domain simulations with wamit are able to evaluate the coupling effects of sloshing on the wave induced rigid body motions of closed cage the predicted surge heave and pitch rao s and mean drift forces in regular waves are in general comparable with the experimental data the results obtained from the time domain simulations with fhsim are in good agreement with wamit for all the tested model configurations in regular waves in addition the time domain simulations are able to evaluate the slow drift motions of closed rigid cage in irregular waves and the local instantaneous forces from each mooring line the corresponding results are in general comparable with the experimental data the comparative analyses show that sloshing has large influence on the coupled surge and pitch motions of closed cage sloshing is also found to have significant effect on the mean drift forces in regular waves especially when the surge response is amplified due to sloshing the amplitudes of the dominant slow drift motions in the tested simulated irregular waves are found to be considerably larger than the dominant first order motions in regular waves which indicates that the slowly varying wave drift forces need to be considered in the design of the mooring system for a floating closed cage the weakly nonlinear multi modal method implemented in fhsim is able to model both the planar and swirling waves inside a cylindrical tank tsarau et al 2021 however analyses of the surface wave patterns and the corresponding sloshing modes are not the focus of the present study the linear potential flow theory and the weakly nonlinear multi modal method are not able to capture some nonlinear hydrodynamic effects that might have influenced the comparisons between the numerical and experimental results the present time domain simulation model needs to be extended for considering the relevant nonlinear hydrodynamic effects as well as the elastic deformation of a closed cage i e the hydroelastic effects credit

20660,closed fish cages have gained increased interest in marine aquaculture however knowledge on the seakeeping behaviour of a floating closed cage and the influence of the contained water inside the cage are still limited in this paper a coupled numerical model is developed for the simulation of closed rigid cages in waves numerical studies are conducted both in the frequency domain and in the time domain and compared with scaled physical experiments special attention has been drawn to the coupling effects of sloshing on cage response and the resulting mooring line forces the comparative analyses show that sloshing of the contained water has large influence on the coupled surge and pitch motions of the cage sloshing is also found to have significant effect on the mean drift forces in regular waves in the tested simulated irregular waves the mooring forces are found to be dominated by the slow drift motions which indicates that the slowly varying wave drift forces need to be considered in the design of the mooring system for a floating closed cage keywords marine aquaculture closed fish cage wave induced response sloshing numerical modelling 1 introduction fish farming in floating closed cages has gained increased interest in recent years as a strategy to mitigate the problems with sea lice and the negative environmental impact which are often associated with the open net cage systems that are widely used for sea based production of atlantic salmon salmo salar the existing concepts of closed fish cages can be categorised as flexible membrane structures fabric semi flexible structures glass fibre and rigid structures steel or concrete based on the construction materials being used and to what degree the cage can deform kristiansen et al 2018a from a marine hydrodynamics perspective a closed cage represents a large volume structure filled with liquid ocean waves may excite free surface oscillation of the contained water inside the cage causing sloshing which is a complex phenomenon with relevance for many applications faltinsen and timokha 2009 the coupling effects of internal hydrodynamics on cage response and structural deformation are important design considerations for floating closed cages however knowledge on and experience with these problems are quite limited as sea based fish farming in closed cages is still a novel concept solaas et al 1993 presented some important design parameters for closed flexible cages which are typically made of coated fabric the flexible nature of these structures implies that hydroelasticity is important to consider in the marine environment løland 1994 a study of drag forces and associated deformations of closed flexible cages was presented in lader et al 2015 and strand et al 2016 followed up by an experimental study on the wave induced responses of the same closed flexible structure lader et al 2017 a combined structural and hydrodynamic model was developed by kristiansen et al 2018b to study the drainage and collapse of a closed flexible cage under specific operational conditions a linear model of two dimensional closed flexible cage in waves was developed by strand and faltinsen 2019 to investigate the coupling effects of sloshing on cage response and structural deformation this model was further developed for the analysis of semi flexible cages including the effect of bending stiffness strand and faltinsen 2020 kristiansen et al 2018a presented a dedicated experimental study of cylindrical closed rigid cages in regular waves and comparison with numerical simulations using linear potential theory in the frequency domain sloshing of the contained water was shown to have large influence on the coupled surge and pitch motions of the cage tan et al 2019 used a single dominant multi modal method for the simulation of sloshing and coupled rigid body motions of a cylindrical closed cage in regular waves it was found that the multi modal method was able to model the swirling waves inside the cage which could lead to violent cage motions even in the direction perpendicular to the incident waves liang et al 2020 used a fully nonlinear time domain harmonic polynomial cell hpc method shao and faltinsen 2014 to study the liquid sloshing problem in a circular cylindrical tank under periodic and transient excitations the sloshing response in terms of free surface elevation as well as hydrodynamic force and moments were evaluated and compared with analytical predictions from the weakly nonlinear multi modal theory in general good agreement was found tsarau et al 2021 presented experimental and numerical studies of a circular cylindrical tank filled with water and subjected to forced oscillations a weakly nonlinear multi modal method faltinsen and timokha 2009 was shown to be able to model both the planar and swirling waves with similar amplitudes to the experiments sloshing experiments with a rotating liquid were also conducted and the results showed that the internal flows might significantly modify the sloshing regimes observed in the non rotating liquid as a continuation of the previous work kristiansen et al 2018a this paper presents an integrated numerical model for analysing the seakeeping behaviour of closed rigid cages and the mooring forces in regular and irregular waves numerical studies are conducted both in the frequency domain and in the time domain and compared with scaled physical experiments the time domain simulation enables the implementation of nonlinear hydrodynamic models and offers the possibility for a complete system analysis e g cage response structural deformation moorings and fish behaviour that most of the existing simulation codes do not provide a model for slowly varying wave drift forces which have great importance in the design of the mooring system for floating large volume structures is implemented sloshing of the contained water inside the cage is modelled based on the weakly nonlinear multi modal method faltinsen and timokha 2009 the coupling effects of sloshing on cage response and the resulting mooring line forces are investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 wamit wamit is a state of the art simulation code distributed and licenced by wamit inc massachusetts usa for analysing wave interactions with floating or submerged marine structures the wave induced response of a three dimensional body in waves is simulated in the frequency domain by evaluating the hydrodynamic pressure and forces on the body surface as well as the fluid velocities the flow is assumed to be potential free of separation or lifting effects and the linearization of the problem permits the decomposition of the velocity potential into the radiation and diffraction components in the present study the so called low order method is used where the geometry of the body is represented by an ensemble of flat quadrilateral panels and the solutions for the velocity potential are approximated by piecewise constant values on each panel www wamit com manual htm wamit provides the option to analyse the linear hydrodynamic parameters for a fluid inside an oscillatory tank or to analyse the coupled problem where one or more tanks are placed within the interior of the body including the dynamic coupling this option is utilized in the present study to simulate the effect of the contained water with a free surface inside the closed cage the tank geometry is defined in the same manner as for the exterior surface of the cage using the low order method the solution for the velocity potential in the tank is computed simultaneously with the velocity potential in the exterior fluid domain outside the cage using an extended linear system which includes all of the fluid domains 2 2 the fhsim framework fhsim is a software platform and framework for mathematical modelling and numerical simulation with a focus on applications within fisheries and aquaculture reite et al 2014 su et al 2019 it has been under continuous development at sintef ocean since 2006 which features a large collection of mathematical models for time domain simulations based on ordinary differential equations odes model development in fhsim is modular where complex systems are modelled as interconnected sub models in the present study new sub models are implemented in fhsim for the simulation of closed rigid cages and sloshing which will be described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 in the following the existing fhsim sub models for the simulation of waves and mooring lines are described in brief 2 2 1 fhsim sub model for the simulation of waves fhsim contains implementations of sea environment models simulating water current and wave fields and a generalized interface for other sub models to query about environmental features such as sea depth current velocity wave elevation and wave induced particle velocity at a specified point in the water volume the implemented wave model supports both eulerian and lagrangian linear wave theories and realization of jonswap and issc wave spectra based on the superposition principle the generated wave field is in general assumed to be undisturbed by other sub models however wave radiation and diffraction faltinsen 1993 can be considered in other sub models see e g in section 2 3 for the calculation of wave induced forces 2 2 2 fhsim sub model for the simulation of mooring lines a generic cable model in fhsim is used for the simulation of mooring lines which are attached to other sub models e g a fish cage or a fixed point in space e g an anchor point the cable model is essentially a collection of 6 degrees of freedom dof rigid bar elements which are connected with axial and angular constraints the constraints are regularized through an elastic version of the baumgarte stabilization method baumgarte 1972 in effect the rigid bar elements can be thought of as connected with axial and angular springs like a traditional spring mass damper model but without some of the numerical instability problems associated with high stiffness the behaviour of the springs is regularized with three parameters α β and ε where α is the damping factor β controls the rate at which the constraint seeks towards equilibrium and ε is the constraint compliance the effective spring stiffness is a combination of β ε and the mathematical formulation of the constraint function for the axial spring the effective stiffness is β 2 ε e a l where e is the young s modulus of the material a is the element s cross sectional area and l is the element s length for the bending angular spring the effective stiffness is β 2 ε e i l where i is the element s second moments of area for bending for the torsional angular spring the effective stiffness is β 2 ε g j l where g is the shear modulus of the material and j is the element s second moments of area for torsion the mooring lines are subject to gravity buoyancy hydrodynamic and viscous forces and forces exerted by other sub models attached to them these forces are computed separately for each element comprising the cable as well as the constraint equations providing desired structural properties for modelling the dynamic response the cable model has been used for the simulation of a full aquaculture net cage system in waves and current and validated through comparison with experimental data endresen et al 2014 a thorough description of the theoretical and mathematical background for the cable model can be found in johansen 2007 2 3 modelling of closed rigid cages the 6dof motions denoted by η i i 1 6 of a floating closed rigid cage are modelled in fhsim by cummins equation cummins 1962 in time domain 1 j 1 6 m i j a i j η j t 0 t k i j t τ η j τ d τ c i j η j t f i s u m t where m i j is the component of the generalized mass matrix a i j is the added mass coefficient at infinity frequency k i j is the impulse response function representing the fluid memory effects c i j is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient and f i s u m t represents the sum of wave excitation forces slow drift forces nonlinear viscous damping mooring forces and forces induced by the contained water note that all the forces and coefficients are defined with respect to the cage fixed coordinate system in the present study the added mass damping and hydrostatic restoring coefficients are obtained from the frequency domain calculations in wamit without internal tank for a range of frequencies the frequency domain data are also used for a state space approximation of the convolution term of cummins equation and calculation of the wave excitation and slow drift forces 2 3 1 state space approximation of the radiation forces associated with fluid memory effects the convolution term of cummins equation can be approximated by a linear state space model kristiansen and egeland 2003 fossen 2005 2 μ i j t 0 t k i j t τ η j τ d τ 3 χ i j t a i j χ i j t b i j η j t 4 μ i j t c i j χ i j t d i j η j t where μ i j t is the output of the state space model that approximates the impulse response function in dof i to an impulse velocity in dof j χ i j t is the state vector of the state space model a i j b i j c i j and d i j are the parametric system matrices as compared with the direct computation of the convolution integral the state space approximation has advantages in terms of the computation speed which can improve up to two orders of magnitude depending on the number of dofs considered taghipour et al 2008 in the present study the vector fitting system identification method gustavsen and semlyen 1999 gustavsen 2006 is used to select the system matrices a i j b i j c i j and d i j for each dof combination i 1 6 j 1 6 based on the calculated added mass and damping coefficients for a range of frequencies a thorough description of the frequency domain identification of parametric state space models can be found in kristiansen 2005 and pérez and fossen 2008 2 3 2 convolution integral and state space approximation of the excitation forces the first order wave excitation force in time domain can be expressed as 5 f i e x c t 0 t h i e x c t τ ξ i n c τ d τ where ξ i n c is the incident wave elevation at the centre of the structure and h i e x c is the impulse response function for the excitation force which can be calculated using the inverse fourier transform of the corresponding force coefficient in frequency domain similar to the radiation force a state space model can be used to approximate the convolution integral for the excitation force yu and falnes 1995 taghipour et al 2008 in the present study the first order excitation forces for long crested irregular waves are evaluated based on the superposition principle 6 f i e x c t j 1 n a j t j h i cos ω j t ε j where n is the number of regular wave components used for the time domain realization of jonswap spectrum a j ω j and ε j are the wave amplitude circular frequency and relative phase angle of wave component number j and t i h i is the transfer function of the wave excitation force for dof i which can be obtained from the first order frequency domain solution for each regular wave component 2 3 3 newman s approximation of the slow drift forces for a moored large volume structure the restoring provided by the mooring lines leads to large resonance periods of the horizontal motions and slow drift motions can occur in the horizontal plane in the present study the newman s approximation newman 1974 is used to calculate the slowly varying wave drift forces for long crested irregular waves considering the second order difference frequency effects 7 f i s d t j 1 n k 1 n a j a k t j d i t k d i cos ω k ω j t ε k ε j where t j d i is the transfer function of the mean drift force for dof i which depends only on the first order frequency domain solution for each regular wave component for example in wamit the mean drift force can be evaluated based on either pressure integration or momentum conservation principle without calculation of the second order velocity potential this expression is also valid for regular wave i e these is only one wave component in this case the calculated slow drift force is equal to the constant mean drift force 2 4 modelling of sloshing a weakly nonlinear multi modal method faltinsen and timokha 2009 using the fourier modal approximate solution of the free surface elevation with time dependent coefficients is implemented in fhsim to simulate sloshing of the contained water inside a closed rigid cage the cage is considered to be a vertical cylindrical tank of radius r which is partially filled with an inviscid incompressible liquid of depth h 2 4 1 natural sloshing modes following modal theory the free surface elevation ξ inside the cage is expanded as a series in terms of so called natural sloshing modes χ m i k x y 8 ξ x y t m i k β m i k t χ m i k x y where β m i k are the generalized coordinates for liquid motion which are infinite in number and the sum goes over all β according to linear potential flow theory the natural modes for an upright circular cylinder in a cylindrical coordinate system r θ z read as 9 χ m i k x y χ m i k r cos θ r sin θ j m l m i r r j m l m i cos m θ sin m θ where j m is the bessel function of the first kind of order m and l m i are the nondimensional roots of the equation j m l m i 0 and index k 1 or 2 corresponds to the cosine or sine mode terms respectively for each natural mode the corresponding natural frequencies are 10 σ m i 2 g r l m i tanh l m i h r where g is the acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s2 and m 0 1 2 i 1 2 are the so called azimuthal and radial mode numbers respectively 2 4 2 modal equations for prescribed tank motions when rigid body motions η i are known the following ordinary differential equations describe liquid motion in terms of the generalized coordinates 11 β 1 j 1 σ 1 j 2 β 1 j 1 2 σ 1 j δ 1 j

have a nonzero contribution and index k 1 or 2 corresponds to the cosine or sine mode terms respectively and b i j k are the nonlinear terms defined below the linear damping term with modal damping ratios denoted by δ m j is introduced artificially in order to achieve steady state solutions of the modal equations possible values of δ m j are discussed in section 2 4 3 the nonlinear terms in the above modal equations for tank excitation frequencies close to σ 1 1 was derived by lukovsky 1990 following faltinsen and timokha 2009 we use the traditional notations p 1 β 1 1 1 r 1 β 1 1 2 p 0 β 0 1 1 p 2 β 2 1 1 r 2 β 2 1 2 such that the nonlinear terms read 17 b 1 1 1 d 1 r 2 p 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 2 r 1 r 1 r 1 2 d 2 r 2 r 1 2 p 1 2 r 1 r 1 p 1 r 1 p 1 r 1 2 p 1 r 1 2 d 3 r p 2 p 1 r 2 r 1 r 1 r 2

r 1 2 d 7 r r 1 p 1 the coefficient d 1 d 10 in these nonlinear terms are tabulated by faltinsen and timokha 2009 for a range of h r between 0 2 and 3 0 the presented model includes nonlinear terms only for the two primary excited modes 1 1 1 and 1 1 2 and the secondary modes 0 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 thus there is no coupling between the third order modes and higher 2 4 3 viscous energy dissipation although potential theory assumes inviscid liquid viscous energy dissipation in the liquid can be included in the modal equations for liquid motion as shown in the previous section in general there is viscous dissipation in both the boundary layers and in the bulk of the fluid however bulk damping is often considered small relative to boundary layer damping and is usually neglected faltinsen and timokha 2009 royon lebeaud et al 2007 have shown that for dissipation at the boundaries of a circular cylindrical tank the damping ratios can be estimated using the following analytical expression 22 δ m n 1 2 r ν 2 σ m n 1 2 2 l m n sinh 2 l m n h r 2 l m n cosh 2 l m n h r sinh 2 l m n h r 1 m l m n 2 1 m l m n 2 2 l m n h r sinh 2 l m n h r where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid note however that royon lebeaud et al 2007 used this expression for smooth wall cylinders aquaculture cages for salmon production may have nonsmooth walls e g due to biofouling and are typically equipped with pipe systems for generating a liquid flow inside the cage which may contribute to the viscous damping 2 4 4 hydrodynamic force the total hydrodynamic force on the cage can be expressed via the generalized coordinates following faltinsen and timokha 2009 23 f η 1 π ρ r 2 h g η 5 η 1 1 2 h η 5 j 1 i r π ρ r 3 l 1 j 2 β 1 j 1 24 f η 2 π ρ r 2 h g η 4 η 2 1 2 h η 4 j 1 i r π ρ r 3 l 1 j 2 β 1 j

j 02 1 of the so called joukowsky inertial tensor are given as in tan et al 2019 after correcting the typo in the original expression by faltinsen and timokha 2009 note also that eqs 23 27 are given in the cage fixed coordinate system with the origin in the centre of the equilibrium free surface of the liquid 2 5 scaled physical experiment physical experiments with a scaled model of cylindrical closed rigid cage were performed in the ocean basin of sintef ocean to ensure similarity of relevant physical parameters e g velocities forces and moments between full scale and model scale froude scaling was applied with a chosen scale factor of 1 27 the basin is 80 m long 50 m wide and equipped with an adjustable floor the depth was set to 5 m equivalent to 135 m in full scale thereby assuming deep water condition for the selected waves the main dimensions and a sketch of the model are given in fig 1 where the ratio of cage depth to cage diameter is equal to 0 5 h d 0 5 the model was made of polycarbonate resin lexan reinforced with aluminium plates along the side wall and steel tubes exterior to the bottom to reduce the flexibility of the cage the cage tank was filled with water up to the design mean water line the freeboard was 0 35 m from the mean water line to the top rim of the model to ensure sufficient stability and buoyancy a torus shaped floating collar made of plastic electrical tube and reinforced with two aluminium rings was attached to the cage model the model was located in the centre of the basin with incoming waves generated in line with the global x axis as shown in fig 1 the mooring configuration consisted of four equally spaced mooring lines which were attached to the floating collar centred in the design mean water line of the cage the other end of each mooring line was attached far away to a horizontal free hanging coil spring the stiffness of each coil spring was 60 n m and a pretension of 45 n was applied to all mooring lines yielding an equivalent horizontal stiffness in x and in y directions as shown in fig 1 of 170 n m for the system the pretension in the mooring lines also provided an additional pitch restoring coefficient of 67 5 nm rad approximated as the mooring line pretension multiplied by cage diameter the model was tested in regular waves with the wave periods in the range between 0 63 s and 2 5 s some of the test runs were not performed due to time constrains corresponding to the relative wavelengths i e the ratio of wavelength to cage diameter λ d in the range from 0 41 to 6 5 irregular wave tests were performed using a typical jonswap spectrum with four different combinations of peak period t p and significant wave height h s prior to the testing the wave field was calibrated without the presence of the model and a wave probe wave2 was used to measure wave elevations in the centre of the basin where the model would be located all tests were performed with 100 filling ratio such that the water level inside the model was same as the external mean free surface in the testing motions of the cage were measured using an optical positioning system where the positions of the reflective markers pos1 8 mounted along the cage side wall 32 328 with respect to the positive x axis were tracked from camera images three accelerometers acc1 3 were also mounted on the model for a benchmark check of the measured motions from the optical positioning markers sloshing of the contained water inside the cage and the wave elevation outside were measured by a set of wave probes rw1 8 internal wave probe rw9 16 external wave probe distributed along the circumferential direction 22 337 with respect to the positive x axis of the cage and with a radial distance of d 40 from the side wall two more wave probes wave1 and wave3 were installed 5 m away from the model to measure the front and side waves tensions in the mooring lines were measured by the uni axial load cells l1 4 installed between the cage and each mooring line a thorough description of the model and instrumentation setup can be found in shen et al 2021 as well as the measurement accuracy e g the specified measurement errors of the optical positioning marker and the wave probe were below 0 2 mm and 1 0 mm respectively and processing of the experimental data these are not further discussed in the present paper while the analysed data by shen et al 2021 are used for comparisons with the numerical simulation results 2 6 simulation experiments the closed cage was modelled in wamit as a moored floating body in the water of infinite depth the geometry of the physical model was discretized by an ensemble of flat quadrilateral panels as shown in fig 2 where the geometrical representation of the floating collar was simplified to avoid numerical problems simplifications of the geometry representation were made such that the water plane area and the displacement of the cage was conserved an interior liquid tank represented by the green panels in fig 2 was applied to model the coupling effects of the contained water on the rigid body motions of the cage the moorings were modelled as linear restoring forces with equivalent spring constants from the physical experiment the time domain simulation model in fhsim consists of the waves the closed cage the contained water and the mooring lines as shown in fig 3 which were set up similarly to the physical experiment the methods introduced in sections 2 2 to 2 4 and the frequency domain data obtained from the calculations with wamit were used to simulate the instantaneous responses of the cage and the mooring lines in both regular and irregular wave conditions in a previous experimental study kristiansen et al 2018a two model configurations were tested i e a wet model where the closed cage was filled with water and a dry model where the contained water was replaced by fixed weights to resemble frozen water these two cage models were made of same materials and had same dimensions as in the present experiment except for the depth h d 0 25 which was 1 2 of the present model as shown in figs 3 and 4 the same mooring lines and pretensions were used for the wet and dry models which provided an equivalent horizontal stiffness of 180 n m close to the present setup both of the wet and dry models were simulated in fhsim as a supplementation to the present model for a better understanding of the influence of sloshing on the wave induced responses of closed cages 3 results the experimental data described in section 2 5 and the corresponding numerical simulation results are presented in this section with a focus on the global response of the cage the results of decay tests are presented in the first place followed by the results in regular and irregular waves all values are presented in full scale i e scaled up by froude scaling with a chosen scale factor of 1 27 3 1 results of decay tests free decay tests were performed to identify the natural periods of cage motions and the corresponding damping levels the testes were started by giving the model an initial perturbation from equilibrium in the considered mode of motion trying to minimize the coupling with other modes the nonlinear viscous damping was considered in the time domain simulations fhsim by using a drag coefficient of 0 6 which was evaluated based on the model test data of a similar cylindrical structure in current fokk 2010 as shown in fig 5 the simulated surge decay responses are in good agreement with the experimental results the surge natural periods obtained from the experiment and the time domain simulation are 116 4 s and 115 6 s respectively the corresponding damping ratios are 0 026 and 0 024 the heave natural period obtained from the time domain simulation fig 6 is 10 6 s and the corresponding damping ratio is 0 055 while there is no experimental data on the heave decay response the pitch natural period obtained from the experiment fig 7 is 14 4 s the simulation result is about 9 smaller i e 13 1 s the corresponding damping ratios are 0 095 and 0 066 respectively the differences between the numerical and model test results especially for the pitch response are mainly attributed to the simplified body geometry in the numerical model where the hydrostatic restoring coefficients were assumed to be constant corresponding to the mean water plane while it was observed in the model tests that the floating collar could easily go in and out of water due to small draft causing time dependent restoring force or moment shen et al 2021 the decay tests do not provide information about the coupled natural periods between cage motions surge and pith and sloshing as it takes a long transient phase with given forcing frequency to develop steady state internal waves the natural sloshing periods t m i associated with the first four azimuthal m 0 1 2 3 and two radial i 1 2 modes defined by the multi modal method eq 10 are presented in table 1 as well as the calculated natural periods of cage motions 3 2 results in regular waves in the physical experiments the incident waves were documented by wave calibration tests for all wave conditions with no model present in the basin the generated incident waves at the model location were found to be in agreement with the wave parameters input to the wavemaker for the major part of the test wave conditions typical time series obtained from the regular wave tests and the corresponding time domain simulations are presented in figs 8 10 for each test simulation a time window was chosen from where steady state values of incident wave height and corresponding rigid body motion amplitudes were extracted the calculated response amplitude operators rao s for surge heave and pitch are presented in figs 11 13 respectively where the steady state motion amplitudes are normalized by the measured simulated incident wave amplitudes the obtained time series from the simulation and the calculated surge heave and pitch rao s are in good agreement with the experimental results for wave periods shorter than 7 s the increased deviations for longer wave periods are attributed to the difference in the pitch natural period predicted by fhsim 13 1 s relative to that obtained from the experiment 14 9 s the rao s obtained from the frequency domain simulation wamit are also presented in figs 11 13 and they are in good agreement with the time domain simulation results for the major part of wave periods in addition the surge heave and pitch natural periods predicted by wamit coincide with those predicted by fhsim due to coupling effects large surge motions are predicted around the pitch resonance period by applying an additional pitch damping ratio ζ p 0 05 added damping equal to 5 of critical damping in the time domain simulation the obtained surge rao s around the pitch natural period are more comparable with the experimental results fig 14 shows the time series of the simulated pitch responses around the resonance period and comparison with the experimental results the response amplitudes obtained from the experiment and simulation tend to be in the same range however the measured responses seem to be unsteady during the limited testing time and the dominant period is not associated with the wave period therefore the pitch rao is not calculated for this test wave condition period t 12 99 s steepness h λ 1 60 the cage model used in the physical experiment was not fully rigid this could have influenced the comparisons between the experimental and numerical results as well as the nonlinear hydrodynamic effects that have not been considered in the numerical models for example submergence of local sections of the floating collar due to the waves will cause a time dependent pitch restoring moment this effect is not included in the present numerical model where a linear restoring moment corresponding to the mean water plane area is used in the experiments a nonlinear phenomenon of sub harmonic response in pitch is observed for the wave period t 12 99 s as shown in fig 14 the same behaviour is not observed in the simulations the pitch response in the first part of the measured time series follows the wave period while about 550 s after start up a process with the doubling of the response period is seen to emerge following the doubling of the response period is a significant increase of the response amplitude a typical example of sub harmonic response in marine hydrodynamics is so called parametric rolling of ships where a time dependent quasi static restoring moment in roll due to the waves causing a parametric excitation this effect is not further discussed in the present paper due to the limited experimental data only for the wave period t 12 99 s 3 3 results in irregular waves the long crested irregular wave tests and simulations were performed using a standard jonswap spectrum peakedness factor 3 3 with four different combinations of the input peak periods and significant wave heights t p 5 0 s 6 0 s 7 8 s 10 0 s h s 1 5 m 2 0 m 3 0 m 3 0 m examples of the time series obtained from the experiments and the time domain simulations in irregular waves are presented in figs 15 18 the power spectra of the corresponding surge responses are shown in fig 19 the obtained time series from the simulation are in general comparable with the experimental results the measured pitch motions fig 16 and internal water surface elevations fig 17 show a higher degree of nonlinearities which can be attributed to the time dependent pitch restoring coefficient and the ovalizing deformation modes of the cage according to shen et al 2021 these effects are not considered in the present numerical models and remain to be further investigated as shown in fig 19 the dominant low frequency responses in irregular waves correspond to the resonance oscillations excited around the surge natural frequency 0 009 hz of the moored system due to the slow drift forces the amplitudes of the slow drift motions of the cage are found to be considerably larger than the first order responses associated with the incoming wave frequencies in the four tested simulated irregular wave conditions 4 discussions 4 1 the influence of sloshing on cage responses comparisons of obtained rao s from the experiments kristiansen et al 2018a and the corresponding numerical simulations wamit and fhsim with the dry and wet model configurations in regular waves show large impact of sloshing on the surge and pitch motions of the cage figs 20 and 22 while no visible impact on the heave motion fig 21 the heave rao s obtained from the experiments with the dry and wet model configurations were almost identical this is consistent with linear potential flow theory that there is no influence of sloshing on the heave motion newman 2005 faltinsen and timokha 2009 as shown in fig 20 the surge response amplitudes are amplified by about 200 for wave periods around the natural period t 2 1 5 40 s of sloshing corresponding to the symmetric mode shape σ 2 1 see the definition in eq 10 however according to linear potential flow theory symmetric sloshing modes does not yield any surge force the local maximum of the surge rao around t 2 1 5 40 s for the wet model is attributed to the frequency dependent added mass of the contained water being negative for the actual frequency and hence cancelling out parts of the inertia force reducing the effective mass of the structure by applying an additional modal damping ratio ζ m 0 05 in the time domain simulation fhsim with the wet model configuration i e when sloshing was damped lower surge rao s were obtained around this frequency this result further indicates the influence of sloshing on the surge motion of the cage in the experiments with the wet model configuration a nonlinear effect of wave steepness on the surge response was observed around t 2 1 which could not be captured by the linear wamit and weakly nonlinear fhsim sloshing models it is noted that the nonlinearity appears as an excitation causing the response to increase with increasing wave steepness in the experiments the cage model was also observed to perform elastic deformations characterized by ovalizing of the water plane cross section for this case as shown in fig 22 the pitch motion amplitudes of the wet model are largely reduced compared to those of the dry model around the pitch resonance period this is because the presence of internal free surface has a destabilizing effect that increases the pitch natural period of the cage for both the dry and wet model configurations deviations were observed between the measured and simulated pitch motions this is also attributed to the difference in the pitch natural period predicted by wamit and fhsim relative to that obtained from the experiment the results obtained from the time domain simulations fhsim are in general more comparable with the experimental results when an additional modal damping ratio ζ m 0 05 was applied for longer wave periods especially around the pitch natural period of the cage 4 2 mean drift forces in regular waves comparisons of the measured and simulated time series of mooring line tensions in regular waves show that the mean drift forces are considerable and influenced by sloshing fig 23 in the experiments with the dry and wet model configurations kristiansen et al 2018a wave reflections from the side walls of the towing tank were also found to have large influence on the mean drift forces and result in large scatter of the measurement results these effects were negligible in the present experiments as the ocean basin is considerably wide and equipped with absorption beaches along both the short and long basin sides which reduce wave reflections to a minimum the present experimental results fig 24 show a clear influence of sloshing on the mean drift forces when the surge response is amplified due to sloshing for wave periods around 5 5 s as shown in fig 11 which is consistent with the numerical results other effects that could have influenced the measured mean drift forces were the precision of the load cells when measuring small quantities the nonlinear hydrodynamic effects due to the in and out of water motion of the floating collar in waves and the elastic deformation of the cage 4 3 slow drift forces in irregular waves the surge motion of the cage and the resulting mooring line forces were found to be dominated by the slow drift effects in the four tested simulated irregular wave conditions fig 25 shows the time series of the measured and simulated surge responses in the irregular wave t p 7 8 s h s 3 0 m where the dominant frequency 0 009 hz corresponds to the surge natural frequency of the cage fig 26 fig 27 shows the time series of the simulated surge responses in a comparative regular wave condition t 7 8 s h 3 0 m where the dominant frequency 0 128 hz is associated with the incoming wave frequency fig 28 the amplitudes of the dominant slow drift motions in the irregular wave are about 500 larger than the dominant first order motions in the regular wave the corresponding mooring forces are also considerably larger in the irregular wave fig 29 as compared with the forces in the regular wave fig 30 fig 31 shows the filtered time series of the mooring forces using band pass filtering in the irregular wave where the calculated standard deviations of the low frequency components 0 0 05 hz are found to be much larger than the high frequency components 0 1 0 15 hz and very close to the standard deviations of the total forces original this further indicates that the slow drift forces are of great importance in the mooring system analysis for a closed cage similar to the present configuration 5 conclusions in the present paper the seakeeping behaviour of a closed rigid fish cage in waves has been studied by numerical modelling both in the frequency domain wamit and in the time domain fhsim the numerical simulation results are compared with the measurement data obtained from scaled physical experiments the main findings from the numerical and comparative studies are as follows the linear frequency domain simulations with wamit are able to evaluate the coupling effects of sloshing on the wave induced rigid body motions of closed cage the predicted surge heave and pitch rao s and mean drift forces in regular waves are in general comparable with the experimental data the results obtained from the time domain simulations with fhsim are in good agreement with wamit for all the tested model configurations in regular waves in addition the time domain simulations are able to evaluate the slow drift motions of closed rigid cage in irregular waves and the local instantaneous forces from each mooring line the corresponding results are in general comparable with the experimental data the comparative analyses show that sloshing has large influence on the coupled surge and pitch motions of closed cage sloshing is also found to have significant effect on the mean drift forces in regular waves especially when the surge response is amplified due to sloshing the amplitudes of the dominant slow drift motions in the tested simulated irregular waves are found to be considerably larger than the dominant first order motions in regular waves which indicates that the slowly varying wave drift forces need to be considered in the design of the mooring system for a floating closed cage the weakly nonlinear multi modal method implemented in fhsim is able to model both the planar and swirling waves inside a cylindrical tank tsarau et al 2021 however analyses of the surface wave patterns and the corresponding sloshing modes are not the focus of the present study the linear potential flow theory and the weakly nonlinear multi modal method are not able to capture some nonlinear hydrodynamic effects that might have influenced the comparisons between the numerical and experimental results the present time domain simulation model needs to be extended for considering the relevant nonlinear hydrodynamic effects as well as the elastic deformation of a closed cage i e the hydroelastic effects credit

20661,wells turbine is very proficient in converting pneumatic power from ocean waves into mechanical energy however such turbines suffer from low performance limited operating range and low efficiency the present study introduces an innovative design to enhance the power produced by the wells turbine by implementing different geometries of gurney flap gf the gurney flap is placed on both pressure and suction sides of the trailing edge te and perpendicular to the chord line without changing chord length gf alters the kutta condition at the trailing edge te which increases the

ocean wave energy into mechanical power environment friendly energy converters that researchers are investigating how to boost their performance the effect of different designs on the performance of the wells turbine was experimentally studied by gato et al 1996 and curran and gato 1996 kim et al 2002 performed a numerical simulation to study the blade sweep and its effect on the turbine performance which has been reported that at blade sweep ratio 0 35 stall delayed setoguchi et al 2000 introduced the influence of utilizing inlet guide vanes on the impulse and wells turbine performance the results indicated that the impulse turbine with self pitch controlled guide vanes was found to have the best performance setoguchi et al setoguchi and takao 2006 studied the influence of self rectifying turbines on impulse and wells turbine it was found that the starting and running characteristics of the impulse type turbine could be better than that of wells turbines under non uniform wave conditions gato and webster 2001 studied the effect of blade sweep and guide vanes on wells turbine performance it is noted in the results that the enhanced operating range and peak efficiency are reduced dhanasekaran and govardhan govardhan and dhanasekaran 2002 introduced a numerical study on the effect of guide vanes and variable chord c on wells turbine performance the results concluded that the self starting characteristics of the variable chord blade were improved by guide vanes the optimum blade geometry of wells turbine is as follows the hub to tip ratio is about 0 7 the aspect ratio about 0 5 naca0020 blade blade sweep ratio of 0 35 and solidity of about 0 67 as reported by kim et al 2001 the effect of the blade setting angle on wells turbine performance was introduced by setoguchi et al 2003a the result revealed that the best performance of the rotor achieved a setting angle of 2 takao et al 2006a showed the effect of end plates on the performance of a wells turbine they found that wells turbine performance characteristics were improved the effect of tip clearance on wells turbine performance was introduced by torresi et al 2008 as a result tip clearance value is of primary importance in the optimization of the performance of the wells turbine on the other hand the tip clearance must be neither too small to avert flow separation already at low values of the flow coefficient nor too high to avert too small performance caused by small pressure drop through the turbine and large tip leakage flow setoguchi et al 2003b stated that the optimum blade profile for small scale wells turbines is to be naca0020 while takao et al 2006b showed that the optimum blade profile for large scale turbines is to be naca0015 takao et al 2008 studied the effect of non uniform tip clearance on the performance of the wells turbine the blade with non uniform tip clearance improved the performance of the wells turbine compared with the blade with uniform tip clearance mohamed et al 2008 improved the tangential force coefficient by 6 and efficiency by 2 1 using non symmetrical airfoil naca2421 optimization furthermore mohamed et al 2011 optimized the naca0021 airfoil profile while reporting that the tangential force coefficient increased by 8 8 improvement in tangential force coefficient and 1 improvement in efficiency within the entire flow range takasaki et al 2016 studied the effect of trailing edge shape on wells turbine performance the authors concluded that the pressure drop reduced at a constant flow coefficient blade with suction slots was introduced by shehata et al 2017 the peak torque coefficient is boosted by 26 7 and the stall is delayed by 51 gratton et al 2018a improved the torque coefficient by 14 by blade profile optimization the influence of the geometry of the turbine duct on its performance was numerically studied by shaaban and hafiz shaaban and abdel 2012 the result revealed that the efficiency was improved by 9 and turbine power was increased by 14 halder and samad 2015 showed that the casing treatment influences the vortex pattern which results in a stall margin became wider however the peak efficiency decreased the effect of several rotor blades on the wells turbine performance was studied by many researchers some of the previous studies recommended the use of eight rotor blades gato et al 1996 curran and gato 1996 setoguchi et al 2003b thakker and abdulhadi 2008 and others recommended the use of six rotor blades thakker and abdulhadi 2008 takao et al 2006b on the other side using air turbines to be immersed in water gave a promising performance hamed et al hossam et al 2017 have demonstrated that submerging wells turbine promises remarkable performance compared to a conventional wells turbine halder et al 2015 succeeded to enhance the productive power of the wells turbine by 26 for a particular operating point as well as delaying the stall using the circumferential casing groove rectangular shape moreover halder et al halder and samad 2016 guessed the optimal wells turbine speed for the different flow velocities with and without a tip groove they reported that the grooved casing design performs better than that without grooved casing halder et al 2017a 2017b proved that using variable blade sweep angles at the tip and midsections enhanced wells turbine performance and provided a higher range of operation torresi et al torres et al 2018 had set a methodology to guess the optimal wells turbine size taking into account the hydro aerodynamic model to ensure the best performance of this turbine moreover nazeryan et al nazeryan and lakzian 2018 investigated numerically the influence of blade thickness on both aerodynamic and entropy generation analysis of a wells turbine they stated that the torque coefficient and efficiency were improved by 63 4 and 72 8 respectively besides gratton et al 2018b performed optimizing the blade profile in the wells turbine for better performance by the torque coefficient magnification by 14 kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 and investigated numerically the effect of rectangular gurney flap height on the aerodynamic wells turbine performance showing that the rectangular flap improved torque coefficient and decreased efficiency where this was confirmed by kotb et al kotb et al 1200 liebeck 1978 reported that the gurney flap is located at the pressure side only at the trailing edge te and perpendicular to the chord line to increase the adhesion of the race car tires during braking and acceleration when the flap height fh is 1 of the chord length the downforce on the race car increased and the drag reduced however increasing the gurney flap height to 2 increased the drag significantly the gurney flap increased the circulation by deflecting the flow towards the pressure side which leads to improving lift see fig 1 nevertheless the modified wake flow increases drag at fh 2 c graham et al 2017 investigated experimentally the effect of gurney flap width on airfoil performance and reported that the lift improvement due to the flap boosted with flap height and reduce with flap width bianchini et al alessandro et al 2019 investigated numerically the effect of gurney flaps on the aerodynamic darrieus wind turbine performance and showed that gf implementation on the inner side of the airfoil with fh 2 c improve out put power by 23 1 and 14 6 at a tip speed ratio 3 3 and 3 9 respectively lópez et al 2014 reported that the energy was extracted from the oscillating waves by the plenum chamber and produces a pneumatic power that drives the turbine they showed that the total pressure drop across the turbine has a sensible influence on the oscillating air motion in the plenum chamber as well as the wave energy capture due to pneumatic damping thus both the turbine and the plenum chamber are having a mutual effect on each other higher or lower damping levels than the optimum damping result in a reduction of available pneumatic power inside the plenum chamber therefore the wells turbine power output depends mainly on the turbine itself and the designed plenum chamber to fit with the turbine to capture the maximum power the turbine is designed to produce therefore when designing a new turbine a suitable plenum chamber design should be taken into consideration to take full advantage of the new design nawar et al 2021 investigated the concept of immersing wells turbine inside water six shapes of casing groove treatment were implemented to enhance the performance of such a turbine wells turbine as a hydraulic turbine achieved better performance than any other turbine hossam et al 2017 hashem et al 2018 it is noticeable from wells turbine characteristic curves of curran and gato 1996 that the maximum efficiency and maximum torque occurred at different flow coefficients the maximum efficiency at flow coefficient equals 0 13 but the maximum torque coefficient at flow coefficient equals 0 22 however many researches mohamed et al 2011 gratton et al 2018b gratton et al 2018b 2018b madhan kumar and samad 2019 focused on increasing the torque coefficient rather than efficiency additionally they introduced several methods to delay the stall inception shehata et al 2017 halder et al 2015 halder et al 2015 2015 hashem et al 2018 the choice of the number of blades used is rationalized from previous studies it is acceptable that the airflow frequency in owc is so small frequency 1 hz that unsteady effects are negligible and then the flow is treated as a steady flow mohamed 2011 2 work novelty and objectives this study aims to increase the power produced by the wells turbine by augmenting it with different geometries of gurney flap gf the gurney flap is placed on both pressure and suction sides to maintain the symmetry of the blade at the trailing edge te and perpendicular to the chord line without change chord length in this paper the effect of varying flap height fh flap width fw and flap geometry on the wells turbine performance has been considered however kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 studied only the effect of varying the rectangular flap height fh on the wells turbine performance wells turbine is investigated while having symmetrical naca 0015 blades the performance is evaluated according to the flow coefficient total pressure drop coefficient torque coefficient and the turbine efficiency as well as presenting the streamlines colored by velocity and pressure fields around the turbine blades to demonstrate the improvement of wells turbine performance 3 methodology in this section wells turbine theory of operation gurney flap scheme computational domain meshing and mesh size independence study will be discussed 3 1 wells turbine wells turbine is one of the most important ocean wave energy converters that convert ocean wave energy into mechanical power in oscillation water column owc inside wave energy converters the pressure fluctuations are generated due to the motion of wave inside a plenum producing an oscillating airflow therefore the self rectifying wells turbine can efficiently convert whose energy into a unidirectional rotational motion see fig 2 a in its basic arrangement it is an axial flow air turbine that comprises a rotor with several symmetrical and untwisted airfoil blades the chord line is perpendicular to the rotational axis 90 stagger angle see fig 2 b in fig 3 the flow of incidence angle α will produce lift l and drag d forces their components in both tangential and axial directions are denoted by ft and fa respectively consequently ft generates torque on the turbine rotor while fa produces thrust force on the turbine rotor axis govardhan and dhanasekaran 2002 for wells turbine in an oscillating airflow α changes from positive to negative values according to upward and downward directions of flow respectively as demonstrated in fig 3 the tangential force ft is acting in the same direction regardless of the positive or negative value of α due to the symmetry of the rotor blade shaaban and abdel 2012 3 2 gurney flap scheme the present study introduces a method to enhance the power produced by the wells turbine by implementing different geometries of gurney flap gf the gurney flap is placed on both pressure and suction sides of the trailing edge te and perpendicular to the chord line without changing its length rectangular and triangular gf have been studied as shown in fig 4 the rectangular gf height fh and width fw were varied from 0 5 c to 2 c and from 0 4 c to 0 6 c respectively besides the triangular gf was studied at fh 1 5 c and fw varies from 0 5 c to 2 c 3 3 computational domain and meshing in the present study the influence of using different geometries of gf on the performance of wells turbine is numerically investigated by solving the 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in this study the sst k ω turbulence model and non dimensional wall distance y are used to guess the flow pattern on the buffer and sub layer zones a good prediction of the aerodynamic performance was achieved by the combination of the sst k ω turbulence model with non dimensional wall distance y 1 the moving reference frame method mrf is applied to simulate the turbine rotor but the main governing equations are solved in the absolute frame the finite volume method is applied to appreciate the absolute frame using the computational fluid dynamics cfd code fluent the present simulation uses different discretization methods as shown in table 1 the simplec algorithm is applied to pressure velocity coupling and consequently eliminates the influence of mesh skewness on the final solution the maximum residual values for momentum continuity velocity x velocity y velocity z and turbulence equations of the solutions are 10 4 moreover the value of turbulence intensity at the inlet and outlet is 5 the turbulence intensity i is defined as the ratio of the root mean square of the velocity fluctuations concerning the mean flow velocity curran and gato 1996 wells turbine dimensions are used in this investigation the specifications of the wells turbine that is under study are shown in table 2 the full cylindrical domain of the eight blade rotor is reduced to a slice of domain angle θ 360 8 45 of the full domain see fig 5 this reduction happened because of the periodical shape of the turbine around the axis of rotation to reduce the computational time shaaban and abdel 2012 besides table 3 presents domain meshing and domain boundary conditions figs 5 and 6 describe the computational domain with boundary conditions and the computational mesh respectively the large cylindrical domain extended 4c upstream and 8c downstream the rotor to confirm that the boundaries did not affect the flow at the turbine shaaban and abdel 2012 for the boundary conditions the inlet and outlet conditions of the computational domain are uniform velocity and outlet pressure respectively the hub and the blade surfaces are treated as non slip stationary walls relative to a rotating reference frame because of the rotating reference frame a non slip moving wall with zero rotational speed is used for the casing surface periodic boundary conditions are used when the flow pattern around the turbine blades has a periodically repeating nature consequently the tangential sides of the domain are treated as a rotational periodic boundary condition see fig 5 flow coefficient ϕ is changed from 0 1 to 0 325 and the fixed rotational speed of the turbine 2000 rpm henceforth the blade tip speed was kept constant table 4 shows the inlet flow velocities at different flow coefficients ϕ fig 6 describes the unstructured tetrahedral mesh with the total number of cells in the computational domain which is 2 614 335 the face size on the blade surface is 0 9 mm refinement grids with inflation are used near the blade surface hub surface and casing surface to accurately capture the flow field inside the boundary layer the number of inflation layers is 20 with a growth rate of 1 2 for the blade surface hub surface and casing surface the first thickness layer normal to the wall is set to be about 3 10 3 mm to achieve y 1 at all flow coefficients to ensure the capability of solving the viscous sub layer fig 7 shows y contours at ϕ 0 2 on all wall boundaries to make sure that the model will be able to solve the viscous sub layer in this study mesh features are very close to hashem et al 2018 3 4 mesh independent study fig 8 shows the influence of the number of cells in the computational domain on the cfd results for turbine efficiency η at the flow coefficient ϕ 0 15 the number of cells was gradually increased in five steps from 1 015 551 cells to 3 953 000 cells this was performed with the constancy of the first thickness layer the number of inflation layers and a growth rate of the blade surface hub surface and casing surface to maintain non dimensional wall distance y 1 at the same ϕ in this study the maximum percentage of the diffractions of torque coefficient ct total pressure loss coefficient cp and efficiency η are 0 99 0 66 and 0 33 respectively it is depicted that cell number of 2 614 335 is the best solution quality where cfd results are independent of the number of cells in the computational domain thus this mesh number was utilized during the present study 4 results and discussions the operating performance of the wells turbine augmented with gf has been discussed in this section accordingly three subsections are presented as follows model validation the effect of different geometries of gurney flap on turbine performance and the velocity and pressure fields around the blades 4 1 model validation the wells turbine performance is evaluated by torque coefficient total pressure drop coefficient and efficiency these coefficients definitions are as follows madhan kumar and samad 2019 the flow coefficient ϕ can be introduced as 1 ϕ c x u the flow coefficient is changed by the variation of the axial flow velocity cx while keeping the rotor tip speed u constant thus the torque coefficient ct can be introduced as 2 c t t ρ ω 2 r t 5 where t is the torque on the rotor ρ is the working fluid density ω is the angular velocity of the turbine and rt is the radius of the rotor tip the total pressure drop coefficient cp is expressed by the following formula 3 c p δ p ο ρ ω 2 r t 2 where δ p o is the total pressure drop the turbine efficiency η is introduced as 4 η tω δ p ο q where q is the volume flow rate through the turbine rotor solidity is an important parameter that affects the performance of wells turbines the rotor solidity σ is defined as 5 σ z c h π r t 2 r h 2 zc 2 π r m where z is the number of blades c is the chord length h is the blade height rh is the radius of the rotor hub and rm is the turbine mean radius eq 5 shows that the rotor solidity σ can be varied by changing the number of turbine blades a validation curve of torque coefficient ct total pressure loss coefficient cp and efficiency η has been determined at different values of flow coefficient ϕ as shown in fig 9 a b and 9c respectively the validation results were compared with both experimental results curran and gato 1996 and cfd results torresi et al 2008 halder and samad 2015 hossam et al 2017 hossam et al 2017 madhan kumar and samad 2019 the results of the present work show strong agreement with the results of curran and gato 1996 and good detect to stall point it is notable to mention that the stall point is determined by a deterioration in the turbine torque coefficient accordingly the present cfd model has been great admitted as a computational tool for the performance of the wells turbine fig 10 presents the error percentage of the cfd of torresi et al 2008 cfd halder et al halder and samad 2015 cfd hamed et al hossam et al 2017 cfd kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 and present work compared with the experimental results of curran and gato 1996 as it is depicted from the figure that the error percentages for the torque coefficient total pressure drop coefficient and efficiency of the present work are lower than that of the other cfd results setoguchi et al 2003b halder and samad 2015 hossam et al 2017 madhan kumar and samad 2019 verification of the rectangular flap at fw 0 5 c fh 1 5 c is also achieved with kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 for more satisfaction fig 11 presents that the present cfd results have a strong agreement with kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 however kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 studied only the effect of varying the rectangular flap height fh on the wells turbine performance so in this paper the effect of varying flap height fh flap width fw and flap geometry on wells turbine performance has been considered 4 2 effect of rectangular flap height fig 12 demonstrates the effect of rectangular flap height on the variations of ct cp and η at different values of ϕ the results show that the rectangular flap of fw 0 5 c fh 1 5 c gives a maximum value of ct 0 148 at ϕ 0 225 while the maximum ct 0 113 at ϕ 0 22 for blade without flap fh 0 c hence the percentage increase in ct is 41 98 at ϕ 0 225 see fig 12 a on the other hand cp is increased as the flap height increases especially at the values of ϕ 0 2 as shown in fig 12 b despite the decrease in the efficiency compared with the blade without flap reference case the amount of power generated had been enhanced fig 12 c the velocity streamlines are presented for wells turbine blade without flap fh 0 c and with flaps of different heights as shown in fig 13 the static pressure contours are presented for wells turbine blade without flap fh 0 c and with fh 1 5 c and fw 0 5 c as shown in fig 14 the comparison of velocity streamlines between blades with flap is established at fw 0 5 c h 50 ϕ 0 2 and fh 0 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 it is noticed that at the blade without flap fh 0 c a vortex is formed at the end of the trailing edge this vortex separates the flow from the surface of the blade reducing the power generated see fig 13 a the flap position at the end of the blades generates vortices regions forward and backward the forward vortices size is very small compared with the backward vortices which diminishes their effect hence the backward vortices that is located downstream of the blade made a low pressure zone this reduces the chance of the boundary layer separation and allows entraining more streamlines that in turn enhance the power generated accordingly the size and location of the vortices have a very vital effect on the performance of the blades the effect of the flap of fh 0 5 c and 1 c is very small compared with the flap of fh 1 5 c and 2 c as shown in fig 13 b c d and e respectively two important pressure regions are affecting intensely the wells turbine performance one of them is located on the pressure side high while the second is located on the suction side negative see fig 14 the negative region on the suction side represents the location of the vortex region the difference in pressure between the high pressure and the negative pressure regions generates the force required for the generation of the power it is observed that at fh 1 5 c a higher pressure and larger negative pressure regions are formed because of the flap fig 14 b hereafter the size and location of such regions relative to each other enhance significantly the performance of such a turbine as depicted in fig 14 4 3 effect of rectangular flap width fig 15 illustrates the effect of the rectangular flap width on the variations of ct cp and η at different values of ϕ the rectangular flap of fw 0 5 c gives a maximum value of ct at ϕ 0 225 compared with the other geometries as shown in fig 15 a on the other hand the rectangular flap of width fw 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 c approximately the same values of cp through the range of ϕ as shown in fig 15 b despite the decrease in the efficiency compared with the blade without flap fh 0 the amount of power generated had been enhanced fig 15 c therefore the optimum rectangular flap dimensions are fh 1 5 c and fw 0 5 c the velocity streamlines are presented for wells turbine blade without flap fh 0 c and with flaps of different widths as shown in fig 16 the comparison of velocity streamlines between blades with flap is accomplished at fh 1 5 c h 50 ϕ 0 2 and fw 0 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 the backward vortices that are formed at fw 0 5 c are very dense compared to others see fig 16 c 4 3 effect of triangular flap width on the other side in fig 17 the effect of triangular flap width has been revealed on the variations of ct cp and η at different values of ϕ the results are compared with the optimum rectangular flap fh 1 5 c and fw 0 5 c and the blade without flap fh 0 c the results stated that the triangular flap of fw 0 5 c fh 1 5 c gives a maximum value of ct 0 137 at ϕ 0 225 compared with the other geometries see fig 17 a on the other hand cp almost constant as the flap width increases especially at the values of ϕ 0 2 as shown in fig 17 b there is a slight decrease in the efficiency compared with the blade without flap fh 0 c see fig 17 c however the amount of power generated had been enhanced because of the ct the rectangular flap has an advantage over the triangular flap in terms of improving power generation by analogy fig 18 illustrated the velocity streamlines of the triangular flap of different widths the comparison of velocity streamlines between the blades with triangular flap is accomplished at fh 1 5 c h 50 ϕ 0 2 and fw 0 0 5 1 5 and 2 the backward vortices that are formed at fw 0 5 c are very dense compared to others see fig 18 b this in turn generates more negative pressure regions which contributes to generating more power at fw 2 c increasing the flap width scavenges the forward vortices which reduces the power generated by analogy fig 19 illustrated the velocity streamlines contours of the rectangular and triangular gurney flap the comparison of velocity streamlines between the blades with rectangular and triangular flap is accomplished at fh 1 5 c fw 0 5 c h 50 and ϕ 0 2 the forward and backward vortices that are formed for rectangular flaps are dense compared to triangular flaps see fig 19 a which contributes to generating more power 5 conclusions the present work aims to enhance the wells turbine performance two gurney flap geometries rectangular and triangular have been elaborated herein the turbine performance was investigated under steady unidirectional flow conditions using the sst k ω model where its numerical results were validated the model is based on the 3d incompressible rans equation in the single rotating reference frame accordingly the following conclusions are taken the blade without flap achieved a maximum torque coefficient equals to 0 113 at ϕ 0 22 furthermore the stall inception appeared at the flow coefficient equals 0 22 compared with the blade without flap the blade with rectangular flap fh 1 5 c and fw 0 5 c achieved a maximum torque coefficient equals 0 148 moreover the stall point was delayed to the flow coefficient equals 0 225 furthermore the maximum percentage of increase in the torque coefficient was 41 98 at such a flow coefficient the gurney flap width fw has a slight effect on the total pressure drop coefficient through the whole range of operation for rectangle and triangle flap for condition of fh 1 5 c fw 0 5 c and ϕ 0 225 wells turbine with the rectangular flap produces 6 91 more torque coefficient greater than that of triangular flap the gurney flap generated two types of vortices forward and backward vortices the forward vortices size was very small compared with the backward vortices that diminish their effect as a result the torque coefficient increased as did the total pressure drop coefficient credit authorship

20661,wells turbine is very proficient in converting pneumatic power from ocean waves into mechanical energy however such turbines suffer from low performance limited operating range and low efficiency the present study introduces an innovative design to enhance the power produced by the wells turbine by implementing different geometries of gurney flap gf the gurney flap is placed on both pressure and suction sides of the trailing edge te and perpendicular to the chord line without changing chord length gf alters the kutta condition at the trailing edge te which increases the coefficient of lift the performance of the wells turbine is evaluated through solving numerically the 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans by using ansys fluent the

ocean wave energy into mechanical power environment friendly energy converters that researchers are investigating how to boost their performance the effect of different designs on the performance of the wells turbine was experimentally studied by gato et al 1996 and curran and gato 1996 kim et al 2002 performed a numerical simulation to study the blade sweep and its effect on the turbine performance which has been reported that at blade sweep ratio 0 35 stall delayed setoguchi et al 2000 introduced the influence of utilizing inlet guide vanes on the impulse and wells turbine performance the results indicated that the impulse turbine with self pitch controlled guide vanes was found to have the best performance setoguchi et al setoguchi and takao 2006 studied the influence of self rectifying turbines on impulse and wells turbine it was found that the starting and running characteristics of the impulse type turbine could be better than that of wells turbines under non uniform wave conditions gato and webster 2001 studied the effect of blade sweep and guide vanes on wells turbine performance it is noted in the results that the enhanced operating range and peak efficiency are reduced dhanasekaran and govardhan govardhan and dhanasekaran 2002 introduced a numerical study on the effect of guide vanes and variable chord c on wells turbine performance the results concluded that the self starting characteristics of the variable chord blade were improved by guide vanes the optimum blade geometry of wells turbine is as follows the hub to tip ratio is about 0 7 the aspect ratio about 0 5 naca0020 blade blade sweep ratio of 0 35 and solidity of about 0 67 as reported by kim et al 2001 the effect of the blade setting angle on wells turbine performance was introduced by setoguchi et al 2003a the result revealed that the best performance of the rotor achieved a setting angle of 2 takao et al 2006a showed the effect of end plates on the performance of a wells turbine they found that wells turbine performance characteristics were improved the effect of tip clearance on wells turbine performance was introduced by torresi et al 2008 as a result tip clearance value is of primary importance in the optimization of the performance of the wells turbine on the other hand the tip clearance must be neither too small to avert flow separation already at low values of the flow coefficient nor too high to avert too small performance caused by small pressure drop through the turbine and large tip leakage flow setoguchi et al 2003b stated that the optimum blade profile for small scale wells turbines is to be naca0020 while takao et al 2006b showed that the optimum blade profile for large scale turbines is to be naca0015 takao et al 2008 studied the effect of non uniform tip clearance on the performance of the wells turbine the blade with non uniform tip clearance improved the performance of the wells turbine compared with the blade with uniform tip clearance mohamed et al 2008 improved the tangential force coefficient by 6 and efficiency by 2 1 using non symmetrical airfoil naca2421 optimization furthermore mohamed et al 2011 optimized the naca0021 airfoil profile while reporting that the tangential force coefficient increased by 8 8 improvement in tangential force coefficient and 1 improvement in efficiency within the entire flow range takasaki et al 2016 studied the effect of trailing edge shape on wells turbine performance the authors concluded that the pressure drop reduced at a constant flow coefficient blade with suction slots was introduced by shehata et al 2017 the peak torque coefficient is boosted by 26 7 and the stall is delayed by 51 gratton et al 2018a improved the torque coefficient by 14 by blade profile optimization the influence of the geometry of the turbine duct on its performance was numerically studied by shaaban and hafiz shaaban and abdel 2012 the result revealed that the efficiency was improved by 9 and turbine power was increased by 14 halder and samad 2015 showed that the casing treatment influences the vortex pattern which results in a stall margin became wider however the peak efficiency decreased the effect of several rotor blades on the wells turbine performance was studied by many researchers some of the previous studies recommended the use of eight rotor blades gato et al 1996 curran and gato 1996 setoguchi et al 2003b thakker and abdulhadi 2008 and others recommended the use of six rotor blades thakker and abdulhadi 2008 takao et al 2006b on the other side using air turbines to be immersed in water gave a promising performance hamed et al hossam et al 2017 have demonstrated that submerging wells turbine promises remarkable performance compared to a conventional wells turbine halder et al 2015 succeeded to enhance the productive power of the wells turbine by 26 for a particular operating point as well as delaying the stall using the circumferential casing groove rectangular shape moreover halder et al halder and samad 2016 guessed the optimal wells turbine speed for the different flow velocities with and without a tip groove they reported that the grooved casing design performs better than that without grooved casing halder et al 2017a 2017b proved that using variable blade sweep angles at the tip and midsections enhanced wells turbine performance and provided a higher range of operation torresi et al torres et al 2018 had set a methodology to guess the optimal wells turbine size taking into account the hydro aerodynamic model to ensure the best performance of this turbine moreover nazeryan et al nazeryan and lakzian 2018 investigated numerically the influence of blade thickness on both aerodynamic and entropy generation analysis of a wells turbine they stated that the torque coefficient and efficiency were improved by 63 4 and 72 8 respectively besides gratton et al 2018b performed optimizing the blade profile in the wells turbine for better performance by the torque coefficient magnification by 14 kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 and investigated numerically the effect of rectangular gurney flap height on the aerodynamic wells turbine performance showing that the rectangular flap improved torque coefficient and decreased efficiency where this was confirmed by kotb et al kotb et al 1200 liebeck 1978 reported that the gurney flap is located at the pressure side only at the trailing edge te and perpendicular to the chord line to increase the adhesion of the race car tires during braking and acceleration when the flap height fh is 1 of the chord length the downforce on the race car increased and the drag reduced however increasing the gurney flap height to 2 increased the drag significantly the gurney flap increased the circulation by deflecting the flow towards the pressure side which leads to improving lift see fig 1 nevertheless the modified wake flow increases drag at fh 2 c graham et al 2017 investigated experimentally the effect of gurney flap width on airfoil performance and reported that the lift improvement due to the flap boosted with flap height and reduce with flap width bianchini et al alessandro et al 2019 investigated numerically the effect of gurney flaps on the aerodynamic darrieus wind turbine performance and showed that gf implementation on the inner side of the airfoil with fh 2 c improve out put power by 23 1 and 14 6 at a tip speed ratio 3 3 and 3 9 respectively lópez et al 2014 reported that the energy was extracted from the oscillating waves by the plenum chamber and produces a pneumatic power that drives the turbine they showed that the total pressure drop across the turbine has a sensible influence on the oscillating air motion in the plenum chamber as well as the wave energy capture due to pneumatic damping thus both the turbine and the plenum chamber are having a mutual effect on each other higher or lower damping levels than the optimum damping result in a reduction of available pneumatic power inside the plenum chamber therefore the wells turbine power output depends mainly on the turbine itself and the designed plenum chamber to fit with the turbine to capture the maximum power the turbine is designed to produce therefore when designing a new turbine a suitable plenum chamber design should be taken into consideration to take full advantage of the new design nawar et al 2021 investigated the concept of immersing wells turbine inside water six shapes of casing groove treatment were implemented to enhance the performance of such a turbine wells turbine as a hydraulic turbine achieved better performance than any other turbine hossam et al 2017 hashem et al 2018 it is noticeable from wells turbine characteristic curves of curran and gato 1996 that the maximum efficiency and maximum torque occurred at different flow coefficients the maximum efficiency at flow coefficient equals 0 13 but the maximum torque coefficient at flow coefficient equals 0 22 however many researches mohamed et al 2011 gratton et al 2018b gratton et al 2018b 2018b madhan kumar and samad 2019 focused on increasing the torque coefficient rather than efficiency additionally they introduced several methods to delay the stall inception shehata et al 2017 halder et al 2015 halder et al 2015 2015 hashem et al 2018 the choice of the number of blades used is rationalized from previous studies it is acceptable that the airflow frequency in owc is so small frequency 1 hz that unsteady effects are negligible and then the flow is treated as a steady flow mohamed 2011 2 work novelty and objectives this study aims to increase the power produced by the wells turbine by augmenting it with different geometries of gurney flap gf the gurney flap is placed on both pressure and suction sides to maintain the symmetry of the blade at the trailing edge te and perpendicular to the chord line without change chord length in this paper the effect of varying flap height fh flap width fw and flap geometry on the wells turbine performance has been considered however kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 studied only the effect of varying the rectangular flap height fh on the wells turbine performance wells turbine is investigated while having symmetrical naca 0015 blades the performance is evaluated according to the flow coefficient total pressure drop coefficient torque coefficient and the turbine efficiency as well as presenting the streamlines colored by velocity and pressure fields around the turbine blades to demonstrate the improvement of wells turbine performance 3 methodology in this section wells turbine theory of operation gurney flap scheme computational domain meshing and mesh size independence study will be discussed 3 1 wells turbine wells turbine is one of the most important ocean wave energy converters that convert ocean wave energy into mechanical power in oscillation water column owc inside wave energy converters the pressure fluctuations are generated due to the motion of wave inside a plenum producing an oscillating airflow therefore the self rectifying wells turbine can efficiently convert whose energy into a unidirectional rotational motion see fig 2 a in its basic arrangement it is an axial flow air turbine that comprises a rotor with several symmetrical and untwisted airfoil blades the chord line is perpendicular to the rotational axis 90 stagger angle see fig 2 b in fig 3 the flow of incidence angle α will produce lift l and drag d forces their components in both tangential and axial directions are denoted by ft and fa respectively consequently ft generates torque on the turbine rotor while fa produces thrust force on the turbine rotor axis govardhan and dhanasekaran 2002 for wells turbine in an oscillating airflow α changes from positive to negative values according to upward and downward directions of flow respectively as demonstrated in fig 3 the tangential force ft is acting in the same direction regardless of the positive or negative value of α due to the symmetry of the rotor blade shaaban and abdel 2012 3 2 gurney flap scheme the present study introduces a method to enhance the power produced by the wells turbine by implementing different geometries of gurney flap gf the gurney flap is placed on both pressure and suction sides of the trailing edge te and perpendicular to the chord line without changing its length rectangular and triangular gf have been studied as shown in fig 4 the rectangular gf height fh and width fw were varied from 0 5 c to 2 c and from 0 4 c to 0 6 c respectively besides the triangular gf was studied at fh 1 5 c and fw varies from 0 5 c to 2 c 3 3 computational domain and meshing in the present study the influence of using different geometries of gf on the performance of wells turbine is numerically investigated by solving the 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in this study the sst k ω turbulence model and non dimensional wall distance y are used to guess the flow pattern on the buffer and sub layer zones a good prediction of the aerodynamic performance was achieved by the combination of the sst k ω turbulence model with non dimensional wall distance y 1 the moving reference frame method mrf is applied to simulate the turbine rotor but the main governing equations are solved in the absolute frame the finite volume method is applied to appreciate the absolute frame using the computational fluid dynamics cfd code fluent the present simulation uses different discretization methods as shown in table 1 the simplec algorithm is applied to pressure velocity coupling and consequently eliminates the influence of mesh skewness on the final solution the maximum residual values for momentum continuity velocity x velocity y velocity z and turbulence equations of the solutions are 10 4 moreover the value of turbulence intensity at the inlet and outlet is 5 the turbulence intensity i is defined as the ratio of the root mean square of the velocity fluctuations concerning the mean flow velocity curran and gato 1996 wells turbine dimensions are used in this investigation the specifications of the wells turbine that is under study are shown in table 2 the full cylindrical domain of the eight blade rotor is reduced to a slice of domain angle θ 360 8 45 of the full domain see fig 5 this reduction happened because of the periodical shape of the turbine around the axis of rotation to reduce the computational time shaaban and abdel 2012 besides table 3 presents domain meshing and domain boundary conditions figs 5 and 6 describe the computational domain with boundary conditions and the computational mesh respectively the large cylindrical domain extended 4c upstream and 8c downstream the rotor to confirm that the boundaries did not affect the flow at the turbine shaaban and abdel 2012 for the boundary conditions the inlet and outlet conditions of the computational domain are uniform velocity and outlet pressure respectively the hub and the blade surfaces are treated as non slip stationary walls relative to a rotating reference frame because of the rotating reference frame a non slip moving wall with zero rotational speed is used for the casing surface periodic boundary conditions are used when the flow pattern around the turbine blades has a periodically repeating nature consequently the tangential sides of the domain are treated as a rotational periodic boundary condition see fig 5 flow coefficient ϕ is changed from 0 1 to 0 325 and the fixed rotational speed of the turbine 2000 rpm henceforth the blade tip speed was kept constant table 4 shows the inlet flow velocities at different flow coefficients ϕ fig 6 describes the unstructured tetrahedral mesh with the total number of cells in the computational domain which is 2 614 335 the face size on the blade surface is 0 9 mm refinement grids with inflation are used near the blade surface hub surface and casing surface to accurately capture the flow field inside the boundary layer the number of inflation layers is 20 with a growth rate of 1 2 for the blade surface hub surface and casing surface the first thickness layer normal to the wall is set to be about 3 10 3 mm to achieve y 1 at all flow coefficients to ensure the capability of solving the viscous sub layer fig 7 shows y contours at ϕ 0 2 on all wall boundaries to make sure that the model will be able to solve the viscous sub layer in this study mesh features are very close to hashem et al 2018 3 4 mesh independent study fig 8 shows the influence of the number of cells in the computational domain on the cfd results for turbine efficiency η at the flow coefficient ϕ 0 15 the number of cells was gradually increased in five steps from 1 015 551 cells to 3 953 000 cells this was performed with the constancy of the first thickness layer the number of inflation layers and a growth rate of the blade surface hub surface and casing surface to maintain non dimensional wall distance y 1 at the same ϕ in this study the maximum percentage of the diffractions of torque coefficient ct total pressure loss coefficient cp and efficiency η are 0 99 0 66 and 0 33 respectively it is depicted that cell number of 2 614 335 is the best solution quality where cfd results are independent of the number of cells in the computational domain thus this mesh number was utilized during the present study 4 results and discussions the operating performance of the wells turbine augmented with gf has been discussed in this section accordingly three subsections are presented as follows model validation the effect of different geometries of gurney flap on turbine performance and the velocity and pressure fields around the blades 4 1 model validation the wells turbine performance is evaluated by torque coefficient total pressure drop coefficient and efficiency these coefficients definitions are as follows madhan kumar and samad 2019 the flow coefficient ϕ can be introduced as 1 ϕ c x u the flow coefficient is changed by the variation of the axial flow velocity cx while keeping the rotor tip speed u constant thus the torque coefficient ct can be introduced as 2 c t t ρ ω 2 r t 5 where t is the torque on the rotor ρ is the working fluid density ω is the angular velocity of the turbine and rt is the radius of the rotor tip the total pressure drop coefficient cp is expressed by the following formula 3 c p δ p ο ρ ω 2 r t 2 where δ p o is the total pressure drop the turbine efficiency η is introduced as 4 η tω δ p ο q where q is the volume flow rate through the turbine rotor solidity is an important parameter that affects the performance of wells turbines the rotor solidity σ is defined as 5 σ z c h π r t 2 r h 2 zc 2 π r m where z is the number of blades c is the chord length h is the blade height rh is the radius of the rotor hub and rm is the turbine mean radius eq 5 shows that the rotor solidity σ can be varied by changing the number of turbine blades a validation curve of torque coefficient ct total pressure loss coefficient cp and efficiency η has been determined at different values of flow coefficient ϕ as shown in fig 9 a b and 9c respectively the validation results were compared with both experimental results curran and gato 1996 and cfd results torresi et al 2008 halder and samad 2015 hossam et al 2017 hossam et al 2017 madhan kumar and samad 2019 the results of the present work show strong agreement with the results of curran and gato 1996 and good detect to stall point it is notable to mention that the stall point is determined by a deterioration in the turbine torque coefficient accordingly the present cfd model has been great admitted as a computational tool for the performance of the wells turbine fig 10 presents the error percentage of the cfd of torresi et al 2008 cfd halder et al halder and samad 2015 cfd hamed et al hossam et al 2017 cfd kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 and present work compared with the experimental results of curran and gato 1996 as it is depicted from the figure that the error percentages for the torque coefficient total pressure drop coefficient and efficiency of the present work are lower than that of the other cfd results setoguchi et al 2003b halder and samad 2015 hossam et al 2017 madhan kumar and samad 2019 verification of the rectangular flap at fw 0 5 c fh 1 5 c is also achieved with kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 for more satisfaction fig 11 presents that the present cfd results have a strong agreement with kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 however kumar and samad madhan kumar and samad 2019 studied only the effect of varying the rectangular flap height fh on the wells turbine performance so in this paper the effect of varying flap height fh flap width fw and flap geometry on wells turbine performance has been considered 4 2 effect of rectangular flap height fig 12 demonstrates the effect of rectangular flap height on the variations of ct cp and η at different values of ϕ the results show that the rectangular flap of fw 0 5 c fh 1 5 c gives a maximum value of ct 0 148 at ϕ 0 225 while the maximum ct 0 113 at ϕ 0 22 for blade without flap fh 0 c hence the percentage increase in ct is 41 98 at ϕ 0 225 see fig 12 a on the other hand cp is increased as the flap height increases especially at the values of ϕ 0 2 as shown in fig 12 b despite the decrease in the efficiency compared with the blade without flap reference case the amount of power generated had been enhanced fig 12 c the velocity streamlines are presented for wells turbine blade without flap fh 0 c and with flaps of different heights as shown in fig 13 the static pressure contours are presented for wells turbine blade without flap fh 0 c and with fh 1 5 c and fw 0 5 c as shown in fig 14 the comparison of velocity streamlines between blades with flap is established at fw 0 5 c h 50 ϕ 0 2 and fh 0 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 it is noticed that at the blade without flap fh 0 c a vortex is formed at the end of the trailing edge this vortex separates the flow from the surface of the blade reducing the power generated see fig 13 a the flap position at the end of the blades generates vortices regions forward and backward the forward vortices size is very small compared with the backward vortices which diminishes their effect hence the backward vortices that is located downstream of the blade made a low pressure zone this reduces the chance of the boundary layer separation and allows entraining more streamlines that in turn enhance the power generated accordingly the size and location of the vortices have a very vital effect on the performance of the blades the effect of the flap of fh 0 5 c and 1 c is very small compared with the flap of fh 1 5 c and 2 c as shown in fig 13 b c d and e respectively two important pressure regions are affecting intensely the wells turbine performance one of them is located on the pressure side high while the second is located on the suction side negative see fig 14 the negative region on the suction side represents the location of the vortex region the difference in pressure between the high pressure and the negative pressure regions generates the force required for the generation of the power it is observed that at fh 1 5 c a higher pressure and larger negative pressure regions are formed because of the flap fig 14 b hereafter the size and location of such regions relative to each other enhance significantly the performance of such a turbine as depicted in fig 14 4 3 effect of rectangular flap width fig 15 illustrates the effect of the rectangular flap width on the variations of ct cp and η at different values of ϕ the rectangular flap of fw 0 5 c gives a maximum value of ct at ϕ 0 225 compared with the other geometries as shown in fig 15 a on the other hand the rectangular flap of width fw 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 c approximately the same values of cp through the range of ϕ as shown in fig 15 b despite the decrease in the efficiency compared with the blade without flap fh 0 the amount of power generated had been enhanced fig 15 c therefore the optimum rectangular flap dimensions are fh 1 5 c and fw 0 5 c the velocity streamlines are presented for wells turbine blade without flap fh 0 c and with flaps of different widths as shown in fig 16 the comparison of velocity streamlines between blades with flap is accomplished at fh 1 5 c h 50 ϕ 0 2 and fw 0 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 the backward vortices that are formed at fw 0 5 c are very dense compared to others see fig 16 c 4 3 effect of triangular flap width on the other side in fig 17 the effect of triangular flap width has been revealed on the variations of ct cp and η at different values of ϕ the results are compared with the optimum rectangular flap fh 1 5 c and fw 0 5 c and the blade without flap fh 0 c the results stated that the triangular flap of fw 0 5 c fh 1 5 c gives a maximum value of ct 0 137 at ϕ 0 225 compared with the other geometries see fig 17 a on the other hand cp almost constant as the flap width increases especially at the values of ϕ 0 2 as shown in fig 17 b there is a slight decrease in the efficiency compared with the blade without flap fh 0 c see fig 17 c however the amount of power generated had been enhanced because of the ct the rectangular flap has an advantage over the triangular flap in terms of improving power generation by analogy fig 18 illustrated the velocity streamlines of the triangular flap of different widths the comparison of velocity streamlines between the blades with triangular flap is accomplished at fh 1 5 c h 50 ϕ 0 2 and fw 0 0 5 1 5 and 2 the backward vortices that are formed at fw 0 5 c are very dense compared to others see fig 18 b this in turn generates more negative pressure regions which contributes to generating more power at fw 2 c increasing the flap width scavenges the forward vortices which reduces the power generated by analogy fig 19 illustrated the velocity streamlines contours of the rectangular and triangular gurney flap the comparison of velocity streamlines between the blades with rectangular and triangular flap is accomplished at fh 1 5 c fw 0 5 c h 50 and ϕ 0 2 the forward and backward vortices that are formed for rectangular flaps are dense compared to triangular flaps see fig 19 a which contributes to generating more power 5 conclusions the present work aims to enhance the wells turbine performance two gurney flap geometries rectangular and triangular have been elaborated herein the turbine performance was investigated under steady unidirectional flow conditions using the sst k ω model where its numerical results were validated the model is based on the 3d incompressible rans equation in the single rotating reference frame accordingly the following conclusions are taken the blade without flap achieved a maximum torque coefficient equals to 0 113 at ϕ 0 22 furthermore the stall inception appeared at the flow coefficient equals 0 22 compared with the blade without flap the blade with rectangular flap fh 1 5 c and fw 0 5 c achieved a maximum torque coefficient equals 0 148 moreover the stall point was delayed to the flow coefficient equals 0 225 furthermore the maximum percentage of increase in the torque coefficient was 41 98 at such a flow coefficient the gurney flap width fw has a slight effect on the total pressure drop coefficient through the whole range of operation for rectangle and triangle flap for condition of fh 1 5 c fw 0 5 c and ϕ 0 225 wells turbine with the rectangular flap produces 6 91 more torque coefficient greater than that of triangular flap the gurney flap generated two types of vortices forward and backward vortices the forward vortices size was very small compared with the backward vortices that diminish their effect as a result the torque coefficient increased as did the total pressure drop coefficient credit authorship

20662,shipowners face the challenge of selecting shipyards to build a new ship as shipyards are highly similar in terms of capacity and capability but highly heterogeneous with a variety of incentives to shipowners building a new ship takes at months and is very expensive and selecting a prospective shipyard demands the shipowners to have a wealth of experience and knowledge we develop an improved fuzzy ahp ifahp based game theoretic model to analyze two competitive shipyards this model allows us to conduct pairwise comparisons on risks of selecting competitive shipyards a case study in which two shipyards offering prospective services to the shipowners is conducted with several rounds of expert consultations this study contributes to the literature by providing both the players and beneficiaries of a game with considerable insights on shipbuilding we discuss some practical implications for both the shipowners and shipyards keywords risk assessment shipping business shipyards group decision making game theory ifahp 1 introduction risk assessment is crucial for decision making to observe the vulnerability of the systems risk can be expressed as the multiplication of the probability of an event and its probable consequences risk assessment comprises the preventive measures along with the data of risk analysis since the consequences of undesired events are costly and even deadly risk assessment is highly studied in the shipping industry related literature for example risk assessment of arctic navigation and istanbul strait are studied by 74 and 73 a systematic literature review for the individual collision risk assessment in ship navigation is presented by 60 risk analysis for the ship mooring operation is studied by 43 ship collision risk assessment is conducted by 103 risk assessment studies related to the shipping industry are not only limited to safe navigation or ship traffic but also ship investment and shipyards such as 47 99 and 38 shipyards are one of the essential elements of the maritime industry many activities such as ship construction ship maintenance and the supply of spare parts are carried out in shipyards therefore shipyard selection is vital for shipowners competing shipyards in the same region offer similar alternatives in many dimensions such as capacity workload and economy when the shipowners invest in a ship they almost know which shipyard to be chosen however when a detailed analysis is done the shipyard selection takes on a different level this study includes a detailed analysis covering not only current conditions but also future situations such as economic equipment or service support the shipbuilding industry is different from other construction or manufacturing sectors and has unique parameters the shipbuilding industry has been described as a high risk sector in many respects basuki et al 2014 in this study it is the first time the risk concept is introduced for the shipyards that can endure the shipyards close to each other in terms of size capacity and capabilities develop some strategies as a marketing tool for their customers in the free market shipyards compete with these strategies the pre determined marketing strategies have a cost to the shipyards the novelty of this study is a model for examining the potential costs of risks to the shipyards as the most crucial problem faced by shipowners is the ship s investment decisions robust models are needed to handle this process as a whole engelen et al 2006 for this study the model is designed based on the following research questions can a model be established in favor of the customer based on the strategies of the actors in the competitive environment can this model be observed step by step to analyze the causes more deeply and can the results of this model be translated into practice the motivation of this study is to create a model that can choose an ideal shipyard among others with the same features in terms of capacity size and capabilities in a competitive environment in favor of the shipowner we propose an improved fuzzy analytical hierarchy process ifahp based game theoretic model the analytical hierarchy process ahp method and fuzzy sets are used because of their superiority such as suitability to the human thought system and ability to handle the criteria more conveniently and quickly the advantages and disadvantages of ahp are mentioned in 37 the values obtained from ahp are adapted to the game theory and the relevant data are processed we employ game theory in order to determine the game values of the strategies of the competing shipyards and to provide maximum benefit to the shipowners this model gives practitioners the most comprehensive answers to research questions and achieves the stated goals first of all this model is used for the first time in the literature and is essential both for its contribution to the economy and for the convenience of shipowners in the competitive shipyard selection process the most important contribution of this study to the literature is to create awareness for the decision making processes of maritime authorities especially shipowners it is emphasized that conventional methods need to be improved the strengths of this model are the combination of well established methods ease of use the potential for further improvement practical applicability and traceability contrary to the traditional approaches this study deals with the background of shipyards rather than the only visible front side of the shipyards in this study the game theoretic model is aimed to increase the quality by providing extra benefits from the marketing strategies of shipyards rather than the cost of the construction in other words a decision support system is aimed at quality management by making a risk assessment finally this study provides a holistic and comprehensive insight for invisible and non considerable situations to attract the shipowners for a shipping proposal with the same cost same contract the study is presented as follows in section 2 the risk assessment of ship investment and applications of multi criteria decision making mcdm methods in risk assessment are discussed the explanations of methodology and proposed ifahp based game theoretic model along with the corresponding algorithm are provided in section 3 the application is presented in section 4 section 5 presents discussions while section 6 finally concludes the paper 2 literature review the literature is examined in two parts the first part reviews the risk assessment and ship investments while the second part reviews the risk assessment methods 2 1 risk assessment of ship investment the locomotive of the global economy is the shipping industry which consists of several sub units such as shipbuilding shipping transportation ship scraping etc alexandridis et al 2018 du et al 2017 all participants in the shipping sector are in multi directional relationships all parameters constituting the shipping industry in terms of economy and politics interact with each other whether actors in these sectors are conscious or not sahin and yip 2017 ship investment involves a dynamic and complex environment where it has numerous trade offs difficulties and risks mclean 2013 niese et al 2015 existing and probable risks have always been considered in maritime history garbatov et al 2018 the banks might cause these risks and also involve the positions of countries in the maritime sector capacities and capabilities of shipyards kavussanos and tsouknidis 2016 shu et al 2018 moreover efforts to develop a sustainable economic model in this field proves the significance of risks in the shipbuilding market xu and yip 2012 luo and kou 2018 ross and schinas 2019 a risk can be defined as the function of multiplication of occurrence probability of an undesired event and its consequences wu et al 2019 according to the practice and the observations from the field shipowners make their investments mostly through conventional approaches in one approach they consider the return on investment roi or loss probability after ship construction at the pre determined shipyards cullinane 1995 another approach considers technical characteristics such as ship tonnage volumetric capacity or ship type park et al 2014 lai et al 2019 in both approaches there is no study dealing with a shipyard comparison a number of risks faced by the maritime industry are explained in 31 for instance political changes global relationships operational problems financial uncertainties are some of the example risks for the shipyards gui jun and zhang 2015 ship investment criteria are studied in 8 and 72 generally financial risks are emphasized in the literature for instance the studies of 64 and 63 focus on investment timing financial strategies and options all the related elements are constituting a shipyard face and exposure several risks related to such as occupational material labor payment promotion shipment timing etc barlas 2012 celik et al 2009 liu et al 2019a all risks have a financial impact and compensation one of the innovative benefits of this study is the provision of a better product after measuring the risks that shipyards can endure risk assessment is defined as a process involving the identification detailed analysis and evaluation of all probable situations hegde and rokseth 2020 risk assessment takes a critical role in the systems including complex operational technical and organizational processes paltrinieri et al 2019 in the literature risk assessment is frequently studied and its applications in the maritime industry can be observed in many different areas these areas vary from navigation ship mooring systems ship collision autonomous ships human factors etc zhang et al 2019 fan et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 studies on ship investment decision making are few in the literature compared to other studies concerning the shipping industry fan and luo 2013 ship investment is a very complex process in the presence of uncertainties and in a competitive environment where shipowners find it difficult to decide without a suitable system luo and fan 2010 ship investment is a process that requires extensive capital and long term returns that should be taken into account therefore shipowners shipyards and banks agree that ship investment is a risky process zhu and chen 2014 risk assessment in the ship investment process can be explained in several different perspectives depending on shipowners banks shipyards for example the technical risks of shipyards might be low quality materials ship maintenance and poor quality labor or late delivery the financial risks of shipyards might be difficulties in banking payment options patterson 2016 similarly operational or marketing risks of shipyards might not create opportunities responding to the shipowner s demands i e avoidance for more facilities on demand avoidance for revising the contract in case of a need ship investment from the perspective of the shipowner is a laborious time consuming process based on the managerial operational strategical and financial perspectives celik and akyuz 2018 gkochari 2015 shipowners have various roles in the shipbuilding supply chain li et al 2018 shipowners must know the shipyard s functions and marketing strategies bulut et al 2012 zheng and chen 2018 countries continuously compete with each other in ship construction jiang et al 2013 vishnevskiy et al 2017 chou 2018 a comparison of countries is highly studied in the literature and can be found on several databases lee et al 2014 hossain et al 2017 for example one of the sectors that carry the turkish economy as a developing country is the shipbuilding industry like other countries turkey encounters similar situations shipyards in turkey are in a competition based on cost service prestige and relative positions yercan 1998 in the literature shipyards are studied either in a holistic perspective or as a single part of a system in detail in other words some studies work on the shipyard performance of the countries and some focus on a shipyard incident in detail to the best of our knowledge there is no study comparing two or more shipyards based on risk assessment they mostly focus on a comparison of two shipyards based on a single parameter furthermore this study provides a tool that helps shipowners for decision making by calculating the risk values of which shipyards can tolerate in the traditional approach shipowners pay attention to specific criteria during the decision making process of the ship s investment these parameters can be classified into two categories finance and engineering aspects in the shipping market the roi is commonly preferred which refers to the profitability and efficiency of the investment roi is a performance measure that deals with the current position and expected return farris et al 2010 its equation is expressed as roi gain cost cost of investment loss probability in the shipping sector is firstly introduced in 21 loss probability refers to a percentage of results that give a deficit account loss probability represents defect rates in the simulation and is different from the classical meaning in the banking system duru et al 2012 if the potential buyer s requirements are fulfilled after negotiations then the shipping price is decided shipping price includes inspection of classification records the expenses of dry dock and delivery and additional payments such as bunkers and stores the remaining four criteria concern engineering aspects fuel consumption loaded draft ship s economic speed and the availability of cargo transfer equipment fuel consumption is a significant subjective parameter in terms of technical and operational concerns the fuel consumption of a merchant ship is processed as an operational cost the vessels are responsible for ensuring to meet the draft restrictions of the ports the draft is a term that refers to the distance between the water surface and the underwater level of the ship it depends on the cargo and ballast whether it is loaded or cargo free in practice there are several versions of drafts such as air draft saltwater arrival draft freshwater arrival draft brackish water arrival draft bar draft etc the difference of these terms are based on the physical restrictions i e bridges rivers etc a ship s economic speed represents operation time and the availability of cargo transfer equipment expresses whether the ship can transfer cargoes by equipped cargo handling appliances in order to increase the shipyards performance several approaches i e lean approach are proposed sharma and gandhi 2017 these are mainly focused on shipyards however in the literature there is no study dealing with shipowners profits based on the endurance and maximum limit of shipyards risks 2 2 applications of mcdm methods in risk assessment risk assessment methods have been studied extensively in almost every field in the literature and have several diverse applications the methods used in risk assessments are applied for complicated problems in many areas rausand 2013 aven 2016 for example there are applications in almost every field such as ecological ramos miras et al 2020 marine chemical sciarrillo et al 2020 senol et al 2015 health etc gyamfi et al 2020 ünver et al 2019 some of the mcdm method based risk assessments are ahp the technique for order of preference by similarity to an ideal solution failure modes and effects analysis fault tree analysis preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations etc sahin et al 2020 the studies are carried out by using deterministic approaches or fuzzy sets sahin and soylu 2020a in the literature it is observed that the number of risk assessment studies conducted using the ahp method is relatively high kheybari et al 2020 the ahp technique has been applied in almost every area in the maritime industry such as shipbuilding shipyard selection ship accidents the health and safety of seafarers port operations and technology decisions bellsolà olba et al 2020 sahin and soylu 2020b sahin et al 2015 in the study of 15 methods and areas for risk assessment are given in detail shipyards are classified by using the ahp method in 10 barriers and enablers for shipyards are discussed by using the ahp method in 66 ports and terminals are analyzed based on safety by using the ahp method hervás peralta et al 2020 there exist many studies related to risk assessment by using the same ifahp method as we used in this paper li et al 2005 şahin and yazır 2019 for example 93 use it for information systems security 95 prefer it for sustainability and system dynamics 91 deal with reliability design and 87 implement the ifahp method for safety evaluations as it is seen ifahp is designed for risk assessment and fits well for safety reliability and the subjects related to risk ifahp method is also implemented in maritime related problems such as risk analysis of marine risers yu and liu 2014 and ship navigation in the arctic region sahin and kum 2015 similarly game theory is highly applied for risk assessment studies sohrabi and azgomi 2020 for instance 16 combine the bayesian network and game theory to solve the damages of the pipelines water supply systems are analyzed by using the fuzzy game theoretical model liu et al 2020 system engineering and game theory are combined with a pipeline accident model xing et al 2020 hybrid game theoretic mcdm is highly implemented in the literature such as 30 45 59 and 33 however there is no study on the game theoretical ifahp method in the proposed method the data are calculated via ifahp after the data are collected and then the game theory is executed the contributions of this paper are threefold first this paper investigates the ship s investment decisions from a shipyard perspective in a fuzzy manner and sheds light on the ship s investment literature second this paper extends the game theoretic model to an improved fuzzy analytical hierarchy process ifahp that could examine pairwise relationships of rival shipyards third different from many previous studies on individual s independent decision making this study uses mcdm in the presence of rival decision makers and various relationships between decision makers under different market conditions 3 methodology mcdm techniques are applied in almost all disciplines pairwise comparison systems are preferred because of their ease of use and avoiding holistic generalizations by breaking the problem into small pieces the methods used in this study are compatible with multi expert group decisions consistency of decision matrices and linguistic expressions 3 1 improved fuzzy analytical hierarchy process method ifahp transfers the reciprocal judgment matrix into the fuzzy consistent judgment matrix normalized aggregation square root and eigenvector methods are also involved in the process yu and liu 2014 kang and xue 2008 the variables and their descriptions are given in table 1 for the ifahp method 0 1 0 9 scales are used the scales and their meanings are given in table 2 the steps of ifahp are shown below wang et al 2012 sahin and kum 2015 step 1 comparative judgment matrix is set up as f a i j n n the elements of matrix f a i j a j i have the following properties 0 a i j 1 a i j a j i 1 a i i 0 5 step 2 fuzzy complementary judgment matrix is established it is listed as a fuzzy consistent matrix f r i j n x n r i is the sum of rows as r i j 1 n r i j r j is the columns of judgment matrix f as r j i 1 n r i j and i j 1 2 n step 3 transformation formula r i r i r j 2 n 0 5 is used to solve the row sum r i i 1 10 t i the fuzzy consistent judgment matrix r r i j n x n is converted from fuzzy judgment matrix f f i j n x n step 4 rank aggregation method eq 1 or square root eq 2 method is used to get the ordering vector 1 w 0 w 1 w 2 w n t j 1 n e 1 j i 1 n j 1 n e i j j 1 n e 2 j i 1 n j 1 n e i j j 1 n e n j i 1 n j 1

obtain reciprocal matrix e e i j n x n that is transformed from the fuzzy complementary judgment matrix r r i j n x n w 0 solves high accuracy of the ranking vector for the iterative initial value v 0 iteration formula v k 1 e v k is used to find the eigenvector v k 1 and infinite norm v k 1 of v k 1 while v k 1 v k less than ε v k 1 λ m a x which is the largest eigenvalue then v k 1 is normalized and become the form of eq 3 3 v k 1 v k 1 1 i 1 n v k 1 i v k 1 2 i 1 n v k 1 i v k 1 n i 1 n v k 1 i t step 6 4 v k v k 1 v k 1 v k 1 1 v k 1 v k 1 2 v k 1 v k 1 n v k 1 t is taken and the ordering vector is w k v i 1 and the calculation is completed v k becomes the new iterative initial value which can be recalculated from the beginning 3 2 game theory game theory is a multidisciplinary approach with an analysis characteristic of the human thought system vasudeva et al 2017 there is a balance in n person finite games called nash equilibrium myerson 1999 in zero sum games for two players the equilibrium point is a great solution to reach a general conclusion in the context of the players responses to each other s strategies players who have different strategies and know each other s strategies make their best actions in the competitive environment and as a result players can fix their decisions in maximum satisfaction when the game reaches the equilibrium point no one wants to deviate from their strategies even if the players are self conflicting in other words strategic stability is achieved even if strategy decisions do not dominate competitors aliahmadi et al 2011 in static game models each player determines the appropriate strategy according to all the opponent s actions reciprocal strategies form the solution at the equilibrium point of the game game theory is applied to the following assumptions each player must choose a strategy a strategy should be the best alternative to an opponent s predicted strategy choice in the case of game equilibrium players thoughts about their opponents strategy choices must be rational because these strategies meet their expectations since each player acts based on the opponent s strategy the players basic expectations and actions must be consistent colman 2016 han et al 2019 liu et al 2019b elements in a decision problem consist of decision makers controllable and non controllable variables events and the result ren et al 2019 tey et al 2019 the decision maker is responsible for the decision making process and its outcome controllable variables represent a large number of strategies that are making a system in the decision making process the chosen strategy should serve as much as possible as the intended purpose uncontrolled variables are factors outside the system and where parties cannot intervene and determine what to do such as socio economic and social cultural factors and advanced technological development the result is a strategy chosen by the decision makers aktan and bahçe 2007 the method succeeds when all the following steps are taken into account in the decision making process geckil and anderson 2016 portillo and humphrey 2018 first the decision criteria are determined second possible decisions and outcomes of the decision making process are identified third the probability distribution type that is applied in the decision making process is determined and the possible probability values of the decision matrix inputs are assigned fourth a function that measures the benefit is defined fifth an experiment is done for decision options sixth according to the experiment results input possibilities might be reviewed revised or corrected seventh the risks of process inputs are calculated for each possible decision eighth the real probabilities used for inputs and the expected risks of each possible decision are calculated finally the smallest expected risky decision is determined as the best solution rençber 2012 profit is maximized and loss is minimized as it is challenging to consider all possible scenarios in the game theory and make the best decision in the decision process the decision matrix is used to find the best strategy the decision matrix is given in fig 1 in a decision matrix s represents strategies controllable variables k symbolizes events uncontrollable variables x i j is the decision maker s choice based on i th strategy and j th event x i j might also be the cost of i th strategy in case of occurring the j th event where i 1 2 m is the number of strategies and j 1 2 n is the number of events the game value and the selection probabilities of the strategies in a competitive environment are found as follows 5 x 1 x 2 x n i adja i adja 6 y 1 y 2 y m adja i i adja i 7 g a i adja i where meanings of symbols a is the coefficient matrix adja is the additional matrix of a matrix a is the determinant of a matrix i is a row vector whose elements are one 1 and equal to the size of matrix a i is the transposition of row vector i and g is the value of the game 3 3 proposed model fig 2 indicates the proposed improved fuzzy ahp based game theoretic model for risk assessment on strategies offered by two competitive shipyards in the literature of multi criteria decision making there are three common types of research approaches and they include quantitative research qualitative research mixed methods we have adopted a mixed method to consider both quantitative and qualitative data by using improved fuzzy ahp the variables the strategies of shipyards are collected from structured interviews of 27 field experts the strategies surveyed are defined and discussed in appendix then two competitive shipyards are evaluated in a game theoretic model quantitatively the model is applied to a real case of shipyard selection 4 application 4 1 case study in the application of this study a comprehensive list is organized and numerous experienced experts are invited for face to face and online meetings the main concern to determine the expert is their both academic and industrial experience twenty seven 27 experts accepted our invitations and a critical discussion is conducted on determining the strategies of shipyards in the first round as reported in table 3 the 27 experts are all shipyard related they are divided into shipyard owner shipowner shipbuilding and planning manager quality manager finance manager work development and projects manager and academicians our approach synthesizes various field experts opinions and reduces potential preference bias they finally agreed on eight strategies as given in figs 3 and 4 the descriptions of the strategies are provided in table 4 these strategies are significant in terms of customer expectations then experts are asked about the risk levels of the competitive strategies of the competing shipyards for ship investment the data collection and application are conducted between march 2019 and may 2019 the profiles of the experts are given in table 3 the areas of study and experience of the experts are ship design shipbuilding and ship navigation also surveys are applied to the shipyard owners the help of two separate forms completes expert consultations and they are applied via face to face and online interviews they completed the questionnaires by making several rounds in three sessions the participation and replies to the questionnaires by the experts are 100 designing the problem determining strategies and defining these strategies have been carried out by interviewing with the experts at the national level shipowners and shipyard behaviors are taken into account considering country realities and international markets after expert interviews the results of the survey are combined and the results are analyzed the steps of ifahp are performed one by one pairwise decision comparisons and their complementary matrices are transformed as the fuzzy consistent matrix the reciprocal matrices are obtained as a result of the transformation of complementary decision matrices relative priorities are found after the weight vector is computed the hierarchical structures of the risk assessment of the ship investment model are provided in figs 3 and 4 aggregated pairwise judgment matrix of the a player s strategies in terms of the b player s strategies is given in table 5 in this study matrices are created for both actors the positions of each strategy according to each case are subject to all expert considerations similarly the aggregated pairwise comparison matrices of the b player s strategies in terms of the a player s strategies are given in table 6 table 7 provides r r i j n x n as mentioned in step 3 ordering vector can be found by two different methods as rank aggregation and square root methods in this study we prefer to use the rank aggregation method eq 1 eq 4 shows the ordering vector weights of combinations are calculated by using the formulas given in the methodology section in the game theory shipyards develop many strategies to attract the shipowner even if the shipyards are ultimately profitable the strategies have some risks as seen in tables 8 and 9 the probability of occurrence of these strategies is given in the table as 0 1 range risk event probability results dumbravă and iacob 2013 shipyard strategies also have costs in the following scale in table 10 the cost scale of the shipyards is generalized after the consensus of expert consultations complex unpredictable time and space dependent factors take roles in the shipbuilding process when building a ship thousands of variables are involved in the process such as ship s service sector tonnage the financial situation of the shipowner shipyard s location the size of the shipyard the experience of the shipyard the economic structure of the country where the shipyard is located international transportation conditions and the freight market after the analysis of an extensive exchange of ideas with sector representatives it has been concluded that the ship s investment is a dynamic process requiring specialized expertise and experience the experts agreed that it is difficult to determine the exact cost of a ship before the process starts due to fragile factors such as exchange rate natural disasters political decisions international financial crises etc for this scenario the approximate costs for each strategy taken from the experts are given in table 11 in the united states dollars usd after the expert consultations cost of each strategy are calculated fuzzy expressions are primarily preferred because it is close to the human thought system then the mean of approximate values in the intervals represented by the fuzzy expressions are obtained as the data given in table 10 the weights of strategies constitute the decision matrix of game theory table 12 shows the weights of a player s strategies in terms of the b player s strategies the risk levels of the shipyard are indicated in table 12 it means that shipyard a is competing with shipyard b based on the strategies of risk of low quality labor risk of payment difficulty ship maintenance risks and risk of failure to provide extra facilities on demand according to the game theory the nash equilibrium for strategies of a the row is g usd 30 986 in the case of realizing their strategies the maximum amount of risk that a can tolerate is found to be usd 30 986 similarly as it is shown in table 13 shipyard b can overcome usd 21 700 based on the game theory of which its steps are given in the methodology section in such a case the shipyard a which offers more opportunities for the shipowner to the hypothetical ship should be a priority for the shipowner 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a holistic approach to measure the performance of a criterion when the other factors are involved in comprehensively in this study we employed a sensitivity analysis based on the study of 11 sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of shipyard strategies under a fuzzy environment for the validation of outcomes seven cases are generated for each player as given in tables 14 and 15 current all low all medium weights are used to analyze the sensitivity of the critical shipyard strategies cases 4 to 7 are generated to see the high values for the specific strategies of the competitors and the low values for other strategies the changes in risk levels and rankings are given in figs 5 to 8 as can be seen k 2 shows the highest importance in seven cases then k 1 follows it similarly s 3 indicates the highest importance in seven cases then s 2 follows it 4 3 validation several studies in the literature deal with the reliability and validation which are two crucial parameters for the mcdm and game theoretical approach deng and jiang 2019 madani and lund 2011 wee et al 2020 ahp and game theory are valid methods and approaches since improved fuzzy ahp based game theoretic model is an entirely new approach to the best of our knowledge there is no existing model that fits completely to compare those therefore for the hybrid approaches there exist analytical requirements for the candidate method of which it provides a decision support system for the ship s investment in favor of the shipowner these requirements are the use of linguistic variables fuzzy expressions ease of use with pairwise comparisons ability to work in a competitive environment availability of desired parameters such as financial technical or operational concerns traceability of each step and sensitivity analysis to solve the problem a decision making process is conducted in this process the final model is developed step by step the model providing all these analytical requirements are obtained field experts test the obtained data findings prove that the method is valid 5 discussion 5 1 performance evaluation of the developed model as this paper intends to develop a mcda model for shipyard selection the results are shown in fig 9 the probability of each strategy in the game matrix is given in the graphical form fig 9 accordingly the most advantageous of these risky situations for shipyard a is poor quality labor s1 0 053 contrary to the assumption coefficients for variation of the parameters affecting labor in labor costs are relatively low control is more comfortable for the shipyard but the warranty period s3 0 548 involves risks that occur outside the control of the shipyard other strategies for shipyard a are the risk of failure to provide extra facilities on demand s4 0 330 and the risk of payment difficulty s2 0 068 the riskiest strategy of shipyard b is expected by the shipowner to offer shipowners extra opportunities other than shipbuilding in a highly competitive environment k4 0 496 other strategies for shipyard b are material based risks k1 0 399 risk of not being tolerated in favor of the shipowner k3 0 083 and late delivery risk k2 0 023 the results show that a feature of this model is in favor of the shipowners fuzzy logic is integrated into the system making it closer to the human thought system the financial risks are kept to a minimum due to the setting of the game it reflects real time business cases that financial risk is minimized in a competitive environment managerial implications for ship investment versus shipyard strategies can be found in appendix separate interviews have been conducted and experts have provided future directions of shipbuilding industry if more experts are involved in the expert consultation process it will take longer time to have expert interviews collect data and questionnaire process this method is ready to be extended to multiple market players with different number of strategies the proposed ifahp based game theoretic model can also be developed by alternative mcda methods deterministic heuristic computational intelligence table 16 demonstrates three shipyards with different number of strategies shipyard 1 consists of four strategies k 1 2 3 4 shipyard 2 has three strategies l 1 2 3 and shipyard 3 has five strategies m 1 2 3 4 5 there exist sixty decisions to be made in this setting however as it can be seen here as the number of shipyards and or strategies increases the complexity increases but compromise the clarity of results optimization and other techniques can be chosen to conduct the analysis with great clarity while the complexity increases 5 2 academic and managerial implications the research findings have the following academic implications first the criteria influencing shipyard selection especially those related to risk and finance are identified in the form of competitive games it triggers new research directions on mcdm and game theory in the future to address the general setting of competitive markets secondly the method is pioneered to make the overall decision result rationalized by considering two decision makers of different criteria this method is also applicable to solve other mcdm problems with varying criteria in a dynamic market thirdly the relative weights of criteria are determined by an ifahp and fuzzy expressions establish the structure of ahp the model is demonstrated with a real application and found useful in processing risk and qualitative information simultaneously fourthly the proposed model with the aid of the game theory enables shipowners to evaluate and select the most preferred ship in a dynamic environment moreover the results of ship evaluation can also enable professional staff to recognize current strengths and the defects of competitive strategies then get more rational decision making through strategy re positioning it will significantly improve the overall selection of game settings and mcdm besides academic implications this study also provides some guidance for shipowners and shipyards on how to deal with conflicting strategies in a shipbuilding service the study may support shipyards in dealing with shipowner s expectations of providing extra facilities on demand in interviews with field experts it has observed that shipyard executives were struggling to understand why some strategies were effective in attracting shipowners while others were not this study provides an overall systematic framework that allows the shipyard executives to evaluate a mix of strategies in developing a better service to shipowners on the other hand this study s findings may support shipyard executives to increase the labor costs or the labor salaries because it is not the highest concern of the shipowners as this study demonstrates shipyards have to manage multiple strategies simultaneously the mix of strategies may be even more pronounced than individual strategy in this study we encourage shipyards executives to foster strategies more integrative for serving shipowners in this competitive shipbuilding industry therefore managerial implications based on the relative importance of the different criteria and different strategies can help guide competing shipyards as decision makers and assist in ship investment based on shipyard strategies 6 conclusions in this study an improved fuzzy ahp ifahp based game theoretic model is presented to assist shipyard selection the main goal of this paper is to investigate whether the combination of ifahp and game theoretic model is a good approach for solving a mcdm problem of selecting one shipyard in a competitive market the model is proposed from the perspective of human thinking style particularly with pairwise comparison a 10 step process is developed by using ifahp and game theoretic model the study provides a risk assessment tool to help the shipowners for guiding the shipyard selection and proves the applicability of the method along with its consistency from the case study and sensitivity analysis it is found that time in delivery is the most important factor of shipyard selection and quality labor is the second most important one from the expert consultations shipowners tend to focus more on shipbuilding process than on future ship maintenance shipyards are advised to endure higher costs of shipbuilding three future research directions could be explored to increase our understanding of ship investment and the roles of shipyards and other decision makers first only shipowners have been consulted other related field experts knowledge e g marine insurers ship charterers etc and ship operators opinions can be collected in future research second only two shipyards have been considered and assumed to be competitors a future research study could be conducted with multiple market players to extend the present research to competition and cooperation among market players this could be the multiple strategies in a ship selection game third the way to finance shipbuilding is not considered ship leasing is a popular source of ship financing yu et al 2019 but many banks consider ship leasing for ship investors the consideration of ship leasing may or may not lead to different strategies of ship investment which would be evaluated by further study credit authorship contribution statement bekir sahin conceptualization methodology validation writing review editing devran yazir visualization investigation software

deciding to a shipyard for a shipbuilding 3 what should the shipowner pay attention to when choosing from multiple shipyards for the construction of new shipbuilding in this question the experts are asked to evaluate the criteria given below in a pairwise comparison manner c1 technical infrastructure material to be used in shipbuilding quality of technical personnel etc c2 process or period for a delivery date of the ship c3 whether the shipyard offers promotions in favor of the shipowner scope of promotion c4 financial considerations ship cost payment channels payment type etc c5 capacity for providing extra facilities depending on shipowner demand expressions in the row are provided as a priority over the expressions in a column as given in table 17 4 what should shipyards offer shipowners as a marketing strategy experts evaluate the importance of marketing strategies of shipyards as given in table 18 here importance levels are expressed high to low as extremely important forcefully important obviously important slightly essential and vital the data are given as a percentage of the average of expert evaluations 5 what should shipowners expect from the shipyards as a marketing strategy similarly experts evaluate the importance level of shipowners expectations from the shipyards as given in table 19 6 how do you assess the shipbuilding industry in developing countries in the interviews we have conducted with experienced professionals at local we asked the state of the shipbuilding industry in developing countries overall we have reached the following generalizations the shipbuilding industry in developing countries such as turkey is still in the development stage and there exist many difficulties in terms of planning and efficient production there are several advantages for the shipowner such as customer oriented construction management and provision of service for specific shipbuilding there are also opportunities in the production of offshore platforms turkish shipyards are technologically behind from a global perspective research and development investments are given little importance in recent years but the increase still left behind from the current advances some experts have maintained hope for the future of the shipbuilding industry in turkey and commented that it would be better 7 how can two shipyards compete with each other experts point out the following important points for a shipyard in a competitive environment main competition parameters can be itemized as timely delivery reasonable price adequate quality customer orientation quality of material cheap and high quality labor and flexibility for shipowner s wishes according to the situations that may arise later shipyards can set a robust organizational structure and realize a life long learning approach in their company 
20662,shipowners face the challenge of selecting shipyards to build a new ship as shipyards are highly similar in terms of capacity and capability but highly heterogeneous with a variety of incentives to shipowners building a new ship takes at months and is very expensive and selecting a prospective shipyard demands the shipowners to have a wealth of experience and knowledge we develop an improved fuzzy ahp ifahp based game theoretic model to analyze two competitive shipyards this model allows us to conduct pairwise comparisons on risks of selecting competitive shipyards a case study in which two shipyards offering prospective services to the shipowners is conducted with several rounds of expert consultations this study contributes to the literature by providing both the players and beneficiaries of a game with considerable insights on shipbuilding we discuss some practical implications for both the shipowners and shipyards keywords risk assessment shipping business shipyards group decision making game theory ifahp 1 introduction risk assessment is crucial for decision making to observe the vulnerability of the systems risk can be expressed as the multiplication of the probability of an event and its probable consequences risk assessment comprises the preventive measures along with the data of risk analysis since the consequences of undesired events are costly and even deadly risk assessment is highly studied in the shipping industry related literature for example risk assessment of arctic navigation and istanbul strait are studied by 74 and 73 a systematic literature review for the individual collision risk assessment in ship navigation is presented by 60 risk analysis for the ship mooring operation is studied by 43 ship collision risk assessment is conducted by 103 risk assessment studies related to the shipping industry are not only limited to safe navigation or ship traffic but also ship investment and shipyards such as 47 99 and 38 shipyards are one of the essential elements of the maritime industry many activities such as ship construction ship maintenance and the supply of spare parts are carried out in shipyards therefore shipyard selection is vital for shipowners competing shipyards in the same region offer similar alternatives in many dimensions such as capacity workload and economy when the shipowners invest in a ship they almost know which shipyard to be chosen however when a detailed analysis is done the shipyard selection takes on a different level this study includes a detailed analysis covering not only current conditions but also future situations such as economic equipment or service support the shipbuilding industry is different from other construction or manufacturing sectors and has unique parameters the shipbuilding industry has been described as a high risk sector in many respects basuki et al 2014 in this study it is the first time the risk concept is introduced for the shipyards that can endure the shipyards close to each other in terms of size capacity and capabilities develop some strategies as a marketing tool for their customers in the free market shipyards compete with these strategies the pre determined marketing strategies have a cost to the shipyards the novelty of this study is a model for examining the potential costs of risks to the shipyards as the most crucial problem faced by shipowners is the ship s investment decisions robust models are needed to handle this process as a whole engelen et al 2006 for this study the model is designed based on the following research questions can a model be established in favor of the customer based on the strategies of the actors in the competitive environment can this model be observed step by step to analyze the causes more deeply and can the results of this model be translated into practice the motivation of this study is to create a model that can choose an ideal shipyard among others with the same features in terms of capacity size and capabilities in a competitive environment in favor of the shipowner we propose an improved fuzzy analytical hierarchy process ifahp based game theoretic model the analytical hierarchy process ahp method and fuzzy sets are used because of their superiority such as suitability to the human thought system and ability to handle the criteria more conveniently and quickly the advantages and disadvantages of ahp are mentioned in 37 the values obtained from ahp are adapted to the game theory and the relevant data are processed we employ game theory in order to determine the game values of the strategies of the competing shipyards and to provide maximum benefit to the shipowners this model gives practitioners the most comprehensive answers to research questions and achieves the stated goals first of all this model is used for the first time in the literature and is essential both for its contribution to the economy and for the convenience of shipowners in the competitive shipyard selection process the most important contribution of this study to the literature is to create awareness for the decision making processes of maritime authorities especially shipowners it is emphasized that conventional methods need to be improved the strengths of this model are the combination of well established methods ease of use the potential for further improvement practical applicability and traceability contrary to the traditional approaches this study deals with the background of shipyards rather than the only visible front side of the shipyards in this study the game theoretic model is aimed to increase the quality by providing extra benefits from the marketing strategies of shipyards rather than the cost of the construction in other words a decision support system is aimed at quality management by making a risk assessment finally this study provides a holistic and comprehensive insight for invisible and non considerable situations to attract the shipowners for a shipping proposal with the same cost same contract the study is presented as follows in section 2 the risk assessment of ship investment and applications of multi criteria decision making mcdm methods in risk assessment are discussed the explanations of methodology and proposed ifahp based game theoretic model along with the corresponding algorithm are provided in section 3 the application is presented in section 4 section 5 presents discussions while section 6 finally concludes the paper 2 literature review the literature is examined in two parts the first part reviews the risk assessment and ship investments while the second part reviews the risk assessment methods 2 1 risk assessment of ship investment the locomotive of the global economy is the shipping industry which consists of several sub units such as shipbuilding shipping transportation ship scraping etc alexandridis et al 2018 du et al 2017 all participants in the shipping sector are in multi directional relationships all parameters constituting the shipping industry in terms of economy and politics interact with each other whether actors in these sectors are conscious or not sahin and yip 2017 ship investment involves a dynamic and complex environment where it has numerous trade offs difficulties and risks mclean 2013 niese et al 2015 existing and probable risks have always been considered in maritime history garbatov et al 2018 the banks might cause these risks and also involve the positions of countries in the maritime sector capacities and capabilities of shipyards kavussanos and tsouknidis 2016 shu et al 2018 moreover efforts to develop a sustainable economic model in this field proves the significance of risks in the shipbuilding market xu and yip 2012 luo and kou 2018 ross and schinas 2019 a risk can be defined as the function of multiplication of occurrence probability of an undesired event and its consequences wu et al 2019 according to the practice and the observations from the field shipowners make their investments mostly through conventional approaches in one approach they consider the return on investment roi or loss probability after ship construction at the pre determined shipyards cullinane 1995 another approach considers technical characteristics such as ship tonnage volumetric capacity or ship type park et al 2014 lai et al 2019 in both approaches there is no study dealing with a shipyard comparison a number of risks faced by the maritime industry are explained in 31 for instance political changes global relationships operational problems financial uncertainties are some of the example risks for the shipyards gui jun and zhang 2015 ship investment criteria are studied in 8 and 72 generally financial risks are emphasized in the literature for instance the studies of 64 and 63 focus on investment timing financial strategies and options all the related elements are constituting a shipyard face and exposure several risks related to such as occupational material labor payment promotion shipment timing etc barlas 2012 celik et al 2009 liu et al 2019a all risks have a financial impact and compensation one of the innovative benefits of this study is the provision of a better product after measuring the risks that shipyards can endure risk assessment is defined as a process involving the identification detailed analysis and evaluation of all probable situations hegde and rokseth 2020 risk assessment takes a critical role in the systems including complex operational technical and organizational processes paltrinieri et al 2019 in the literature risk assessment is frequently studied and its applications in the maritime industry can be observed in many different areas these areas vary from navigation ship mooring systems ship collision autonomous ships human factors etc zhang et al 2019 fan et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 studies on ship investment decision making are few in the literature compared to other studies concerning the shipping industry fan and luo 2013 ship investment is a very complex process in the presence of uncertainties and in a competitive environment where shipowners find it difficult to decide without a suitable system luo and fan 2010 ship investment is a process that requires extensive capital and long term returns that should be taken into account therefore shipowners shipyards and banks agree that ship investment is a risky process zhu and chen 2014 risk assessment in the ship investment process can be explained in several different perspectives depending on shipowners banks shipyards for example the technical risks of shipyards might be low quality materials ship maintenance and poor quality labor or late delivery the financial risks of shipyards might be difficulties in banking payment options patterson 2016 similarly operational or marketing risks of shipyards might not create opportunities responding to the shipowner s demands i e avoidance for more facilities on demand avoidance for revising the contract in case of a need ship investment from the perspective of the shipowner is a laborious time consuming process based on the managerial operational strategical and financial perspectives celik and akyuz 2018 gkochari 2015 shipowners have various roles in the shipbuilding supply chain li et al 2018 shipowners must know the shipyard s functions and marketing strategies bulut et al 2012 zheng and chen 2018 countries continuously compete with each other in ship construction jiang et al 2013 vishnevskiy et al 2017 chou 2018 a comparison of countries is highly studied in the literature and can be found on several databases lee et al 2014 hossain et al 2017 for example one of the sectors that carry the turkish economy as a developing country is the shipbuilding industry like other countries turkey encounters similar situations shipyards in turkey are in a competition based on cost service prestige and relative positions yercan 1998 in the literature shipyards are studied either in a holistic perspective or as a single part of a system in detail in other words some studies work on the shipyard performance of the countries and some focus on a shipyard incident in detail to the best of our knowledge there is no study comparing two or more shipyards based on risk assessment they mostly focus on a comparison of two shipyards based on a single parameter furthermore this study provides a tool that helps shipowners for decision making by calculating the risk values of which shipyards can tolerate in the traditional approach shipowners pay attention to specific criteria during the decision making process of the ship s investment these parameters can be classified into two categories finance and engineering aspects in the shipping market the roi is commonly preferred which refers to the profitability and efficiency of the investment roi is a performance measure that deals with the current position and expected return farris et al 2010 its equation is expressed as roi gain cost cost of investment loss probability in the shipping sector is firstly introduced in 21 loss probability refers to a percentage of results that give a deficit account loss probability represents defect rates in the simulation and is different from the classical meaning in the banking system duru et al 2012 if the potential buyer s requirements are fulfilled after negotiations then the shipping price is decided shipping price includes inspection of classification records the expenses of dry dock and delivery and additional payments such as bunkers and stores the remaining four criteria concern engineering aspects fuel consumption loaded draft ship s economic speed and the availability of cargo transfer equipment fuel consumption is a significant subjective parameter in terms of technical and operational concerns the fuel consumption of a merchant ship is processed as an operational cost the vessels are responsible for ensuring to meet the draft restrictions of the ports the draft is a term that refers to the distance between the water surface and the underwater level of the ship it depends on the cargo and ballast whether it is loaded or cargo free in practice there are several versions of drafts such as air draft saltwater arrival draft freshwater arrival draft brackish water arrival draft bar draft etc the difference of these terms are based on the physical restrictions i e bridges rivers etc a ship s economic speed represents operation time and the availability of cargo transfer equipment expresses whether the ship can transfer cargoes by equipped cargo handling appliances in order to increase the shipyards performance several approaches i e lean approach are proposed sharma and gandhi 2017 these are mainly focused on shipyards however in the literature there is no study dealing with shipowners profits based on the endurance and maximum limit of shipyards risks 2 2 applications of mcdm methods in risk assessment risk assessment methods have been studied extensively in almost every field in the literature and have several diverse applications the methods used in risk assessments are applied for complicated problems in many areas rausand 2013 aven 2016 for example there are applications in almost every field such as ecological ramos miras et al 2020 marine chemical sciarrillo et al 2020 senol et al 2015 health etc gyamfi et al 2020 ünver et al 2019 some of the mcdm method based risk assessments are ahp the technique for order of preference by similarity to an ideal solution failure modes and effects analysis fault tree analysis preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations etc sahin et al 2020 the studies are carried out by using deterministic approaches or fuzzy sets sahin and soylu 2020a in the literature it is observed that the number of risk assessment studies conducted using the ahp method is relatively high kheybari et al 2020 the ahp technique has been applied in almost every area in the maritime industry such as shipbuilding shipyard selection ship accidents the health and safety of seafarers port operations and technology decisions bellsolà olba et al 2020 sahin and soylu 2020b sahin et al 2015 in the study of 15 methods and areas for risk assessment are given in detail shipyards are classified by using the ahp method in 10 barriers and enablers for shipyards are discussed by using the ahp method in 66 ports and terminals are analyzed based on safety by using the ahp method hervás peralta et al 2020 there exist many studies related to risk assessment by using the same ifahp method as we used in this paper li et al 2005 şahin and yazır 2019 for example 93 use it for information systems security 95 prefer it for sustainability and system dynamics 91 deal with reliability design and 87 implement the ifahp method for safety evaluations as it is seen ifahp is designed for risk assessment and fits well for safety reliability and the subjects related to risk ifahp method is also implemented in maritime related problems such as risk analysis of marine risers yu and liu 2014 and ship navigation in the arctic region sahin and kum 2015 similarly game theory is highly applied for risk assessment studies sohrabi and azgomi 2020 for instance 16 combine the bayesian network and game theory to solve the damages of the pipelines water supply systems are analyzed by using the fuzzy game theoretical model liu et al 2020 system engineering and game theory are combined with a pipeline accident model xing et al 2020 hybrid game theoretic mcdm is highly implemented in the literature such as 30 45 59 and 33 however there is no study on the game theoretical ifahp method in the proposed method the data are calculated via ifahp after the data are collected and then the game theory is executed the contributions of this paper are threefold first this paper investigates the ship s investment decisions from a shipyard perspective in a fuzzy manner and sheds light on the ship s investment literature second this paper extends the game theoretic model to an improved fuzzy analytical hierarchy process ifahp that could examine pairwise relationships of rival shipyards third different from many previous studies on individual s independent decision making this study uses mcdm in the presence of rival decision makers and various relationships between decision makers under different market conditions 3 methodology mcdm techniques are applied in almost all disciplines pairwise comparison systems are preferred because of their ease of use and avoiding holistic generalizations by breaking the problem into small pieces the methods used in this study are compatible with multi expert group decisions consistency of decision matrices and linguistic expressions 3 1 improved fuzzy analytical hierarchy process method ifahp transfers the reciprocal judgment matrix into the fuzzy consistent judgment matrix normalized aggregation square root and eigenvector methods are also involved in the process yu and liu 2014 kang and xue 2008 the variables and their descriptions are given in table 1 for the ifahp method 0 1 0 9 scales are used the scales and their meanings are given in table 2 the steps of ifahp are shown below wang et al 2012 sahin and kum 2015 step 1 comparative judgment matrix is set up as f a i j n n the elements of matrix f a i j a j i have the following properties 0 a i j 1 a i j a j i 1 a i i 0 5 step 2 fuzzy complementary judgment matrix is established it is listed as a fuzzy consistent matrix f r i j n x n r i is the sum of rows as r i j 1 n r i j r j is the columns of judgment matrix f as r j i 1 n r i j and i j 1 2 n step 3 transformation formula r i r i r j 2 n 0 5 is used to solve the row sum r i i 1 10 t i the fuzzy consistent judgment matrix r r i j n x n is converted from fuzzy judgment matrix f f i j n x n step 4 rank aggregation method eq 1 or square root eq 2 method is used to get the ordering vector 1 w 0 w 1 w 2 w n t j 1 n e 1 j i 1 n j 1 n e i j j 1 n e 2 j i 1 n j 1 n e i j j 1 n e n j i 1 n j 1

obtain reciprocal matrix e e i j n x n that is transformed from the fuzzy complementary judgment matrix r r i j n x n w 0 solves high accuracy of the ranking vector for the iterative initial value v 0 iteration formula v k 1 e v k is used to find the eigenvector v k 1 and infinite norm v k 1 of v k 1 while v k 1 v k less than ε v k 1 λ m a x which is the largest eigenvalue then v k 1 is normalized and become the form of eq 3 3 v k 1 v k 1 1 i 1 n v k 1 i v k 1 2 i 1 n v k 1 i v k 1 n i 1 n v k 1 i t step 6 4 v k v k 1 v k 1 v k 1 1 v k 1 v k 1 2 v k 1 v k 1 n v k 1 t is taken and the ordering vector is w k v i 1 and the calculation is completed v k becomes the new iterative initial value which can be recalculated from the beginning 3 2 game theory game theory is a multidisciplinary approach with an analysis characteristic of the human thought system vasudeva et al 2017 there is a balance in n person finite games called nash equilibrium myerson 1999 in zero sum games for two players the equilibrium point is a great solution to reach a general conclusion in the context of the players responses to each other s strategies players who have different strategies and know each other s strategies make their best actions in the competitive environment and as a result players can fix their decisions in maximum satisfaction when the game reaches the equilibrium point no one wants to deviate from their strategies even if the players are self conflicting in other words strategic stability is achieved even if strategy decisions do not dominate competitors aliahmadi et al 2011 in static game models each player determines the appropriate strategy according to all the opponent s actions reciprocal strategies form the solution at the equilibrium point of the game game theory is applied to the following assumptions each player must choose a strategy a strategy should be the best alternative to an opponent s predicted strategy choice in the case of game equilibrium players thoughts about their opponents strategy choices must be rational because these strategies meet their expectations since each player acts based on the opponent s strategy the players basic expectations and actions must be consistent colman 2016 han et al 2019 liu et al 2019b elements in a decision problem consist of decision makers controllable and non controllable variables events and the result ren et al 2019 tey et al 2019 the decision maker is responsible for the decision making process and its outcome controllable variables represent a large number of strategies that are making a system in the decision making process the chosen strategy should serve as much as possible as the intended purpose uncontrolled variables are factors outside the system and where parties cannot intervene and determine what to do such as socio economic and social cultural factors and advanced technological development the result is a strategy chosen by the decision makers aktan and bahçe 2007 the method succeeds when all the following steps are taken into account in the decision making process geckil and anderson 2016 portillo and humphrey 2018 first the decision criteria are determined second possible decisions and outcomes of the decision making process are identified third the probability distribution type that is applied in the decision making process is determined and the possible probability values of the decision matrix inputs are assigned fourth a function that measures the benefit is defined fifth an experiment is done for decision options sixth according to the experiment results input possibilities might be reviewed revised or corrected seventh the risks of process inputs are calculated for each possible decision eighth the real probabilities used for inputs and the expected risks of each possible decision are calculated finally the smallest expected risky decision is determined as the best solution rençber 2012 profit is maximized and loss is minimized as it is challenging to consider all possible scenarios in the game theory and make the best decision in the decision process the decision matrix is used to find the best strategy the decision matrix is given in fig 1 in a decision matrix s represents strategies controllable variables k symbolizes events uncontrollable variables x i j is the decision maker s choice based on i th strategy and j th event x i j might also be the cost of i th strategy in case of occurring the j th event where i 1 2 m is the number of strategies and j 1 2 n is the number of events the game value and the selection probabilities of the strategies in a competitive environment are found as follows 5 x 1 x 2 x n i adja i adja 6 y 1 y 2 y m adja i i adja i 7 g a i adja i where meanings of symbols a

competitive shipyards in the literature of multi criteria decision making there are three common types of research approaches and they include quantitative research qualitative research mixed methods we have adopted a mixed method to consider both quantitative and qualitative data by using improved fuzzy ahp the variables the strategies of shipyards are collected from structured interviews of 27 field experts the strategies surveyed are defined and discussed in appendix then two competitive shipyards are evaluated in a game theoretic model quantitatively the model is applied to a real case of shipyard selection 4 application 4 1 case study in the application of this study a comprehensive list is organized and numerous experienced experts are invited for face to face and online meetings the main concern to determine the expert is their both academic and industrial experience twenty seven 27 experts accepted our invitations and a critical discussion is conducted on determining the strategies of shipyards in the first round as reported in table 3 the 27 experts are all shipyard related they are divided into shipyard owner shipowner shipbuilding and planning manager quality manager finance manager work development and projects manager and academicians our approach synthesizes various field experts opinions and reduces potential preference bias they finally agreed on eight strategies as given in figs 3 and 4 the descriptions of the strategies are provided in table 4 these strategies are significant in terms of customer expectations then experts are asked about the risk levels of the competitive strategies of the competing shipyards for ship investment the data collection and application are conducted between march 2019 and may 2019 the profiles of the experts are given in table 3 the areas of study and experience of the experts are ship design shipbuilding and ship navigation also surveys are applied to the shipyard owners the help of two separate forms completes expert consultations and they are applied via face to face and online interviews they completed the questionnaires by making several rounds in three sessions the participation and replies to the questionnaires by the experts are 100 designing the problem determining strategies and defining these strategies have been carried out by interviewing with the experts at the national level shipowners and shipyard behaviors are taken into account considering country realities and international markets after expert interviews the results of the survey are combined and the results are analyzed the steps of ifahp are performed one by one pairwise decision comparisons and their complementary matrices are transformed as the fuzzy consistent matrix the reciprocal matrices are obtained as a result of the transformation of complementary decision matrices relative priorities are found after the weight vector is computed the hierarchical structures of the risk assessment of the ship investment model are provided in figs 3 and 4 aggregated pairwise judgment matrix of the a player s strategies in terms of the b player s strategies is given in table 5 in this study matrices are created for both actors the positions of each strategy according to each case are subject to all expert considerations similarly the aggregated pairwise comparison matrices of the b player s strategies in terms of the a player s strategies are given in table 6 table 7 provides r r i j n x n as mentioned in step 3 ordering vector can be found by two different methods as rank aggregation and square root methods in this study we prefer to use the rank aggregation method eq 1 eq 4 shows the ordering vector weights of combinations are calculated by using the formulas given in the methodology section in the game theory shipyards develop many strategies to attract the shipowner even if the shipyards are ultimately profitable the strategies have some risks as seen in tables 8 and 9 the probability of occurrence of these strategies is given in the table as 0 1 range risk event probability results dumbravă and iacob 2013 shipyard strategies also have costs in the following scale in table 10 the cost scale of the shipyards is generalized after the consensus of expert consultations complex unpredictable time and space dependent factors take roles in the shipbuilding process when building a ship thousands of variables are involved in the process such as ship s service sector tonnage the financial situation of the shipowner shipyard s location the size of the shipyard the experience of the shipyard the economic structure of the country where the shipyard is located international transportation conditions and the freight market after the analysis of an extensive exchange of ideas with sector representatives it has been concluded that the ship s investment is a dynamic process requiring specialized expertise and experience the experts agreed that it is difficult to determine the exact cost of a ship before the process starts due to fragile factors such as exchange rate natural disasters political decisions international financial crises etc for this scenario the approximate costs for each strategy taken from the experts are given in table 11 in the united states dollars usd after the expert consultations cost of each strategy are calculated fuzzy expressions are primarily preferred because it is close to the human thought system then the mean of approximate values in the intervals represented by the fuzzy expressions are obtained as the data given in table 10 the weights of strategies constitute the decision matrix of game theory table 12 shows the weights of a player s strategies in terms of the b player s strategies the risk levels of the shipyard are indicated in table 12 it means that shipyard a is competing with shipyard b based on the strategies of risk of low quality labor risk of payment difficulty ship maintenance risks and risk of failure to provide extra facilities on demand according to the game theory the nash equilibrium for strategies of a the row is g usd 30 986 in the case of realizing their strategies the maximum amount of risk that a can tolerate is found to be usd 30 986 similarly as it is shown in table 13 shipyard b can overcome usd 21 700 based on the game theory of which its steps are given in the methodology section in such a case the shipyard a which offers more opportunities for the shipowner to the hypothetical ship should be a priority for the shipowner 4 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a holistic approach to measure the performance of a criterion when the other factors are involved in comprehensively in this study we employed a sensitivity analysis based on the study of 11 sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of shipyard strategies under a fuzzy environment for the validation of outcomes seven cases are generated for each player as given in tables 14 and 15 current all low all medium weights are used to analyze the sensitivity of the critical shipyard strategies cases 4 to 7 are generated to see the high values for the specific strategies of the competitors and the low values for other strategies the changes in risk levels and rankings are given in figs 5 to 8 as can be seen k 2 shows the highest importance in seven cases then k 1 follows it similarly s 3 indicates the highest importance in seven cases then s 2 follows it 4 3 validation several studies in the literature deal with the reliability and validation which are two crucial parameters for the mcdm and game theoretical approach deng and jiang 2019 madani and lund 2011 wee et al 2020 ahp and game theory are valid methods and approaches since improved fuzzy ahp based game theoretic model is an entirely new approach to the best of our knowledge there is no existing model that fits completely to compare those therefore for the hybrid approaches there exist analytical requirements for the candidate method of which it provides a decision support system for the ship s investment in favor of the shipowner these requirements are the use of linguistic variables fuzzy expressions ease of use with pairwise comparisons ability to work in a competitive environment availability of desired parameters such as financial technical or operational concerns traceability of each step and sensitivity analysis to solve the problem a decision making process is conducted in this process the final model is developed step by step the model providing all these analytical requirements are obtained field experts test the obtained data findings prove that the method is valid 5 discussion 5 1 performance evaluation of the developed model as this paper intends to develop a mcda model for shipyard selection the results are shown in fig 9 the probability of each strategy in the game matrix is given in the graphical form fig 9 accordingly the most advantageous of these risky situations for shipyard a is poor quality labor s1 0 053 contrary to the assumption coefficients for variation of the parameters affecting labor in labor costs are relatively low control is more comfortable for the shipyard but the warranty period s3 0 548 involves risks that occur outside the control of the shipyard other strategies for shipyard a are the risk of failure to provide extra facilities on demand s4 0 330 and the risk of payment difficulty s2 0 068 the riskiest strategy of shipyard b is expected by the shipowner to offer shipowners extra opportunities other than shipbuilding in a highly competitive environment k4 0 496 other strategies for shipyard b are material based risks k1 0 399 risk of not being tolerated in favor of the shipowner k3 0 083 and late delivery risk k2 0 023 the results show that a feature of this model is in favor of the shipowners fuzzy logic is integrated into the system making it closer to the human thought system the financial risks are kept to a minimum due to the setting of the game it reflects real time business cases that financial risk is minimized in a competitive environment managerial implications for ship investment versus shipyard strategies can be found in appendix separate interviews have been conducted and experts have provided future directions of shipbuilding industry if more experts are involved in the expert consultation process it will take longer time to have expert interviews collect data and questionnaire process this method is ready to be extended to multiple market players with different number of strategies the proposed ifahp based game theoretic model can also be developed by alternative mcda methods deterministic heuristic computational intelligence table 16 demonstrates three shipyards with different number of strategies shipyard 1 consists of four strategies k 1 2 3 4 shipyard 2 has three strategies l 1 2 3 and shipyard 3 has five strategies m 1 2 3 4 5 there exist sixty decisions to be made in this setting however as it can be seen here as the number of shipyards and or strategies increases the complexity increases but compromise the clarity of results optimization and other techniques can be chosen to conduct the analysis with great clarity while the complexity increases 5 2 academic and managerial implications the research findings have the following academic implications first the criteria influencing shipyard selection especially those related to risk and finance are identified in the form of competitive games it triggers new research directions on mcdm and game theory in the future to address the general setting of competitive markets secondly the method is pioneered to make the overall decision result rationalized by considering two decision makers of different criteria this method is also applicable to solve other mcdm problems with varying criteria in a dynamic market thirdly the relative weights of criteria are determined by an ifahp and fuzzy expressions establish the structure of ahp the model is demonstrated with a real application and found useful in processing risk and qualitative information simultaneously fourthly the proposed model with the aid of the game theory enables shipowners to evaluate and select the most preferred ship in a dynamic environment moreover the results of ship evaluation can also enable professional staff to recognize current strengths and the defects of competitive strategies then get more rational decision making through strategy re positioning it will significantly improve the overall selection of game settings and mcdm besides academic implications this study also provides some guidance for shipowners and shipyards on how to deal with conflicting strategies in a shipbuilding service the study may support shipyards in dealing with shipowner s expectations of providing extra facilities on demand in interviews with field experts it has observed that shipyard executives were struggling to understand why some strategies were effective in attracting shipowners while others were not this study provides an overall systematic framework that allows the shipyard executives to evaluate a mix of strategies in developing a better service to shipowners on the other hand this study s findings may support shipyard executives to increase the labor costs or the labor salaries because it is not the highest concern of the shipowners as this study demonstrates shipyards have to manage multiple strategies simultaneously the mix of strategies may be even more pronounced than individual strategy in this study we encourage shipyards executives to foster strategies more integrative for serving shipowners in this competitive shipbuilding industry therefore managerial implications based on the relative importance of the different criteria and different strategies can help guide competing shipyards as decision makers and assist in ship investment based on shipyard strategies 6 conclusions in this study an improved fuzzy ahp ifahp based game theoretic model is presented to assist shipyard selection the main goal of this paper is to investigate whether the combination of ifahp and game theoretic model is a good approach for solving a mcdm problem of selecting one shipyard in a competitive market the model is proposed from the perspective of human thinking style particularly with pairwise comparison a 10 step process is developed by using ifahp and game theoretic model the study provides a risk assessment tool to help the shipowners for guiding the shipyard selection and proves the applicability of the method along with its consistency from the case study and sensitivity analysis it is found that time in delivery is the most important factor of shipyard selection and quality labor is the second most important one from the expert consultations shipowners tend to focus more on shipbuilding process than on future ship maintenance shipyards are advised to endure higher costs of shipbuilding three future research directions could be explored to increase our understanding of ship investment and the roles of shipyards and other decision makers first only shipowners have been consulted other related field experts knowledge e g marine insurers ship charterers etc and ship operators opinions can be collected in future research second only two shipyards have been considered and assumed to be competitors a future research study could be conducted with multiple market players to extend the present research to competition and cooperation among market players this could be the multiple strategies in a ship selection game third the way to finance shipbuilding is not considered ship leasing is a popular source of ship financing yu et al 2019 but many banks consider ship leasing for ship investors the consideration of ship leasing may or may not lead to different strategies of ship investment which would be

marketing strategy similarly experts evaluate the importance level of shipowners expectations from the shipyards as given in table 19 6 how do you assess the shipbuilding industry in developing countries in the interviews we have conducted with experienced professionals at local we asked the state of the shipbuilding industry in developing countries overall we have reached the following generalizations the shipbuilding industry in developing countries such as turkey is still in the development stage and there exist many difficulties in terms of planning and efficient production there are several advantages for the shipowner such as customer oriented construction management and provision of service for specific shipbuilding there are also opportunities in the production of offshore platforms turkish shipyards are technologically behind from a global perspective research and development investments are given little importance in recent years but the increase still left behind from the current advances some experts have maintained hope for the future of the shipbuilding industry in turkey and commented that it would be better 7 how can two shipyards compete with each other experts point out the following important points for a shipyard in a competitive environment main competition parameters can be itemized as timely delivery reasonable price adequate quality customer orientation quality of material cheap and high quality labor and flexibility for shipowner s wishes according to the situations that may arise later shipyards can set a robust organizational structure and realize a life long learning approach in their company 
20663,this paper investigates fault feature extraction for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with weak thruster fault when the conventional feature extraction method based on time frequency domain decomposition is used to extract the weak fault feature of the thruster the frequency bands of the fault feature and disturbance feature are overlapped such that it is difficult to extract the fault feature accurately to solve this problem a novel extraction method for fault feature is developed based on an optimized sparse decomposition algorithm two problems are encountered when directly using the existing sparse decomposition algorithm to diagnose weak thruster fault the first problem is that during the decomposition of time domain signals the accuracy is relatively low a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed in this study to address this problem the second problem is that during the extraction of weak fault feature of the thruster the difference between the fault feature and disturbance feature is small to address this problem a feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix is proposed finally pool experimental verifications are presented keywords autonomous underwater vehicles thruster weak faults sparse decomposition 1 introduction safety is a vital concern in autonomous underwater vehicle auv research and application during unmanned and cableless operations in marine environments brito et al 2010 as the critical actuation component in an auv the thruster is a common source of fault if the thruster fault can be diagnosed at an early phase a more serious fault can be avoided zhang et al 2016 in general the fault in the early phase is weak the loss of the thrust is less than 10 wang et al 2013 therefore investigation of the diagnosis method for weak thruster fault is of great significance the typical process of fault diagnosis can be primarily divided into three sub steps fault feature extraction fault diagnosis and fault degree identification the fundamental process is illustrated in fig 1 dearden and ernits 2013 this paper investigates the first sub step i e the feature extraction of weak thruster fault in contrast to the fault feature extraction in other fields the feature extraction of weak thruster fault of auvs is affected by random ocean currents and strong measurement noise zhang et al 2015 li et al 2020 a typical method for the auv thruster fault feature extraction is wavelet decomposition method time frequency decomposition method wan et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 for feature extraction for an auv with loss of the thrust being more than 20 the authors previously proposed a fault feature extraction method based on wavelet decomposition combined with channel extended empirical mode decomposition emd zhang et al 2016 this method has a good feature extraction effect for this scenario however for a weak fault the loss of the thrust is less than 10 it is difficult to distinguish the fault feature and disturbance feature after wavelet decomposition as a result the problem of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis occurs the reasons for this problem are analyzed as follows for a weak thruster fault the fault feature is weak and the signal to noise ratio is low after wavelet decomposition the wavelet detail coefficient considered as the fault feature is hidden in the disturbance feature hence it is difficult to distinguish the abnormal points of the fault through this method in addition an auv is a closed loop system when a weak thruster fault occurs the change of auv states caused by the fault is unobvious under the action of closed loop control the control signals can be adjusted quickly allowing the auv to re track the target in a short time owing to the short change time of the auv states a low decomposition scale with a narrow time window is adopted for analysis when using wavelet decomposition when the low scale decomposition is used a relatively wide frequency band is generated and there is an overlap of the frequency band of the fault feature with that of the disturbance thus the wavelet detail coefficient considered as the fault feature also contains the disturbance feature and its amplitude is similar to that of the fault feature consequently it is difficult to distinguish the abnormal points by adopting the wavelet method to extract the weak thruster fault feature which can easily result in misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis the wavelet decomposition method is a typical time frequency decomposition method and its core function is to study the local features in the time and frequency domains however the features of the weak thruster fault and the external disturbance overlap in the time and frequency domains thus the wavelet decomposition method cannot be applied to extract the weak fault feature of the thruster meanwhile we also used common time frequency domain decomposition methods such as empirical mode and wavelet packet decomposition methods wan et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 to extract the weak thruster fault feature but the results were not satisfactory inspired by the literatures on signal processing based on the sparse decomposition algorithm this study attempts to utilize the sparse decomposition algorithm to extract features of weak thruster fault as a novel signal processing method the sparse decomposition algorithm was first used in the field of image processing in 2006 over the past few years this algorithm has been used in the fault feature extraction of rotating machinery e g bearings and exhibits superiority olshausen and field 1996 lee et al 2007 liu et al 2010 the aim of feature extraction is to retrieve useful information hidden in the original time domain the transform domain should be appropriately selected based on the different features of the signals so that the useful signals and the disturbance signals can be effectively distinguished according to the above analysis the feature extraction method based on wavelet decomposition which transforms signals into that of the time frequency domain is not sensitive to weak thruster fault the sparse decomposition algorithm transforms signals into that of the self constructed sparse domain and is able to concisely represent the signal and learn high level features from the captured data hence this study attempts to extract the features of weak thruster fault based on the sparse decomposition algorithm the problem definitions are as follows when the existing sparse decomposition algorithm is directly used for weak fault diagnosis of the thruster two problems arise 1 during the decomposition of time domain signals the accuracy is relatively low based on the existing sparse decomposition algorithm 2 the difference between the fault feature and disturbance feature when extracting the weak fault feature of the thruster based on the existing sparse decomposition algorithm is small the main contributions of this study are as follows i to solve the problem 1 i e the low decomposition accuracy of the sparse decomposition algorithm for signals in the time domain a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed for decomposing the time domain signals ii to address the problem 2 i e the small difference between fault feature and disturbance feature when adopting the existing sparse decomposition algorithm an improved feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix is proposed for extracting fault features iii based on the above mentioned improvements of the existing sparse decomposition algorithm a novel and complete extraction method for fault features is developed based on an optimized sparse decomposition algorithm the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the problems arising when the existing sparse decomposition algorithm is directly used to extract the features of weak thruster fault and then analyzes the sources of the problems section 3 elaborates the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm and the feasibility of this algorithm is verified by a pool experiment the extraction method for weak fault features based on the fault weight matrix is introduced in section 4 and its feasibility is verified via pool experiments in section 5 the feasibility of the complete extraction method for weak thruster fault features is verified experimentally and compared with the wavelet decomposition method finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 problem statement and analysis this study investigates the extraction method for weak thruster fault based on the sparse decomposition algorithm in this section we briefly describe the shortcomings of the weak thruster feature extraction based on the sparse decomposition algorithm and then analyze the causes of the shortcomings finally we briefly introduce the extraction method of fault feature based on an optimized sparse decomposition algorithm 2 1 problem statement the sparse decomposition algorithm is employed to extract the weak fault feature of the thruster and the problems existing in such methods are expounded the sparse decomposition algorithm transforms the signals into the sparse domain and extracts the signals feature lee et al 2007 tang et al 2014 gajjar et al 2017 inspired by the above references this study designs the extraction method of auv weak thruster fault based on the sparse decomposition algorithm as shown in fig 2 the specific connotation of each step in fig 2 is as follows a building atom dictionary the dictionary is built by existing signal samples so that its basic function has a structure similar to the auv states b sparse decomposition the built atomic dictionary is adopted to decompose the signals sparsely the termination condition is determined by the residual energy of signals c fault feature extraction the sparse decomposition coefficients corresponding to each atom dictionary built from sparse decomposition are used as the extracted fault features while following the above steps to extract fault features in experimental studies we encountered the following two problems 1 the sparse decomposition algorithm has a low decomposition accuracy for time series signals decomposition results specifically in step b during the decomposition of time domain signals the accuracy is relatively low for time domain signals based on the existing sparse decomposition algorithm 2 the difference between the decomposition coefficients in the presence and absence of a fault remains small specifically in step c the decomposition coefficient is considered as the fault feature and the difference between the decomposition coefficients under fault and no fault is still small the decomposition coefficient in the case of a fault is the fault feature and that in the case of no fault is the disturbance feature the smaller the difference between the two the lower the accuracy of the fault diagnosis results leading to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis 2 2 cause analysis to solve the above two problems encountered when extracting the weak fault feature of the thruster based on the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm the causes of the problems are analyzed 1 analysis of the cause of the problem 1 the conventional sparse decomposition method for long signals is as follows first the original signal with a length of k beats are divided into short signals of the same length as that of the atomic dictionary and each short signal is then decomposed separately assuming that the length of the atomic dictionary is n the long signal is decomposed into k n segments to achieve k n decomposition results however the thruster fault may occur at any position in the n beats of the short signal thus the conventional method for decomposing the original signal cannot distinguish the fault accurately leading to the low accuracy of the decomposition result in the time domain 2 analysis of the cause of the problem 2 in the auv operation in addition to the thruster fault the current disturbance also affects the yaw angle signal surge velocity signal and other state signals of the auv the basic idea of fault extraction based on the sparse decomposition algorithm is to decompose the signals sparsely and subsequently consider the sparse decomposition coefficient as the fault feature the sparse decomposition coefficient only represents the scaling value of the atomic dictionary because the signals variation caused by the weak thruster fault is small the difference between the decomposition coefficient at the fault time and that only affected by ocean currents is small thus the weak fault feature is difficult to distinguish from the ocean current disturbance feature only by exploiting the sparse decomposition coefficient as the fault feature in the conventional method 2 3 improvement strategy based on the aforementioned analysis this study improves the sparse decomposition algorithm and the basic process of the novel diagnosis of the fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm is shown in fig 3 by comparing figs 2 and 3 the proposed fault feature extraction method can be shown to include the following two aspects 1 for step b a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed to replace the sparse decomposition method in the conventional method 2 for step c a method based on fault weight matrix for extracting weak fault features is proposed to replace the conventional feature extraction method in section 2 we analyze the shortcomings of the weak thruster feature extraction based on the sparse decomposition algorithm and then two improvements are made next we will describe the improvements in detail specifically section 3 describes the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm and section 4 presents the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix 3 time shift operator based decomposition algorithm and experimental verification the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm decomposes the original long s into short signals of the same length as that of the atomic dictionary hao et al 2017 which was first applied in the field of image processing without considering the time domain accuracy while applying this algorithm to the signals processing of auv states it is found that the precise location of the fault in the short signal segment cannot be obtained directly using the conventional algorithm this leads to the low accuracy of the decomposition results in the time domain i e problem 1 stated in section 2 1 to address this problem 1 a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed in this study based on the above analysis and the feasibility of this algorithm is experimentally verified 3 1 time shift operator based decomposition algorithm at first the concept of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is explained followed by the analysis of the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm finally the calculation formula of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is provided 1 basic feature of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm as discussed above because the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm cannot directly decompose the long signal the signal needs to be divided and decomposed thus the decomposition accuracy of this algorithm for time series signals in the time domain is low accordingly the time shift operator is added to the sparse decomposition algorithm in this study i e the time variable is added to the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm this ensures that each beat of the original signal obtains a corresponding decomposition result rather than the same decomposition resulting in the same time segment as that in the conventional algorithm thus the precision of the time domain decomposition result is improved the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm and the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm are explained in the next section 2 calculation formula of conventional sparse decomposition algorithm the basic principle of the conventional sparse algorithm is to split the long input signal x of length l into short signals of length m which are expressed as a linear weighted combination of the basis function d and noise as expressed by the following two equations hao et al 2017 1 x d α ε k 1 k d k α k ε 2 min α α 0 where d d 1 d 2 d k r m k is the atomic dictionary matrix and d k is the column vector in the dictionary matrix also called an atom α α 1 α 2 α k t is the sparse decomposition coefficient obtained from the sparse decomposition of the input signals and ε is the sparse decomposition residual term l 0 represents the zero norm used to calculate the number of nonzero terms in the coefficient vector eq 1 is the fundamental formula of the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm eq 2 is a constraint of eq 1 which can make the result of eq 1 sparse because the coefficient α k is primarily zero or close to zero hao et al 2017 next the following improvements are introduced into the sparse decomposition algorithm as revealed from the analysis of eq 1 and eq 2 the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm does not consider the signals variation in the time domain i e there is no time variable therefore when processing the time series signal it can only divide the time sequence signal into fragments of identical length similar to that of the atomic dictionary for instance the length of the auv atomic dictionary for the velocity signals in this study is 50 beats therefore to obtain a velocity signals decomposition result 50 beats are required this study attempts to achieve a decomposition result for each beat thus the time domain accuracy of the decomposition result can be enhanced therefore this study improves the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm by adding a time shift operator in eq 1 according to this improvement the long time series signals can be directly to be decomposed which can enhance the accuracy of the sparse decomposition algorithm in the time domain 3 calculation formula of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm to make the sparse decomposition algorithm applicable to time series signals this study improves the calculation formula of the sparse decomposition algorithm by adding a time shift operator and deduces the calculation formula of the final decomposition coefficient the following is the derivation of the calculation formula of the algorithm the objective of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm in this study is to decompose an original signal x of length l through a fixed length atomic dictionary of length k and obtain the sparse representation of the decomposed signal each time thus the algorithm proposed in this study can obtain the set of atomic dictionaries at any moment by adding a time shift operator based on eq 1 eq 1 can be improved as follows 3 x k τ α k τ m k t τ ε k τ α k τ t τ m k ε the constraint eq 2 is expressed as 4 min α k τ α k τ 0 where t τ is the shift operator that selects an atom m k 1 k k and then assigns it to start at instant τ therefore dictionary d 2 can be defined as d 2 t τ m k k τ t is the time variable τ and k denote the summation functions which calculate the sums of the variables τ and k respectively and α k τ is the sparse decomposition coefficient eq 3 and eq 4 are ideal expressions for the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm in practice we need to obtain the sparse decomposition coefficient α k τ corresponding to the atomic set m k subsequently the decomposition coefficient α k τ is obtained by the following steps the zero norm l 0 in eq 4 represents the number of non zero terms for the coefficient vector which is a nondeterministic polynomial that cannot be solved directly in practice it is approximated by the l 2 norm accordingly the constraint formula eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 min x k τ α k τ t τ m k 2 2 where m k is the column vector for a given atom m κ we have 6 x ˆ κ τ α κ τ t τ m κ ε where x ˆ κ is the fitted signal with a given atom m κ based on eq 5 and eq 6 the following equations can be derived to obtain the optimal matching atom m κ o p t and corresponding sparse decomposition α κ o p t as 7 m κ o p t α κ o p t argmin m 2 1 x ˆ κ τ σ τ α τ t τ m 2 2 where σ τ τ α k τ 0 m is the column vector representing an adjustable atom in the dictionary when only using the support information from the decomposition the dictionary and coefficient are jointly estimated to obtain the most matched atoms m κ and the corresponding sparse decomposition α κ τ as follows mailhé et al 2008 8 m κ argmin m 2 1 τ σ τ m t τ x ˆ κ 2 9 α κ τ τ σ τ argmin x ˆ κ τ σ τ α τ t τ m 2 2 where t τ denotes the adjoint matrix of the time shift operator t τ therefore eq 8 and eq 9 can be performed successively to obtain each value of m k and α k τ these are the implementation of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm next the feasibility of this algorithm is experimentally verified 3 2 experimental verification of time shift operator based decomposition algorithm to verify the feasibility of the improved algorithm the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm is used to conduct comparative analysis based on pool experimental data on a prototype auv the experimental environment and the comparative test results are described below 1 experimental environment in this study the beaver ii auv experimental prototype illustrated in fig 4 is employed for the pool experiment zhang et al 2016 and the experimental environment is presented in fig 5 the auv performs a straight moving experiment at a constant velocity of 0 3 m s in a flowing environment the flow field distribution is illustrated in fig 6 zhang et al 2016 under the experimental conditions the auv cruises with a constant velocity of 0 3 m s and on thruster fault where current disturbance is shown as fig 6 the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm and the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm are adopted to decompose the collected signals including velocity yaw angle and main thruster voltage the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the problem of low accuracy of the decomposition results of the sparse decomposition algorithm which does not involve fault feature extraction hence the experimental data from auv without thruster fault are employed the original surge data without fault are shown in fig 7 2 experimental results the data sample parameters are as follows the total beat number is 500 signal sampling interval is 0 2 s and sampling frequency is 5 hz the atomic dictionary is built based on the k svd method yang et al 2017 where the length of the velocity signal atomic dictionary is 50 beats subsequently the corresponding experimental results are analyzed the auv velocity signal data samples are decomposed based on the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm and the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm the results are presented in fig 8 fig 8 shows the decomposition results of the velocity signal using the two methods the higher the sampling frequency the smaller the time difference between the adjacent decomposition results and the higher the accuracy of the decomposition results in time domain analysis of the decomposition results shown in fig 9 reveals that the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm yields a decomposition result per 50 beats whereas the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm yields a decomposition result every beat hence the sampling frequencies of the decomposition result for these two algorithms are 0 1 hz and 5 hz respectively since sampling frequency is 5 hz by comparison the sampling frequency of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is 50 times that of the conventional algorithm therefore it is proved that the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm effectively enhances the accuracy of the decomposition result of the conventional algorithm in the time domain therefore a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve the low accuracy of time series signals decomposed using the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm through comparative experiments it is verified that the proposed algorithm can enhance the accuracy of the time domain signal decomposition results as explained in section 2 1 the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm encounters two problems when extracting weak fault of auv thrusters 1 the accuracy of the decomposition results for time series signal is low and 2 the difference between the decomposition coefficients in the presence and absence of a fault remains small when the fault feature is extracted specifically problem 1 is addressed in the present section and the feasibility of this algorithm is verified via pool experiments for problem 2 a method for weak fault feature extraction based on fault weight matrix is described in the next section 4 feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix and experimental verification problem 2 of the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm explained in section 2 1 states that during the extraction of weak fault of auv thruster the difference between the decomposition coefficient under fault and that without fault remains small in this section to solve it a feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is developed and the experimental verification is conducted 4 1 feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix in this subsection the fundamental idea of this method and its difference from the conventional feature extraction method based on sparse decomposition are first presented subsequently the learning process of the key fault weight matrix of the improved method is elucidated 1 concept behind the method in the conventional feature extraction method based on sparse decomposition the decomposition coefficients corresponding to the atomic dictionary are treated as fault features for feature diagnosis kreutz delgado et al 2003 the basic idea of the improved method is to establish the fault weight matrix corresponding to the atom dictionary subsequently the inner product of the sparse decomposition coefficient and fault weight matrix is considered as the fault feature to enhance the differences between the fault feature and disturbance feature this improvement can overcome the difficulty of distinguishing the weak fault of the thruster from the ocean current disturbance to clearly elucidate the difference between the two methods a schematic comparison of the conventional feature extraction method and the improved feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is presented in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the fault weight matrix is introduced into the improved method on the fundamental of conventional method and the inner product of the fault weight matrix and the sparse decomposition coefficient is then used as an optimized fault feature compared with the conventional method the new feature of the improved method includes fault weight matrix next the learning method of the fault weight matrix is elucidated 2 learning method of fault weight matrix atomic dictionaries obtained by conventional sparse decomposition are label free and do not contain fault information to enhance fault features this study introduces a fault label for each atom when building an atom dictionary i e the fault weight matrix mentioned in this study therefore this study decomposes the known fault data samples so that the decomposition coefficients contain the required fault information next the decomposition coefficients of the identical atoms are introduced to obtain the fault weight matrix based on the specific ideas of the mentioned learning methods the flow chart of the proposed method is presented in fig 10 fig 10 shows that the learning method of the fault weight matrix is to decompose the fault samples continuously and then update the fault weight matrix the specific process is elucidated as follows the learning method of the fault weight matrix in this study can be divided into the following five steps 1 initialization taking j samples x j 1 2 j to be learned let j 1 the residual term is initialized to ε x j atomic dictionary d is learned using the k svd algorithm number of iterations is t 1 and the fault weight matrix is w 2 find matching atom the inner product of the residuals ε and the atoms d i in the atom dictionary d are identified figured out and the subscript of the maximum value of the inner product λ is identified which is expressed as 10 x d λ sup i 1 k x d i where d i denotes each atom from the atom dictionary and i is the number of each atom 3 update coefficient matrix and fault weight matrix the coefficient matrix is updated as 11 α n 1 α n eq 10 indicates that the decomposition coefficient obtained in the n t h iteration is used to replace the coefficient in the n 1 t h iteration and the corresponding updated fault weight matrix is 12 w λ w λ α t 4 update the residual the residual is the difference between the original signal and the current iteration fitting result expressed as 13 ε t x d t α t 5 judge the termination condition the iteration termination condition of the algorithm refers to the number of atoms k employed to decompose the signal if the number of iterations satisfies n k the calculation returns to step 1 if the number of iterations satisfies n k the next set of data j j 1 is learned when all the data are learned the fault weight matrix is normalized and the calculation is performed n denotes the number of atoms adopted to decompose the signal owing to the sparse nature of the signals only a few atoms contain useful signal information the selection method of n is obtained by analyzing the amplitude of the decomposition coefficient corresponding to different atoms after decomposing the fault samples a previous study reported that the decomposition coefficient of 2 3 atoms in the signal decomposition result obtained from the auv states is significantly higher than that of the remaining atoms therefore the coefficient n is set to 3 in this study in this study t the fault weight matrix is introduced into the conventional feature extraction method to enhance the fault feature in the next subsection the feasibility of the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is verified by comparative experiments 4 2 experimental verification to verify the feasibility of the improved feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm is used to conduct comparative analysis the experimental conditions and the comparative experimental results are described below 1 fault simulation method in this section the thruster fault is simulated according to the method in our previous research chu and zhang 2014 shown as follows assuming that the fault degree of the thruster is λ the real thrust of the thruster is τ 1 λ τ where τ is the desired thrust for this corresponding thruster to simulate the fault of the thruster the control voltage is converted and calculated and then sent to the thruster motor driver the equation for voltage conversion is as follows u 1 λ u 0 84 λ where u denotes the actual control voltage input to the motor driver u denotes the control voltage of the controller output and λ is the assumed fault degree in this study λ is set to 5 to simulate a fault with 5 loss of the thrust 2 experimental data of sample parameters in this study the fault sample data with 5 loss of the thrust are used for comparison this study only focuses on the thruster fault diagnosis for an auv during the constant velocity cruise therefore the start up phase is not considered the experimental data of 500 beats in the steady state phase are selected for the analysis a desired velocity is 0 3 m s and the fault occurs at the 200th beat the original data with 5 loss of the thrust are shown in fig 11 3 comparison of experimental results the comparative experimental results of the two methods are presented in fig 12 because the fault information of the thruster is primarily reflected in the velocity signal yaw angle and control voltage of the auv the three kinds data are experimentally analyzed the blue line in fig 12 shows the fault features of surge velocity yaw angle and main thruster voltage obtained using the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix and the red line is obtained using the conventional method presented in fig 9 a as can be seen from fig 12 near the occurrence of a fault 200 beats there is no fault feature peak value when the conventional method is used whereas there is a clear and large fault feature peak value when using the method based on the fault weight matrix the reason for the difference between the blue and red curves in fig 12 is explained as follows in the conventional feature extraction method the sparse decomposition coefficient is considered as the fault feature in this case the sparse decomposition coefficient represents only the scaling value of the corresponding atomic dictionary because the variance of signals caused by the weak fault of the thruster are small the difference between the decomposition coefficient of the fault and that of the current disturbance is small in this study the fault weight matrix is established by utilizing the fault information data and the fault feature is enhanced by the inner product of the weight matrix and the original fault feature matrix as a result the blue curve obtained by the improved method based on the fault weight matrix shows a large difference from the red curve obtained by the conventional method near the fault occurrence moment to quantitatively analyze the performance of the improved method and facilitate the comparison the specific data in fig 12 are extracted the specific data are presented in table 1 in this study the extracted fault features are used for the subsequent weak fault diagnosis of the thruster and it is always required that the values of fault features are higher than the disturbance feature hence this study verifies the feasibility of the improved method by comparing the ratio of the fault feature and the disturbance feature the conventional feature extraction method is used to extract fault features from three signals and the ratios of the feature values are 0 262 0 506 and 0 214 all less than 1 this shows that the fault feature value of the conventional method is smaller than the value of the disturbance feature which means that the conventional feature extraction method cannot effectively extract the weak fault feature of the thruster the feature value ratios obtained using the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix are 1 588 1 708 and 2 381 which are all greater than 1 demonstrating that the feature value at the time of fault is higher than the disturbance feature value at any time for different signals the ratios of the feature values in this method are improved by 132 6 120 2 and 216 7 compared to the conventional method therefore the feasibility and superiority of the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix during the extraction of weak fault features are verified from the result it can be concluded that the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix achieved better results during the feature extraction of the main voltage signal the auv uses an electronic compass and a dvl sensor to obtain the surge velocity and yaw information through measurement while the main voltage can be directly extracted in the software system therefore the accuracy of the feature extraction result utilizing the main thrust voltage signal is better it also indirectly shows that the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is better than the conventional method as expounded in section 2 1 the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm encounters two problems when extracting weak fault of auv thrusters 1 the accuracy of the decomposition results for time series signal is low and 2 the difference between the decomposition coefficients u in the presence and absence of a fault remains small is small when the fault feature is extracted specifically problem 1 is addressed in section 3 for problem 2 a feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is developed in this section and the feasibility of this method is verified by comparative experiments with conventional method 5 comparison with wavelet decomposition method two problems are encountered when extracting the auv thruster weak fault features based on the sparse decomposition method in sections 3 and 4 we presented the improved algorithms including the corresponding pool experimental verification in this section these two improved algorithms are combined to form a novel extraction method for fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm the method proposed in this study is a new method in principle therefore to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved feature extraction method the feature extraction method based on wavelet decomposition is used to conduct comparative experiments the wavelet decomposition method was adopted in the auv thruster fault feature extraction method zhang et al 2014 the experimental data of the sample parameters are first explained and the experimental results are then compared 1 experimental data of sample parameters the fault sample data with a 5 loss of the thrust are employed in the comparative experiment same as section 4 3 2 comparative experimental results the experimental results based on these two different methods are presented in fig 13 as mentioned in the previous subsection the comparison is also performed by considering the velocity signal yaw angle and main voltage as the analysis objects the blue line in fig 13 shows the fault features of surge velocity yaw angle and main thruster voltage obtained using the novel extraction method of fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm and the red line is obtained using the wavelet decomposition method as shown in fig 12 near the occurrence of a fault 200 beats both the proposed methods in this study and the wavelet decomposition method showed feature peak values but the peak value of the novel method is clearly higher than that of the wavelet decomposition method in addition the novel method is superior to the wavelet decomposition method in terms of the difference between the feature peak value and the disturbance feature value the feature extraction method based on wavelet decomposition is a time frequency domain decomposition method which transforms the time domain signal into the frequency domain signal through wavelet decomposition however when this method is applied in extracting the weak fault feature of the thruster a problem of frequency band overlapping of the fault feature and disturbance arises which leads to a relatively small fault feature value and disturbance value in this study the novel extraction method of fault feature is based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm for fault feature extraction which transforms the time domain signal into that of the sparse domain avoiding the overlapping problem of the fault feature and disturbance in the frequency domain therefore near the fault occurrence moment the blue curve obtained using the novel method and the red curve obtained using the wavelet decomposition method have a large difference to quantitatively analyze the performance of the novel extraction method of fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm the specific data in fig 13 are extracted the specific data are presented in table 2 the experimental results are presented in fig 13 and table 2 in the feature extraction stage a larger extracted fault feature value than the disturbance feature value indicates that the weak fault feature of the thruster in the presence of current disturbance is marked which shows that the performance of the novel feature extraction method is better therefore the novel extraction method of the fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm is better than the wavelet decomposition method in terms of the ratio of the value of the fault feature to the disturbance feature as can be seen from table 2 the ratios of the feature values of the 3 signals after wavelet decomposition are 1 278 1 138 and 1 676 the ratios of the feature values of the proposed method in this study are 1 588 1 708 and 2 381 the ratios of the feature values of the decomposition results of both methods are greater than 1 demonstrating that the feature values of the fault are higher than the disturbance feature values i e the two methods induce certain effects on the extraction of weak fault features compared to the wavelet decomposition method the ratios of the feature values for these three signals are improved by 24 25 50 08 and 42 06 in this subsection the comparison between the wavelet decomposition method and the novel method based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm for the extraction of weak fault features of the auv thruster proves that the proposed novel method outperforms the wavelet decomposition method for the weak fault of the auv thruster 6 conclusion this study analyzes the limitations of time frequency decomposition methods in addressing the problems associated with the extraction of weak fault features of an auv thruster and then it investigates the problems of using a new concept based on sparse decomposition based on the two problems existing in the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm in thruster fault feature extraction the improved methods are developed to overcome the limitation of relatively low decomposition accuracy for time domain signals based on the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed the conventional algorithm ignores the influence of time variables on the decomposition results which leads to poor accuracy in the time domain this study addresses this limitation in the conventional algorithm by adding the time shift operator to it and verifies the improvement when using the algorithm over the conventional algorithm by comparing the sampling frequency of the decomposition results in the time domain the experimental results show that the sampling frequency of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is 50 times that of the conventional algorithm which verifies the feasibility of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm based on the improved sparse decomposition in this study the difference between decomposition coefficients in the presence and absence of a fault is still small i e the difference between fault feature and disturbance feature remains small to solve this problem a feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix is proposed by constructing a fault weight matrix this method enhances the fault feature and it also increases the difference between the fault feature and the disturbance feature from comparative experimental results it is found that the ratios of the fault features extracted using the conventional method to the disturbance feature are less than 1 that is all the fault features are less than the disturbance feature it indicates that the conventional method cannot be used for extracting weak fault feature meanwhile all the ratios obtained using the improved method are greater than 1 compared to the conventional method the ratios of fault feature to disturbance feature for different signals are improved by 132 6 120 2 and 216 7 which verifies the feasibility of the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix finally this study proposes a novel extraction method for fault feature based on an optimized sparse decomposition by combining the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm and the extraction method based on the fault weight matrix the proposed fault feature extraction method is compared with the fault feature extraction method based on the wavelet decomposition method the experimental results show that when using the feature extraction method based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm the ratios of the feature values from different signals are improved by 24 25 50 08 and 42 06 compared to those from the wavelet decomposition method these experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed method in

20663,this paper investigates fault feature extraction for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with weak thruster fault when the conventional feature extraction method based on time frequency domain decomposition is used to extract the weak fault feature of the thruster the frequency bands of the fault feature and disturbance feature are overlapped such that it is difficult to extract the fault feature accurately to solve this problem a novel extraction method for fault feature is developed based on an optimized sparse decomposition algorithm two problems are encountered when directly using the existing sparse decomposition algorithm to diagnose weak thruster fault the first problem is that during the decomposition of time domain signals the accuracy is relatively low a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed in this study to address this problem the second problem is that during the extraction of weak fault feature of the thruster the difference between the fault feature and disturbance feature is small to address this problem a feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix is proposed finally pool experimental verifications are presented keywords autonomous underwater vehicles thruster weak faults sparse decomposition 1 introduction safety is a vital concern in autonomous underwater vehicle auv research and application during unmanned and cableless operations in marine environments brito et al 2010 as the critical actuation component in an auv the thruster is a common source of fault if the thruster fault can be diagnosed at an early phase a more serious fault can be avoided zhang et al 2016 in general the fault in the early phase is weak the loss of the thrust is less than 10 wang et al 2013 therefore investigation of the diagnosis method for weak thruster fault is of great significance the typical process of fault diagnosis can be primarily divided into three sub steps fault feature extraction fault diagnosis and fault degree identification the fundamental process is illustrated in fig 1 dearden and ernits 2013 this paper investigates the first sub step i e the feature extraction of weak thruster fault in contrast to the fault feature extraction in other fields the feature extraction of weak thruster fault of auvs is affected by random ocean currents and strong measurement noise zhang et al 2015 li et al 2020 a typical method for the auv thruster fault feature extraction is wavelet decomposition method time frequency decomposition method wan et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 for feature extraction for an auv with loss of the thrust being more than 20 the authors previously proposed a fault feature extraction method based on wavelet decomposition combined with channel extended empirical mode decomposition emd zhang et al 2016 this method has a good feature extraction effect for this scenario however for a weak fault the loss of the thrust is less than 10 it is difficult to distinguish the fault feature and disturbance feature after wavelet decomposition as a result the problem of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis occurs the reasons for this problem are analyzed as follows for a weak thruster fault the fault feature is weak and the signal to noise ratio is low after wavelet decomposition the wavelet detail coefficient considered as the fault feature is hidden in the disturbance feature hence it is difficult to distinguish the abnormal points of the fault through this method in addition an auv is a closed loop system when a weak thruster fault occurs the change of auv states caused by the fault is unobvious under the action of closed loop control the control signals can be adjusted quickly allowing the auv to re track the target in a short time owing to the short change time of the auv states a low decomposition scale with a narrow time window is adopted for analysis when using wavelet decomposition when the low scale decomposition is used a relatively wide frequency band is generated and there is an overlap of the frequency band of the fault feature with that of the disturbance thus the wavelet detail coefficient considered as the fault feature also contains the disturbance feature and its amplitude is similar to that of the fault feature consequently it is difficult to distinguish the abnormal points by adopting the wavelet method to extract the weak thruster fault feature which can easily result in misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis the wavelet decomposition method is a typical time frequency decomposition method and its core function is to study the local features in the time and frequency domains however the features of the weak thruster fault and the external disturbance overlap in the time and frequency domains thus the wavelet decomposition method cannot be applied to extract the weak fault feature of the thruster meanwhile we also used common time frequency domain decomposition methods such as empirical mode and wavelet packet decomposition methods wan et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 to extract the weak thruster fault feature but the results were not satisfactory inspired by the literatures on signal processing based on the sparse decomposition algorithm this study attempts to utilize the sparse decomposition algorithm to extract features of weak thruster fault as a novel signal processing method the sparse decomposition algorithm was first used in the field of image processing in 2006 over the past few years this algorithm has been used in the fault feature extraction of rotating machinery e g bearings and exhibits superiority olshausen and field 1996 lee et al 2007 liu et al 2010 the aim of feature extraction is to retrieve useful information hidden in the original time domain the transform domain should be appropriately selected based on the different features of the signals so that the useful signals and the disturbance signals can be effectively distinguished according to the above analysis the feature extraction method based on wavelet decomposition which transforms signals into that of the time frequency domain is not sensitive to weak thruster fault the sparse decomposition algorithm transforms signals into that of the self constructed sparse domain and is able to concisely represent the signal and learn high level features from the captured data hence this study attempts to extract the features of weak thruster fault based on the sparse decomposition algorithm the problem definitions are as follows when the existing sparse decomposition algorithm is directly used for weak fault diagnosis of the thruster two problems arise 1 during the decomposition of time domain signals the accuracy is relatively low based on the existing sparse decomposition algorithm 2 the difference between the fault feature and disturbance feature when extracting the weak fault feature of the thruster based on the existing sparse decomposition algorithm is small the main contributions of this study are as follows i to solve the problem 1 i e the low decomposition accuracy of the sparse decomposition algorithm for signals in the time domain a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed for decomposing the time domain signals ii to address the problem 2 i e the small difference between fault feature and disturbance feature when adopting the existing sparse decomposition algorithm an improved feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix is proposed for extracting fault features iii based on the above mentioned improvements of the existing sparse decomposition algorithm a novel and complete extraction method for fault features is developed based on an optimized sparse decomposition algorithm the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the problems arising when the existing sparse decomposition algorithm is directly used to extract the features of weak thruster fault and then analyzes the sources of the problems section 3 elaborates the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm and the feasibility of this algorithm is verified by a pool experiment the extraction method for weak fault features based on the fault weight matrix is introduced in section 4 and its feasibility is verified via pool experiments in section 5 the feasibility of the complete extraction method for weak thruster fault features is verified experimentally and compared with the wavelet decomposition method finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 problem statement and analysis this study investigates the extraction method for weak thruster fault based on the sparse decomposition algorithm in this section we briefly describe the shortcomings of the weak thruster feature extraction based on the sparse decomposition algorithm and then analyze the causes of the shortcomings finally we briefly introduce the extraction method of fault feature based on an optimized sparse decomposition algorithm 2 1 problem statement the sparse decomposition algorithm is employed to extract the weak fault feature of the thruster and the problems existing in such methods are expounded the sparse decomposition algorithm transforms the signals into the sparse domain and extracts the signals feature lee et al 2007 tang et al 2014 gajjar et al 2017 inspired by the above references this study designs the extraction method of auv weak thruster fault based on the sparse decomposition algorithm as shown in fig 2 the specific connotation of each step in fig 2 is as follows a building atom dictionary the dictionary is built by existing signal samples so that its basic function has a structure similar to the auv states b sparse decomposition the built atomic dictionary is adopted to decompose the signals sparsely the termination condition is determined by the residual energy of signals c fault feature extraction the sparse decomposition coefficients corresponding to each atom dictionary built from sparse decomposition are used as the extracted fault features while following the above steps to extract fault features in experimental studies we encountered the following two problems 1 the sparse decomposition algorithm has a low decomposition accuracy for time series signals decomposition results specifically in step b during the decomposition of time domain signals the accuracy is relatively low for time domain signals based on the existing sparse decomposition algorithm 2 the difference between the decomposition coefficients in the presence and absence of a fault remains small specifically in step c the decomposition coefficient is considered as the fault feature and the difference between the decomposition coefficients under fault and no fault is still small the decomposition coefficient in the case of a fault is the fault feature and that in the case of no fault is the disturbance feature the smaller the difference between the two the lower the accuracy of the fault diagnosis results leading to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis 2 2 cause analysis to solve the above two problems encountered when extracting the weak fault feature of the thruster based on the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm the causes of the problems are analyzed 1 analysis of the cause of the problem 1 the conventional sparse decomposition method for long signals is as follows first the original signal with a length of k beats are divided into short signals of the same length as that of the atomic dictionary and each short signal is then decomposed separately assuming that the length of the atomic dictionary is n the long signal is decomposed into k n segments to achieve k n decomposition results however the thruster fault may occur at any position in the n beats of the short signal thus the conventional method for decomposing the original signal cannot distinguish the fault accurately leading to the low accuracy of the decomposition result in the time domain 2 analysis of the cause of the problem 2 in the auv operation in addition to the thruster fault the current disturbance also affects the yaw angle signal surge velocity signal and other state signals of the auv the basic idea of fault extraction based on the sparse decomposition algorithm is to decompose the signals sparsely and subsequently consider the sparse decomposition coefficient as the fault feature the sparse decomposition coefficient only represents the scaling value of the atomic dictionary because the signals variation caused by the weak thruster fault is small the difference between the decomposition coefficient at the fault time and that only affected by ocean currents is small thus the weak fault feature is difficult to distinguish from the ocean current disturbance feature only by exploiting the sparse decomposition coefficient as the fault feature in the conventional method 2 3 improvement strategy based on the aforementioned analysis this study improves the sparse decomposition algorithm and the basic process of the novel diagnosis of the fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm is shown in fig 3 by comparing figs 2 and 3 the proposed fault feature extraction method can be shown to include the following two aspects 1 for step b a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed to replace the sparse decomposition method in the conventional method 2 for step c a method based on fault weight matrix for extracting weak fault features is proposed to replace the conventional feature extraction method in section 2 we analyze the shortcomings of the weak thruster feature extraction based on the sparse decomposition algorithm and then two improvements are made next we will describe the improvements in detail specifically section 3 describes the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm and section 4 presents the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix 3 time shift operator based decomposition algorithm and experimental verification the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm decomposes the original long s into short signals of the same length as that of the atomic dictionary hao et al 2017 which was first applied in the field of image processing without considering the time domain accuracy while applying this algorithm to the signals processing of auv states it is found that the precise location of the fault in the short signal segment cannot be obtained directly using the conventional algorithm this leads to the low accuracy of the decomposition results in the time domain i e problem 1 stated in section 2 1 to address this problem 1 a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed in this study based on the above analysis and the feasibility of this algorithm is experimentally verified 3 1 time shift operator based decomposition algorithm at first the concept of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is explained followed by the analysis of the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm finally the calculation formula of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is provided 1 basic feature of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm as discussed above because the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm cannot directly decompose the long signal the signal needs to be divided and decomposed thus the decomposition accuracy of this algorithm for time series signals in the time domain is low accordingly the time shift operator is added to the sparse decomposition algorithm in this study i e the time variable is added to the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm this ensures that each beat of the original signal obtains a corresponding decomposition result rather than the same decomposition resulting in the same time segment as that in the conventional algorithm thus the precision of the time domain decomposition result is improved the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm and the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm are explained in the next section 2 calculation formula of conventional sparse decomposition algorithm the basic principle of the conventional sparse algorithm is to split the long input signal x of length l into short signals of length m which are expressed as a linear weighted combination of the basis function d and noise as expressed by the following two equations hao et al 2017 1 x d α ε k 1 k d k α k ε 2 min α α 0 where d d 1 d 2 d k r m k is the atomic dictionary matrix and d k is the column vector in the dictionary matrix also called an atom α α 1 α 2 α k t is the sparse decomposition coefficient obtained from the sparse decomposition of the input signals and ε is the sparse decomposition residual term l 0 represents the zero norm used to calculate the number of nonzero terms in the coefficient vector eq 1 is the fundamental formula of the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm eq 2 is a constraint of eq 1 which can make the result of eq 1 sparse because the coefficient α k is primarily zero or close to zero hao et al 2017 next the following improvements are introduced into the sparse decomposition algorithm as revealed from the analysis of eq 1 and eq 2 the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm does not consider the signals variation in the time domain i e there is no time variable therefore when processing the time series signal it can only divide the time sequence signal into fragments of identical length similar to that of the atomic dictionary for instance the length of the auv atomic dictionary for the velocity signals in this study is 50 beats therefore to obtain a velocity signals decomposition result 50 beats are required this study attempts to achieve a decomposition result for each beat thus the time domain accuracy of the decomposition result can be enhanced therefore this study improves the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm by adding a time shift operator in eq 1 according to this improvement the long time series signals can be directly to be decomposed which can enhance the accuracy of the sparse decomposition algorithm in the time domain 3 calculation formula of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm to make the sparse decomposition algorithm applicable to time series signals this study improves the calculation formula of the sparse decomposition algorithm by adding a time shift operator and deduces the calculation formula of the final decomposition coefficient the following is the derivation of the calculation formula of the algorithm the objective of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm in this study is to decompose an original signal x of length l through a fixed length atomic dictionary of length k and obtain the sparse representation of the decomposed signal each time thus the algorithm proposed in this study can obtain the set of atomic dictionaries at any moment by adding a time shift operator based on eq 1 eq 1 can be improved as follows 3 x k τ α k τ m k t τ ε k τ α k τ t τ m k ε the constraint eq 2 is expressed as 4 min α k τ α k τ 0 where t τ is the shift operator that selects an atom m k 1 k k and then assigns it to start at instant τ therefore dictionary d 2 can be defined as d 2 t τ m k k τ t is the time variable τ and k denote the summation functions which calculate the sums of the variables τ and k respectively and α k τ is the sparse decomposition coefficient eq 3 and eq 4 are ideal expressions for the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm in practice we need to obtain the sparse decomposition coefficient α k τ corresponding to the atomic set m k subsequently the decomposition coefficient α k τ is obtained by the following steps the zero norm l 0 in eq 4 represents the number of non zero terms for the coefficient vector which is a nondeterministic polynomial that cannot be solved directly in practice it is approximated by the l 2 norm accordingly the constraint formula eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 min x k τ α k τ t τ m k 2 2 where m k is the column vector for a given atom m κ we have 6 x ˆ κ τ α κ τ t τ m κ ε where x ˆ κ is the fitted signal with a given atom m κ based on eq 5 and eq 6 the following equations can be derived to obtain the optimal matching atom m κ o p t and corresponding sparse decomposition α κ o p t as 7 m κ o p t α κ o p t argmin m 2 1 x ˆ κ τ σ τ α τ t τ m 2 2 where σ τ τ α k τ 0 m is the column vector representing an adjustable atom in the dictionary when only using the support information from the decomposition the dictionary and coefficient are jointly estimated to obtain the most matched atoms m κ and the corresponding sparse decomposition α κ τ as follows mailhé et al 2008 8 m κ argmin m 2 1 τ σ τ m t τ x ˆ κ 2 9 α κ τ τ σ τ argmin x ˆ κ τ σ τ α τ t τ m 2 2 where t τ denotes the adjoint matrix of the time shift operator t τ therefore eq 8 and eq 9 can be performed successively to obtain each value of m k and α k τ these are the implementation of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm next the feasibility of this algorithm is experimentally verified 3 2 experimental verification of time shift operator based decomposition algorithm to verify the feasibility of the improved algorithm the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm is used to conduct comparative analysis based on pool experimental data on a prototype auv the experimental environment and the comparative test results are described below 1 experimental environment in this study the beaver ii auv experimental prototype illustrated in fig 4 is employed for the pool experiment zhang et al 2016 and the experimental environment is presented in fig 5 the auv performs a straight moving experiment at a constant velocity of 0 3 m s in a flowing environment the flow field distribution is illustrated in fig 6 zhang et al 2016 under the experimental conditions the auv cruises with a constant velocity of 0 3 m s and on thruster fault where current disturbance is shown as fig 6 the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm and the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm are adopted to decompose the collected signals including velocity yaw angle and main thruster voltage the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is developed to solve the problem of low accuracy of the decomposition results of the sparse decomposition algorithm which does not involve fault feature extraction hence the experimental data from auv without thruster fault are employed the original surge data without fault are shown in fig 7 2 experimental results the data sample parameters are as follows the total beat number is 500 signal sampling interval is 0 2 s and sampling frequency is 5 hz the atomic dictionary is built based on the k svd method yang et al 2017 where the length of the velocity signal atomic dictionary is 50 beats subsequently the corresponding experimental results are analyzed the auv velocity signal data samples are decomposed based on the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm and the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm the results are presented in fig 8 fig 8 shows the decomposition results of the velocity signal using the two methods the higher the sampling frequency the smaller the time difference between the adjacent decomposition results and the higher the accuracy of the decomposition results in time domain analysis of the decomposition results shown in fig 9 reveals that the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm yields a decomposition result per 50 beats whereas the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm yields a decomposition result every beat hence the sampling frequencies of the decomposition result for these two algorithms are 0 1 hz and 5 hz respectively since sampling frequency is 5 hz by comparison the sampling frequency of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is 50 times that of the conventional algorithm therefore it is proved that the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm effectively enhances the accuracy of the decomposition result of the conventional algorithm in the time domain therefore a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve the low accuracy of time series signals decomposed using the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm through comparative experiments it is verified that the proposed algorithm can enhance the accuracy of the time domain signal decomposition results as explained in section 2 1 the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm encounters two problems when extracting weak fault of auv thrusters 1 the accuracy of the decomposition results for time series signal is low and 2 the difference between the decomposition coefficients in the presence and absence of a fault remains small when the fault feature is extracted specifically problem 1 is addressed in the present section and the feasibility of this algorithm is verified via pool experiments for problem 2 a method for weak fault feature extraction based on fault weight matrix is described in the next section 4 feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix and experimental verification problem 2 of the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm explained in section 2 1 states that during the extraction of weak fault of auv thruster the difference between the decomposition coefficient under fault and that without fault remains small in this section to solve it a feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is developed and the experimental verification is conducted 4 1 feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix in this subsection the fundamental idea of this method and its difference from the conventional feature extraction method based on sparse decomposition are first presented subsequently the learning process of the key fault weight matrix of the improved method is elucidated 1 concept behind the method in the conventional feature extraction method based on sparse decomposition the decomposition coefficients corresponding to the atomic dictionary are treated as fault features for feature diagnosis kreutz delgado et al 2003 the basic idea of the improved method is to establish the fault weight matrix corresponding to the atom dictionary subsequently the inner product of the sparse decomposition coefficient and fault weight matrix is considered as the fault feature to enhance the differences between the fault feature and disturbance feature this improvement can overcome the difficulty of distinguishing the weak fault of the thruster from the ocean current disturbance to clearly elucidate the difference between the two methods a schematic comparison of the conventional feature extraction method and the improved feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is presented in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that the fault weight matrix is introduced into the improved method on the fundamental of conventional method and the inner product of the fault weight matrix and the sparse decomposition coefficient is then used as an optimized fault feature compared with the conventional method the new feature of the improved method includes fault weight matrix next the learning method of the fault weight matrix is elucidated 2 learning method of fault weight matrix atomic dictionaries obtained by conventional sparse decomposition are label free and do not contain fault information to enhance fault features this study introduces a fault label for each atom when building an atom dictionary i e the fault weight matrix mentioned in this study therefore this study decomposes the known fault data samples so that the decomposition coefficients contain the required fault information next the decomposition coefficients of the identical atoms are introduced to obtain the fault weight matrix based on the specific ideas of the mentioned learning methods the flow chart of the proposed method is presented in fig 10 fig 10 shows that the learning method of the fault weight matrix is to decompose the fault samples continuously and then update the fault weight matrix the specific process is elucidated as follows the learning method of the fault weight matrix in this study can be divided into the following five steps 1 initialization taking j samples x j 1 2 j to be learned let j 1 the residual term is initialized to ε x j atomic dictionary d is learned using the k svd algorithm number of iterations is t 1 and the fault weight matrix is w 2 find matching atom the inner product of the residuals ε and the atoms d i in the atom dictionary d are identified figured out and the subscript of the maximum value of the inner product λ is identified which is expressed as 10 x d λ sup i 1 k x d i where d i denotes each atom from the atom dictionary and i is the number of each atom 3 update coefficient matrix and fault weight matrix the coefficient matrix is updated as 11 α n 1 α n eq 10 indicates that the decomposition coefficient obtained in the n t h iteration is used to replace the coefficient in the n 1 t h iteration and the corresponding updated fault weight matrix is 12 w λ w λ α t 4 update the residual the residual is the difference between the original signal and the current iteration fitting result expressed as 13 ε t x d t α t 5 judge the termination condition the iteration termination condition of the algorithm refers to the number of atoms k employed to decompose the signal if the number of iterations satisfies n k the calculation returns to step 1 if the number of iterations satisfies n k the next set of data j j 1 is learned when all the data are learned the fault weight matrix is normalized and the calculation is performed n denotes the number of atoms adopted to decompose the signal owing to the sparse nature of the signals only a few atoms contain useful signal information the selection method of n is obtained by analyzing the amplitude of the decomposition coefficient corresponding to different atoms after decomposing the fault samples a previous study reported that the decomposition coefficient of 2 3 atoms in the signal decomposition result obtained from the auv states is significantly higher than that of the remaining atoms therefore the coefficient n is set to 3 in this study in this study t the fault weight matrix is introduced into the conventional feature extraction method to enhance the fault feature in the next subsection the feasibility of the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is verified by comparative experiments 4 2 experimental verification to verify the feasibility of the improved feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm is used to conduct comparative analysis the experimental conditions and the comparative experimental results are described below 1 fault simulation method in this section the thruster fault is simulated according to the method in our previous research chu and zhang 2014 shown as follows assuming that the fault degree of the thruster is λ the real thrust of the thruster is τ 1 λ τ where τ is the desired thrust for this corresponding thruster to simulate the fault of the thruster the control voltage is converted and calculated and then sent to the thruster motor driver the equation for voltage conversion is as follows u 1 λ u 0 84 λ where u denotes the actual control voltage input to the motor driver u denotes the control voltage of the controller output and λ is the assumed fault degree in this study λ is set to 5 to simulate a fault with 5 loss of the thrust 2 experimental data of sample parameters in this study the fault sample data with 5 loss of the thrust are used for comparison this study only focuses on the thruster fault diagnosis for an auv during the constant velocity cruise therefore the start up phase is not considered the experimental data of 500 beats in the steady state phase are selected for the analysis a desired velocity is 0 3 m s and the fault occurs at the 200th beat the original data with 5 loss of the thrust are shown in fig 11 3 comparison of experimental results the comparative experimental results of the two methods are presented in fig 12 because the fault information of the thruster is primarily reflected in the velocity signal yaw angle and control voltage of the auv the three kinds data are experimentally analyzed the blue line in fig 12 shows the fault features of surge velocity yaw angle and main thruster voltage obtained using the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix and the red line is obtained using the conventional method presented in fig 9 a as can be seen from fig 12 near the occurrence of a fault 200 beats there is no fault feature peak value when the conventional method is used whereas there is a clear and large fault feature peak value when using the method based on the fault weight matrix the reason for the difference between the blue and red curves in fig 12 is explained as follows in the conventional feature extraction method the sparse decomposition coefficient is considered as the fault feature in this case the sparse decomposition coefficient represents only the scaling value of the corresponding atomic dictionary because the variance of signals caused by the weak fault of the thruster are small the difference between the decomposition coefficient of the fault and that of the current disturbance is small in this study the fault weight matrix is established by utilizing the fault information data and the fault feature is enhanced by the inner product of the weight matrix and the original fault feature matrix as a result the blue curve obtained by the improved method based on the fault weight matrix shows a large difference from the red curve obtained by the conventional method near the fault occurrence moment to quantitatively analyze the performance of the improved method and facilitate the comparison the specific data in fig 12 are extracted the specific data are presented in table 1 in this study the extracted fault features are used for the subsequent weak fault diagnosis of the thruster and it is always required that the values of fault features are higher than the disturbance feature hence this study verifies the feasibility of the improved method by comparing the ratio of the fault feature and the disturbance feature the conventional feature extraction method is used to extract fault features from three signals and the ratios of the feature values are 0 262 0 506 and 0 214 all less than 1 this shows that the fault feature value of the conventional method is smaller than the value of the disturbance feature which means that the conventional feature extraction method cannot effectively extract the weak fault feature of the thruster the feature value ratios obtained using the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix are 1 588 1 708 and 2 381 which are all greater than 1 demonstrating that the feature value at the time of fault is higher than the disturbance feature value at any time for different signals the ratios of the feature values in this method are improved by 132 6 120 2 and 216 7 compared to the conventional method therefore the feasibility and superiority of the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix during the extraction of weak fault features are verified from the result it can be concluded that the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix achieved better results during the feature extraction of the main voltage signal the auv uses an electronic compass and a dvl sensor to obtain the surge velocity and yaw information through measurement while the main voltage can be directly extracted in the software system therefore the accuracy of the feature extraction result utilizing the main thrust voltage signal is better it also indirectly shows that the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is better than the conventional method as expounded in section 2 1 the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm encounters two problems when extracting weak fault of auv thrusters 1 the accuracy of the decomposition results for time series signal is low and 2 the difference between the decomposition coefficients u in the presence and absence of a fault remains small is small when the fault feature is extracted specifically problem 1 is addressed in section 3 for problem 2 a feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix is developed in this section and the feasibility of this method is verified by comparative experiments with conventional method 5 comparison with wavelet decomposition method two problems are encountered when extracting the auv thruster weak fault features based on the sparse decomposition method in sections 3 and 4 we presented the improved algorithms including the corresponding pool experimental verification in this section these two improved algorithms are combined to form a novel extraction method for fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm the method proposed in this study is a new method in principle therefore to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved feature extraction method the feature extraction method based on wavelet decomposition is used to conduct comparative experiments the wavelet decomposition method was adopted in the auv thruster fault feature extraction method zhang et al 2014 the experimental data of the sample parameters are first explained and the experimental results are then compared 1 experimental data of sample parameters the fault sample data with a 5 loss of the thrust are employed in the comparative experiment same as section 4 3 2 comparative experimental results the experimental results based on these two different methods are presented in fig 13 as mentioned in the previous subsection the comparison is also performed by considering the velocity signal yaw angle and main voltage as the analysis objects the blue line in fig 13 shows the fault features of surge velocity yaw angle and main thruster voltage obtained using the novel extraction method of fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm and the red line is obtained using the wavelet decomposition method as shown in fig 12 near the occurrence of a fault 200 beats both the proposed methods in this study and the wavelet decomposition method showed feature peak values but the peak value of the novel method is clearly higher than that of the wavelet decomposition method in addition the novel method is superior to the wavelet decomposition method in terms of the difference between the feature peak value and the disturbance feature value the feature extraction method based on wavelet decomposition is a time frequency domain decomposition method which transforms the time domain signal into the frequency domain signal through wavelet decomposition however when this method is applied in extracting the weak fault feature of the thruster a problem of frequency band overlapping of the fault feature and disturbance arises which leads to a relatively small fault feature value and disturbance value in this study the novel extraction method of fault feature is based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm for fault feature extraction which transforms the time domain signal into that of the sparse domain avoiding the overlapping problem of the fault feature and disturbance in the frequency domain therefore near the fault occurrence moment the blue curve obtained using the novel method and the red curve obtained using the wavelet decomposition method have a large difference to quantitatively analyze the performance of the novel extraction method of fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm the specific data in fig 13 are extracted the specific data are presented in table 2 the experimental results are presented in fig 13 and table 2 in the feature extraction stage a larger extracted fault feature value than the disturbance feature value indicates that the weak fault feature of the thruster in the presence of current disturbance is marked which shows that the performance of the novel feature extraction method is better therefore the novel extraction method of the fault feature based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm is better than the wavelet decomposition method in terms of the ratio of the value of the fault feature to the disturbance feature as can be seen from table 2 the ratios of the feature values of the 3 signals after wavelet decomposition are 1 278 1 138 and 1 676 the ratios of the feature values of the proposed method in this study are 1 588 1 708 and 2 381 the ratios of the feature values of the decomposition results of both methods are greater than 1 demonstrating that the feature values of the fault are higher than the disturbance feature values i e the two methods induce certain effects on the extraction of weak fault features compared to the wavelet decomposition method the ratios of the feature values for these three signals are improved by 24 25 50 08 and 42 06 in this subsection the comparison between the wavelet decomposition method and the novel method based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm for the extraction of weak fault features of the auv thruster proves that the proposed novel method outperforms the wavelet decomposition method for the weak fault of the auv thruster 6 conclusion this study analyzes the limitations of time frequency decomposition methods in addressing the problems associated with the extraction of weak fault features of an auv thruster and then it investigates the problems of using a new concept based on sparse decomposition based on the two problems existing in the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm in thruster fault feature extraction the improved methods are developed to overcome the limitation of relatively low decomposition accuracy for time domain signals based on the conventional sparse decomposition algorithm a time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is proposed the conventional algorithm ignores the influence of time variables on the decomposition results which leads to poor accuracy in the time domain this study addresses this limitation in the conventional algorithm by adding the time shift operator to it and verifies the improvement when using the algorithm over the conventional algorithm by comparing the sampling frequency of the decomposition results in the time domain the experimental results show that the sampling frequency of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm is 50 times that of the conventional algorithm which verifies the feasibility of the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm based on the improved sparse decomposition in this study the difference between decomposition coefficients in the presence and absence of a fault is still small i e the difference between fault feature and disturbance feature remains small to solve this problem a feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix is proposed by constructing a fault weight matrix this method enhances the fault feature and it also increases the difference between the fault feature and the disturbance feature from comparative experimental results it is found that the ratios of the fault features extracted using the conventional method to the disturbance feature are less than 1 that is all the fault features are less than the disturbance feature it indicates that the conventional method cannot be used for extracting weak fault feature meanwhile all the ratios obtained using the improved method are greater than 1 compared to the conventional method the ratios of fault feature to disturbance feature for different signals are improved by 132 6 120 2 and 216 7 which verifies the feasibility of the feature extraction method based on the fault weight matrix finally this study proposes a novel extraction method for fault feature based on an optimized sparse decomposition by combining the time shift operator based decomposition algorithm and the extraction method based on the fault weight matrix the proposed fault feature extraction method is compared with the fault feature extraction method based on the wavelet decomposition method the experimental results show that when using the feature extraction method based on the optimized sparse decomposition algorithm the ratios of the feature values from different signals are improved by 24 25 50 08 and 42 06 compared to those from the wavelet decomposition method these experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed method in

20664,the maneuverability of a submersible in the vertical plane is investigated for this purpose extensive experiments are performed on a half scale suboff model in the circulating water channel cwc with the planar motion mechanism pmm oblique towing tests containing high attack angles pure heave tests and pure pitch tests are involved the validity of the experiments is identified by the accordance of the present hydrodynamic coefficients and the ones of defense advanced research projects agency darpa in order to fit the measured data for cases with high attack angles this paper develops the expression of dimensionless pitch moment m by the piecewise function besides the blockage effects are corrected by tamura equation in addition the uncertainty analysis ua is conducted referring to the recommended procedure 7 5 02 06 04 by 27th ittc 2014b the results show that the developed equation turns out to be superior to the standard one and the total uncertainties of the hydrodynamics are less than 2 which reveals the accuracy and credibility of the experimental measurement keywords half scale suboff model pmm maneuvering derivatives ua 1 introduction good maneuverability of a submersible ensures fast and accurate operation such as steady navigating rapid turning and emergency ascending the investigation on the maneuverability of a submersible began in 1950s for decades of exploring and developing several classical models were proposed for accurate depiction of the underwater motion abkowitz 1964 gertler and hagen 1967 feldman 1979 fossen 1991 watt 2007 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a therein gertler and hagen 1967 established the most influential mathematical model i e the standard equations of motion which is based on low order taylor expansions these equations have the advantages of rapid calculating time and reasonable form for submarine simulation however they can only be applied to the situation where the attitude angle of the submersible should be limited in relatively small range subsequently feldman 1979 and watt 2007 successively developed the standard equations by adding the correction items of the cross flow drag or damping terms which extended these equations to investigate the emergency recoveries from a stern plane jam rising scenarios and other extreme maneuvers yet their maneuvering models still have limited application because they were derived from the test results with the attack angles ranging from 30 to 30 in the vertical plane to fill in this gap new expressing ways were used for better approximation between equations and test data zhang and wu 2004 and yang 2004 used polynomial piecewise function to establish the numerical models of six dof maneuvering motion they conducted comprehensive experiments on submersibles at full attack angles 180 180 in the vertical plane because the test data present strong nonlinearity and asymmetry single low order equation cannot express the complex hydrodynamic characteristics in each dof therefore polynomial piecewise function is the best solution for retaining the low order forms of the equations even so their models are still cumbersome and obscure due to their excessive pursuit of best fit and too many high order taylor s expansions are used to depict the nonlinear of the hydrodynamic curves except the achievements above few published studies have explored the expression of maneuvering motion at excessively high attack angles tang et al 2009 zhang and wu 2004 watt 2007 it is still a challenge to deeply investigate the numerical modeling of the cases in extreme maneuvers in view of the importance to establish the motion equations there are two approaches for studying the issue including the experimental method and the numerical method barr 1993 although the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained by the experimental method may be influenced by the scale effect usually they are still considered to be more accurate and reliable than those by the numerical one d 1995 roddy 1990 avila and adamowski 2011 and park et al 2017 carried on numerous pmm tests on different submersible in the towing tank of which the contents were comprised of oblique towing tests pure yaw tests and pure sway tests despite the advantages of the similarity between the experimental flow field and actual one low boundary effects and favorable accuracy of the measured results pmm tests in the towing tank also have some drawbacks such as short time for measurement motion errors due to track deformation strong vibration disturbance and difficulties in the observation therefore researchers gradually focus on the cwc gill and price 1977 nomoto and hattori 1986 kuniaki et al 2002 wang et al 2012 of which the advantages could overcome these deficiencies of towing tank firstly the cwc is designed to make the water flowing around the model to keep the tests ongoing for a long time then the carriage motion is more stable without the limitation of the longitudinal tracks besides observation and photography is easier to achieve through the glasses in the side walls but on the account of blockage effect which results from its little water area in the test section the measured hydrodynamics possibly dwindle in the cwc compared to these in the infinite water and revision should be made in the data processing xie et al 1978 27th ittc 2014a however that issue seems to be little mentioned in the published literatures about tank or cwc tests liu et al 2017 nishimoto et al 2019 besides the limitation of the test grounds the facilities can also be significantly influential in the test results usually two struts are utilized to connect the model to the pmm roddy 1990 azarsina et al 2007 watt 2007 however these struts can evidently affect the flow field around the submersible which leads to some deviation in the measured hydrodynamics from the ideal ones measured without any external attachment in order to diminish these detrimental impacts from the struts new types of the braces are designed subsequently therein kim et al 2013 dantas and barros 2013 and park et al 2017 selected l shape strings to support the models while lin et al 2018 utilized one single strut with circular cross section compared to the traditional ones these new braces have smaller relative sizes and more perfect installation locations with which the correctness of test results are more likely to be guaranteed this paper aimed to study the maneuverability of the submersible in the vertical plane pmm tests of a half scale suboff model were taken in the cwc including oblique towing tests pure heave tests pure pitch tests in the moving coordinate system of the model the new installation method enabled the model to reach the largest tested attack angles in the limited water which are 60 during the test data processing tamura equation was used to revise the model speeds in order to eliminate the blockage effect 27th ittc 2014a according to the results the gertler and hagen s standard equations of motion polynomial piecewise function model are used to summarize the maneuverability equations besides the uncertainty analysis ua and comparison for the results between this paper and defense advanced research projects agency darpa were made to identify the validity of the test results 2 experimental program 2 1 facilities as fig 1 shows the

the model in order to better depict the layout of the half scale suboff model in the cwc two coordinate systems are used including the space fixed one e ξ η ζ and body fixed one o xyz as shown in fig

side of the model the longitudinal coordinate of the connection point coincides with that of the center of the gravity of the model and the top of the strut is connected to the loading surface of the load cell through the flange the other end of the load cell is fixed with the carrying strut of the pmm the model lies in the cwc with its y axis in the ξ η plane the distance from the centerline of the model and the cwc bottom is 0 873 m during the tests the minimum distance between the surface of the model and the outer boundaries such as free surface side walls and bottom of the cwc is more than twice the maximum diameter of the model besides the blockage ratio of the channel is lower than 25 within which the boundary effect can be acceptable according to 13th ittc 1972 s and ji and liu 2008 s standards in addition the correction of the boundary effect i e the blockage effect were made in the subsequent section 4 1 2 2 2 experiment conditions the tests were conducted in may 2018 when the water temperature was 24 5 c the experimental contents include uncertainty evaluation and formal maneuverability test the formal tests were conducted in two parts i e the static tests and dynamic tests the angle of attack ranged from 60 to 60 in the static tests and the dynamic tests consisted of pure pitch tests and pure heave tests with the periods of 10 s 11 s 12 s according to the recommended procedures by 27th ittc 2014b several cases in the tests were randomly selected for repeated measurement detailed experiment conditions are shown in table 3 3 mathematical model 3 1

attack angles or pitch are within 35 according to the conclusions of the static test results in section 4 3 and the standard equations of motion by gertler and hagen 1967 the forces and moment on the model can be approximately expressed by the equations with 2 order hydrodynamic coefficients and according to lin et al 2018 the recommended equations for external forces and moment provided by the

correction is an important part in the data processing especially when the tests are conducted in the cwc in this paper considering the blockage ratios of the tests were large tamura equation was used to remove unwanted blockage effects 27th ittc 2014a the expression is shown as 16 v v 0 δ v 17 δ v v 0 0 67 m 1 l w 0 75 1 1 f n h 2 where v and v 0 are the revised and original model speed to the water respectively δ v is the corrector of the speed l is the characteristic length of the model i e the total length of the submersible w h are the width and water depth of the cwc respectively f n h is the froude number of the cwc which can be expressed by 18 f n h v 0 g h where g is acceleration of gravity and m 1 is the blockage ratio which is given by 19 m 1 a i w h i 1 2 3 therein a i is set as the projected area of the submersible on the cross section of the cwc considering that it could be quite difficult to accurately calculate the exact value of a i approximate equations were established according to the calculation of the projected area of cylinder on plane when in the steady tests the projected area a 1 is given by 20 a 1 a s a m i n c o s α a m a x s i n α where a s is the area of the longitudinal section of the strut a m i n a m a x are the maximum areas of the cross and longitudinal section of the half scale suboff model respectively α is the angle of attack in the heave tests the projected area a 2 is given by 21 a 2 a s a m i n and in the heave tests the projected area a 3 is given by 22 a 3 a s a m i n c o s θ a m a x s i n θ where θ is the pitch angle of the model based on the equations above the calculated δ v in the steady tests are given by fig 5 and since the values of δ v in the dynamic varies over time two examples of the calculated value of δ v in 1 period are shown in figs 6 and 7 one is for a heave test and the other is for a pitch test the working conditions of them are both that flow rate u c w c is 0 7 m s period t is 10 s and the amplitude z 0 is 0 3 m 4 2 test results the measured dimensionless hydrodynamic forces and moment x z m in the static tests are given by fig 8 it should be noted that during the data procession of x z m the forces and moments of strut was measured independently and subtracted from the total hydrodynamic forces and moments directly this processing way is based on the theory of the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015b according to which the forces and moments of the appendages could be considered to be linearly superimposed on the total ones as shown below the value of x decreases with increasing α from 60 to 10 and increases from 10 to 60 the curve is approximately parabolic with small nonlinearity and obvious asymmetry the value of z is close to 0 at 0 and rises as α rises the maximum occurred at 60 the curves exhibit small nonlinearity and weak asymmetry the value of m is close to 0 at 0 as well it increases with the increasing α between 25 hardly changes between 25 40 and takes on rising then falling afterwards the maximum occurs at 45 at the positive attack angles however at the negative attack angles ranging from 25 to 60 the value of m firstly decreases then rises slightly and goes down at the end the curve shows strong nonlinearity and obvious asymmetry in summary the dimensionless hydrodynamic forces and moment all present nonlinearity and asymmetry within the range of high angle of attack there are two main reasons for this phenomenon one is that as the upstream cross sectional area of the model grows with increasing α the reynolds number in the flow field around increases as well the flow separation gradually turns to be intense there forms vortices structure including primary vortex shed vortex etc which makes the flow field turn out to be complicated the frictional resistance and viscous resistance on the hull change to a different extent and that leads to the nonlinear variation of the hydrodynamic forces and moment the other reason is that the attachments can be the main factor to cause asymmetry the upstream cross sectional area of the attachments is not so large in the range of small angle of attack that it has limited influences on the flow field nearby therefore the asymmetry and nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic forces and moment are weak then but when at high angles of attack the influences of the attachments cannot be neglected besides the velocity of flow and the pressure around the model changes sharply thus there is a great difference in the turbulence intensity between the local and the whole which enhances the nonlinearity and asymmetry of the hydrodynamics fig 9 shows the calculated z s and m s in the design conditions of pure heave tests while fig 10 shows the calculated x o z c z s m c and m s in the design conditions of pure pitch tests as shown in the figures the values of most integral hydrodynamics increase linearly with the increasing dimensionless kinematic parameters and because the values of hydrodynamics are small in the low velocity zone unavoidable slight measured errors can make some points obviously deviate from the major trend 4 3 modification of the equations of motion as shown in section 3 the motion model is based on the standard equations of motion by gertler and hagen 1967 according to the results of the fitting curves to the test data of the steady tests in fig 11 the curve of z matches very well to the equations with small variance and the determination coefficient r 2 of the standard equations for z is 1 00 as for x asymmetric term x w w and x w w w w are kept to describe the strong asymmetry of the curves however the equations cannot be simply revised to fit the curves of m for its strong nonlinearity and obvious asymmetry and according to zhang and wu 2004 s and yang 2004 s researches the piecewise function is used to express the maneuverability model based on the result of goodness of fit test the piecewise intervals of the angle of attack s range were properly divided for the curve of m as shown in eq 25 when α is in the domain 25 25 the equations follow the standard ones otherwise higher order terms are added the equations are given by 23 x x w w x u u u 2 x w w w 2 x w w w w 24 z z 0 z w w z w w z w w w w z w w w 2 25 m m 0 m w w m w w w w m w w w w 3 60 α 25 m 0 m w w m w w m w w w w m w w w 2 25 α 25 m 0 m w w m w w w w m w w w w 3 25 α 60 as fig 12 shows the 2 order standard equations and revised equations are applied to fit the curves of x and m and based on the overall sample the determination coefficients r 2 of the standard equations for x and m are 0 71 0 98 respectively while those of the revised equations are both 1 00 obviously the revised equations give the best fitting to the test data in this paper it can be seen that the standard equation of x by gertler and hagen is more symmetrical against pitch angles which would result in the difference between measurements in sjtu and the fitting but it should be stated that it cannot be the basis to deny the good quality of gertler and hagen s equations since their equations show quite fine matching performance to much other test data burcher et al 1995 lin et al 2018 watt 2007 besides the measured data were input to eqs 23 25 to calculate the dimensionless hydrodynamic coefficients as for the hydrodynamic coefficients in the dynamic models the known inertial hydrodynamic coefficients were derived from the equations within the interval 25 α 25 that is because during the movement the attack or the pitch angles were within 20 the calculated dimensionless hydrodynamic coefficients are given in table 4 since the viscous hydrodynamic coefficients in the static tests has been calculated the inertial hydrodynamic coefficients in the dynamic tests such as x q q z q z q z q q z q q m q m q and m q q can be obtained after substituting the known coefficients into eq 7 15 the results are shown in table 5 4 4 validation of test results 4 4 1 uncertainty analysis the ua shows the quality and reliability of the test quantificationally which is an important part of the test results standard procedures of the ua for ship model tests were proposed in the 22th ittc 1999 and revised afterwards the sources of the uncertainty were analyzed as fig 13 the total uncertainties u for the dimensionless measured hydrodynamic force moment f consist of the bias systematic errors b and precision random errors limits p the expressions are described as 26 u f 2 b f 2 p f 2 the precision limits largely reflect the repeatability and reproducibility of the test results tests under the same conditions should be conducted repeatedly for the standard deviation s d e v of the measured data with which p will be assessed the precision limit equation for p is given by 27 p n u m k s d e v n u m where n u m is the number of the repeated tests k is the coverage factor k 2 by the ittc recommendation 27th ittc 2014b the bias limits are determined by a study of the measuring system when the measured physical quantity is related to the parameters of the test system the bias b can be estimated based on the law of uncertainty propagation as 28 b 2 i 1 n θ i 2 b i 2 2 i 1 n 1 j i 1 n θ i θ j b i j where i j is the item number of the uncertainty source and n is the total number of the items if p i is set as the physical characteristic of the uncertainty source which can be the measured value of the force or the moment the water density the length of the model and the speed of the model θ i is the influence coefficient defined by θ i f p i b i is the bias of measured p i b i j is the correlated bias limits in p i and p j the estimation methods of b i can vary based on the different measurement systems the detailed process of ua can be referred to 22th ittc 1999 and simonse 2004 and in this paper b i j 0 because the uncertainty source is unrelated with each other according to the calculating formulas in the ittc guidelines 22th ittc 1999 the individual biases composite biases precisions and total uncertainty are obtained in tables 6 to 8 as it is shown the relative total uncertainties of the static test results range from 0 35 to 1 08 while that of the dynamic test results from 0 89 to 3 04 that proves the accuracy and reasonability of the test method 4 4 2 result comparison the model in the shape of suboff turns to be widely used in the experimental research for maneuverability in this paper a half scale suboff model has been driven by pmm in the cwc to obtain the maneuvering derivatives compared to roddy 1990 s report i e the test results published by darpa though the hydrodynamic forces and moment in both experiments show most same properties there are still some differences for the different test conditions and measuring method tables 9 and 10 show the distinction of the test conditions and results between sjtu and darpa the tested angle of attack ranges from 15 15 and within this range the standard equations of motion by gertler and hagen are fitting for them the hydrodynamic coefficients in both experiments are of the same order of magnitude especially for the linear hydrodynamic coefficients which also identifies the effectiveness and practicability of the test in this paper 5 conclusion in order to build the reasonable maneuverability model for the submersible model a series of tests have been launched by pmm in the cwc of shanghai jiao tong university the tests conclude the measurement of the hydrodynamic forces and moment and evaluation of uncertainty according to the test results the main conclusions of this paper are as follows 1 a motion model of a submersible in the vertical plane was developed added terms and the piecewise function were successfully used to revise the standard equation of motions to get a better fitting to the test data the revised equations can better depict the strong nonlinearity and asymmetry of the hydrodynamic characteristics with a simple form and clear meaning when the model is in the range of high attack angles the idea of piecewise function might be successfully applied to analyses and predictions of maneuverability of submersibles and actually of any other floating body 2 data processing was improved and perfect unwanted blockage effects were corrected by tamura simplified equation the method of fourier averaging was used to process the dynamic test data thus all the hydrodynamic coefficients in the revised equations were obtained accurately and fast 3 ua was made to identify the high quality and reliability of the test the relative total uncertainties of the tests are less than 3 1 which shows the accuracy and reasonability of the new test method 4 a comparison of the test conditions and results was made between darpa and this paper the hydrodynamic coefficients in both experiments are of the same order of magnitude and the differences were caused by the different

20664,the maneuverability of a submersible in the vertical plane is investigated for this purpose extensive experiments are performed on a half scale suboff model in the circulating water channel cwc with the planar motion mechanism pmm oblique towing tests containing high attack angles pure heave tests and pure pitch tests are involved the validity of the experiments is identified by the accordance of the present hydrodynamic coefficients and the ones of defense advanced research projects agency darpa in order to fit the measured data for cases with high attack angles this paper develops the expression of dimensionless pitch moment m by the piecewise function besides the blockage effects are corrected by tamura equation in addition the uncertainty analysis ua is conducted referring to the recommended procedure 7 5 02 06 04 by 27th ittc 2014b the results show that the developed equation turns out to be superior to the standard one and the total uncertainties of the hydrodynamics are less than 2 which reveals the accuracy and credibility of the experimental measurement keywords half scale suboff model pmm maneuvering derivatives ua 1 introduction good maneuverability of a submersible ensures fast and accurate operation such as steady navigating rapid turning and emergency ascending the investigation on the maneuverability of a submersible began in 1950s for decades of exploring and developing several classical models were proposed for accurate depiction of the underwater motion abkowitz 1964 gertler and hagen 1967 feldman 1979 fossen 1991 watt 2007 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a therein gertler and hagen 1967 established the most influential mathematical model i e the standard equations of motion which is based on low order taylor expansions these equations have the advantages of rapid calculating time and reasonable form for submarine simulation however they can only be applied to the situation where the attitude angle of the submersible should be limited in relatively small range subsequently feldman 1979 and watt 2007 successively developed the standard equations by adding the correction items of the cross flow drag or damping terms which extended these equations to investigate the emergency recoveries from a stern plane jam rising scenarios and other extreme maneuvers yet their maneuvering models still have limited application because they were derived from the test results with the attack angles ranging from 30 to 30 in the vertical plane to fill in this gap new expressing ways were used for better approximation between equations and test data zhang and wu 2004 and yang 2004 used polynomial piecewise function to establish the numerical models of six dof maneuvering motion they conducted comprehensive experiments on submersibles at full attack angles 180 180 in the vertical plane because the test data present strong nonlinearity and asymmetry single low order equation cannot express the complex hydrodynamic characteristics in each dof therefore polynomial piecewise function is the best solution for retaining the low order forms of the equations even so their models are still cumbersome and obscure due to their excessive pursuit of best fit and too many high order taylor s expansions are used to depict the nonlinear of the hydrodynamic curves except the achievements above few published studies have explored the expression of maneuvering motion at excessively high attack angles tang et al 2009 zhang and wu 2004 watt 2007 it is still a challenge to deeply investigate the numerical modeling of the cases in extreme maneuvers in view of the importance to establish the motion equations there are two approaches for studying the issue including the experimental method and the numerical method barr 1993 although the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained by the experimental method may be influenced by the scale effect usually they are still considered to be more accurate and reliable than those by the numerical one d 1995 roddy 1990 avila and adamowski 2011 and park et al 2017 carried on numerous pmm tests on different submersible in the towing tank of which the contents were comprised of oblique towing tests pure yaw tests and pure sway tests despite the advantages of the similarity between the experimental flow field and actual one low boundary effects and favorable accuracy of the measured results pmm tests in the towing tank also have some drawbacks such as short time for measurement motion errors due to track deformation strong vibration disturbance and difficulties in the observation therefore researchers gradually focus on the cwc gill and price 1977 nomoto and hattori 1986 kuniaki et al 2002 wang et al 2012 of which the advantages could overcome these deficiencies of towing tank firstly the cwc is designed to make the water flowing around the model to keep the tests ongoing for a long time then the carriage motion is more stable without the limitation of the longitudinal tracks besides observation and photography is easier to achieve through the glasses in the side walls but on the account of blockage effect which results from its little water area in the test section the measured hydrodynamics possibly dwindle in the cwc compared to these in the infinite water and revision should be made in the data processing xie et al 1978 27th ittc 2014a however that issue seems to be little mentioned in the published literatures about tank or cwc tests liu et al 2017 nishimoto et al 2019 besides the limitation of the test grounds the facilities can also be significantly influential in the test results usually two struts are utilized to connect the model to the pmm roddy 1990 azarsina et al 2007 watt 2007 however these struts can evidently affect the flow field around the submersible which leads to some deviation in the measured hydrodynamics from the ideal ones measured without any external attachment in order to diminish these detrimental impacts from the struts new types of the braces are designed subsequently therein kim et al 2013 dantas and barros 2013 and park et al 2017 selected l shape strings to support the models while lin et al 2018 utilized one single strut with circular cross section compared to the traditional ones these new braces have smaller relative sizes and more perfect installation locations with which the correctness of test results are more likely to be guaranteed this paper aimed to study the maneuverability of the submersible in the vertical plane pmm tests of a half scale suboff model were taken in the cwc including oblique towing tests pure heave tests pure pitch tests in the moving coordinate system of the model the new installation method enabled the model to reach the largest tested attack angles in the limited water which are 60 during the test data processing tamura equation was used to revise the model speeds in order to eliminate the blockage effect 27th ittc 2014a according to the results the gertler and hagen s standard equations of motion polynomial piecewise function model are used to summarize the maneuverability equations besides the uncertainty analysis ua and comparison for the results between this paper and defense advanced research projects agency darpa were made to identify the validity of the test results 2 experimental program 2 1 facilities as fig 1 shows the maneuverability test system includes test model instrumentations control system and measurement system the test model is a half scale suboff model no 5470 groves et al 1989 suboff model no 5470 was designed as a standard model by darpa for cfd computational fluid dynamics and test research with its all geometrical details published the fully appended suboff model had an axisymmetric hull a fairwater symmetric stern appendages and struts table 1 shows the main geometric parameters of the model and fig 2 shows the design and physical pictures the cwc is located in shanghai jiao tong

measurement system include the control boxes desktop computer displacement angle sensor load cell thermometer signal converter measurement software etc 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 arrangement of the model in order to better depict the layout of the half scale suboff model in the cwc two coordinate systems are used including the space fixed one e ξ η ζ and body fixed one o xyz as shown in fig 3 the origin of the body fixed coordinates is located at the center of gravity while that of the space fixed one is located at fixed point on the ground the end of the strut is connected to the port side of the model the longitudinal coordinate of the connection point coincides with that of the center of the gravity of the model and the top of the strut is connected to the loading surface of the load cell through the flange the other end of the load cell is fixed with the carrying strut of the pmm the model lies in the cwc with its y axis in the ξ η plane the distance from the centerline of the model and the cwc bottom is 0 873 m during the tests the minimum distance between the surface of the model and the outer boundaries such as free surface side walls and bottom of the cwc is more than twice the maximum diameter of the model besides the blockage ratio of the channel is lower than 25 within which the boundary effect can be acceptable according to 13th ittc 1972 s and ji and liu 2008 s standards in addition the correction of the boundary effect i e the blockage effect were made in the subsequent section 4 1 2 2 2 experiment conditions the tests were conducted in may 2018 when the water temperature was 24 5 c the experimental contents include uncertainty evaluation and formal maneuverability test the formal tests were conducted in two parts i e the static tests and dynamic tests the angle of attack ranged from 60 to 60 in the static tests and the dynamic tests consisted of pure pitch tests and pure heave tests with the periods of 10 s 11 s 12 s according to the recommended procedures by 27th ittc 2014b several cases in the tests were randomly selected for repeated measurement detailed experiment conditions are shown in table 3 3 mathematical model 3 1 coordinate systems as shown in fig 4 x y z k m n are the hydrodynamic forces and moments on the body axis the 3 dof equations of motion in the vertical plane can be derived by newton s second law and they are 1 x m u w q x g q 2 z g q z m w u q z g q 2 x g q m i y y q m z g u w q x g w u q where m is the mass of the submersible i y y is the pitch moment of inertia of the submersible x g z g are the longitudinal and vertical distance from the cog to the center plane respectively u w q are surge heave velocities and pitch angular velocity u w q are surge acceleration heave angular acceleration pitch angular acceleration respectively 3 2 equations of motion in this paper since the strut is mounted right over the cog of the submersible there are x g 0 z g 0 thus the hydrodynamic forces and moment x z m are converted into the dimensionless forms i e x z m 2 x m u w q f x 0 5 ρ l 2 v 2 z m w u q f z 0 5 ρ l 2 v 2 m i y y q m y 0 5 ρ l 3 v 2 where ρ is water density l is the total length of the submersible f x f z m y are the external forces and moment measured by the load cell and v is the total velocity of the submersible at cog through the water because u w are the velocity components there is v u 2 w 2 3 2 1 static test during the process to build the equations of motion from the results of static tests at the high attack angles the standard equations of motion by gertler and hagen 1967 have been referred to the equations are given by 3 x x u u u 2 x w w w 2 x a s z z 0 z w w z w w z w w w w z w w w 2 m m l m n l where the dimensionless velocities u u v w w v w w 2 v terms with subscripts are the subterms of the dimensionless viscous hydrodynamic coefficients such as x u u x w w z 0 z w z w z w w z w w x a s is composed of the added terms to depict the asymmetry of x which are x w w and x w w w w m l and m n l are the linear and nonlinear terms in the expression of m therein m l is composed of m 0 m w w and m n l is composed of m w w m w w w w m w w w w 3 etc detailed analysis is shown in section 4 3 3 2 2 dynamic test the dynamic tests include pure heave tests and pure pitch tests due to the limited displacement and angle driven by pmm the attack angles or pitch are within 35 according to the conclusions of the static test results in section 4 3 and the standard equations of motion by gertler and hagen 1967 the forces and moment on the model can be approximately expressed by the equations with 2 order hydrodynamic coefficients and according to lin et al 2018 the recommended equations for external forces and moment provided by the pmm system or the measured forces and moment in the dynamic tests are given by 4 f x m u w q 0 5 ρ l 2 v 2 x u u x u u u 2 f z m w u q 0 5 ρ l 2 v 2 z w w z q q z w w z w w w 2 z w w w w z q q z w q w

coefficients the dimensionless acceleration and velocity u u l v 2 w w l v 2 q q v l q q v 2 l 2 since the heave or pitch motion is harmonic the method of fourier averaging has been used to process the measured data and analysis the inertial hydrodynamic coefficients if f is set as the measured dimensionless hydrodynamic force moment ω is the angular frequency in the motion t is time the subscripts o c s are the mean term cosine term and sine term respectively the processing of fourier analysis on 1 period 0 2 π ω is shown as below 5 f o ω 2 π f d t f c ω π f cos ω t d t f s ω π f sin

the heave amplitude combined equation 4 and 6 it is implied that z w m w can be solved by the heave test results and since w in eq 6 shows sine characteristic fourier analysis for sine term is performed on the test data insert eqs 6 into 4 5 there are 7 z s 1 0 5 ρ l 3 m ω π w sin ω t d t z w ω π w sin ω t d t 8 m s m w ω π w sin ω t d t after substituting the known viscous hydrodynamic

correction is an important part in the data processing especially when the tests are conducted in the cwc in this paper considering the blockage ratios of the tests were large tamura equation was used to remove unwanted blockage effects 27th ittc 2014a the expression is shown as 16 v v 0 δ v 17 δ v v 0 0 67 m 1 l w 0 75 1 1 f n h 2 where v and v 0 are the revised and original model speed to the water respectively δ v is the corrector of the speed l is the characteristic length of the model i e the total length of the submersible w h are the width and water depth of the cwc respectively f n h is the froude number of the cwc which can be expressed by 18 f n h v 0 g h where g is acceleration of gravity and m 1 is the blockage ratio which is given by 19 m 1 a i w h i 1 2 3 therein a i is set as the projected area of the submersible on the cross section of the cwc considering that it could be quite difficult to accurately calculate the exact value of a i approximate equations were established according to the calculation of the projected area of cylinder on plane when in the steady tests the projected area a 1 is given by 20 a 1 a s a m i n c o s α a m a x s i n α where a s is the area of the longitudinal section of the strut a m i n a m a x are the maximum areas of the cross and longitudinal section of the half scale suboff model respectively α is the angle of attack in the heave tests the projected area a 2 is given by 21 a 2 a s a m i n and in the heave tests the projected area a 3 is given by 22 a 3 a s a m i n c o s θ a m a x s i n θ where θ is the pitch angle of the model based on the equations above the calculated δ v in the steady tests are given by fig 5 and since the values of δ v in the dynamic varies over time two examples of the calculated value of δ v in 1 period are shown in figs 6 and 7 one is for a heave test and the other is for a pitch test the working conditions of them are both that flow rate u c w c is 0 7 m s period t is 10 s and the amplitude z 0 is 0 3 m 4 2 test results the measured dimensionless hydrodynamic forces and moment x z m in the static tests are given by fig 8 it should be noted that during the data procession of x z m the forces and moments of strut was measured independently and subtracted from the total hydrodynamic forces and moments directly this processing way is based on the theory of the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015b according to which the forces and moments of the appendages could be considered to be linearly superimposed on the total ones as shown below the value of x decreases with increasing α from 60 to 10 and increases from 10 to 60 the curve is approximately parabolic with small nonlinearity and obvious asymmetry the value of z is close to 0 at 0 and rises as α rises the maximum occurred at 60 the curves exhibit small nonlinearity and weak asymmetry the value of m is close to 0 at 0 as well it increases with the increasing α between 25 hardly changes between 25 40 and takes on rising then falling afterwards the maximum occurs at 45 at the positive attack angles however at the negative attack angles ranging from 25 to 60 the value of m firstly decreases then rises slightly and goes down at the end the curve shows strong nonlinearity and obvious asymmetry in summary the dimensionless hydrodynamic forces and moment all present nonlinearity and asymmetry within the range of high angle of attack there are two main reasons for this phenomenon one is that as the upstream cross sectional area of the model grows with increasing α the reynolds number in the flow field around increases as well the flow separation gradually turns to be intense there forms vortices structure including primary vortex shed vortex etc which makes the flow field turn out to be complicated the frictional resistance and viscous resistance on the hull change to a different extent and that leads to the nonlinear variation of the hydrodynamic forces and moment the other reason is that the attachments can be the main factor to cause asymmetry the upstream cross sectional area of the attachments is not so large in the range of small angle of attack that it has limited influences on the flow field nearby therefore the asymmetry and nonlinearity of the hydrodynamic forces and moment are weak then but when at high angles of attack the influences of the attachments cannot be neglected besides the velocity of flow and the pressure around the model changes sharply thus there is a great difference in the turbulence intensity between the local and the whole which enhances the nonlinearity and asymmetry of the hydrodynamics fig 9 shows the calculated z s and m s in the design conditions of pure heave tests while fig 10 shows the calculated x o z c z s m c and m s in the design conditions of pure pitch tests as shown in the figures the values of most integral hydrodynamics increase linearly with the increasing dimensionless kinematic parameters and because the values of hydrodynamics are small in the low velocity zone unavoidable slight measured errors can make some points obviously deviate from the major trend 4 3 modification of the equations of motion as shown in section 3 the motion model is based on the standard equations of motion by gertler and hagen 1967 according to the results of the fitting curves to the test data of the steady tests in fig 11 the curve of z matches very well to the equations with small variance and the determination coefficient r 2 of the standard equations for z is 1 00 as for x asymmetric term x w w and x w w w w are kept to describe the strong asymmetry of the curves however the equations cannot be simply revised to fit the curves of m for its strong nonlinearity and obvious asymmetry and according to zhang and wu 2004 s and yang 2004 s researches the piecewise function is used to express the maneuverability model based on the result of goodness of fit test the piecewise intervals of the angle of attack s range were properly divided for the curve of m as shown in eq 25 when α is in the domain 25 25 the equations follow the standard ones otherwise higher order terms are added the equations are given by 23 x x w w x u u u 2 x w w w 2 x w w w w 24 z z 0 z w w z w w z w w w w z w w w 2 25 m m 0 m w w m w w w w m w w w w 3 60 α 25 m 0 m w w m w w m w w w w m w w w 2 25 α 25 m 0 m w w m w w w w m w w w w 3 25 α 60 as fig 12 shows the 2 order standard equations and revised equations are applied to fit the curves of x and m and based on the overall sample the determination coefficients r 2 of the standard equations for x and m are 0 71 0 98 respectively while those of the revised equations are both 1 00 obviously the revised equations give the best fitting to the test data in this paper it can be seen that the standard equation of x by gertler and hagen is more symmetrical against pitch angles which would result in the difference between measurements in sjtu and the fitting but it should be stated that it cannot be the basis to deny the good quality of gertler and hagen s equations since their equations show quite fine matching performance to much other test data burcher et al 1995 lin et al 2018 watt 2007 besides the measured data were input to eqs 23 25 to calculate the dimensionless hydrodynamic coefficients as for the hydrodynamic coefficients in the dynamic models the known inertial hydrodynamic coefficients were derived from the equations within the interval 25 α 25 that is because during the movement the attack or the pitch angles were within 20 the calculated dimensionless hydrodynamic coefficients are given in table 4 since the viscous hydrodynamic coefficients in the static tests has been calculated the inertial hydrodynamic coefficients in the dynamic tests such as x q q z q z q z q q z q q m q m q and m q q can be obtained after substituting the known coefficients into eq 7 15 the results are shown in table 5 4 4 validation of test results 4 4 1 uncertainty analysis the ua shows the quality and reliability of the test quantificationally which is an important part of the test results standard procedures of the ua for ship model tests were proposed in the 22th ittc 1999 and revised afterwards the sources of the uncertainty were analyzed as fig 13 the total uncertainties u for the dimensionless measured hydrodynamic force moment f consist of the bias systematic errors b and precision random errors limits p the expressions are described as 26 u f 2 b f 2 p f 2 the precision limits largely reflect the repeatability and reproducibility of the test results tests under the same conditions should be conducted repeatedly for the standard deviation s d e v of the measured data with which p will be assessed the precision limit equation for p is given by 27 p n u m k s d e v n u m where n u m is the number of the repeated tests k is the coverage factor k 2 by the ittc recommendation 27th ittc 2014b the bias limits are determined by a study of the measuring system when the measured physical quantity is related to the parameters of the test system the bias b can be estimated based on the law of uncertainty propagation as 28 b 2 i 1 n θ i 2 b i 2 2 i 1 n 1 j i 1 n θ i θ j b i j where i j is the item number of the uncertainty source and n is the total number of the items if p i is set as the physical characteristic of the uncertainty source which can be the measured value of the force or the moment the water density the length of the model and the speed of the model θ i is the influence coefficient defined by θ i f p i b i is the bias of measured p i b i j is the correlated bias limits in p i and p j the estimation methods of b i can vary based on the different measurement systems the detailed process of ua can be referred to 22th ittc 1999 and simonse 2004 and in this paper b i j 0 because the uncertainty source is unrelated with each other according to the calculating formulas in the ittc guidelines 22th ittc 1999 the individual biases composite biases precisions and total uncertainty are obtained in tables 6 to 8 as it is shown the relative total uncertainties of the static test results range from 0 35 to 1 08 while that of the dynamic test results from 0 89 to 3 04 that proves the accuracy and reasonability of the test method 4 4 2 result comparison the model in the shape of suboff turns to be widely used in the experimental research for maneuverability in this paper a half scale suboff model has been driven by pmm in the cwc to obtain the maneuvering derivatives compared to roddy 1990 s report i e the test results published by darpa though the hydrodynamic forces and moment in both experiments show most same properties there are still some differences for the different test conditions and measuring method tables 9 and 10 show the distinction of the test conditions and results between sjtu and darpa the tested angle of attack ranges from 15 15 and within this range the standard equations of motion by gertler and hagen are fitting for them the hydrodynamic coefficients in both experiments are of the same order of magnitude especially for the linear hydrodynamic coefficients which also identifies the effectiveness and practicability of the test in this paper 5 conclusion in order to build the reasonable maneuverability model for the submersible model a series of tests have been launched by pmm in the cwc of shanghai jiao tong university the tests conclude the measurement of the hydrodynamic forces and moment and evaluation of uncertainty according to the test results the main conclusions of this paper are as follows 1 a motion model of a submersible in the vertical plane was developed added terms and the piecewise function were successfully used to revise the standard equation of motions to get a better fitting to the test data the revised equations can better depict the strong nonlinearity and asymmetry of the hydrodynamic characteristics with a simple form and clear meaning when the model is in the range of high attack angles the idea of piecewise function might be successfully applied to analyses and predictions of maneuverability of submersibles and actually of any other floating body 2 data processing was improved and perfect unwanted blockage effects were corrected by tamura simplified equation the method of fourier averaging was used to process the dynamic test data thus all the hydrodynamic coefficients in the revised equations were obtained accurately and fast 3 ua was made to identify the high quality and reliability of the test the relative total uncertainties of the tests are less than 3 1 which shows the accuracy and reasonability of the new test method 4 a comparison of the test conditions and results was made between darpa and this paper the hydrodynamic coefficients in both experiments are of the same order of magnitude and the differences were caused by the different test conditions measuring method and revised maneuverability equations credit authorship contribution statement xiaoyang liang methodology software investigation validation data curation writing
