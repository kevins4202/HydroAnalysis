13555,with the goal of investigating the effect on zno on the photo chemical degradation of pharmaceuticals using paracetamol as a model compound a thin film of zno was grown by means of ultrasonic spray pyrolysis on glass substrates the morphology crystalline structure and elemental composition of the obtained thin films were determined by scanning electron microscopy x ray diffraction and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy techniques uv vis spectroscopy was used to determine the corresponding optical bandgap to evaluate the catalytic activity of zinc oxide films towards the degradation of selected pharmaceutical compounds capillary electrophoresis was used the structure of the byproducts generated during the photocatalytic reactions was determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy according to our results the film allowed coupling relatively mild conditions 0 35 h2o2 and uv light 365 nm 6 w cm 2 and still reach a degradation efficiency of 88 1 under the selected experimental conditions the approach was also applicable to other compounds with similar properties diclofenac paracetamol diflunisal and acetylsalicylic acid keywords paracetamol heterogeneous photocatalysis capillary electrophoresis zno gas chromatography mass spectrometry 1 introduction pollution of water bodies has been identified as one of the top five environmental concerns in recent years among the common pollutants contaminating water bodies are heavy metals synthetic pesticides and fertilizers dyes detergents and a wide variety of pharmaceutical compounds making their way via sewage as well as agricultural industrial runoffs a diverse class of contaminants called emerging contaminants has attracted much attention in recent years especially because these remain largely unregulated and there is a growing concern that they may have adverse effect on the flora and fauna 1 2 pharmaceutical contaminants are critically important because of their widespread presence in both surface and ground water 3 7 an issue that is attributed to consumers healthcare centers and manufacturers 8 one of the problems leading to the release of these compounds to the environment is that many sewage and water treatment plants use conventional remediation approaches which do not remove these compounds potentially affecting not only humans but also the wildlife 1 5 9 among the compounds found in surface water are included a concoction of antibiotics antidepressants hormones specialty drugs such as blood thinners and heart medications and over the counter drugs acetaminophen also known as paracetamol is a premier example of the latter group it is one of the most common analgesics and antipyretics used to relieve headaches fever and body aches linked to a number of pathologies including the common cold and flu 10 although it is generally safe at the recommended doses this drug is the leading cause of acute hepatic failure in many developed nations and is under review as a potential carcinogen chemically paracetamol is an amide substituted phenolic compound with a molecular weight of 151 163 g mol density of 1 263 g cm3 white crystal and a pka of 9 38 due to its widespread use paracetamol has been categorized as an emerging contaminant and has been found in concentrations of up to 6 μg l 40 nm in european sewage treatment plant stp effluents up to 10 μg l 66 nm in usa natural waters and at 65 μg l 0 43 μm in the tyne river 11 13 in order to prevent the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in the environment it is necessary to implement effective degradation methods in water treatment plants 14 among the techniques that can be applied to address this problem advanced oxidation processes aops 14 16 are generally regarded as some of the most important ones and are currently gaining prevalence across the world broadly described aops involve the generation of reactive radical species with high potential to oxidize organic matter 17 18 among the active species generated hydroxyl radicals oh hydrogen radicals h and hydroperoxyl radicals o oh are the most important hydroxyl radicals feature a high redox potential 2 8 v against she 19 21 are amongst the most reactive species 14 22 and are capable of reacting with most organic contaminants present in water resulting in breakdown and mineralization hydroxyl radicals are typically generated via primary oxidants such as molecular oxygen 23 ozone 24 or hydrogen peroxide 25 to promote the activation of these oxidants semiconductor photocatalysis have been widely used as adjuvants for decontamination of water because they allow improving the overall efficiency of the process while maintaining a relatively clean chemistry these semiconductors can absorb photons with an energy equal to or greater than the value of their corresponding bandgaps leading to the excitation of electrons towards the conduction band of the material and leaving a hole behind in the valence band 26 this electron hole charge carrying pair can participate in a variety of redox reactions that occur on the solid water interface where the photogenerated holes may give rise to oxidation reactions and the photogenerated electrons may promote reduction reactions the overall importance is that these intermediaries can propagate and generate a wide variety of additional oxidized compounds 27 opening the door to the degradation of a wide variety of compounds despite these advantages a common drawback of aops is the relatively high implementation costs due to additional processes such as sludge removal additional pre steps including addition of other reagents to increase effectiveness additional post steps to remove toxic by products to make the effluents safer for the environment however as the technology matures stricter regulations are implemented and the cost is decreasing aops are becoming widely adopted 28 30 aiming to further advance the application of aops towards the degradation of common pharmaceutical compounds this report describes the use of a combination of led uv radiation hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and a film of zinc oxide zno towards the degradation of paracetamol the semiconductor catalyst used features a narrower bandgap 31 than that of anatase tio2 and has been proposed as an alternative photocatalyst due to its lower cost thermal stability 32 and higher photo efficiency 33 36 in order to obtain relevant kinetic information related to the degradation process a simple method based on capillary electrophoresis was developed and implemented this approach also allowed determining the selectivity of the process over other pharmaceutical compounds with similar properties diclofenac paracetamol diflunisal and acetylsalicylic acid the results were validated by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry gcms which also enabled the identification of several degradation by products and confirm the mechanism involved 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents unless otherwise stated all aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized di water 18 mω cm nanopure diamond barnstead dubuque ia and analytical reagent grade chemicals zinc acetate dihydrate purity 98 paracetamol diclofenac diflunisal acetylsalicylic acid sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 and hydrogen peroxide were all procured from sigma aldrich and used as obtained for the photodegradation reactions aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide were prepared daily by dilution from a stock 30 2 2 photocatalyst synthesis and preparation of samples zno thin film was grown on square corning glass substrates 1 cm2 1 8 mm thickness by means of ultrasonic spray pyrolysis usp 37 38 for this purpose a solution of zinc acetate 0 10 m was prepared in di water and then aerosolized using an ultrasonic nebulizer to form a dense mist the glass substrate maintained at 450 c t s was coated by placing it in front of the mist under a constant flow of nitrogen 7 ml min 1 for 15 min these conditions were selected as a balance between the properties and the time required to fabricate the selected substrates the thickness values of the resultant thin films were determined using a dektak 3 surface profilometer veeco and were the result of the experimental variables selected for the synthesis the photocatalytic activity of zno films was probed using a solution containing 400 μm of paracetamol or a solution containing a mixture of dichlofenac paracetamol diflunisal and acetyl salicylic acid each at 400 μm both prepared in aqueous sodium phosphate buffer 1 0 mm ph 11 5 2 3 characterization techniques two sets of characterization tests were performed the first set was devoted to the determination of physico chemical properties of the zno thin film photocatalyst while the second was oriented to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the zno thin films and monitoring the by products generated during the photodegradation reactions 2 3 1 sem and edx the surface morphology of the zno thin film was studied using scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy these experiments were performed employing a jeol microscope jsm 6390lv peabody ma and an accelerating voltage of 15 kv to resolve the elemental chemical composition an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy system oxford pentafet mod 7582 integrated with the sem equipment was used the eds was equipped with a si li detector with electron energies ranging from 0 12 to 12 kev elemental zinc and silica were used as standards for quantitation of zinc and oxygen respectively in the films 2 3 2 x ray diffraction x ray diffraction measurements were obtained to gain insights about the crystallinity of the sample the diffraction patterns were obtained using a bruker d 8 advance diffractometer equipped with a cu kα tube λ 1 5418 å operated in a grazing configuration and measurements of diffraction angle ranging 10 2 80 the angular range was 15 75 at a step size of 0 05 and a time step of 3 s the diffraction pattern was then compared to the available crystallographic charts published by the international centre for diffraction data icdd to identify the crystal structure and space group of the synthesized photocatalyst 2 3 3 uv vis optical reflectance measurements were carried out with the aid of an ocean optics flame t uv vis es spectrophotometer the photon energy was varied from 2 0 to 4 0 ev for estimation of the optical bandgap eg 2 4 photodegradation reactions the photocatalyzed degradation process in both model solutions was induced using a uv led model h86 f uvitron international curing system fitted with a 365 nm light source with an irradiance of 5980 mw cm 2 for a spot size of 6 mm in diameter the initial volume of the solutions was kept constant at 5 0 ml 2 5 capillary electrophoresis the degradation of paracetamol was monitored using a p ace mdq plus capillary electrophoresis system fitted with a uv vis detector operated with a 214 nm filter capillaries of 50 μm id 360 μm od from polymicro technologies phoenix az usa and 37 5 cm effective 50 cm total length were used in all cases the injection of the sample was performed hydrodynamically by applying 20 psi for 5 s sodium phosphate 50 0 mm ph 11 5 was used as the running buffer and the separation was performed by applying 15 kv under these conditions a linear relationship was obtained between the absorbance and concentration of paracetamol in the 0 01 400 μm range r2 0 993 fig si 1 the limit of detection of the method for paracetamol calculated as 3σ sensitivity where σ is the standard deviation of the response was 25 μm it is also important to state that the selected conditions allowed the analysis separation and uv detection of all the compounds selected diclofenac paracetamol diflunisal and acetylsalicylic acid in less than 17 min fig si 2 greatly enhancing the throughput of the study 39 it is also relevant to state that studies requiring a lower limit of detection could still rely on ce by simply adjusting the injection method or volume the detection method 40 41 or implementing a sample preconcentration step in the protocol 42 2 6 gas chromatography mass spectrometry the by products formed in the photodegradation were analyzed using a shimadzu qp2010se gc ms fitted with a shimadzu rxi 5sil ms fused silica capillary column 1 4 bis dimethylsiloxy phenylene dimethyl polysiloxane 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the samples were injected using a shimadzu aoc20i autosampler into an ssl injector maintained at 300 c the oven program used for the separation started with an initial temperature of 70 c held for 1 min and then heated to 320 c trough a linear ramp of 30 c min 1 the upper temperature was held for 10 min the mass spectrometer interface was kept at 250 c and the ion source was heated to 200 c the ms was operated at 70 ev scanning from m z 45 900 aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at definite time intervals and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas the residue was taken up in 1 ml of ethyl acetate and 30 μl of derivatizing agent n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide with trimethylchlorosilane bstfa tmcs was added to this solution the mixture was then heated at 70 c for 30 min and finally a 1μl aliquot was injected into the gc inlet in split less mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic degradation of paracetamol via led uv h2o2 of the various aops reported in literature h2o2 uv based degradation processes have been found to degrade paracetamol 1 43 44 and other pharmaceuticals 45 47 with high efficiency 90 even leading to mineralization of some emerging contaminants 48 thus the photocatalytic degradation of paracetamol using zno film and 365 nm led uv radiation was first studied as a function of the wavelength of the incident light these preliminary experiments were performed using a solution containing 400 μm of paracetamol and 0 35 of h2o2 in a vial and irradiating the mixture using each of the possible wavelengths of the uv led source during 68 min our results shown in fig si 3 demonstrated that the photodegradation was significantly better when 365 nm was used 68 7 efficiency compared to the results obtained when radiation of 385 nm 395 nm or 405 nm was used thus 365 nm was selected as the optimum irradiation wavelength and used for all subsequent experiments it is important to mention that under these conditions the reaction was expected to proceed via the generation of hydroxyl radicals which can attack paracetamol with a high reaction rate k 106 109 m 1 s 1 49 and relatively low selectivity 15 50 using these conditions the effect of the concentration of h2o2 on the degradation efficiency of paracetamol was then investigated as it can be observed in fig 1 a a significant enhancement in the degradation efficiency was observed as the concentration of h2o2 was increased from 0 c c0 0 92 0 3 control experiment to 0 35 when 44 2 of the initial paracetamol was degraded c c0 0 66 0 02 after 34 min further increases in h2o2 concentration did not lead to significant enhancements in the degradation of paracetamol hence all further experiments were carried out at a h2o2 concentration of 0 35 since the irradiation time can also have a significant effect on the efficiency of the reaction additional experiments were performed to determine the most appropriate reaction time for these experiments standard solutions containing 400 μm of paracetamol and 0 35 of h2o2 were placed in a vial and irradiated using the uv led 365 nm as it can be observed in fig 1b the degradation reaction proceeded only under uv irradiation whereas no degradation was observed in the control experiment it was observed that the extent of degradation increased as a function of irradiation time suggesting that although 68 min would provide a reasonable compromise between the degradation efficiency and the reaction time longer irradiations can be selected if higher degradation percentages are desired it is important to note that although longer reaction times were not pursued these results suggest that smaller improvements would be obtained beyond 68 min overall these experiments demonstrate the limited viability of the combination of the uv led 365 nm and h2o2 towards the degradation of paracetamol our results show that although the selected radiation source was able to activate the peroxide via h2o2 2 oh to form the reactive radical species 15 40 51 only 68 7 of the initial paracetamol would be degraded under the optimum conditions thus opening the door to investigate the feasibility of using zno films as heterogeneous photocatalysts 3 2 characterization of the zno film among other catalysts that can be applied towards the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds 31 52 54 zno stands out due its safety low cost stability 32 high photo efficiency 33 36 and versatility 55 57 considering that the catalytic activity and stability of zno can be significantly affected by its crystal size surface area morphology and texture 58 64 a number of synthetic approaches have been presented among those and as recognized by karaköse and çolak spray pyrolysis offers several advantages such as the use of inexpensive equipment due to ambient operating pressures ease of large scale adoption and possibility of automation for industrial use 65 thus the proposed zno films were first characterized by sem to study the surface morphology and structure of the films as they determine the recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers 66 67 and the overall efficiency of the photocatalyst sem micrographs of the zinc oxide thin films revealed a uniform compact granular surface with particles of around 1 μm in diameter formed by the coalescence of small irregular flakes fig 2 a as a result of the fast formation mechanism involved in the synthesis the morphology of the surface is less ordered than traditional rods plates or flowers 64 a factor that was considered advantageous towards the surface area the absorption of light and the production of electron hole pairs 59 68 69 additional sem images obtained at lower magnifications are provided as reference in fig si 4 next the substrates were investigated via xrd to understand the crystallinity of the material deposited and representative results are shown in fig 2b as it can be observed clear signals were obtained at 31 7 34 4 36 3 47 6 56 6 63 0 68 1 and 69 2 2θ degrees where theta is the bragg angle table 1 these features showed a good agreement with the hexagonal structure of zno wurtzite structure space group c6v 4 p63mc icdd crystallographic table no 00 080 0074 from which it was possible to assign the main peaks observed as corresponding to the diffraction planes 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 3 1 1 2 and 2 0 1 full width at half maximum fwhm for the peaks were obtained using gaussian fit parameters for the calculation of average crystallite size on the film d using eq 1 1 d k λ β c c o s θ where λ 1 5418 å is the wavelength of the x ray radiation βc is the fwhm of the diffraction peaks in radians k is the shape factor 70 the shape constant was assigned a value of 0 9 table 1 summarizes the results of the xrd characterization the average crystallite size determined for the zinc oxide film was 360 94 å energy dispersive x ray spectrophotometry xeds was used in combination with sem to verify the composition of the material formed in the film as the presence of other elements that can impact the photocatalytic efficiency of the film 71 the results of chemical composition measurement for zno film in weight percentage and atomic percentage are shown in fig si 5 and summarized in table si 1 indicating a very good agreement between the theoretical and observed values trace amounts of silicon and calcium were observed in xeds analysis and were attributed to the glass substrates on which the films were grown that said our results are in good agreement with previous reports 72 that described the zn2p peak divided into two peaks at 1021 and 1044 ev specifically stating that the separation of 23 ev is consistent with the standard separation value of 23 1 ev relating to zn2 these results confirm the formation of wurtzite most thermally stable morphology of zno via spray pyrolysis combining uniformity with a relatively simple instrumental setup that can be assembled in any laboratory 3 3 optical properties of the zno films the band gap energy of a semiconductor describes the energy needed to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band and plays a central role in the light absorption efficiency of materials in this case the optical bandgap energy for zinc oxide was estimated from optical reflectance spectra using a tauc plot 61 73 fig 3 shows the plot of αhν 2 as a function of hν where α is the optical absorption coefficient and hν is the photons energy calculated using planck s constant h 6 626 10 34 j s and the frequency ν the optical absorption coefficient α was calculated using eq 2 2 α 2 303 a b s t where abs is the absorbance of the material and t is the mean thickness of the zinc oxide film 8660 30 å in this case an ordinate αhν 2 where an exponent of 2 was considered because zno is a material with a direct bandgap the value calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of this plot corresponds to e g 2 9 ev which is slightly lower than previously reported values for other zno substrates 65 74 75 and suggesting a high degree of structural deformation 76 3 4 performance towards the degradation of paracetamol in order to determine their catalytic activity the zno films were placed in a vial facing up covered with 5 ml of a solution containing 400 μm paracetamol and 0 35 h2o2 if appropriate and then exposed to the led uv radiation if appropriate for the selected period of time fig 4 a summarizes the results obtained for the control experiments performed to highlight the contribution of each variable to the degradation process exposing paracetamol to either the catalyst exp 1 0 35 h2o2 exp 2 or the led uv radiation exp 3 rendered non significant degradation patterns of c c0 1 00 0 03 c c0 0 97 0 03 or c c0 0 95 0 05 respectively similarly the catalyst in combination with the led uv radiation exp 4 only allowed degrading 7 1 of the initial amount of paracetamol c c0 0 93 0 01 as previously described see fig 1 the combination of led uv radiation 365 nm and 0 35 h2o2 was significantly better than uv led alone leading to the degradation of 68 5 of the initial amount of paracetamol within 68 min c c0 0 32 0 05 however when the zno film was used in conjunction with the led uv and h2o2 the paracetamol degradation was significantly improved specifically and following the experimental design previously discussed experiments were performed to determine the most appropriate reaction time for these experiments the zno substrate was placed in a vial covered with a solution containing 400 μm of paracetamol and 0 35 of h2o2 and then irradiated using the uv led 365 nm for the selected period of time as it can be observed in fig 4b the zno film led to a higher degradation amount exp 6 than the control experiment exp 5 without the zno film fig 1b and allowed degrading 88 8 of the initial amount c c0 0 12 0 08 over the 68 min reaction time it is important to mention that although a simple comparison of the results may also suggest a small synergism between the zno film 7 1 and the led uv and h2o2 68 5 were used the difference may not be statistically relevant 88 8 vs 75 10 the experiments described in fig 4 a and b performed under comparable conditions suggest that the degradation provided by the photoactivation of the h2o2 may proceed in parallel to the mechanism associated with that of the zno catalyst under these considerations the main species responsible for the degradation would be hydroxyl oh and superoxide radicals o2 and the reaction would proceed according to the mechanism described for zno as well as other materials 33 77 78 this hypothesis was tested by monitoring the photocatalyzed decomposition of paracetamol by gc ms in the presence of the zno film at regular time intervals t 0 17 34 51 and 68 min in agreement with the data previously discussed a systematic decrease in the signal associated with paracetamol was observed and a number of additional peaks appeared in the chromatogram as the reaction time increased see fig si 7 these experiments allowed identifying a handful of carboxylic acids benzoic acid methyl levulinic acid and succinic acid as the main byproducts of oxidation reaction suggesting that the reaction follows the mechanistic pathways suggested by yang et al 77 and moctezuma et al 78 3 5 applicability towards the degradation of other pharmaceuticals one of the most important aspects linked to advanced oxidation processes is the possibility to apply them towards multiple pharmaceutical compounds commonly found in wastewater 1 3 20 79 80 to address this aspect the effectiveness of the proposed methodology towards the degradation of a mixture of pharmaceutical compounds was assessed in this case mixtures of diclofenac diflunisal acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol were subjected to the reaction conditions identified above 0 35 h2o2 uv led 365 nm and the zno film and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis at different reaction times as a representative example fig 5 a shows an electropherogram showing the peaks corresponding to each of the selected compounds and the excess h2o2 the degradation process for all the selected compounds followed similar kinetics fig 5b albeit the extent of degradation was different specifically after 68 min the degraded amount of diflunisal diclofenac paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid reached 93 6 61 5 60 4 and 42 6 of the initial concentration respectively while the results clearly demonstrate the applicability of the approach to similar drugs it would be important to mention that the scope of this project does not yet allow rationalizing the degradation pattern observed that may be influenced not only by their oxidation susceptibility 81 82 but also by other mechanisms e g adsorption the second aspect that is relevant to these experiments is that they indicate a substantial competition effect between the selected compounds leading to a lower degradation of paracetamol when found in the presence of the other compounds at the same concentrations this behavior is somewhat expected because the structure of the compounds is quite similar phenolic compounds leading to similar properties although our results fig 5a clearly show that the h2o2 was not fully consumed they suggest that these complex samples containing concentration of pharmaceuticals that largely exceed the expected amounts 11 13 may need more aggressive conditions for the degradation last but not least these experiments highlighted the advantages of using capillary electrophoresis towards the assessment of catalysts enabling the fast analysis of relatively complex samples that would otherwise require traditional approaches hplc or gc 3 6 kinetic analysis the experiments presented described the degradation of paracetamol and similar compounds using a combination of uv led h2o2 and a thin film of zno this process has been traditionally analyzed using a second order rate constant of paracetamol reacting with the oh radical the analysis can be simplified by considering that this radical would be the most reactive species 14 22 and would remain constant along the experiment leading to the pseudo first order rate kinetic relationship described by eq 3 3 l n c c 0 k 1 t where c is the concentration of the analyte at a given time c0 is the initial concentration 400 μm and k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 83 based on this preliminary analysis the data in figs 1b 4 b and 5 b were replotted as ln c c0 as a function of time fig 6 as it can be observed in fig 6a and in agreement with previous reports 77 84 85 our results suggest that the degradation reaction of paracetamol can be explained using pseudo first order kinetics when performed in the presence of uv led and h2o2 however the addition of zno orange datapoints may suggest the presence of a secondary process that is evident after 30 min of reaction this departure from the traditional pseudo first order kinetics may indicate that the zno film could be interacting with the paracetamol and potentially contributing to its degradation in agreement with the low selectivity expected from the oh radical a very different behavior was observed when the mixture of pharmaceutical compounds was exposed to of uv led h2o2 and zno as it can be observed in fig 6b the degradation of diflunisal gray datapoints is the only one that follows the pseudo first order relationship on the other side the degradation of the other compounds in the mixture diclofenac paracetamol acetylsalicylic acid shown a de acceleration this de acceleration could be potentially attributed to different factors including the adsorption of some of the intermediate species 77 78 86 to the catalyst and inhibiting its performance competition for the active sites or a strong absorption of the uv light when the mixture is used although these results do not allow a detailed description of the kinetics they do highlight the complexity of a system that contains radiation uv led 365 nm the oxidant h2o2 a catalyst zno film and a mixture of pharmaceutical compounds additional experiments are currently underway to address these new questions and potentially re optimize the experimental variables of the degradation process 4 conclusions this manuscript described the synthesis characterization and application of zno as a photocatalyst to promote the degradation of paracetamol via led uv 365 nm and h2o2 under the optimized conditions the addition of the catalysts improved the reaction efficiency from 68 to 88 in 68 min representing a competitive approach for the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals while our results suggest that the photoactivation of the peroxide would be the main driving force behind the degradation mechanism the addition of the zno film is a convenient alternative to improve the yield of the reaction by coupling capillary electrophoresis to the degradation study we were also able to follow the kinetics of the process using mixtures and determine that the low selectivity of the approach could enable the degradation of other compounds in such case effect of the matrix should be

linked to a number of pathologies including the common cold and flu 10 although it is generally safe at the recommended doses this drug is the leading cause of acute hepatic failure in many developed nations and is under review as a potential carcinogen chemically paracetamol is an amide substituted phenolic compound with a molecular weight of 151 163 g mol density of 1 263 g cm3 white crystal and a pka of 9 38 due to its widespread use paracetamol has been categorized as an emerging contaminant and has been found in concentrations of up to 6 μg l 40 nm in european sewage treatment plant stp effluents up to 10 μg l 66 nm in usa natural waters and at 65 μg l 0 43 μm in the tyne river 11 13 in order to prevent the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in the environment it is necessary to implement effective degradation methods in water treatment plants 14 among the techniques that can be applied to address this problem advanced oxidation processes aops 14 16 are generally regarded as some of the most important ones and are currently gaining prevalence across the world broadly described aops involve the generation of reactive radical species with high potential to oxidize organic matter 17 18 among the active species generated hydroxyl radicals oh hydrogen radicals h and hydroperoxyl radicals o oh are the most important hydroxyl radicals feature a high redox potential 2 8 v against she 19 21 are amongst the most reactive species 14 22 and are capable of reacting with most organic contaminants present in water resulting in breakdown and mineralization hydroxyl radicals are typically generated via primary oxidants such as molecular oxygen 23 ozone 24 or hydrogen peroxide 25 to promote the activation of these oxidants semiconductor photocatalysis have been widely used as adjuvants for decontamination of water because they allow improving the overall efficiency of the process while maintaining a relatively clean chemistry these semiconductors can absorb photons with an energy equal to or greater than the value of their corresponding bandgaps leading to the excitation of electrons towards the conduction band of the material and leaving a hole behind in the valence band 26 this electron hole charge carrying pair can participate in a variety of redox reactions that occur on the solid water interface where the photogenerated holes may give rise to oxidation reactions and the photogenerated electrons may promote reduction reactions the overall importance is that these intermediaries can propagate and generate a wide variety of additional oxidized compounds 27 opening the door to the degradation of a wide variety of compounds despite these advantages a common drawback of aops is the relatively high implementation costs due to additional processes such as sludge removal additional pre steps including addition of other reagents to increase effectiveness additional post steps to remove toxic by products to make the effluents safer for the environment however as the technology matures stricter regulations are implemented and the cost is decreasing aops are becoming widely adopted 28 30 aiming to further advance the application of aops towards the degradation of common pharmaceutical compounds this report describes the use of a combination of led uv radiation hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and a film of zinc oxide zno towards the degradation of paracetamol the semiconductor catalyst used features a narrower bandgap 31 than that of anatase tio2 and has been proposed as an alternative photocatalyst due to its lower cost thermal stability 32 and higher photo efficiency 33 36 in order to obtain relevant kinetic information related to the degradation process a simple method based on capillary electrophoresis was developed and implemented this approach also allowed determining the selectivity of the process over other pharmaceutical compounds with similar properties diclofenac paracetamol diflunisal and acetylsalicylic acid the results were validated by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry gcms which also enabled the identification of several degradation by products and confirm the mechanism involved 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents unless otherwise stated all aqueous solutions were prepared using deionized di water 18 mω cm nanopure diamond barnstead dubuque ia and analytical reagent grade chemicals zinc acetate dihydrate purity 98 paracetamol diclofenac diflunisal acetylsalicylic acid sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 and hydrogen peroxide were all procured from sigma aldrich and used as obtained for the photodegradation reactions aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide were prepared daily by dilution from a stock 30 2 2 photocatalyst synthesis and preparation of samples zno thin film was grown on square corning glass substrates 1 cm2 1 8 mm thickness by means of ultrasonic spray pyrolysis usp 37 38 for this purpose a solution of zinc acetate 0 10 m was prepared in di water and then aerosolized using an ultrasonic nebulizer to form a dense mist the glass substrate maintained at 450 c t s was coated by placing it in front of the mist under a constant flow of nitrogen 7 ml min 1 for 15 min these conditions were selected as a balance between the properties and the time required to fabricate the selected substrates the thickness values of the resultant thin films were determined using a dektak 3 surface profilometer veeco and were the result of the experimental variables selected for the synthesis the photocatalytic activity of zno films was probed using a solution containing 400 μm of paracetamol or a solution containing a mixture of dichlofenac paracetamol diflunisal and acetyl salicylic acid each at 400 μm both prepared in aqueous sodium phosphate buffer 1 0 mm ph 11 5 2 3 characterization techniques two sets of characterization tests were performed the first set was devoted to the determination of physico chemical properties of the zno thin film photocatalyst while the second was oriented to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the zno thin films and monitoring the by products generated during the photodegradation reactions 2 3 1 sem and edx the surface morphology of the zno thin film was studied using scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy these experiments were performed employing a jeol microscope jsm 6390lv peabody ma and an accelerating voltage of 15 kv to resolve the elemental chemical composition an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy system oxford pentafet mod 7582 integrated with the sem equipment was used the eds was equipped with a si li detector with electron energies ranging from 0 12 to 12 kev elemental zinc and silica were used as standards for quantitation of zinc and oxygen respectively in the films 2 3 2 x ray diffraction x ray diffraction measurements were obtained to gain insights about the crystallinity of the sample the diffraction patterns were obtained using a bruker d 8 advance diffractometer equipped with a cu kα tube λ 1 5418 å operated in a grazing configuration and measurements of diffraction angle ranging 10 2 80 the angular range was 15 75 at a step size of 0 05 and a time step of 3 s the diffraction pattern was then compared to the available crystallographic charts published by the international centre for diffraction data icdd to identify the crystal structure and space group of the synthesized photocatalyst 2 3 3 uv vis optical reflectance measurements were carried out with the aid of an ocean optics flame t uv vis es spectrophotometer the photon energy was varied from 2 0 to 4 0 ev for estimation of the optical bandgap eg 2 4 photodegradation reactions the photocatalyzed degradation process in both model solutions was induced using a uv led model h86 f uvitron international curing system fitted with a 365 nm light source with an irradiance of 5980 mw cm 2 for a spot size of 6 mm in diameter the initial volume of the solutions was kept constant at 5 0 ml 2 5 capillary electrophoresis the degradation of paracetamol was monitored using a p ace mdq plus capillary electrophoresis system fitted with a uv vis detector operated with a 214 nm filter capillaries of 50 μm id 360 μm od from polymicro technologies phoenix az usa and 37 5 cm effective 50 cm total length were used in all cases the injection of the sample was performed hydrodynamically by applying 20 psi for 5 s sodium phosphate 50 0 mm ph 11 5 was used as the running buffer and the separation was performed by applying 15 kv under these conditions a linear relationship was obtained between the absorbance and concentration of paracetamol in the 0 01 400 μm range r2 0 993 fig si 1 the limit of detection of the method for paracetamol calculated as 3σ sensitivity where σ is the standard deviation of the response was 25 μm it is also important to state that the selected conditions allowed the analysis separation and uv detection of all the compounds selected diclofenac paracetamol diflunisal and acetylsalicylic acid in less than 17 min fig si 2 greatly enhancing the throughput of the study 39 it is also relevant to state that studies requiring a lower limit of detection could still rely on ce by simply adjusting the injection method or volume the detection method 40 41 or implementing a sample preconcentration step in the protocol 42 2 6 gas chromatography mass spectrometry the by products formed in the photodegradation were analyzed using a shimadzu qp2010se gc ms fitted with a shimadzu rxi 5sil ms fused silica capillary column 1 4 bis dimethylsiloxy phenylene dimethyl polysiloxane 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the samples were injected using a shimadzu aoc20i autosampler into an ssl injector maintained at 300 c the oven program used for the separation started with an initial temperature of 70 c held for 1 min and then heated to 320 c trough a linear ramp of 30 c min 1 the upper temperature was held for 10 min the mass spectrometer interface was kept at 250 c and the ion source was heated to 200 c the ms was operated at 70 ev scanning from m z 45 900 aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at definite time intervals and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas the residue was taken up in 1 ml of ethyl acetate and 30 μl of derivatizing agent n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide with trimethylchlorosilane bstfa tmcs was added to this solution the mixture was then heated at 70 c for 30 min and finally a 1μl aliquot was injected into the gc inlet in split less mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic degradation of paracetamol via led uv h2o2 of the various aops reported in literature h2o2 uv based degradation processes have been found to degrade paracetamol 1 43 44 and other pharmaceuticals 45 47 with high efficiency 90 even leading to mineralization of some emerging contaminants 48 thus the photocatalytic degradation of paracetamol using zno film and 365 nm led uv radiation was first studied as a function of the wavelength of the incident light these preliminary experiments were performed using a solution containing 400 μm of paracetamol and 0 35 of h2o2 in a vial and irradiating the mixture using each of the possible wavelengths of the uv led source during 68 min our results shown in fig si 3 demonstrated that the photodegradation was significantly better when 365 nm was used 68 7 efficiency compared to the results obtained when radiation of 385 nm 395 nm or 405 nm was used thus 365 nm was selected as the optimum irradiation wavelength and used for all subsequent experiments it is important to mention that under these conditions the reaction was expected to proceed via the generation of hydroxyl radicals which can attack paracetamol with a high reaction rate k 106 109 m 1 s 1 49 and relatively low selectivity 15 50 using these conditions the effect of the concentration of h2o2 on the degradation efficiency of paracetamol was then investigated as it can be observed in fig 1 a a significant enhancement in the degradation efficiency was observed as the concentration of h2o2 was increased from 0 c c0 0 92 0 3 control experiment to 0 35 when 44 2 of the initial paracetamol was degraded c c0 0 66 0 02 after 34 min further increases in h2o2 concentration did not lead to significant enhancements in the degradation of paracetamol hence all further experiments were carried out at a h2o2 concentration of 0 35 since the irradiation time can also have a significant effect on the efficiency of the reaction additional experiments were performed to determine the most appropriate reaction time for these experiments standard solutions containing 400 μm of paracetamol and 0 35 of h2o2 were placed in a vial and irradiated using the uv led 365 nm as it can be observed in fig 1b the degradation reaction proceeded only under uv irradiation whereas no degradation was observed in the control experiment it was observed that the extent of degradation increased as a function of irradiation time suggesting that although 68 min would provide a reasonable compromise between the degradation efficiency and the reaction time longer irradiations can be selected if higher degradation percentages are desired it is important to note that although longer reaction times were not pursued these results suggest that smaller improvements would be obtained beyond 68 min overall these experiments demonstrate the limited viability of the combination of the uv led 365 nm and h2o2 towards the degradation of paracetamol our results show that although the selected radiation source was able to activate the peroxide via h2o2 2 oh to form the reactive radical species 15 40 51 only 68 7 of the initial paracetamol would be degraded under the optimum conditions thus opening the door to investigate the feasibility of using zno films as heterogeneous photocatalysts 3 2 characterization of the zno film among other catalysts that can be applied towards the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds 31 52 54 zno stands out due its safety low cost stability 32 high photo efficiency 33 36 and versatility 55 57 considering that the catalytic activity and stability of zno can be significantly affected by its crystal size surface area morphology and texture 58 64 a number of synthetic approaches have been presented among those and as recognized by karaköse and çolak spray pyrolysis offers several advantages such as the use of inexpensive equipment due to ambient operating pressures ease of large scale adoption and possibility of automation for industrial use 65 thus the proposed zno films were first characterized by sem to study the surface morphology and structure of the films as they determine the recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers 66 67 and the overall efficiency of the photocatalyst sem micrographs of the zinc oxide thin films revealed a uniform compact granular surface with particles of around 1 μm in diameter formed by the coalescence of small irregular flakes fig 2 a as a result of the fast formation mechanism involved in the synthesis the morphology of the surface is less ordered than traditional rods plates or flowers 64 a factor that was considered advantageous towards the surface area the absorption of light and the production of electron hole pairs 59 68 69 additional sem images obtained at lower magnifications are provided as reference in fig si 4 next the substrates were investigated via xrd to understand the crystallinity of the material deposited and representative results are shown in fig 2b as it can be observed clear signals were obtained at 31 7 34 4 36 3 47 6 56 6 63 0 68 1 and 69 2 2θ degrees where theta is the bragg angle table 1 these features showed a good agreement with the hexagonal structure of zno wurtzite structure space group c6v 4 p63mc icdd crystallographic table no 00 080 0074 from which it was possible to assign the main peaks observed as corresponding to the diffraction planes 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 3 1 1 2 and 2 0 1 full width at half maximum fwhm for the peaks were obtained using gaussian fit parameters for the calculation of average crystallite size on the film d using eq 1 1 d k λ β c c o s θ where λ 1 5418 å is the wavelength of the x ray radiation βc is the fwhm of the diffraction peaks in radians k is the shape factor 70 the shape constant was assigned a value of 0 9 table 1 summarizes the results of the xrd characterization the average crystallite size determined for the zinc oxide film was 360 94 å energy dispersive x ray spectrophotometry xeds was used in combination with sem to verify the composition of the material formed in the film as the presence of other elements that can impact the photocatalytic efficiency of the film 71 the results of chemical composition measurement for zno film in weight percentage and atomic percentage are shown in fig si 5 and summarized in table si 1 indicating a very good agreement between the theoretical and observed values trace amounts of silicon and calcium were observed in xeds analysis and were attributed to the glass substrates on which the films were grown that said our results are in good agreement with previous reports 72 that described the zn2p peak divided into two peaks at 1021 and 1044 ev specifically stating that the separation of 23 ev is consistent with the standard separation value of 23 1 ev relating to zn2 these results confirm the formation of wurtzite most thermally stable morphology of zno via spray pyrolysis combining uniformity with a relatively simple instrumental setup that can be assembled in any laboratory 3 3 optical properties of the zno films the band gap energy of a semiconductor describes the energy needed to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band and plays a central role in the light absorption efficiency of materials in this case the optical bandgap energy for zinc oxide was estimated from optical reflectance spectra using a tauc plot 61 73 fig 3 shows the plot of αhν 2 as a function of hν where α is the optical absorption coefficient and hν is the photons energy calculated using planck s constant h 6 626 10 34 j s and the frequency ν the optical absorption coefficient α was calculated using eq 2 2 α 2 303 a b s t where abs is the absorbance of the material and t is the mean thickness of the zinc oxide film 8660 30 å in this case an ordinate αhν 2 where an exponent of 2 was considered because zno is a material with a direct bandgap the value calculated by extrapolation of the linear part of this plot corresponds to e g 2 9 ev which is slightly lower than previously reported values for other zno substrates 65 74 75 and suggesting a high degree of structural deformation 76 3 4 performance towards the degradation of paracetamol in order to determine their catalytic activity the zno films were placed in a vial facing up covered with 5 ml of a solution containing 400 μm paracetamol and 0 35 h2o2 if appropriate and then exposed to the led uv radiation if appropriate for the selected period of time fig 4 a summarizes the results obtained for the control experiments performed to highlight the contribution of each variable to the degradation process exposing paracetamol to either the catalyst exp 1 0 35 h2o2 exp 2 or the led uv radiation exp 3 rendered non significant degradation patterns of c c0 1 00 0 03 c c0 0 97 0 03 or c c0 0 95 0 05 respectively similarly the catalyst in combination with the led uv radiation exp 4 only allowed degrading 7 1 of the initial amount of paracetamol c c0 0 93 0 01 as previously described see fig 1 the combination of led uv radiation 365 nm and 0 35 h2o2 was significantly better than uv led alone leading to the degradation of 68 5 of the initial amount of paracetamol within 68 min c c0 0 32 0 05 however when the zno film was used in conjunction with the led uv and h2o2 the paracetamol degradation was significantly improved specifically and following the experimental design previously discussed experiments were performed to determine the most appropriate reaction time for these experiments the zno substrate was placed in a vial covered with a solution containing 400 μm of paracetamol and 0 35 of h2o2 and then irradiated using the uv led 365 nm for the selected period of time as it can be observed in fig 4b the zno film led to a higher degradation amount exp 6 than the control experiment exp 5 without the zno film fig 1b and allowed degrading 88 8 of the initial amount c c0 0 12 0 08 over the 68 min reaction time it is important to mention that although a simple comparison of the results may also suggest a small synergism between the zno film 7 1 and the led uv and h2o2 68 5 were used the difference may not be statistically relevant 88 8 vs 75 10 the experiments described in fig 4 a and b performed under comparable conditions suggest that the degradation provided by the photoactivation of the h2o2 may proceed in parallel to the mechanism associated with that of the zno catalyst under these considerations the main species responsible for the degradation would be hydroxyl oh and superoxide radicals o2 and the reaction would proceed according to the mechanism described for zno as well as other materials 33 77 78 this hypothesis was tested by monitoring the photocatalyzed decomposition of paracetamol by gc ms in the presence of the zno film at regular time intervals t 0 17 34 51 and 68 min in agreement with the data previously discussed a systematic decrease in the signal associated with paracetamol was observed and a number of additional peaks appeared in the chromatogram as the reaction time increased see fig si 7 these experiments allowed identifying a handful of carboxylic acids benzoic acid methyl levulinic acid and succinic acid as the main byproducts of oxidation reaction suggesting that the reaction follows the mechanistic pathways suggested by yang et al 77 and moctezuma et al 78 3 5 applicability towards the degradation of other pharmaceuticals one of the most important aspects linked to advanced oxidation processes is the possibility to apply them towards multiple pharmaceutical compounds commonly found in wastewater 1 3 20 79 80 to address this aspect the effectiveness of the proposed methodology towards the degradation of a mixture of pharmaceutical compounds was assessed in this case mixtures of diclofenac diflunisal acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol were subjected to the reaction conditions identified above 0 35 h2o2 uv led 365 nm and the zno film and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis at different reaction times as a representative example fig 5 a shows an electropherogram showing the peaks corresponding to each of the selected compounds and the excess h2o2 the degradation process for all the selected compounds followed similar kinetics fig 5b albeit the extent of degradation was different specifically after 68 min the degraded amount of diflunisal diclofenac paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid reached 93 6 61 5 60 4 and 42 6 of the initial concentration respectively while the results clearly demonstrate the applicability of the approach to similar drugs it would be important to mention that the scope of this project does not yet allow rationalizing the degradation pattern observed that may be influenced not only by their oxidation susceptibility 81 82 but also by other mechanisms e g adsorption the second aspect that is relevant to these experiments is that they indicate a substantial competition effect between the selected compounds leading to a lower degradation of paracetamol when found in the presence of the other compounds at the same concentrations this behavior is somewhat expected because the structure of the compounds is quite similar phenolic compounds leading to similar properties although our results fig 5a clearly show that the h2o2 was not fully consumed they suggest that these complex samples containing concentration of pharmaceuticals that largely exceed the expected amounts 11 13 may need more aggressive conditions for the degradation last but not least these experiments highlighted the advantages of using capillary electrophoresis towards the assessment of catalysts enabling the fast analysis of relatively complex samples that would otherwise require traditional approaches hplc or gc 3 6 kinetic analysis the experiments presented described the degradation of paracetamol and similar compounds using a combination of uv led h2o2 and a thin film of zno this process has been traditionally analyzed using a second order rate constant of paracetamol reacting with the oh radical the analysis can be simplified by considering that this radical would be the most reactive species 14 22 and would remain constant along the experiment leading to the pseudo first order rate kinetic relationship described by eq 3 3 l n c c 0 k 1 t where c is the concentration of the analyte at a given time c0 is the initial concentration 400 μm and k1 is the pseudo first order rate constant 83 based on this preliminary analysis the data in figs 1b 4 b and 5 b were replotted as ln c c0 as a function of time fig 6 as it can be observed in fig 6a and in agreement with previous reports 77 84 85 our results suggest that the degradation reaction of paracetamol can be explained using pseudo first order kinetics when performed in the presence of uv led and h2o2 however the addition of zno orange datapoints may suggest the presence of a secondary process that is evident after 30 min of reaction this departure from the traditional pseudo first order kinetics may indicate that the zno film could be interacting with the paracetamol and potentially contributing to its degradation in agreement with the low selectivity expected from the oh radical a very different behavior was observed when the mixture of pharmaceutical compounds was exposed to of uv led h2o2 and zno as it can be observed in fig 6b the degradation of diflunisal gray datapoints is the only one that follows the pseudo first order relationship on the other side the degradation of the other compounds in the mixture diclofenac paracetamol acetylsalicylic acid shown a de acceleration this de acceleration could be potentially attributed to different factors including the adsorption of some of the intermediate species 77 78 86 to the catalyst and inhibiting its performance competition for the active sites or a strong absorption of the uv light when the mixture is used although these results do not allow a detailed description of the kinetics they do highlight the complexity of a system that contains radiation uv led 365 nm the oxidant h2o2 a catalyst zno film and a mixture of pharmaceutical compounds additional experiments are currently underway to address these new questions and potentially re optimize the experimental variables of the degradation process 4 conclusions this manuscript described the synthesis characterization and application of zno as a photocatalyst to promote the degradation of paracetamol via led uv 365 nm and h2o2 under the optimized conditions the addition of the catalysts improved the reaction efficiency from 68 to 88 in 68 min representing a competitive approach for the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals while our results suggest that the photoactivation of the peroxide would be the main driving force behind the degradation mechanism the addition of the zno film is a convenient alternative to improve the yield of the reaction by coupling capillary electrophoresis to the degradation study we were also able to follow the kinetics of the process using mixtures and determine that the low selectivity of the approach could enable the degradation of other compounds in such case effect of the matrix should be

13556,considered critical and strategic the rare earth elements ree can be found in ores as well as in secondary sources such as acid mine drainage amd the present work studies the ion exchange process to recover and separate the ree present in a solution similar to an acid mine effluent containing la pr nd sm eu gd dy er metal impurities al ca mg and sulfate so4 2 the loading experiments were carried out in columns filled with a strong acid cation resin the feed solution contained 3 13 mmol l 1 of ree 1 17 mmol l 1 of metal impurities and 11 6 mmol l 1 of sulfate at ph 3 5 the elution fractionation experiments were performed with nh4edta at 0 02 0 05 and 0 30 mol l 1 the loading efficiencies were equal to 85 0 94 mmol g 1 for the ree and 30 0 15 mmol g 1 for the metal impurities during loading part of heavy ree and impurities were replaced by light ree the best ree fractionation condition was obtained when 0 02mol l 1 nh4edta was employed it was possible to separate the ree from al and ca the final liquor contained 39 0 mmol l 1 of ree and 2 79 mmol l 1 of metal impurities the process overall recovery was 83 the lewatit mds 200h resin has shown to be suitable to recover and partially fractionate ree including the separation of sm which has an ionic radius like eu keywords column experiments fractionation acid mine drainage elution 1 introduction the term rare earth elements ree stands for the group of 17 chemically similar metallic elements that includes scandium yttrium and the lanthanide series 1 3 are crucial for the development of new technologies due to their electronic optical and catalytic characteristics being considered precious metals these elements are not so rare to be found in nature when compared to some transition metals 4 7 but their production has been difficult because the ree are dispersed and generally occur in low content in their host minerals therefore secondary sources such as effluents resulting from acid mining drainage amd 8 9 could be an alternative to their conventional mining and represent an important source of these elements 9 that besides being critical for industrial 10 are also contaminants 11 needing removal before the effluent is released into the environment although their treatment pre concentration and further recovery seem promising from both an economic and environmental point of view 11 the recovery of these elements from amd constitutes a challenge to many countries in brazil an acid mine water that are generated in an old uranium mine caldas municipality state of minas gerais with a ree concentration of approximately 126 mg l 1 and ph 3 4 is considered an unconventional strategic resource the separation of the ree is a challenge in inorganic chemistry due to the great similarity of their physicochemical behavior as well as similarities of ionic radii between neighbor elements 12 15 many techniques to recover and fractionate the ree are reported in the literature 14 16 and include gravity concentration flotation magnetic and electrostatic separation 17 19 solvent extraction precipitation 20 23 and ion exchange regarding the ion exchange technique different resins are used to recover and fractionate ree 24 27 however due to the positive charge of the ree cationic resins are widely used especially the ones that present the sulfonic group moreover strong acid resins have the advantage of high loading capacity as well as great selectivity for trivalent ree over metals impurities commonly found in amd 25 the structure of a sulfonic resin can be visualized in fig 1 depending on the characteristics of the mine drainage different metal removal mechanisms have been suggested adsorption ion exchange sulphate reduction and precipitation have been identified as responsible mechanisms in various investigations 28 the application of the ion exchange technique has promoted great progress in the recovery and fractionation of ree 4 since it has the advantage of obtaining high purity products and concentrating the ree present in diluted solutions 29 this technique has been suggested as the main mechanism for removing metals in amd 30 whose concentrations are generally low 31 the recovery of ree from amd becomes a sustainable option in an economic point of view since some usual processes such as mining crushing comminuting and leaching won t be performed 8 in a multi element system the adsorption efficiency of each ion is affected by competition from other ions in the solution 32 the fractionation of the ree is based on the affinity of the resins for the elements as well as on the selective effect of the eluent agent the separation process starts during loading due to the affinity between the resin and the ions which is a function of the charge and the ionic radius of the ions and the chemical structure of the resin 15 however the loading does not promote an adequate fractionation because the separation factors for adjacent rare earths are close to unity as the difference of the ree adsorption constants is small 21 yet in the elution step there are some differences in the displacement of the elements as a function of their affinity for the eluent among the numerous eluents with potential to fractionate ree the chelating agents are the ones which promote the greatest fractionation they form stable complexes with significantly different stability constants 4 33 among the most used chelating species edta 21 stands out for its high separation capacity this research investigated the potential of ion exchange technique to recover and fractionate ree in a multi element matrix similar to an amd effluent the loading capacity of a strong acid resin and the elution of ree was evaluated by column experiments the effect of residence time on the loading capacity as well as the influence of edta concentration and residence time on elution were assessed the best conditions to recover and fractionate the ree were established along with the best conditions to separate ree from impurities 2 methodology 2 1 stock solutions stock solutions of each ree al ca and mg were prepared with approximately 3000 0 mg l 1 of ree and 1000 0 mg l 1 of the other elements al ca and mg solutions were obtained by the dissolution of sulfates la nd sm and gd in mili q deionized water metal oxides pr dy er al ca and eu carbonate were dissolved in concentrated h2so4 the solutions ph values varied between 1 0 and 1 9 2 1 1 laboratory solution thirty liters of a laboratory solution was prepared using aliquots of the stock solutions the laboratory solution was homogenized and then stocked in a polystyrene plastic container at 25 5 c the ph was adjusted to 3 5 by adding 2 0 mol l 1 koh table 1 shows the chemical characterization of the laboratory solution the concentrations of rre are approx 3 7 times higher than the concentration of ree in the amd from brazil 8 however the ph and the content of sulfate are the similar 8 34 35 the concentration of the impurities is within the levels found in some amd 35 37 the ree concentration in the laboratory solution varied from 0 360 0 018 to 0 440 0 022 mmol l 1 which corresponds to the total content of the most expressive etr la pr e nd found in the amd from brazil the content of the impurities was slightly higher than the ree as it is in situ 2 2 cation exchange resins the resin used for this study was supplied by lanxess it is a strong acid resin with a functional ion exchange group so3h sulfonic acid and a matrix of polystyrene cross linked with divinylbenzene this resin was selected according to the literature 8 manufacturer s orientation and commercial availability the properties of the resin are summarized in table 2 before being used it was washed with mili q deionized water air dried and then stored in a desiccator cabinet 2 3 loading of the ree the loading experiments were carried out in triplicate using glass columns of 11 mm internal diameter the mass of the resin in each column was 6 25 g corresponding to a bed volume of 8 5 ml the columns were fed with laboratory solution containing 3 12 mmol l 1 of ree and 1 85 mmol l 1 of impurities at 25 5 o c by means of a peristaltic pump watson marlow qdos 30 residence times were 10 4 and 13 3 min the samples were collected every 3 h with an automatic fraction collector amarshan frac 900 and sent for chemical analysis after loading the resin was washed with deionized water and kept at 3 cm above the resin level until elution the resin loading mmol g 1 and the removal

summarizes the loading and elution conditions the loading ph was 3 5 and the elution ph was 8 56 no replicate was carried out for the elution experiments except for the experimental condition

of the selected ree at the peak of elution r e e is the sum of the concentrations of all ree at the peak of elution 2 5 chemical analysis the content of ree and other metals in liquid samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometry icp oes spectroflame model fmv 03 the detection limit of this method was 0 10 mg l 1 for the ree 0 50 mg l 1 for ca and al and 0 10 mg l 1 for mg the determination of the dissolved sulfate was carried out by dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometry edx shimadzu model 720 detection limit 100 mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 loading of the ree the breakthrough profiles for ree are shown in fig 2 where the horizontal solid line corresponds to ree concentration in the feed solution and bed volume bv refers to the volume of solution corresponding to the volume of the resin in place the formation of a peak above the feed line can be observed for sm eu gd dy and er the peaks are due to desorption of part of these ree the loadings for the elements that presented desorption were calculated by the difference between the area above the breakthrough curve up to the feed line qads and the area of the desorption peak qdes that is q qads qdes for the other elements i e la pr nd the loadings q mmol g 1 were calculated 38 by integrating the area above the curves the breaking point corresponds to the feed volume where the concentration of the ions in the effluent reaches a value accepted as a limit often stipulated at 5 or 10 of the concentration of these ions in the feed solution the break point was first reached by the heavy ree dy and er at 191 bv followed by sm eu gd pr and nd at 208 bvs and la at 243 bv this means that adsorption was greater for la followed by the other light ree pr nd sm eu and gd and finally the heavy ones dy and er this sequence of affinity corroborates the literature 8 21 39 and demonstrates the selective extraction of the ree with greater ionic radii 8 by lewatit mds 200h resin the desorption and replacement of heavy ree by light ree increased in accordance with their increasing atomic number this occurs due to the fact that the elements with greater basic character have greater affinity for strong cationic resin 20 22 as ree basic character increases with increasing ionic radii decreasing atomic number z 21 light ree are attracted with stronger electrostatic interactions and so tend to be rather adsorbed the hydration energy is another factor that affects adsorption 25 the hydration energy of ree increases with increasing z values 40 elements with low hydration energies have the capacity to replace the ones with higher hydration energies adsorbed on the resin the variation of basic character and hydration energy is a consequence of lanthanide contraction the main property of the ree that determines their affinity for the resin as a consequence of desorption la pr and nd show curves with a long tail profile differently from the other ree sm eu gd dy e er that show profiles with a sharp increase the long tail profile occurs because as the heavy ree are desorbed other elements such as la pr and nd occupy the new free sites lanthanum was the element that most replaces the desorbed elements and so it shows the most prolonged profile the element that presents higher desorption was er who shows the sharpest profile ree loading was evaluated at two residence times 10 4 and 13 3 min by varying the flow rate the other experimental conditions were kept constant the results are summarized in table 4 table 4 shows that the highest loadings were achieved for la and the lowest for er the total loading capacity of the resin was the same at both residence times 0 94 mmol g 1 therefore a residence time of 10 4 min is assumed to be enough for an effective interaction between ree and resin the total loading of 0 940 mmol g 1 is similar to the ones obtained by filipe et al 8 when evaluating the loading capacity of lewatit mds 200h for ree in batch experiments at different ph values the values reported by those authors varied between 0 840 and 0 922 mmol g 1 regarding desorption it was less outstanding for sm eu and gd 8 10 to whom the resin presented high affinity when compared to dy and er 18 30 the difference in affinity verified results from the difference of the basic character the variation of other factors such as charge ionic size and electronegativity can also affect the affinity of the elements 3 21 22 the breakthrough curve for la has a long tail demonstrating a slow adsorption after the breaking point which promoted a decrease in its efficiency this elongation is attributed to the replacement of heavy ree as previously discussed however as the total efficiency varied between 84 and 85 the studied strong acid resin appears to be eligible for ree recovery 3 2 loading of the impurities ca al mg a loading capacity of approximately 0 15 mmol g 1 corresponding to a removal efficiency of 30 was obtained for the impurities at both residence times fig 3 shows the breakthrough curves of the impurities only for the residence time of 10 4 min note that the formation of peaks above the feed lines corresponds to the desorption of impurities where ca and mg are highlighted the values for the loadings mmol g 1 percentages of desorption and removal efficiency for the impurities are presented in table 5 according to table 5 aluminium is the most removed impurity due to its higher ionic charge 3 21 compared to ca and mg in spite of having the same charge ca was more adsorbed than mg what is attributed to its larger ionic radius and greater electropositivity consequently ca was less desorbed 75 compared to mg 86 21 26 regarding multicomponent solutions competitive adsorption implies on ions with higher charges and or more electropositive tend to be preferably attracted when comparing ions with the same charge such as ca and mg a greater loading capacity is obtained for ca which is more electropositive greater basic character and consequently more attracted by the sulfonic group s o 3 h when comparing al with the ree al is the least retained by the resin because it is less electropositive than all the elements of the lanthanide series 3 21 3 3 elution for the elution experiments all the columns were pre saturated with ree in the same experimental conditions the eluent nh4edta was used at ph 8 5 ammonium hydroxide was used to increase the ph avoiding ree precipitation 3 14 3 3 1 effect of residence time on ree fractionation the investigation of the effect of residence time on ree fractionation was carried out at two different flow rates 0 64 and 0 40 ml min 1 corresponding to residence times of 13 3 e 21 3 min respectively the elution was carried out using 0 05 mol l 1 nh4edta 33 the elution curves are shown in fig 4 it can be seen in fig 4 that the light ree la pr and nd show sharper elution peaks which implies in high concentrations of these elements in the eluate 21 39 the elution peaks for the heavy ree dy and er for both flow rates are formed in lesser bvs 8 due to their smaller ionic radii as the ionic radii of the ree increases the peaks tend to form in higher bvs the last peak to form is for la in approximately 19 bvs the elution sequence is the opposite of the loading sequence 4 41 and confirms that heavy ree have less affinity for the resin and greater affinity for nh4edta the heavy ree have larger hydration and solvation radii 40 being more soluble in nh4edta moreover they have a less basic character and their ions are smaller what increases the stability of their chelates 21 it is reported in the literature concerning the fractionation of ree 17 21 that it is easier to separate light from medium and heavy ree due to the greater difference between their ionic radii the present work corroborates the literature since the separation of light ree la and pr was more favorable 2 also because eu and gd have close ionic radii 20 21 they were eluted together presenting a separation factor of almost one 42 it can be observed that for a residence time of 21 3 min fig 4b the ree elution peaks become more separated i e the ree are being eluted at distinct bvs which means that the fractionation degree increases when the residence time is increased also 3 26 33 this fact is associated to the greater interaction of the eluent solution with the ions adsorbed in the resin 33 moreover higher flow rates favor equilibrium perturbations and cause non effective ion interactions which reduce the fractionation efficiency 43 the results in table 6 show that for the residence time of 13 3 min high percentages of the elements er dy gd and eu were obtained at the same bv of 7 2 for the residence time of 21 3 min the elements er and dy had their peaks at 2 8 bvs while the elements gd and eu were eluted at 5 6 bvs therefore the fractionation at 21 3 min was slightly more efficient moreover a longer residence time promoted greater ree percentages in the eluate e g at the residence time of 21 3 min the percentages of pr and la were 41 1 and 82 6 respectively while at a shorter residence time 13 3 min their percentages were 33 2 and 66 2 krishnamurthy gupta 16 reports great difficulty in separating sm from eu and gd however in the present work the elution peaks for sm and for the pair eu gd are found at different bvs pointing out a novel separation route of this element 3 3 2 elution ph profile the investigation of the elution ph profile aimed to evaluate the ph of elution for each ree since the formation of complexes with edta is ph dependent 21 this knowledge is important to outline the ree elution and separation conditions fig 5 shows the elution ph profile for a residence time of 21 3 min according to fig 5 at the beginning of the elution the eluent ph decreases from 8 50 to 2 66 keeping this value up to bv 7 from bv 8 22 there is a gradual increase in ph from 2 66 to 4 0 after that there is a sharp increase and the ph reaches its initial value of 8 50 at bv 28 where the ion exchange process ends the ph variation is due to acid generation in the ion exchange process for each 3 0 mol of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ammonium salt that reacts with 1 0 mol of ree cations 2 0 mol of h cations are released eq 4 shows the reaction for nh4edta formation at ph 8 50 eq 5 shows the reaction for ree complexation and eq 6 shows the dissociation reaction that promotes ph reduction 4 2 n h 4 o h a q h 4 c 10 h 12 n 2 o 8 a q n h 4 2 h 2 c 10 h 12 n 2 o 8 a q 2 h

q r resin chain tr3 ree table 7 shows the ph ranges in which ree are complexed and the ph at elution peak the elution ph profile fig 5 shows that the heavy ree dy er are the first to be complexed showing a peak at ph 2 66 for the medium ree sm eu gd the process occurred up to ph 3 61 and for the light ree la nd pr up to ph 8 56 the greater elution of heavy ree at lower ph values is due to the fact that ree with smaller ionic radii less basic character form more stable complexes with edta 21 presenting higher pka values this fact confirms the basic character of ree increases with decreasing atomic number and indicates that the acidic conditions are the best to elute ree in a selective way 3 3 3 effect of nh4edta concentration on the ree fractionation for evaluating the effect of nh4edta concentration three different concentrations were selected 0 02 mol l 1 according literature 42 0 05 and 0 3 mol l 1 by recommendation of the resin supplier the elution profiles are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows that all the ree were eluted between 1 and 15 bvs for the 0 30 mol l 1 of nh4edta there was no fractionation at this condition because the excess of eluent promotes the complexation of all the ree independently of the affinity of the eluent solution towards the elements when the eluent concentration was reduced to 0 05 mol l 1 fig 6b elution occurred up to 24 bvs and the fractionation improved considerably what can be confirmed by the increase in the separation of the peaks yet at the concentration of 0 02 mol l 1 fig 6c elution occurred up to 48 bvs favoring even more the separation of the peaks with the pairs er dy and eu gd being eluted separately the greatest separation efficiency is associated to the lowest eluent concentration moore 42 has also evaluated the effect of concentration on the fractionation of ree adsorbed in a sulfonic resin and observed that the greatest separation occurred for an eluent concentration of 0 02 mmol l 1 table 8 shows the percentages of ree in the eluate at different bvs table 8 shows that maximum percentages in elution were obtained for the light ree which corroborates the literature 33 42 lanthanum was found in the percentages of 19 6 66 2 and 80 6 in the eluate the maximum percentages for the other elements varied from 20 5 47 4 when eluting with nh4edta at a concentration of 0 30 mol l 1 all the ree show peaks at bv 5 5 for the elution at a concentration of 0 05 mol l 1 the pairs er dy and gd eu show maximum percentages at the same bv of 7 2 when decreasing concentration to 0 02 mol l 1 the pairs gd eu and er dy are eluted at different bvs 11 6 and 7 respectively one way of separating gd and eu is to precipitate the eu by reducing eu3 to eu2 by using metallic zinc 5 21 however if sm3 is also present in solution it will probably be reduced to sm2 nevertheless sm2 is more easily oxidized than eu2 3 3 4 ree elution process efficiency table 9 shows the ree percentages in the final eluate and the elution efficiencies for each ree it was observed that the efficiency of nh4edta in removing ree was influenced by the residence time for an eluent concentration of 0 05 mol l 1 the elution efficiency was 89 at a residence time of 21 3 min 12 higher than the elution efficiency 78 obtained at a residence time of 13 3 min regarding the influence of the eluent concentration the elution efficiency of ree did not vary significantly however the fractionation was improved when the concentration was reduced to 0 02 mol l 1 the ree concentration in the feed solution was 3 12 mmol l 1 and for a removal of 89 a concentrate with 39 02 mmol l 1 5 9 g l ree was obtained 3 3 5 elution of impurities the elution of impurities was carried out considering the best experimental conditions obtained at the ree fractionation fig 7 shows that for both conditions al was the first to be eluted due to its smaller ionic radius and bigger hydrated radius when compared to ca and mg 38 this promotes better stability of its chelate due to the larger formation constant of its edta complex ki 1 3 1016 in comparison to ca ki 5 1010 and mg ki 4 9 109 44 the al elution occurred slowly showing flat profiles with this element being present in all the eluted fractions contrary ca and mg showed narrower profiles evidencing a higher concentration of these elements in the eluted fractions whose elution occurred together the elution with an eluent concentration of 0 02 mol l 1 fig 7b allowed the separation of ca and mg from the ree sixty three percent 63 of these elements were eluted and their concentration in the final eluate was 2 79 mmol l 1 0 096 g l 1 yet at elution with an eluent concentration of 0 05 mmol l 1 fig 7a the impurities were eluted together with the ree 3 4 advantages of eluting with and edta one of the advantages of using edta over other reagents such as inorganic acids and salts is due to its ability to fractionate the ree another important aspect of this study is the presence of sulfate ions in the solution which forms complexes with the ree these complexes are strongly attached to the resin and the elution with inorganic acids such as hcl requires high concentrations 4 mol l 1 hcl specifically for hcl the process could be economically disadvantageous in large scale operation mainly because of corrosion of the facilities on the other hand edta is not so aggressive and the elution is more efficient as the complexes formed with edta and the ree present stronger bonds compared to inorganic acids an exploratory economical evaluation just taking into account the reagents cost showed that for the present study the elution with edta 0 02 mol l 1 would cost 0 33 per liter of resin on the other hand the elution under experimental conditions of page 25 i e using hcl 4 mol l 1 would cost 0 22 per liter of resin 45 4 conclusions the strong acid cation resin lewatit mds 200h is suitable to recover ree from secondary sources because it shows a great affinity for the ree specially the lighter ones and a low affinity for the impurities ca al e mg the total ree loading capacity was approximately 0 940 mmol g 1 corresponding to an efficiency of 85 for the impurities the loading capacity was 0 15 mmol g 1 with 30 of efficiency the best fractionation in elution was obtained with 0 02 mol l 1 nh4edta making possible to separate ca and mg from ree aluminum was eluted in all fractions even though in low percentages after elution a concentrate with 39 0 mmol l 1 ree corresponding to 89 efficiency and approximately 2 79 mmol l 1 impurities corresponding to 63 efficiency was obtained the overall efficiency for ree was 83 it was possible to partially fractionate the ree at the conditions established in this work lanthanum was the most fractionated element gd and er were eluted together and the other elements were fractionated even though in a less percentage the residence time and the eluent concentration have a great effect on ree fractionation by increasing residence time and decreasing eluent concentration the ree fractionation was improved however there is a need to optimize the fractionation so loading experiments with the genuine amd

13556,considered critical and strategic the rare earth elements ree can be found in ores as well as in secondary sources such as acid mine drainage amd the present work studies the ion exchange process to recover and separate the ree present in a solution similar to an acid mine effluent containing la pr nd sm eu gd dy er metal impurities al ca mg and sulfate so4 2 the loading experiments were carried out in columns filled with a strong acid cation resin the feed solution contained 3 13 mmol l 1 of ree 1 17 mmol l 1 of metal impurities and 11 6 mmol l 1 of sulfate at ph 3 5 the elution fractionation experiments were performed with nh4edta at 0 02 0 05 and 0 30 mol l 1 the loading efficiencies were equal to 85 0 94 mmol g 1 for the ree and 30 0 15 mmol g 1 for the metal impurities during loading part of heavy ree and impurities were replaced by light ree the best ree fractionation condition was obtained when 0 02mol l 1 nh4edta was employed it was possible to separate the ree from al and ca the final liquor contained 39 0 mmol l 1 of ree and 2 79 mmol l 1 of metal impurities the process overall recovery was 83 the lewatit mds 200h resin has shown to be suitable to recover and partially fractionate ree including the separation of sm which has an ionic radius like eu keywords column experiments fractionation acid mine drainage elution 1 introduction the term rare earth elements ree stands for the group of 17 chemically similar metallic elements that includes scandium yttrium and the lanthanide series 1 3 are crucial for the development of new technologies due to their electronic optical and catalytic characteristics being considered precious metals these elements are not so rare to be found in nature when compared to some transition metals 4 7 but their production has been difficult because the ree are dispersed and generally occur in low content in their host minerals therefore secondary sources such as effluents resulting from acid mining drainage amd 8 9 could be an alternative to their conventional mining and represent an important source of these elements 9 that besides being critical for industrial 10 are also contaminants 11 needing removal before the effluent is released into the environment although their treatment pre concentration and further recovery seem promising from both an economic and environmental point of view 11 the recovery of these elements from amd constitutes a challenge to many countries in brazil an acid mine water that are generated in an old uranium mine caldas municipality state of minas gerais with a ree concentration of approximately 126 mg l 1 and ph 3 4 is considered an unconventional strategic resource the separation of the ree is a challenge in inorganic chemistry due to the great similarity of their physicochemical behavior as well as similarities of ionic radii between neighbor elements 12 15 many techniques to recover and fractionate the ree are reported in the literature 14 16 and include gravity concentration flotation magnetic and electrostatic separation 17 19 solvent extraction precipitation 20 23 and ion exchange regarding the ion exchange technique different resins are used to recover and fractionate ree 24 27 however due to the positive charge of the ree cationic resins are widely used especially the ones that present the sulfonic group moreover strong acid resins have the advantage of high loading capacity as well as great selectivity for trivalent ree over metals impurities commonly found in amd 25 the structure of a sulfonic resin can be visualized in fig 1 depending on the characteristics of the mine drainage different metal removal mechanisms have been suggested adsorption ion exchange sulphate reduction and precipitation have been identified as responsible mechanisms in various investigations 28 the application of the ion exchange technique has promoted great progress in the recovery and fractionation of ree 4 since it has the advantage of obtaining high purity products and concentrating the ree present in diluted solutions 29 this technique has been suggested as the main mechanism for removing metals in amd 30 whose concentrations are generally low 31 the recovery of ree from amd becomes a sustainable option in an economic point of view since some usual processes such as mining crushing comminuting and leaching won t be performed 8 in a multi element system the adsorption efficiency of each ion is affected by competition from other ions in the solution 32 the fractionation of the ree is based on the affinity of the resins for the elements as well as on the selective effect of the eluent agent the separation process starts during loading due to the affinity between the resin and the ions which is a function of the charge and the ionic radius of the ions and the chemical structure of the resin 15 however the loading does not promote an adequate fractionation because the separation factors for adjacent rare earths are close to unity as the difference of the ree adsorption constants is small 21 yet in the elution step there are some differences in the displacement of the elements as a function of their affinity for the eluent among the numerous eluents with potential to fractionate ree the chelating agents are the ones which promote the greatest fractionation they form stable complexes with significantly different stability constants 4 33 among the most used chelating species edta 21 stands out for its high separation capacity this research investigated the potential of ion exchange technique to recover and fractionate ree in a multi element matrix similar to an amd effluent the loading capacity of a strong acid resin and the elution of ree was evaluated by column experiments the effect of residence time on the loading capacity as well as the influence of edta concentration and residence time on elution were assessed the best conditions to recover and fractionate the ree were established along with the best conditions to separate ree from impurities 2 methodology 2 1 stock solutions stock solutions of each ree al ca and mg were prepared with approximately 3000 0 mg l 1 of ree and 1000 0 mg l 1 of the other elements al ca and mg solutions were obtained by the dissolution of sulfates la nd sm and gd in mili q deionized water metal oxides pr dy er al ca and eu carbonate were dissolved in concentrated h2so4 the solutions ph values varied between 1 0 and 1 9 2 1 1 laboratory solution thirty liters of a laboratory solution was prepared using aliquots of the stock solutions the laboratory solution was homogenized and then stocked in a polystyrene plastic container at 25 5 c the ph was adjusted to 3 5 by adding 2 0 mol l 1 koh table 1 shows the chemical characterization of the laboratory solution the concentrations of rre are approx 3 7 times higher than the concentration of ree in the amd from brazil 8 however the ph and the content of sulfate are the similar 8 34 35 the concentration of the impurities is within the levels found in some amd 35 37 the ree concentration in the laboratory solution varied from 0 360 0 018 to 0 440 0 022 mmol l 1 which corresponds to the total content of the most expressive etr la pr e nd found in the amd from brazil the content of the impurities was slightly higher than the ree as it is in situ 2 2 cation exchange resins the resin used for this study was supplied by lanxess it is a strong acid resin with a functional ion exchange group so3h sulfonic acid and a matrix of polystyrene cross linked with divinylbenzene this resin was selected according to the literature 8 manufacturer s orientation and commercial availability the properties of the resin are summarized in table 2 before being used it was washed with mili q deionized water air dried and then stored in a desiccator cabinet 2 3 loading of the ree the loading experiments were carried out in triplicate using glass columns of 11 mm internal diameter the mass of the resin in each column was 6 25 g corresponding to a bed volume of 8 5 ml the columns were fed with laboratory solution containing 3 12 mmol l 1 of ree and 1 85 mmol l 1 of impurities at 25 5 o c by means of a peristaltic pump watson marlow qdos 30 residence times were 10 4 and 13 3 min the samples were collected every 3 h with an automatic fraction collector amarshan frac 900 and sent for chemical analysis after loading the resin was washed with deionized water and kept at 3 cm above the resin level until elution the resin loading mmol g 1 and the removal

removal is the adsorption efficiency 2 4 elution of the ree the elements were eluted using edta in three different concentrations 0 02 0 05 and 0 30 mol l 1 the edta solution was prepared by diluting the acid with milli q deionized water and adjusting the ph to 8 5 by the addition of ammonium hydroxide nh4ho elution was performed at 25 5 c by passing the nh4edta solution through the resins pre saturated with ree the residence time of the elution were 13 3 and 21 3 min the column effluent was collected using an automatic fraction collector amarshan frac 900 at a pre determined time table 3 summarizes the loading and elution conditions the loading ph was 3 5 and the elution ph was 8 56 no replicate was carried out for the elution experiments except for the experimental condition presented in fig 4b the percentage of each ree at the peak of elution was calculated using eq 3 3 r e 1 r e e 100 were is the percentage of each ree at the peak of elution r e 1 is the concentration of the selected ree at the peak of elution r e e is the sum of the concentrations of all ree at the peak of elution 2 5 chemical analysis the content of ree and other metals in liquid samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometry icp oes spectroflame model fmv 03 the detection limit of this method was 0 10 mg l 1 for the ree 0 50 mg l 1 for ca and al and 0 10 mg l 1 for mg the determination of the dissolved sulfate was carried out by dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometry edx shimadzu model 720 detection limit 100 mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 loading of the ree the breakthrough profiles for ree are shown in fig 2 where the horizontal solid line corresponds to ree concentration in the feed solution and bed volume bv refers to the volume of solution corresponding to the volume of the resin in place the formation of a peak above the feed line can be observed for sm eu gd dy and er the peaks are due to desorption of part of these ree the loadings for the elements that presented desorption were calculated by the difference between the area above the breakthrough curve up to the feed line qads and the area of the desorption peak qdes that is q qads qdes for the other elements i e la pr nd the loadings q mmol g 1 were calculated 38 by integrating the area above the curves the breaking point corresponds to the feed volume where the concentration of the ions in the effluent reaches a value accepted as a limit often stipulated at 5 or 10 of the concentration of these ions in the feed solution the break point was first reached by the heavy ree dy and er at 191 bv followed by sm eu gd pr and nd at 208 bvs and la at 243 bv this means that adsorption was greater for la followed by the other light ree pr nd sm eu and gd and finally the heavy ones dy and er this sequence of affinity corroborates the literature 8 21 39 and demonstrates the selective extraction of the ree with greater ionic radii 8 by lewatit mds 200h resin the desorption and replacement of heavy ree by light ree increased in accordance with their increasing atomic number this occurs due to the fact that the elements with greater basic character have greater affinity for strong cationic resin 20 22 as ree basic character increases with increasing ionic radii decreasing atomic number z 21 light ree are attracted with stronger electrostatic interactions and so tend to be rather adsorbed the hydration energy is another factor that affects adsorption 25 the hydration energy of ree increases with increasing z values 40 elements with low hydration energies have the capacity to replace the ones with higher hydration energies adsorbed on the resin the variation of basic character and hydration energy is a consequence of lanthanide contraction the main property of the ree that determines their affinity for the resin as a consequence of desorption la pr and nd show curves with a long tail profile differently from the other ree sm eu gd dy e er that show profiles with a sharp increase the long tail profile occurs because as the heavy ree are desorbed other elements such as la pr and nd occupy the new free sites lanthanum was the element that most replaces the desorbed elements and so it shows the most prolonged profile the element that presents higher desorption was er who shows the sharpest profile ree loading was evaluated at two residence times 10 4 and 13 3 min by varying the flow rate the other experimental conditions were kept constant the results are summarized in table 4 table 4 shows that the highest loadings were achieved for la and the lowest for er the total loading capacity of the resin was the same at both residence times 0 94 mmol g 1 therefore a residence time of 10 4 min is assumed to be enough for an effective interaction between ree and resin the total loading of 0 940 mmol g 1 is similar to the ones obtained by filipe et al 8 when evaluating the loading capacity of lewatit mds 200h for ree in batch experiments at different ph values the values reported by those authors varied between 0 840 and 0 922 mmol g 1 regarding desorption it was less outstanding for sm eu and gd 8 10 to whom the resin presented high affinity when compared to dy and er 18 30 the difference in affinity verified results from the difference of the basic character the variation of other factors such as charge ionic size and electronegativity can also affect the affinity of the elements 3 21 22 the breakthrough curve for la has a long tail demonstrating a slow adsorption after the breaking point which promoted a decrease in its efficiency this elongation is attributed to the replacement of heavy ree as previously discussed however as the total efficiency varied between 84 and 85 the studied strong acid resin appears to be eligible for ree recovery 3 2 loading of the impurities ca al mg a loading capacity of approximately 0 15 mmol g 1 corresponding to a removal efficiency of 30 was obtained for the impurities at both residence times fig 3 shows the breakthrough curves of the impurities only for the residence time of 10 4 min note that the formation of peaks above the feed lines corresponds to the desorption of impurities where ca and mg are highlighted the values for the loadings mmol g 1 percentages of desorption and removal efficiency for the impurities are presented in table 5 according to table 5 aluminium is the most removed impurity due to its higher ionic charge 3 21 compared to ca and mg in spite of having the same charge ca was more adsorbed than mg what is attributed to its larger ionic radius and greater electropositivity consequently ca was less desorbed 75 compared to mg 86 21 26 regarding multicomponent solutions competitive adsorption implies on ions with higher charges and or more electropositive tend to be preferably attracted when comparing ions with the same charge such as ca and mg a greater loading capacity is obtained for ca which is more electropositive greater basic character and consequently more attracted by the sulfonic group s o 3 h when comparing al with the ree al is the least retained by the resin because it is less electropositive than all the elements of the lanthanide series 3 21 3 3 elution for the elution experiments all the columns were pre saturated with ree in the same experimental conditions the eluent nh4edta was used at ph 8 5 ammonium hydroxide was used to increase the ph avoiding ree precipitation 3 14 3 3 1 effect of residence time on ree fractionation the investigation of the effect of residence time on ree fractionation was carried out at two different flow rates 0 64 and 0 40 ml min 1 corresponding to residence times of 13 3 e 21 3 min respectively the elution was carried out using 0 05 mol l 1 nh4edta 33 the elution curves are shown in fig 4 it can be seen in fig 4 that the light ree la pr and nd show sharper elution peaks which implies in high concentrations of these elements in the eluate 21 39 the elution peaks for the heavy ree dy and er for both flow rates are formed in lesser bvs 8 due to their smaller ionic radii as the ionic radii of the ree increases the peaks tend to form in higher bvs the last peak to form is for la in approximately 19 bvs the elution sequence is the opposite of the loading sequence 4 41 and confirms that heavy ree have less affinity for the resin and greater affinity for nh4edta the heavy ree have larger hydration and solvation radii 40 being more soluble in nh4edta moreover they have a less basic character and their ions are smaller what increases the stability of their chelates 21 it is reported in the literature concerning the fractionation of ree 17 21 that it is easier to separate light from medium and heavy ree due to the greater difference between their ionic radii the present work corroborates the literature since the separation of light ree la and pr was more favorable 2 also because eu and gd have close ionic radii 20 21 they were eluted together presenting a separation factor of almost one 42 it can be observed that for a residence time of 21 3 min fig 4b the ree elution peaks become more separated i e the ree are being eluted at distinct bvs which means that the fractionation degree increases when the residence time is increased also 3 26 33 this fact is associated to the greater interaction of the eluent solution with the ions adsorbed in the resin 33 moreover higher flow rates favor equilibrium perturbations and cause non effective ion interactions which reduce the fractionation efficiency 43 the results in table 6 show that for the residence time of 13 3 min high percentages of the elements er dy gd and eu were obtained at the same bv of 7 2 for the residence time of 21 3 min the elements er and dy had their peaks at 2 8 bvs while the elements gd and eu were eluted at 5 6 bvs therefore the fractionation at 21 3 min was slightly more efficient moreover a longer residence time promoted greater ree percentages in the eluate e g at the residence time of 21 3 min the percentages of pr and la were 41 1 and 82 6 respectively while at a shorter residence time 13 3 min their percentages were 33 2 and 66 2 krishnamurthy gupta 16 reports great difficulty in separating sm from eu and gd however in the present work the elution peaks for sm and for the pair eu gd are found at different bvs pointing out a novel separation route of this element 3 3 2 elution ph profile the investigation of the elution ph profile aimed to evaluate the ph of elution for each ree since the formation of complexes with edta is ph dependent 21 this knowledge is important to outline the ree elution and separation conditions fig 5 shows the elution ph profile for a residence time of 21 3 min according to fig 5 at the beginning of the elution the eluent ph decreases from 8 50 to 2 66 keeping this value up to bv 7 from bv 8 22 there is a gradual increase in ph from 2 66 to 4 0 after that there is a sharp increase and the ph reaches its initial value of 8 50 at bv 28 where the ion exchange process ends the ph variation is due to acid generation in the ion exchange process for each 3 0 mol of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ammonium salt that reacts with 1 0 mol of ree cations 2 0 mol of h cations are released eq 4 shows the reaction for nh4edta formation at ph 8 50 eq 5 shows the reaction for ree complexation and eq 6 shows the dissociation reaction that promotes ph reduction 4 2 n h 4 o h a q h 4 c 10 h 12 n 2 o 8 a q n h 4 2 h 2 c 10 h 12 n 2 o 8 a q 2 h

q r resin chain tr3 ree table 7 shows the ph ranges in which ree are complexed and the ph at elution peak the elution ph profile fig 5 shows that the heavy ree dy er are the first to be complexed showing a peak at ph 2 66 for the medium ree sm eu gd the process occurred up to ph 3 61 and for the light ree la nd pr up to ph 8 56 the greater elution of heavy ree at lower ph values is due to the fact that ree with smaller ionic radii less basic character form more stable complexes with edta 21 presenting higher pka values this fact confirms the basic character of ree increases with decreasing atomic number and indicates that the acidic conditions are the best to elute ree in a selective way 3 3 3 effect of nh4edta concentration on the ree fractionation for evaluating the effect of nh4edta concentration three different concentrations were selected 0 02 mol l 1 according literature 42 0 05 and 0 3 mol l 1 by recommendation of the resin supplier the elution profiles are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows that all the ree were eluted between 1 and 15 bvs for the 0 30 mol l 1 of nh4edta there was no fractionation at this condition because the excess of eluent promotes the complexation of all the ree independently of the affinity of the eluent solution towards the elements when the eluent concentration was reduced to 0 05 mol l 1 fig 6b elution occurred up to 24 bvs and the fractionation improved considerably what can be confirmed by the increase in the separation of the peaks yet at the concentration of 0 02 mol l 1 fig 6c elution occurred up to 48 bvs favoring even more the separation of the peaks with the pairs er dy and eu gd being eluted separately the greatest separation efficiency is associated to the lowest eluent concentration moore 42 has also evaluated the effect of concentration on the fractionation of ree adsorbed in a sulfonic resin and observed that the greatest separation occurred for an eluent concentration of 0 02 mmol l 1 table 8 shows the percentages of ree in the eluate at different bvs table 8 shows that maximum percentages in elution were obtained for the light ree which corroborates the literature 33 42 lanthanum was found in the percentages of 19 6 66 2 and 80 6 in the eluate the maximum percentages for the other elements varied from 20 5 47 4 when eluting with nh4edta at a concentration of 0 30 mol l 1 all the ree show peaks at bv 5 5 for the elution at a concentration of 0 05 mol l 1 the pairs er dy and gd eu show maximum percentages at the same bv of 7 2 when decreasing concentration to 0 02 mol l 1 the pairs gd eu and er dy are eluted at different bvs 11 6 and 7 respectively one way of separating gd and eu is to precipitate the eu by reducing eu3 to eu2 by using metallic zinc 5 21 however if sm3 is also present in solution it will probably be reduced to sm2 nevertheless sm2 is more easily oxidized than eu2 3 3 4 ree elution process efficiency table 9 shows the ree percentages in the final eluate and the elution efficiencies for each ree it was observed that the efficiency of nh4edta in removing ree was influenced by the residence time for an eluent concentration of 0 05 mol l 1 the elution efficiency was 89 at a residence time of 21 3 min 12 higher than the elution efficiency 78 obtained at a residence time of 13 3 min regarding the influence of the eluent concentration the elution efficiency of ree did not vary significantly however the fractionation was improved when the concentration was reduced to 0 02 mol l 1 the ree concentration in the feed solution was 3 12 mmol l 1 and for a removal of 89 a concentrate with 39 02 mmol l 1 5 9 g l ree was obtained 3 3 5 elution of impurities the elution of impurities was carried out considering the best experimental conditions obtained at the ree fractionation fig 7 shows that for both conditions al was the first to be eluted due to its smaller ionic radius and bigger hydrated radius when compared to ca and mg 38 this promotes better stability of its chelate due to the larger formation constant of its edta complex ki 1 3 1016 in comparison to ca ki 5 1010 and mg ki 4 9 109 44 the al elution occurred slowly showing flat profiles with this element being present in all the eluted fractions contrary ca and mg showed narrower profiles evidencing a higher concentration of these elements in the eluted fractions whose elution occurred together the elution with an eluent concentration of 0 02 mol l 1 fig 7b allowed the separation of ca and mg from the ree sixty three percent 63 of these elements were eluted and their concentration in the final eluate was 2 79 mmol l 1 0 096 g l 1 yet at elution with an eluent concentration of 0 05 mmol l 1 fig 7a the impurities were eluted together with the ree 3 4 advantages of eluting with and edta one of the advantages of using edta over other reagents such as inorganic acids and salts is due to its ability to fractionate the ree another important aspect of this study is the presence of sulfate ions in the solution which forms complexes with the ree these complexes are strongly attached to the resin and the elution with inorganic acids such as hcl requires high concentrations 4 mol l 1 hcl specifically for hcl the process could be economically disadvantageous in large scale operation mainly because of corrosion of the facilities on the other hand edta is not so aggressive and the elution is more efficient as the complexes formed with edta and the ree present stronger bonds compared to inorganic acids an exploratory economical evaluation just taking into account the reagents cost showed that for the present study the elution with edta 0 02 mol l 1 would cost 0 33 per liter of resin on the other hand the elution under experimental conditions of page 25 i e using hcl 4 mol l 1 would cost 0 22 per liter of resin 45 4 conclusions the strong acid cation resin lewatit mds 200h is suitable to recover ree from secondary sources because it shows a great affinity for the ree specially the lighter ones and a low affinity for the impurities ca al e mg the total ree loading capacity was approximately 0 940 mmol g 1 corresponding to an efficiency of 85 for the impurities the loading capacity was 0 15 mmol g 1 with 30 of efficiency the best fractionation in elution was obtained with 0 02 mol l 1 nh4edta making possible to separate ca and mg from ree aluminum was eluted in all fractions even though in low percentages after elution a concentrate with 39 0 mmol l 1 ree corresponding to 89 efficiency and approximately 2 79 mmol l 1 impurities corresponding to 63 efficiency was obtained the overall efficiency for ree was 83 it was possible to partially fractionate the ree at the conditions established in this work lanthanum was the most fractionated element gd and er were eluted together and the other elements were fractionated even though in a less percentage the residence time and the eluent concentration have a great effect on ree fractionation by increasing residence time and decreasing eluent concentration the ree fractionation was improved however there is a need to optimize the fractionation so loading experiments with the genuine amd effluent and elution with nh4etda in lower concentration and longer residence time are under investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13557,the present study revealed adsorption behaviors of microcystin lr mc lr on pristine biochars bcs derived from various waste biomass of kentucky bluegrass kb poa pratensis l microalgae spirulina sp grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk bcs obtained from waste biomass on pyrolysis at 350 550 and 750 c for 2 h demonstrated different physicochemical characteristics the maximum adsorption capacity of 2769 μg mc lr g was observed in kb biochar prepared at 750 c kb bc750 with the involvement of hydrophobic and π π interaction electrostatic attraction ion exchange and surface complexation as the principal adsorption mechanisms mc lr adsorption onto kb fitted well to elovich kinetic and freundlich isotherm model or the sorption furthermore mc lr adsorption from the real wastewater using kb bc750 demonstrated significant removal ca 50 as compared to the distilled water therefore the results of the present study have heightened the strategies to remove mc lr from the wastewater using cheap adsorbents like kb bcs keywords cyanotoxin kentucky bluegrass microcystin lr biochar wastewater 1 introduction cyanotoxins e g microcystin anatoxin nodularin cylindrospermopsin etc are the secondary metabolites produced by harmful algal blooms that were broadly discovered in the lake and river the cyanotoxins occurrence in eutrophic water imposes several health issues leading to serious damages to human health including liver kidney and central nervous system through food chain drinking water and recreational contact 1 2 among these cyanotoxins microcystin lr hereafter mc lr is the cyclic peptide hepatotoxins which is one of the most well known algal toxins produced by cyanobacteria like microcystis sp and anabaena sp 1 2 in particular mc lr was regulated to the limit of 1 μg l for the drinking water by the environmental protection agency epa and world health organization who owing to its high potential toxicity 50 μg kg based on intraperitoneal ld50 that can lead to respiratory diseases and allergic dermatosis 2 4 furthermore the occurrence of mc lr in the water phase can disrupt and destroy the eco system numerous approaches including biological chemical and physical involving coagulation flocculation chlorination ozonation photo irradiation and filtration have been applied earlier for the elimination of mc lr from the aqueous phase 4 6 among these technologies the biological approach was inadequate to eliminate mc lr owing to long operation time for biodegradation low efficiency and interference of other factors e g metal ions ph temperature etc 5 6 besides chemical methods used for the elimination of mc lr has major limitations such as high maintenance cost and secondary health concern in contrast the adsorption among the physical treatment approaches has been regarded as the best strategy for microcystin removal owing to a facile low cost and time saving reaction process recently research has been centered on the adsorption techniques for mc lr elimination using activated carbon ac graphene silica peat and clay and so on 4 6 8 unfortunately these materials pose certain disadvantages including a high production cost and bias adsorption properties e g surface area ion exchange and functional groups etc although their mc lr adsorption capacity was estimated 1 7 83 3 μg mc lr g 6 11 therefore it was necessary to develop a cost effective and suitable adsorbent such as biochar for the elimination of mc lr biochar a carbonaceous material produced by pyrolyzing different waste feedstocks e g agricultural byproduct biomaterials etc pose several promising properties e g hydrophobicity surface area metal composition and functional groups etc that could be utilized to remediate various contaminants e g antibiotics pesticides heavy metals organic matters etc in aqueous phase 12 17 based on the results from the previous literature biochar could be an alternative and prospective adsorbent for the removal of mc lr nevertheless to date only a few studies have been reported on the mc lr adsorption using biochar wood leaf manure based although it possessed several remarkable properties such as cost effective materials generated from waste biomass and versatile properties of absorbent for the removal of targeted pollutants 18 21 furthermore no detailed studies on the evaluation of adsorption kinetic desorption efficiency and adsorption capacity in real wastewater were reported and the current study is the first report on kentucky bluegrass derived biochar for microcystin lr removal therefore we attempted mc lr adsorption studies using various waste biomass microalgae rice husk grape pomace coffee residue and kentucky bluegrass derived biochars the key objectives of the current investigation were to 1 assess the adsorption of mc lr onto various pristine biochars derived from waste feedstocks and 2 figure out the adsorptive behavior and mechanisms about mc lr elimination by the best chosen biochar i e kb bc750 using kinetic and isotherm models and 3 estimate the desorption efficiency of biochar and 4 evaluate the interference compounds for mc lr adsorption onto biochar in real wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk used as feedstock for biochar production were obtained from the local suppliers mc lr used in this study was procured from enzo life sciences farmingdale usa analytical chemicals such as methanol phosphate buffer used for mc lr analysis using hplc were procured from sigma aldrich st louis usa 2 2 biochar production from waste biomass the kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk biomass after grinding were sieved through u s mesh size no 35 and dried for 24 h at 60 c in an oven these feedstocks were pyrolyzed under continuous nitrogen supply to generate the biochar using an mti furnace otf 1200x richmond usa the pyrolytic temperature was raised to 350 550 or 750 c and held for 2 h the resulting biochars were denoted as the name of feedstock and producing temperature e g kb bc350 kb bc550 and kb bc750 to make biochar free from ash and other impurities it was washed several times with di and dried at 60 c overnight the dried biochar was ground and sieved under 140 μm particle size and used for further adsorption experiments 2 3 characteristics analysis of biochar elements like carbon c nitrogen n and hydrogen h in biochars were estimated using elemental analyzer flash ea 1112 waltham thermo scientific usa and the oxygen o content was evaluated considering the change in total contents of c n and h whereas o c and h c values were calculated by molecular ratios of o h and c specific surface area of biochar was estimated using nitrogen adsorption method of brunauer emmett teller bet the minerals e g ca fe mg n p and k content in feedstock and biochar was estimated by icp oes icap7400 duo waltham thermo fisher scientific usa furthermore the surface morphologies of kentucky bluegrass and kentucky bluegrass derived biochars kb bcs were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy sem tm4000 plus hitachi co japan the content of volatile carbon fixed carbon ash ph pzc the ph at point of zero charge of kb bcs was analyzed following methods reported from the previous literature 12 x ray diffraction xrd was investigated by rigaku smartlab rigaku co japan at 40 kv and the data collection was performed in the range of 2 80 fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of kb bcs was revealed by jasco fr ir 4600 spectrometer besides x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific usa was applied to confirm the change in compositions on the surface of kb bc750 before and after mc lr adsorption 2 4 screening of biochars for mc lr adsorption batch studies were proposed to evaluate the adsorption capability of different biochars and select one of the best among pristine biochar derived from various waste biomass such as kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk in brief 0 002 g of biochar was transferred to 20 ml of mc lr solution ph 6 400 μg l in 50 ml erlenmeyer flask and stored at 20 c for 3 days under shaking 160 rpm in addition cac commercial activated carbon was used for the comparison of adsorption capacity of mc lr after the adsorption reaction the solution was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to separate biochar and mc lr solution the quantity of mc lr adsorbed onto biochar was estimated as the difference between the initial mc lr concentration and the residual mc lr concentration the amount μg of mc lr adsorbed per mass g of biochar was calculated following eq 1 14 1 qe co ci x v m where qe is the amount of mc lr adsorbed by biochar μg g co and ci is mc lr concentration in the initial and final solution μg l respectively v is the volume of mc lr solution l and m is the unit mass of biochar g 2 5 influence of solution ph on mc lr adsorption and modeling of adsorption kinetics and isotherms to evaluate the impact of initial ph on mc lr adsorption onto the best chosen biochar i e kb bc750 0 002 g of biochar was introduced to 20 ml of mc lr solutions 400 μg l with initial ph 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 adjusted by 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh respectively the mixture was incubated at 20 c under shaking 160 rpm for 3 days the kinetic experiments were performed under the same procedures as the batch studies biochar 0 002 g 20 ml of mc lr solution ph 6 400 μg l incubated at 20 c for 3 days for modeling of kinetics the

by the most used three models non linear for elucidating adsorption isotherms such as freundlich temkin and langmuir as follows eq s 8 10 14 8 f r e u n d l i c h q e k f c e 1 n f 9 t e m k i n q e r

and regeneration of mc lr onto kb bc750 desorption and regeneration of mc lr bounded kb bc750 were evaluated for the reuse ability of biochar the mc lr ph 6 working volume 0 02 l concentration 400 μg l adsorption onto kb bc750 0 002 g was conducted at 20 c for 12 h and then the mc lr desorption from mc lr bounded kb bc750 was performed using 0 1 m naoh at 20 c for 24 h with time interval 14 22 in addition the regeneration and reuse study of mc lr onto kb bc750 was applied by naoh 0 1 m desorption and thermal oxidation 300 c 23 2 7 evaluation of kb bc750 for mc lr adsorption from the real wastewater in the preliminary experiment on the real wastewater for mc lr elimination lake water ilgamho seoul korea from konkuk university campus river water han river seoul korea and tap water supplied from korea water company were used as the solution for the mc lr adsorption onto the biochar the wastewater was filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter before the adsorption experiment and mc lr was spiked into each solution to adjust the concentration to 400 μg l of mc lr the experiment for adsorption of mc lr ph 6 0 02 l from the real wastewater onto kb bc750 0 002 g was conducted 2 8 measurement the separated supernatant was analyzed using hplc yl9100 younglin co korea coupled with a luna omega 3 μm polar c18 column 100 phenomenex usa using uv vis detection performed at a wavelength of 238 nm a 5 μl of mc lr solution sample was injected into hplc the mobile phase contained 55 analytical grade methanol and 45 phosphate buffer 0 05 m ph 2 5 was applied to elute the mc lr adsorption experiments for each biochar were run in duplicate and the results were expressed as the means and standard deviations ion chromatography ics 300 dionex usa was used to determine the change in cations and anions in real wastewater from han river and ilgam lake before and after mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of various adsorbents for mc lr adsorption biochars bcs are derived from the various waste feedstocks i e kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk at various pyrolysis temperatures i e 350 550 and 750 c were evaluated for mc lr adsorption as shown in fig 1 the mc lr adsorption capacity of biochar was in the following order kentucky bluegrass bcs coffee residue bcs grape pomace bcs rice husk bcs microalgae bcs the adsorption capacities of mc lr on these biochars revealed ranged from 625 to 2769 μg mc lr g bc in particular the adsorption capacities of kentucky bluegrass derived biochars 1423 2769 μg mc lr g bc was the highest among these biochars 625 1573 μg mc lr g bc fig 1 moreover the mc lr adsorption capacities of tested biochars tended to improve with the increase in pyrolysis temperature in detail the relationship between the adsorption capacities of different biochars and h c ratio associated with the pyrolytic temperature as indicator of hydrophobic value had a high correlation r 2 0 95 in all biochars fig s1 the result indicated that the higher pyrolytic temperature i e 750 c was observed as the optimal condition and hydrophobic interaction revealed one of the possible mc lr adsorption mechanisms generally these phenomena deduced that the biochar produced at higher pyrolysis temperature can influence the adsorption of contaminants owing to increase the in surface area higher hydrophobicity and concentration of specific the metals i e p k ca mg and fe etc 24 3 2 characterization of kb bcs the kb bcs that were found as best adsorbent was further characterized to evaluate the effect of pyrolysis temperatures on the physicochemical properties of biochar using sem ftir xrd ea the sem images of kentucky bluegrass feedstock and kb bcs generated at the different pyrolysis temperatures are depicted in the current study fig 2 a the kentucky bluegrass feedstock demonstrated a non porous structure with an uneven surface however the kb bcs showed a more porous structure that could be one of the important factors for mc lr adsorption fig 2a as shown in table 1 the specific surface area of kb bcs improved with the increase in pyrolysis temperature although it was inverse between kb bc550 190 m2 g and kb bc750 118 m2 g the porosity of kb bcs revealed a similar trend with the specific surface area as reported in the previous studies 25 these results might be due to the destruction of the porous structure of biochar and blocking of biochar pore by tar 25 26 besides the ftir spectra of kentucky bluegrass feedstock and kb bcs were obtained at different pyrolysis temperatures fig 2b in the area ranging 600 4000 cm 1 various peaks were detected with prominent peaks at 1049 cm 1 corresponds to co stretching 1150 cm 1 related to co single bonds 1270 cm 1 correlating to coh phenolics 1430 cm 1 was ch 1640 cm 1 was associated with the conjugated co cc 2930 cm 1 was related to ch stretching of ch2 and ch3 and 3200 3400 cm 1 agrees with the hydroxyl groups oh 14 22 the transmittance of most peaks that appeared in kentucky bluegrass feedstock tended to decline with the increase in pyrolysis temperature among kb bcs most of the peaks in kb bc750 disappeared except 1049 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 these findings indicate the cleavage of functional groups and the dehydration of feedstock at higher pyrolysis temperature i e 500 c as reported in previous literature 27 based on the evaluation of results from various adsorbents for mc lr adsorption the higher mc lr adsorption the higher mc lr adsorption capacity onto kb bc750 may be weakly associated with the functional groups the xrd analysis was completed to study the crystallinity of kb bcs fig 2c three major peaks were detected at 2θ 26 for sio2 28 for ca oh 2 and 30 for caco3 kb bc350 and kb bc550 possessed ca oh 2 and sio2 respectively whereas kb bc750 had a higher intensity of sio2 ca oh 2 and caco3 13 14 these results demonstrated that biochar generated at higher pyrolysis temperature developed a crystallization structure due to concentrated minerals such as ca si mg p k etc furthermore ultimate analysis and c h n content of kentucky bluegrass feedstock was evaluated and compared with kb bcs table 1 the c contents 64 68 increased during pyrolysis due to the loss of volatile substances while h and o contents were decreased therefore o c 0 21 0 07 and h c 0 79 0 16 values implying hydrophobicity and aromaticity of kb bcs also decreased in contrast ash contents increased with the increase in pyrolysis temperature the ph pzc of kb bcs appeared to be 6 35 6 99 and 7 07 for bc350 bc550 and bc750 respectively table 1 and fig s2 in the current study a slight increase in ph pzc was observed though the previous literature generally reports higher values in biochar due to the concentrated alkali salts 22 moreover as seen in table 2 the minerals including p k ca mg and fe of kb bcs slightly increased with an increase in the pyrolysis temperatures 3 3 influence of solution ph on mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 as the ph plays a very important role in the adsorption process experiments were performed by varying the ph conditions ranged from 3 to 9 to investigate the influence of solution ph on mc lr adsorption as shown in fig 3 at lower ph higher adsorption was observed with the maximum mc lr adsorption capacity of 5034 μg mc lr g bc and 3676 μg mc lr g bc at ph 3 and ph 4 for kb bc750 respectively however at higher ph 5 9 the lower mc lr adsorption capacities 2714 2964 μg mc lr g bc were observed based on the pka 2 09 2 19 and 12 48 of mc lr and ph pzc 7 07 of kb bc750 the mc lr was dominated by negative charge and kb bc750 was positively charged at ph 3 7 indicating electrostatic interactions although the same mechanism for mc lr adsorption at ph 3 7 the adsorption capacities of mc lr at ph 3 and 4 were higher than the ph 5 6 and 7 these phenomena may cause by two specific effects firstly there was weak mc lr at ph 3 and 4 which could be associated with the hydrophobic and π π interactions onto kb bc750 suggesting the hydrophobic nature table s1 in addition the coiling of mc lr at low ph acidic condition may be a possible cause as reported in previous literature 21 on the other hand at ph 7 07 the surface of kb bc750 was negatively charged and mc lr was dominated by the negative charge mc lr 7 07 ph 12 48 and mc lr2 ph 12 48 therefore results suggest that the electrostatic repulsion appeared between mc lr and kb bc750 these mc lr adsorption results followed similar trends as reported earlier for the giant reed derived biochar 21 3 4 adsorption kinetics onto kb bc750 adsorption kinetics studies were conducted to evaluate mechanisms for mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 two compartment intra particle diffusion elovich liquid film diffusion pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were employed in the current study the mc lr adsorption was perceived to be rapid during the first 10 min and then attained the final equilibrium fig 4 the kb bc750 achieved 69 5 of the total mc lr adsorption within 300 min for the initial concentration of mc lr adsorption these results indicate that mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 was progressively occupied as shown in fig 4a and table s2 the elovich was the best model with the highest correlation coefficient r2 0 972 concurring chemical adsorption using functional groups metal and π π interaction 28 furthermore the intra particle diffusion model describing diffusive mass transfer was incorporated for the mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 showed a high correlation coefficient r2 0 968 fig 4b this might take place in one stage indicating either the diffusion to the external surface of biochar or boundary layer diffusion of mc lr based on the high correlation coefficient 29 hence from the existing results it was clear that metals and functional groups were involved in chemical sorption that influenced the mc lr adsorption 3 5 adsorption isotherms onto kb bc750 adsorption isotherm was assessed owing to its significance to understand the affinity and adsorption potential of biochar towards adsorbate the adsorption isotherm was performed via three isotherm models like freundlich langmuir and temkin between the different initial concentrations 125 150 200 250 300 350 and 400 μg l of mc lr and kb bc750 0 002 g at ph 6 and temperature 20 c as shown in fig 5 and table s3 the freundlich found to be the best fitted model with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 98 as compared to other isotherm models i e langmuir r2 0 95 temkin r2 0 96 based on the findings the freundlich model indicates that multilayer adsorption was governed between kb bc750 and mc lr similar to the bamboo leaf pine sawdust maize straw and chicken manure derived bc as mentioned by the previous investigators 19 20 likewise the maximum mc lr adsorption capacity of kb bc750 was 2769 μg mc lr g bc which was much higher than the bamboo leaf pine sawdust maize straw and chicken manure derived bc 100 1500 μg mc lr g bc with the involvement of total surface groups for hydrogen bonding although adsorption capacity of kb bc750 was much lower than it of cac commercial activated carbon 25 000 μg mc lr g and peeled wood chips and giant red derived bc as shown in table s4 kb bcs could be potential adsorbent for mc lr removal 9 18 21 30 3 6 possible adsorption mechanisms xps was used to further evaluate the compositions of kb bc750 before and after mc lr adsorption fig 6 the xps revealed the presence of o1s n1s c1s mg1s and ca2p during the survey scan 22 from the survey scan o1s and n1s increased after mc lr adsorption while c1s decreased among those compositions in addition caco3 as ca2p was present which was closely correlating with the xrd results however change in ca2p intensity was negligible before and after the adsorption process in detail the loss of π π in kb bc750 after mc lr adsorption demonstrated that π π interaction would be favorable between kb bc750 and mc lr 31 the results imply that there are two possible mechanisms such as π π eda and π π stacking indicating an interaction between the π electron surface of kb bc750 and protonated guanidine groups of mc lr and between aromatic units of kb bc750 and benzene ring of mc lr 32 kcn and k4p2o7 peaks appeared before the mc lr adsorption nevertheless their intensity was decreased after the mc lr adsorption suggesting ion exchange or surface complexation having a positive contribution similar to the effects of mineral for mc lr adsorption as reported from the previous literature 21 the increase in nh2 of guanidine group co co and oh in mc lr after the mc lr adsorption demonstrated that the mc lr adsorption was also performed using functional groups 8 21 consequently results indicate that π π interaction ion exchange and surface complexation by k influence the mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 besides based on the results from o c value porosity and solution ph studies the hydrophobic interaction pore structure and electrostatic interaction could be associated with the mc lr adsorption among them the porosity is crucial for mc lr adsorption the pore size of kb bc750 5 09 nm was larger than kb bc550 1 87 nm according to the previous literature mc lr adsorption onto activated carbon with mesopore structure i e diameter 2 50 nm was greater 32 the phenomena of mc lr adsorption capacity of kb bc550 and kb bc750 was consistent with the results from previous literature therefore kb bc750 with the hydrophobic and π π interaction electrostatic attraction ion exchange and surface complexation as the principal adsorption mechanisms were involved in mc lr adsorption 3 7 desorption and regeneration of mc lr from kb bc750 based on the previous literature the mc lr desorption from kb bc750 was estimated using 0 1 m naoh 14 as depicted in fig 7 kb bc750 achieved about 41 of the desorption rate for mc lr which was much higher than the results 0 01 reported in the previous literature 18 this phenomenon might be owing to the weak binding force between kb bc750 and mc lr under alkali conditions the equilibrium of mc lr desorption was also rapidly achieved within 200 min these results recommend that the kb bc750 has the reuse potential as the effective adsorbent for mc lr removal from water bodies in addition the reuse and regeneration efficiency of kb bc750 using chemical i e naoh and thermal oxidation i e 300 c methods was assessed the regeneration efficiency of kb bc750 using naoh demonstrated 92 58 48 and 46 during the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th adsorption desorption cycles correspondingly fig 8 a however the higher regeneration efficiencies were observed using the thermal oxidation method reaching 94 61 56 and 47 at the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th adsorption desorption cycles respectively fig 8b a decrease in the regeneration efficiency could be due to the accumulation of adsorbed mc lr on the surface of kb bc750 and the deteriorated surface of kb bc750 as possible reasons 23 therefore both desorption approaches could be a high potential for the removal of mc lr by kb bc750 in addition some changes such as surface area and pore size did not exhibit during regeneration whereas the loss of functional groups appeared on the surface of kb bc750 by chemical and thermal oxidation method fig s3 however the loss of functional groups is negligible due to it is not major mechanism for mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 in the present study accordingly these results imply that the decrease of regeneration efficiency of kb bc750 may be associated with the changes of mineral compositions during the regeneration cycles 3 8 assessment of kb bc750 for mc lr removal from the real wastewater the experimental study was performed to evaluate interference between mc lr adsorption and kb bc750 by metal ions in the mc lr spiked real wastewater including di water han river and ilgam lake as shown in fig 9 the mc lr adsorption capacity in the real wastewater from han river and ilgam lake were 1000 μg mc lr g bc and 1421 μg mc lr g bc respectively while in di water was 2769 μg mc lr g bc the decrease in mc lr adsorption capacity in the real wastewater could be due to the cationic and anionic metal ions from the results of metal ions in the real wastewater from han river and ilgam lake a higher amount of metal ions such as na mg2 k ca2 cl no3 and so4 were discovered in particular the significant decrease in mc lr adsorption demonstrates that these phenomena may be likely due to the rapid absorption of mg2 ca2 and no3 onto kb bc750 resulting in the elimination of metal ions in the real wastewater rather than the mc lr adsorption there is a need for a detailed thermodynamic study for mc lr adsorption and fate study for metal ions adsorption onto kb bc750 4 conclusions in the present research biochars derived from various waste biomass including kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk through pyrolysis from 350 to 750 c were investigated as adsorbents for mc lr removal overall kb bcs was revealed as an effective adsorbent for mc lr removal freundlich and elovich were found to be best fit isotherm and kinetic models for the mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 with the mc lr adsorption capacity 2769 μg mc lr g bc owing to the mechanisms including hydrophobic and π π interaction electrostatic attraction and metal complexation in addition the yield of biochar produced from various biomasses generally ranges from 5 to 40 kb bcs about 40 at 350 c 12 at 550 c 8 at 750 c in this study and the cost of biochar is 1000 cheaper per ton comparted to it of commercial activated carbon 33 thus these results have heightened the strategies for the removal of mc lr

13557,the present study revealed adsorption behaviors of microcystin lr mc lr on pristine biochars bcs derived from various waste biomass of kentucky bluegrass kb poa pratensis l microalgae spirulina sp grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk bcs obtained from waste biomass on pyrolysis at 350 550 and 750 c for 2 h demonstrated different physicochemical characteristics the maximum adsorption capacity of 2769 μg mc lr g was observed in kb biochar prepared at 750 c kb bc750 with the involvement of hydrophobic and π π interaction electrostatic attraction ion exchange and surface complexation as the principal adsorption mechanisms mc lr adsorption onto kb fitted well to elovich kinetic and freundlich isotherm model or the sorption furthermore mc lr adsorption from the real wastewater using kb bc750 demonstrated significant removal ca 50 as compared to the distilled water therefore the results of the present study have heightened the strategies to remove mc lr from the wastewater using cheap adsorbents like kb bcs keywords cyanotoxin kentucky bluegrass microcystin lr biochar wastewater 1 introduction cyanotoxins e g microcystin anatoxin nodularin cylindrospermopsin etc are the secondary metabolites produced by harmful algal blooms that were broadly discovered in the lake and river the cyanotoxins occurrence in eutrophic water imposes several health issues leading to serious damages to human health including liver kidney and central nervous system through food chain drinking water and recreational contact 1 2 among these cyanotoxins microcystin lr hereafter mc lr is the cyclic peptide hepatotoxins which is one of the most well known algal toxins produced by cyanobacteria like microcystis sp and anabaena sp 1 2 in particular mc lr was regulated to the limit of 1 μg l for the drinking water by the environmental protection agency epa and world health organization who owing to its high potential toxicity 50 μg kg based on intraperitoneal ld50 that can lead to respiratory diseases and allergic dermatosis 2 4 furthermore the occurrence of mc lr in the water phase can disrupt and destroy the eco system numerous approaches including biological chemical and physical involving coagulation flocculation chlorination ozonation photo irradiation and filtration have been applied earlier for the elimination of mc lr from the aqueous phase 4 6 among these technologies the biological approach was inadequate to eliminate mc lr owing to long operation time for biodegradation low efficiency and interference of other factors e g metal ions ph temperature etc 5 6 besides chemical methods used for the elimination of mc lr has major limitations such as high maintenance cost and secondary health concern in contrast the adsorption among the physical treatment approaches has been regarded as the best strategy for microcystin removal owing to a facile low cost and time saving reaction process recently research has been centered on the adsorption techniques for mc lr elimination using activated carbon ac graphene silica peat and clay and so on 4 6 8 unfortunately these materials pose certain disadvantages including a high production cost and bias adsorption properties e g surface area ion exchange and functional groups etc although their mc lr adsorption capacity was estimated 1 7 83 3 μg mc lr g 6 11 therefore it was necessary to develop a cost effective and suitable adsorbent such as biochar for the elimination of mc lr biochar a carbonaceous material produced by pyrolyzing different waste feedstocks e g agricultural byproduct biomaterials etc pose several promising properties e g hydrophobicity surface area metal composition and functional groups etc that could be utilized to remediate various contaminants e g antibiotics pesticides heavy metals organic matters etc in aqueous phase 12 17 based on the results from the previous literature biochar could be an alternative and prospective adsorbent for the removal of mc lr nevertheless to date only a few studies have been reported on the mc lr adsorption using biochar wood leaf manure based although it possessed several remarkable properties such as cost effective materials generated from waste biomass and versatile properties of absorbent for the removal of targeted pollutants 18 21 furthermore no detailed studies on the evaluation of adsorption kinetic desorption efficiency and adsorption capacity in real wastewater were reported and the current study is the first report on kentucky bluegrass derived biochar for microcystin lr removal therefore we attempted mc lr adsorption studies using various waste biomass microalgae rice husk grape pomace coffee residue and kentucky bluegrass derived biochars the key objectives of the current investigation were to 1 assess the adsorption of mc lr onto various pristine biochars derived from waste feedstocks and 2 figure out the adsorptive behavior and mechanisms about mc lr elimination by the best chosen biochar i e kb bc750 using kinetic and isotherm models and 3 estimate the desorption efficiency of biochar and 4 evaluate the interference compounds for mc lr adsorption onto biochar in real wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk used as feedstock for biochar production were obtained from the local suppliers mc lr used in this study was procured from enzo life sciences farmingdale usa analytical chemicals such as methanol phosphate buffer used for mc lr analysis using hplc were procured from sigma aldrich st louis usa 2 2 biochar production from waste biomass the kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk biomass after grinding were sieved through u s mesh size no 35 and dried for 24 h at 60 c in an oven these feedstocks were pyrolyzed under continuous nitrogen supply to generate the biochar using an mti furnace otf 1200x richmond usa the pyrolytic temperature was raised to 350 550 or 750 c and held for 2 h the resulting biochars were denoted as the name of feedstock and producing temperature e g kb bc350 kb bc550 and kb bc750 to make biochar free from ash and other impurities it was washed several times with di and dried at 60 c overnight the dried biochar was ground and sieved under 140 μm particle size and used for further adsorption experiments 2 3 characteristics analysis of biochar elements like carbon c nitrogen n and hydrogen h in biochars were estimated using elemental analyzer flash ea 1112 waltham thermo scientific usa and the oxygen o content was evaluated considering the change in total contents of c n and h whereas o c and h c values were calculated by molecular ratios of o h and c specific surface area of biochar was estimated using nitrogen adsorption method of brunauer emmett teller bet the minerals e g ca fe mg n p and k content in feedstock and biochar was estimated by icp oes icap7400 duo waltham thermo fisher scientific usa furthermore the surface morphologies of kentucky bluegrass and kentucky bluegrass derived biochars kb bcs were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy sem tm4000 plus hitachi co japan the content of volatile carbon fixed carbon ash ph pzc the ph at point of zero charge of kb bcs was analyzed following methods reported from the previous literature 12 x ray diffraction xrd was investigated by rigaku smartlab rigaku co japan at 40 kv and the data collection was performed in the range of 2 80 fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of kb bcs was revealed by jasco fr ir 4600 spectrometer besides x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific usa was applied to confirm the change in compositions on the surface of kb bc750 before and after mc lr adsorption 2 4 screening of biochars for mc lr adsorption batch studies were proposed to evaluate the adsorption capability of different biochars and select one of the best among pristine biochar derived from various waste biomass such as kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk in brief 0 002 g of biochar was transferred to 20 ml of mc lr solution ph 6 400 μg l in 50 ml erlenmeyer flask and stored at 20 c for 3 days under shaking 160 rpm in addition cac commercial activated carbon was used for the comparison of adsorption capacity of mc lr after the adsorption reaction the solution was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to separate biochar and mc lr solution the quantity of mc lr adsorbed onto biochar was estimated as the difference between the initial mc lr concentration and the residual mc lr concentration the amount μg of mc lr adsorbed per mass g of biochar was calculated following eq 1 14 1 qe co ci x v m where qe is the amount of mc lr adsorbed by biochar μg g co and ci is mc lr concentration in the initial and final solution μg l respectively v is the volume of mc lr solution l and m is the unit mass of biochar g 2 5 influence of solution ph on mc lr adsorption and modeling of adsorption kinetics and isotherms to evaluate the impact of initial ph on mc lr adsorption onto the best chosen biochar i e kb bc750 0 002 g of biochar was introduced to 20 ml of mc lr solutions 400 μg l with initial ph 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 adjusted by 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh respectively the mixture was incubated at 20 c under shaking 160 rpm for 3 days the kinetic experiments were performed under the same procedures as the batch studies biochar 0 002 g 20 ml of mc lr solution ph 6 400 μg l incubated at 20 c for 3 days for modeling of kinetics the

addition the regeneration and reuse study of mc lr onto kb bc750 was applied by naoh 0 1 m desorption and thermal oxidation 300 c 23 2 7 evaluation of kb bc750 for mc lr adsorption from the real wastewater in the preliminary experiment on the real wastewater for mc lr elimination lake water ilgamho seoul korea from konkuk university campus river water han river seoul korea and tap water supplied from korea water company were used as the solution for the mc lr adsorption onto the biochar the wastewater was filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter before the adsorption experiment and mc lr was spiked into each solution to adjust the concentration to 400 μg l of mc lr the experiment for adsorption of mc lr ph 6 0 02 l from the real wastewater onto kb bc750 0 002 g was conducted 2 8 measurement the separated supernatant was analyzed using hplc yl9100 younglin co korea coupled with a luna omega 3 μm polar c18 column 100 phenomenex usa using uv vis detection performed at a

in cations and anions in real wastewater from han river and ilgam lake before and after mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of various adsorbents for mc lr adsorption biochars bcs are derived from the various waste feedstocks i e kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk at various pyrolysis temperatures i e 350 550 and 750 c were evaluated for mc lr adsorption as shown in fig 1 the mc lr adsorption capacity of biochar was in the following order kentucky bluegrass bcs coffee residue bcs grape pomace bcs rice husk bcs microalgae bcs the adsorption capacities of mc lr on these biochars revealed ranged from 625 to 2769 μg mc lr g bc in particular the adsorption capacities of kentucky bluegrass derived biochars 1423 2769 μg mc lr g bc was the highest among these biochars 625 1573 μg mc lr g bc fig 1 moreover the mc lr adsorption capacities of tested biochars tended to improve with the increase in pyrolysis temperature in detail the relationship between the adsorption capacities of different biochars and h c ratio associated with the pyrolytic temperature as indicator of hydrophobic value had a high correlation r 2 0 95 in all biochars fig s1 the result indicated that the higher pyrolytic temperature i e 750 c was observed as the optimal condition and hydrophobic interaction revealed one of the possible mc lr adsorption mechanisms generally these phenomena deduced that the biochar produced at higher pyrolysis temperature can influence the adsorption of contaminants owing to increase the in surface area higher hydrophobicity and concentration of specific the metals i e p k ca mg and fe etc 24 3 2 characterization of kb bcs the kb bcs that were found as best adsorbent was further characterized to evaluate the effect of pyrolysis temperatures on the physicochemical properties of biochar using sem ftir xrd ea the sem images of kentucky bluegrass feedstock and kb bcs generated at the different pyrolysis temperatures are depicted in the current study fig 2 a the kentucky bluegrass feedstock demonstrated a non porous structure with an uneven surface however the kb bcs showed a more porous structure that could be one of the important factors for mc lr adsorption fig 2a as shown in table 1 the specific surface area of kb bcs improved with the increase in pyrolysis temperature although it was inverse between kb bc550 190 m2 g and kb bc750 118 m2 g the porosity of kb bcs revealed a similar trend with the specific surface area as reported in the previous studies 25 these results might be due to the destruction of the porous structure of biochar and blocking of biochar pore by tar 25 26 besides the ftir spectra of kentucky bluegrass feedstock and kb bcs were obtained at different pyrolysis temperatures fig 2b in the area ranging 600 4000 cm 1 various peaks were detected with prominent peaks at 1049 cm 1 corresponds to co stretching 1150 cm 1 related to co single bonds 1270 cm 1 correlating to coh phenolics 1430 cm 1 was ch 1640 cm 1 was associated with the conjugated co cc 2930 cm 1 was related to ch stretching of ch2 and ch3 and 3200 3400 cm 1 agrees with the hydroxyl groups oh 14 22 the transmittance of most peaks that appeared in kentucky bluegrass feedstock tended to decline with the increase in pyrolysis temperature among kb bcs most of the peaks in kb bc750 disappeared except 1049 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 these findings indicate the cleavage of functional groups and the dehydration of feedstock at higher pyrolysis temperature i e 500 c as reported in previous literature 27 based on the evaluation of results from various adsorbents for mc lr adsorption the higher mc lr adsorption the higher mc lr adsorption capacity onto kb bc750 may be weakly associated with the functional groups the xrd analysis was completed to study the crystallinity of kb bcs fig 2c three major peaks were detected at 2θ 26 for sio2 28 for ca oh 2 and 30 for caco3 kb bc350 and kb bc550 possessed ca oh 2 and sio2 respectively whereas kb bc750 had a higher intensity of sio2 ca oh 2 and caco3 13 14 these results demonstrated that biochar generated at higher pyrolysis temperature developed a crystallization structure due to concentrated minerals such as ca si mg p k etc furthermore ultimate analysis and c h n content of kentucky bluegrass feedstock was evaluated and compared with kb bcs table 1 the c contents 64 68 increased during pyrolysis due to the loss of volatile substances while h and o contents were decreased therefore o c 0 21 0 07 and h c 0 79 0 16 values implying hydrophobicity and aromaticity of kb bcs also decreased in contrast ash contents increased with the increase in pyrolysis temperature the ph pzc of kb bcs appeared to be 6 35 6 99 and 7 07 for bc350 bc550 and bc750 respectively table 1 and fig s2 in the current study a slight increase in ph pzc was observed though the previous literature generally reports higher values in biochar due to the concentrated alkali salts 22 moreover as seen in table 2 the minerals including p k ca mg and fe of kb bcs slightly increased with an increase in the pyrolysis temperatures 3 3 influence of solution ph on mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 as the ph plays a very important role in the adsorption process experiments were performed by varying the ph conditions ranged from 3 to 9 to investigate the influence of solution ph on mc lr adsorption as shown in fig 3 at lower ph higher adsorption was observed with the maximum mc lr adsorption capacity of 5034 μg mc lr g bc and 3676 μg mc lr g bc at ph 3 and ph 4 for kb bc750 respectively however at higher ph 5 9 the lower mc lr adsorption capacities 2714 2964 μg mc lr g bc were observed based on the pka 2 09 2 19 and 12 48 of mc lr and ph pzc 7 07 of kb bc750 the mc lr was dominated by negative charge and kb bc750 was positively charged at ph 3 7 indicating electrostatic interactions although the same mechanism for mc lr adsorption at ph 3 7 the adsorption capacities of mc lr at ph 3 and 4 were higher than the ph 5 6 and 7 these phenomena may cause by two specific effects firstly there was weak mc lr at ph 3 and 4 which could be associated with the hydrophobic and π π interactions onto kb bc750 suggesting the hydrophobic nature table s1 in addition the coiling of mc lr at low ph acidic condition may be a possible cause as reported in previous literature 21 on the other hand at ph 7 07 the surface of kb bc750 was negatively charged and mc lr was dominated by the negative charge mc lr 7 07 ph 12 48 and mc lr2 ph 12 48 therefore results suggest that the electrostatic repulsion appeared between mc lr and kb bc750 these mc lr adsorption results followed similar trends as reported earlier for the giant reed derived biochar 21 3 4 adsorption kinetics onto kb bc750 adsorption kinetics studies were conducted to evaluate mechanisms for mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 two compartment intra particle diffusion elovich liquid film diffusion pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were employed in the current study the mc lr adsorption was perceived to be rapid during the first 10 min and then attained the final equilibrium fig 4 the kb bc750 achieved 69 5 of the total mc lr adsorption within 300 min for the initial concentration of mc lr adsorption these results indicate that mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 was progressively occupied as shown in fig 4a and table s2 the elovich was the best model with the highest correlation coefficient r2 0 972 concurring chemical adsorption using functional groups metal and π π interaction 28 furthermore the intra particle diffusion model describing diffusive mass transfer was incorporated for the mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 showed a high correlation coefficient r2 0 968 fig 4b this might take place in one stage indicating either the diffusion to the external surface of biochar or boundary layer diffusion of mc lr based on the high correlation coefficient 29 hence from the existing results it was clear that metals and functional groups were involved in chemical sorption that influenced the mc lr adsorption 3 5 adsorption isotherms onto kb bc750 adsorption isotherm was assessed owing to its significance to understand the affinity and adsorption potential of biochar towards adsorbate the adsorption isotherm was performed via three isotherm models like freundlich langmuir and temkin between the different initial concentrations 125 150 200 250 300 350 and 400 μg l of mc lr and kb bc750 0 002 g at ph 6 and temperature 20 c as shown in fig 5 and table s3 the freundlich found to be the best fitted model with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 98 as compared to other isotherm models i e langmuir r2 0 95 temkin r2 0 96 based on the findings the freundlich model indicates that multilayer adsorption was governed between kb bc750 and mc lr similar to the bamboo leaf pine sawdust maize straw and chicken manure derived bc as mentioned by the previous investigators 19 20 likewise the maximum mc lr adsorption capacity of kb bc750 was 2769 μg mc lr g bc which was much higher than the bamboo leaf pine sawdust maize straw and chicken manure derived bc 100 1500 μg mc lr g bc with the involvement of total surface groups for hydrogen bonding although adsorption capacity of kb bc750 was much lower than it of cac commercial activated carbon 25 000 μg mc lr g and peeled wood chips and giant red derived bc as shown in table s4 kb bcs could be potential adsorbent for mc lr removal 9 18 21 30 3 6 possible adsorption mechanisms xps was used to further evaluate the compositions of kb bc750 before and after mc lr adsorption fig 6 the xps revealed the presence of o1s n1s c1s mg1s and ca2p during the survey scan 22 from the survey scan o1s and n1s increased after mc lr adsorption while c1s decreased among those compositions in addition caco3 as ca2p was present which was closely correlating with the xrd results however change in ca2p intensity was negligible before and after the adsorption process in detail the loss of π π in kb bc750 after mc lr adsorption demonstrated that π π interaction would be favorable between kb bc750 and mc lr 31 the results imply that there are two possible mechanisms such as π π eda and π π stacking indicating an interaction between the π electron surface of kb bc750 and protonated guanidine groups of mc lr and between aromatic units of kb bc750 and benzene ring of mc lr 32 kcn and k4p2o7 peaks appeared before the mc lr adsorption nevertheless their intensity was decreased after the mc lr adsorption suggesting ion exchange or surface complexation having a positive contribution similar to the effects of mineral for mc lr adsorption as reported from the previous literature 21 the increase in nh2 of guanidine group co co and oh in mc lr after the mc lr adsorption demonstrated that the mc lr adsorption was also performed using functional groups 8 21 consequently results indicate that π π interaction ion exchange and surface complexation by k influence the mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 besides based on the results from o c value porosity and solution ph studies the hydrophobic interaction pore structure and electrostatic interaction could be associated with the mc lr adsorption among them the porosity is crucial for mc lr adsorption the pore size of kb bc750 5 09 nm was larger than kb bc550 1 87 nm according to the previous literature mc lr adsorption onto activated carbon with mesopore structure i e diameter 2 50 nm was greater 32 the phenomena of mc lr adsorption capacity of kb bc550 and kb bc750 was consistent with the results from previous literature therefore kb bc750 with the hydrophobic and π π interaction electrostatic attraction ion exchange and surface complexation as the principal adsorption mechanisms were involved in mc lr adsorption 3 7 desorption and regeneration of mc lr from kb bc750 based on the previous literature the mc lr desorption from kb bc750 was estimated using 0 1 m naoh 14 as depicted in fig 7 kb bc750 achieved about 41 of the desorption rate for mc lr which was much higher than the results 0 01 reported in the previous literature 18 this phenomenon might be owing to the weak binding force between kb bc750 and mc lr under alkali conditions the equilibrium of mc lr desorption was also rapidly achieved within 200 min these results recommend that the kb bc750 has the reuse potential as the effective adsorbent for mc lr removal from water bodies in addition the reuse and regeneration efficiency of kb bc750 using chemical i e naoh and thermal oxidation i e 300 c methods was assessed the regeneration efficiency of kb bc750 using naoh demonstrated 92 58 48 and 46 during the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th adsorption desorption cycles correspondingly fig 8 a however the higher regeneration efficiencies were observed using the thermal oxidation method reaching 94 61 56 and 47 at the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th adsorption desorption cycles respectively fig 8b a decrease in the regeneration efficiency could be due to the accumulation of adsorbed mc lr on the surface of kb bc750 and the deteriorated surface of kb bc750 as possible reasons 23 therefore both desorption approaches could be a high potential for the removal of mc lr by kb bc750 in addition some changes such as surface area and pore size did not exhibit during regeneration whereas the loss of functional groups appeared on the surface of kb bc750 by chemical and thermal oxidation method fig s3 however the loss of functional groups is negligible due to it is not major mechanism for mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 in the present study accordingly these results imply that the decrease of regeneration efficiency of kb bc750 may be associated with the changes of mineral compositions during the regeneration cycles 3 8 assessment of kb bc750 for mc lr removal from the real wastewater the experimental study was performed to evaluate interference between mc lr adsorption and kb bc750 by metal ions in the mc lr spiked real wastewater including di water han river and ilgam lake as shown in fig 9 the mc lr adsorption capacity in the real wastewater from han river and ilgam lake were 1000 μg mc lr g bc and 1421 μg mc lr g bc respectively while in di water was 2769 μg mc lr g bc the decrease in mc lr adsorption capacity in the real wastewater could be due to the cationic and anionic metal ions from the results of metal ions in the real wastewater from han river and ilgam lake a higher amount of metal ions such as na mg2 k ca2 cl no3 and so4 were discovered in particular the significant decrease in mc lr adsorption demonstrates that these phenomena may be likely due to the rapid absorption of mg2 ca2 and no3 onto kb bc750 resulting in the elimination of metal ions in the real wastewater rather than the mc lr adsorption there is a need for a detailed thermodynamic study for mc lr adsorption and fate study for metal ions adsorption onto kb bc750 4 conclusions in the present research biochars derived from various waste biomass including kentucky bluegrass microalgae grape pomace coffee residues and rice husk through pyrolysis from 350 to 750 c were investigated as adsorbents for mc lr removal overall kb bcs was revealed as an effective adsorbent for mc lr removal freundlich and elovich were found to be best fit isotherm and kinetic models for the mc lr adsorption onto kb bc750 with the mc lr adsorption capacity 2769 μg mc lr g bc owing to the mechanisms including hydrophobic and π π interaction electrostatic attraction and metal complexation in addition the yield of biochar produced from various biomasses generally ranges from 5 to 40 kb bcs about 40 at 350 c 12 at 550 c 8 at 750 c in this study and the cost of biochar is 1000 cheaper per ton comparted to it of commercial activated carbon 33 thus these results have heightened the strategies for the removal of mc lr

13558,in recent years lithium production has been increasing as a result of the growing market demand salt lake brines are one of the main sources of raw lithium which can be concentrated and purified by natural evaporation this time consuming production causes a loss of around 85 95 of the water contained in the extracted brine in this context new technologies could replace the current process with the aim to improve the water management by recognizing the evaporated water as a critical resource this study proposes a novel fractionation method based on a membrane distillation crystallization process for concentrating and purifying the lithium brine while recovering fresh water synthetic brines containing the major components present in li rich brines were assessed at different temperatures reaching a water flux higher than 3 0 kg m2h at 50 c the process was continuously protracted achieving the fractionation of na and k salts by controlling the supersaturation of the brine and crystallization subsequently the observed water flux for mg brine was 0 22 kg m2h as a result of the water activity decline at high brine concentration 7 0 mol kgh2o moreover thermodynamic speciation simulation supported the potentialities of this process showing the capacity to recover around 95 of the water contained in real brines from salt lakes after three stages of separation overall a conceptual flow sheet of a new membrane based fractional crystallization method was proposed for i the intensification of the brine concentration ii the recovery of water up to 95 iii the brine purification from in presence of major ions i e li na k and mg keywords lithium extraction water recovery membrane distillation crystallization integrated membrane processes lithium salt lake brines 1 introduction the necessity to accelerate the transition of the current energy matrix from fossil fuels to renewable sources is promoting the adoption of various ways to supply and store energy highlighting electric energy as the prominent supply method many countries such as china india united states france germany norway netherlands and united kingdom have implemented policies related to the promotion of electric vehicles ev to reduce the use of the fossil energy sources in motor cars and thereby offering unprecedented opportunities for the broader application of sustainability and renewables in the transport sector 1 on this basis the ev global annual sales is estimated to increase from 2 million vehicles by 2017 to 23 43 million by 2030 1 presently the dominant technology adopted to store energy in order to reach the minimum required level of ev autonomy is based on li ion batteries current li carbonate equivalent lce production is around 400 kt year worldwide increasing up to 900 kt year by 2025 driven by growing ev demand 2 3 particularly chile having 51 of global reserves is one of the main producers of lce worldwide with 29 of total production in 2019 moreover the two li producers in chile i e sqm and albemarle are executing expansion projects to reach a total production over 205 kt year lce by 2025 4 5 therefore the lce production in chile will be duplicated in the short term in this context chile is a key player in the next energetic transition whereas the prominence of li as critical raw material has been recently recognized by both us and eu 6 7 li is currently obtained from two main natural sources 55 from li bearing ores pegmatites and 45 brines extracted from salt lakes salars 4 in chile lce is produced from the li rich atacama salt lake the brine extracted from the salt lake wells is fed into a series of solar evaporation ponds where different components e g ca2 so4 2 na k and mg2 are fractionally eliminated from the brine by evaporative crystallization promoted by solar radiation and wind convection insofar as li must be purified and concentrated from 0 05 wt to 0 2 wt typical li concentration in brines to around 1 0 wt 6 0 wt water evaporation ranges between 85 and 95 of the water contained in the extracted brine 8 11 as shown in fig 1 taking into account the current lce chilean production and making an overall water balance the water lost from brines ranges within 18 000 60 000 m3 day 200 1 400 m3 water per ton of li contained in the extracted brine depending on li concentration in the feed and produced brines these values are expected to duplicate by 2025 according to the expansion plan of involved companies the fact that this process takes place in one of the most arid areas in the world causes several concerns in local communities about the consequences on the water balance of the salt lake particularly regarding the possible impact on aquifers and wetlands downstream of the salt lake 12 13 whereas there are no formal studies showing the quantitative impact of the water evaporation in the salt lake 11 it is reasonable to expect a long term effect given the context of increasing demand for and growth in the production of li and global warming effects moreover the current evaporation process presents additional issues that affects the production performance high residence time 12 24 months depending on local weather conditions which determines high requirement of pond volume and area poor control and very low efficiency of the process due to the fact that crystallization depends on weather conditions loss of energy used to evaporate water into the atmosphere 11 the aforementioned background has encouraged different technology development companies and researchers to rethink the process 14 16 for the selective extraction of li ion from brines such as adsorption on different matrixes solvent extraction using commercial or conventional extractants ionic liquids and li recovery by electrochemical based processes furthermore the study of the application of membrane separation technologies has increased significantly in the last years 17 18 mainly focused on electrodialysis ed and nanofiltration nf for the selective separation of monovalent ions from divalent ions both operations were proposed to remove li ion from brines all these alternative options take into consideration the possibility that the recovered brine without li could be returned into the salt lake although environmental impact has not been studied at date 11 since any technological solution should avoid the addition of non native compounds e g antiscalants ph adjusting agents etc into the salt lake the above mentioned processes might present risks other possible processes with the capacity of recovering fresh water are membrane distillation md 19 21 and hydrate based desalination methods 22 moreover a recent study based on a three stages membrane electrolysis approach presented the possibility to recover water with low dissolved salts contents 23 noteworthy the multi element composition of brines enriched by a wide variety of highly concentrated components presents serious challenges hampering the practical exploration of the above mentioned alternative techniques thus the implementation of novel technologies for the effective selective fractionation of li from brine is a necessity 24 in the absence of a definitive alternative to the evaporation ponds the development of new methods should be highly valued to complement current technological developments membrane distillation crystallization mcr is an innovative and emerging process which synergistically combines md with crystallization mcr intensifies the intrinsic potentialities of both processes on the one hand in absence of osmotic limitations the evaporation of the volatile solvent significantly enhances the volume reduction factor thus leading to a highly concentrated solution on the other hand membranes promote the crystallization of dissolved salts from the supersaturated brine fig 2 mcr removes the solvent from a liquid stream in the form of vapor diffusing through a hydrophobic membrane that works as phase support membrane contactor separating the feed solution and the stripping solution 25 for aqueous solutions the transmembrane flux of water jw is phenomenologically related to the driving force of the mass transfer phenomenon represented by a partial pressure gradient δp 1 j w k δ p where k is the overall mass transfer coefficient of the system that incorporates both internal and external transport resistances the partial pressure gradient is a function of both temperature i e the vapor pressure of the pure water p w 0 and concentration i e the water activity aw 2 δ p p w 0 t f e e d a w c f e e d p w 0 t s t r i p p i n g a w c s t r i p p i n g if the stripping solution also referred as distillate is pure water a w c s t r i p p i n g 1 if vacuum is applied on the stripping side p w 0 t s t r i p p i n g 0 since mcr is operated at relatively low feed temperature typically around 50 70 c its energy demand can be satisfied by waste heat streams or renewable sources geothermal solar etc moreover the use of hollow fiber membrane modules with high specific surface areas results in compact and easily scalable equipment the progressive removal of water determines the supersaturation of dissolved ions contained in the feed solution leading to the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of crystals which can be removed continuously from the treated feed solution 26 31 mcr has been applied for i the treatment of seawater desalination brines recovering salts and increasing the water recovery factor 32 35 ii the extraction of minerals from seawater 36 39 and effluents of shale gas 39 40 and anodizing industry 41 iii the recovery of sodium sulfate from waste effluents 42 45 iv the production of sodium carbonate from co2 streams 46 v the extraction of phosphates from reject water in a dewatering process 47 in this context quist jensen et al 2016 investigated the crystallization of licl from a synthetic solution of pure water and licl 48 the study focused on the impact of concentration and temperature polarization phenomena on the mcr performance interestingly results showed that polarization effect limited the crystallization of licl feed concentration from 6 m to 8 m due to its high solubility and low water activity at high feed concentration allowing the achievement of supersaturation only if applying vacuum on the stripping side however use of vacuum can be impractical from a technological point of view at a large scale due to the high cost associated to vacuum pump and to extra cost related to the condensation of water vapor definitively the high solubility of li salt drastically reduces the water activity hindering the straightforward extraction of li via mcr nevertheless md mcr has emerged as an interesting approach aimed to achieve a rapid and controlled concentration of the brine fulfilling the purpose of an almost total water recovery moreover other salts contained in brine present a lower solubility in comparison with licl offering the prospect of a purification of the brine via a fractional precipitation induced by mcr process overall mcr has the potential to replace the obsolete and time demanding process of solar evaporator ponds ensuring i the intensification of the brine concentration ii the recovery of water iii the purification of the brine form other components than li the present work proposes the implementation of mcr in li extraction from brines lab scale mcr experiments were carried out with synthetic li brines in order to evaluate the efficiency of mcr in terms of water recovery and brine purification to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic study elucidating the effects of the temperature and the composition of the brine on the water flux and on the multi stage fractional crystallization of other dissolved salts i e nacl and kcl thermodynamics simulations were employed for the assessment of the process using real lithium rich brines of different south american salt lakes in addition this is the first study assessing the potential water recovery from li rich brines using a mcr system mimicking the real brines found in salt lakes from south america overall the ambition of this work is to open the door for the advent of fractional mcr in li extraction industry ensuring an outstanding improvement of the efficiency in brine concentration and purification coupled with a high degree of water recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 artificial brines the elemental composition of salt lake brines is highly variable even between different extraction wells in a same salt lake 9 24 table 1 shows an average elemental concentration of different salt lakes located in south america as mentioned before the chilean li production is conducted in the atacama salt lake the most concentrated in terms of total molality mol salt kg h2o mcr tests were carried out using synthetic and simplified brines with the aim of assessing the effect of the main cationic components present in a typical brine i e na k and mg2 on the basis of the typical elemental contents in real brines synthetic brines whose compositions are reported in table 2 were prepared by dissolving licl nacl kcl and mgcl2 6h2o sigma aldrich reagent grade 99 in demineralized water 5 μs cm in addition to weight composition solubility data of the different compounds as a function of temperature are necessary for a proper design of the fractional crystallization process in this regard fig 3 shows the solubility of the main pure salts found in salt lakes brine 1 simulates the feed solution extracted from wells having na and li contents similar to the atacama salt lake brine 2 simulates the concentrated solution exiting from na separation stage and fed to the subsequent k separation stage in this case the tds content was slightly higher than brine 1 since nacl and kcl solubilities are close at ambient temperature fig 3 and na concentration is typically higher than k table 1 brine 3 simulates the solution fed to mg separation stage to be concentrated between 5 8 times to achieve the saturation level of mgcl2 2 2 membrane distillation crystallization tests the mcr prototype assembled at laboratory scale and operated in batch mode is shown in fig 4 the system included a hollow fiber membrane module microdyn nadir md 020 cp 2 n 2 liters tanks for feed and distillate solution two peristaltic pumps cole parmer masterflex model 07518 60 recirculating solutions in counter current flow through the membrane module two thermo regulated baths jeio tech model cw3 10 and model rwe 2025 for heating the feed and cooling the distillate flow using immersed stainless steel coil tubing four thermocouples located at the inlet and outlet of each flow connected to a data logger for temperature registration a balance located below the feed tank was used to register the time dependent variation of weight δw transmembrane flux jv was computed as 3 j v δ w a δ t where a is the membrane surface area and δt is the time interval considered membrane module specifications and operational conditions are reported in table 3 the synthetic brine was circulated through the membrane module up to crystals were formed or in case of brine 3 when the transmembrane water flux declined to zero electric conductivity was measured in the distillate tank hanna instruments model hi98308 at the end of each crystallization test a sample 2 ml of mother liquor was taken from the feed tank crystals filtered and visually inspected by optical microscopy zeiss microscope axiolab all experiments were replicated at least three times 2 3 simulation of potential water recovery from brines simulations of potential water recovery from li rich brines of salt lakes were conducted using the open source geochemical software phreeqc version 3 developed by the usgs 50 with the pitzer data base the database of phreeqc for brines based on chloride previously validated with experimental data 51 was used to estimate the thermodynamic equilibrium of complex solutions i e solubility of each element in li rich brines estimation of activity coefficients was conducted using the pitzer s model included in the same software in addition the phreeqc database was modified to incorporate the thermodynamic data of li carnallite species licl mgcl2 7h2o thermodynamic data were taken and or estimated from different sources solubility constants and enthalpy gradient 52 55 and pitzer s parameters 52 simulations as a function of the percentage of water extracted from each brine were conducted to estimate the equilibrium concentration of each species to support the fractionation stages of the process 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane distillation crystallization tests evaporative tests carried out on brine 1 and brine 2 resulted in substantially stable transmembrane fluxes in undersaturated conditions as shown in fig 5 when the temperature difference δt estimated as the difference between the arithmetic average of inlet and outlet temperatures of feed and distillate streams was raised from 9 c to 27 c the average transmembrane flux increases by 600 from 0 45 to 3 6 kg m2h for brine 1 and by 610 from 0 6 to 3 4 kg m2h for brine 2 the enhancement of transmembrane flux with δt is in agreement with the clausius clapeyron exponential relationship between vapor pressure and temperature on the other hand the average water flux for brine 3 was only 0 22 kg m2h at temperature of 50 c while fig 5 at lower temperature there was no evident water transfer this is a consequence of the high initial solute content in brine 3 35 9 wt compared to brine 1 and brine 2 21 6 wt and 24 3 wt respectively as per table 2 under these circumstances estimation by phreeqc speciation software reveals that the water activity coefficients of brine 1 and brine 2 solutions i e 0 84 and 0 81 respectively are substantially higher than the water activity coefficient for brine 3 i e 0 35 thereby reducing the driving force of the evaporative process eqs 1 and 2 analogously the similarity in tds values for brine 1 and brine 2 reflects the similarity of fluxes for the temperature gradients assessed as a result mcr operations at feed brine temperature of 50 c in na and k separation stages ensured a high rate of brine concentration by removing water at a flux above 3 kg m2h that is one order of magnitude faster than the conventional evaporation ponds where evaporation rates typically range between 0 36 and 0 57 kg m2h 20 these water flux differences can determine an important reduction of equipment installations at industrial scale noteworthy another significant advantage introduced by mcr is the circularity in water management resulting in the production of a distillate with an electric conductivity lower than 20 μs cm thus representing a high quality water exploitable for industrial or human uses conversely mcr at the mg separation stage can recover fresh water with mass transfer rates comparable to natural evaporation although the use of a diluted brine as cooling medium for distillate flow could increase the water flux achieved here this subject will be discussed in section 3 3 the study of park et al 2020 about li enrichment of artificial brine by md 20 reported a transmembrane flux of 22 5 kg m2h i e 6 times higher than values obtained in the present study 3 5 kg m2h at similar feed and distillate temperature 50 c and 20 c respectively although a direct comparison between these two studies is hampered by the differences in operational conditions and process scale 0 00181 m2 membrane surface area versus 0 1 m2 of the present study feed brine composition represents probably the main reason for the different performance 20 in the referenced study the initial brine has tds of 2 84 wt which is around 8 5 12 5 times less than brines assessed in our work as a result a significant reduction in the partial pressure gradient is expected causing the decrease of the driving force and thereby the water flux in the system water recovery trends at different δt values cumulative mass of distillated water per initial water content in feed brine are shown in fig 6 depending on the operational feed temperature from 32 to 50 c brine 1 reached nacl saturation at water recovery in the range of 22 24 and brine 2 reached kcl saturation in the range of 16 20 it is worth nothing that the slope of the plotted curves reflects the variation of the transmembrane flux in time this is of critical importance to assess the alteration of the mcr performance especially after the nucleation of salt crystals that might potentially clog the membrane surface for brine 1 the decline of water flux after the achievement of the nacl saturation point was comprised between 8 5 δt 9 c and 23 δt 27 c suggesting that a higher evaporation rate resulting in a more rapid increment of supersaturation during the batch test leads to a marked deposition of crystals on the membrane surface for brine 2 flux reduction after the beginning of kcl crystallization ranged from 22 δt 9 c to 29 δt 27 c previous investigations suggest that adoption of continuous mcr operations at constant supersaturation level controlled fluid dynamics to move away growing nuclei from membrane surface and to maintain crystals in suspension and continuous removal of solid product from mother liquor by filtration are able to guarantee an appropriate stability to the system 32 the morphology of formed crystals are shown in fig 7 irregular cubic nacl crystals with average size of 900 μm were obtained from brine 1 fig 7a and cubic kcl crystals with average size of around 2000 μm were formed from brine 2 fig 7b this information is relevant in the perspectives of industrial applications to define adequately the type of filtration required to separate crystals as well as their storage and transportation properties in addition the crystal size impacts on the amount of mother liquor entrapped that might lead to particles adhesion shape modification and reduction of crystalline purity for brine 3 after 6 h of operation a dramatic reduction of the instantaneous water recovery was observed before achieving the saturation of mgcl2 or licl thus preventing the crystallization the withdrawal of the driving force was a consequence of the reduction of the water activity by at least 50 once solute content overcame 40 wt also exacerbated by concentration polarization phenomenon over the three fractionation stages of na k and mg investigated separately in stand alone experiments a total water recovery up to 75 sum of dehydration performance of each stage was reached when operating at δt of 27 c fig 6 the barrier to the achievement of higher water recovery is mainly represented by i the high initial tds content of the brines which intrinsically determines a limited water volume available to be transferred before reaching saturation and salt crystallization ii the small driving force to water evaporation for brine 3 determined by its high molality 7 mol kgh2o that results in a feed partial pressure rapidly coming close to that of cold pure water at distillate side however speciation and fractionation of solid phases in multi ion na k mg li solutions mimicking real brines atacama maricunga and caucharí sites demonstrate the capacity to recover around 95 of water at total concentration value around 6 0 mol kgh2o as discussed in the following section 3 2 3 2 simulation of potential water recovery from brines simulation results of the concentration evolution for the main dissolved elements contained in salt lakes are shown in fig 8 under continuous water evaporation at 40 c results consider the output of solid phases in the mass balance when the saturation of a specific salt was achieved in case of atacama salt lake fig 8a the average brine defined by table 1 is saturated for nacl at the beginning of evaporation 0 water extraction whereupon na contents decreased progressively due to crystallization instead the concentration of k and mg increased up to their saturation level around 2 0 mol kgh2o for k and almost 4 0 mol kgh2o for mg at 50 and 82 water extraction respectively then the concentration of both ions decreased due to the crystallization of kcl and potassium carnallite k carnallite kmgcl3 6h2o in case of maricunga and caucharí salt lakes fig 8b and c respectively the tendency of elements concentration was similar to the previous case although na concentration increased up to the saturation level around 6 0 mol kgh2o at 20 and 28 water extraction for maricunga and caucharí respectively for all three cases li was kept dissolved in the brine reaching concentration values closer to 14 mol kgh2o for atacama and maricunga salt lakes and 7 0 mol kgh2o for caucharí salt lake at 99 5 water extraction however precipitation of li carnallite licl mgcl2 7h2o solid phase was predicted at this water extraction value for atacama and maricunga salt lakes as a result of their high mg li mass ratio approaching 6 5 whereas mg li mass ratio in caucharí salt lake was 2 4 an interesting outcome obtained from these simulations is the total concentration value obtained for the three salt lakes after na saturation and before mg saturation a stable value around 6 0 mol kgh2o corresponding to a 95 water recovery this fact is a consequence of the compensation effect between the mass of salts formed and elements progressively concentrated and particularly of the high content of na contained in the brines of salt lakes this result is particularly interesting for mcr process since the driving force to evaporate water could be maintained almost stable until reaching mg crystallization thus ensuring a stable water vapor flux brine 1 and brine 2 defined for mcr tests table 2 had similar concentration values with simulated brine of caucharí salt lake in both cases crystallization of nacl and kcl were achieved around 20 water recovery fig 6a and b agreeing with simulation results in fig 8c where nacl reached the saturation after 25 of water extracted in case of brine 1 water removal reached 40 for a feed brine temperature of 41 c δt 18 c suffering only a moderate decrease in the water recovery slope fig 6a on the other hand the total concentration of 7 07 mol kgh2o defined for brine 3 table 2 was achieved after at least 90 of water extracted hence the last stage of mg removal is not relevant in terms of potential water recovery when compared to na and k separation stages it is necessary to mention that the simulated concentration profiles for 30 c and 50 c were not shown due to their substantial similarity to those obtained at 40 c in terms of elemental concentration in the brine with respect to water extraction 3 3 proposed flow sheet for membrane fractionation process according to results shown in fig 8 the progressive water extraction from brines promotes the sequential crystallization of salts based on their solubility in a multicomponent system on this premise a fractionation process based on multiple mcr stages is proposed where each stage is designed for removing a specific salt the potential water recovery of each mcr stage for the three li rich brines atacama maricunga caucharí assessed at 30 c 40 c and 50 c is shown in fig 9 each stage is fed with the brine saturated for its specific salt these results are presented defining the li concentration at 4 0 wt in the concentrated brine produced in order to minimize the losses of li by the generation of li carnallite potential water recovery attains 80 and 90 for maricunga and caucharí salt lakes in the first stage of halite nacl formation while a 50 recovery is reached in atacama salt lake where the initial total concentration is higher than 6 0 mol kgh2o and near to the saturation point of halite however the potential to extract fresh water from brines with a 50 recovery in the first stage of the process is promising when taking into account the current process used at industrial scale fig 1 in general slight differences with respect to the temperature are foreseen for all brines in the k separation stage the three salt lake brines reached 95 water recovery until attaining k carnallite kmgcl3 6h2o saturation overall exhibiting a similar total molality salts removal in each mcr stage for the three salt lake brines at different temperatures is exemplified in fig 10 in all cases both nacl and kcl are almost completely removed after the k carnallite stage moreover the mg removal is higher than 95 in atacama and maricunga salt lakes brine while it is lower than 80 in caucahrí salt lake brine where crystallization of bischofite mgcl2 6h2o or li carnallite licl mgcl2 7h2o does not occur when the produced li brine reaches 4 0 wt under similar mg li ratio 6 4 and 6 5 for atacama and maricunga respectively the li concentration set in the produced concentrated brine defines the number of mcr fractionation stages required because of higher li content in atacama salt lake with respect to maricunga table 1 li concentration reaches 4 0 wt in the third stage where k carnallite is being generated avoiding li precipitation by generation of li carnallite on the other hand in the case of maricunga five stages are needed to reach 4 0 wt li in the final concentation brine including the li carnallite stage where a part of li is precipitated the enhancement of li carnallite generation at higher temperature is in accordance with literature 52 55 an economic evaluation of li losses with respect to final li concentration in the produced brine is therefore recommended to maximize the li recovery taking into account the experimental results on mcr for different brines and the simulation of potential water recovery and salts removal a conceptual flow sheet of a membrane based fractionation process for enrichment of li in salt lake brines lisa process is proposed in fig 11 this process includes a dedicated stage to remove a specific salt simultaneously recovering water according to the following sequence stage 1 halite stage 2 sylvinite stage 3 k carnallite stage 4 bischofite stage 5 li carnallite in the first three stages pure water is used to condense water vapor at the distillate side of mcr according to simulation results the overall water recovery can reach up to 95 as discussed before the inclusion of stages 4 and 5 depends on the brine characteristics and the targeted li concentration in the produced brine if these last stages are included it is necessary to circulate brine at the distillate side having a lower activity than pure water in order to adequately sustain the water vapor transfer from a high concentrated brine the diluted brine resulting from the last two stages is returned into the salt lake or recycled back to lisa process according to fig 3 the solubility of all salts involved in salt lake brines increases with temperature but the slope of nacl solubility is lower with respect to the others salts this fact allows proposing that lisa stage 1 is operated at high temperature in order to maximize the water flux while subsequent stages can be fed at the outlet temperature of the previous stage thus decreasing salt solubility in this regard the last two stages bischofite and li carnallite can be operated as a thermo osmotic mcr where both temperature and activity gradients synergistically act as driving force to mass transfer the energy required by lisa to evaporate water is similar to the current pond evaporation process since both methods operates at low temperature below 50 c taking into account the heat of vaporization of water of 2 400 kj kg a transmembrane flux of 3 0 kg m2h at feed temperature of 50 c and a water recovery of 75 the specific energy consumption sec approaches to 470 kw h ton brine without heat recovery this is substantially in line with sec values observed in solar desalination by membrane distillation 56 the lisa approach considers the use of sun energy to heat the brine as is currently done in the evaporation ponds in this regard the thermal energy input could be provided by conventional thermo solar panels overall the fractionation approach to treat hypersaline solutions supported by a thermodynamic analysis proposed here can be a useful tool to move forward the mcr process to the industrial application particularly for complex solutions in terms of components variability 4 conclusions in this study lab scale experimental tests and speciation modelling aimed at estimating the performance of a multi stage fractionation process based on membrane crystallization mcr for the production of li enriched salt lake brines three synthetic brines were assessed simulating different stages of the major elements separation na k and mg measured transmembrane water fluxes were in the range of 0 5 3 5 kg m2h for na and k brines average feed temperature of 32 50 c δt of 9 27 c i e at least 5 10 times higher than the current evaporation rates found in salt lakes mcr tests protracted until reaching the solubility limits of nacl and kcl resulted in the production of correspondent salt crystals on the other hand the highest water flux observed when processing concentrated mg and li brine was 0 22 kg m2h at average feed temperature of 50 c δt of 27 c due to the low water activity associated to the hyperconcentrated brine 7 0 mol kgh2o that reduced the driving force to the transport of vapor across the membrane taking into account these results the total fresh water recovery reached by a sequential mcr process could be at least 75 at 50 c in the feed brine thermodynamic simulations carried out by phreeqc software using the ionic composition of three salt lake brines atacama maricunga and caucharí as input predicted a potential water recovery higher than 50 in the first stage of halite nacl crystallization furthermore the potential water recovery reaches about 95 after sequential halite sylvinite kcl and k carnallite kmgcl3 6h2o fractionation stages according with these results a conceptual flow sheet of a fractionation method for recovering water crystallizing salts and enriching li brines based on sequential stages of mcr was proposed lisa process definitively lisa process was found to be beneficial to intensify the process of concentration and purification of the brine and to simultaneously recovery the evaporated water this alternative technology to the current evaporation ponds of lithium rich brines from salt lakes can support additional sustainable development in this high demand industry this study has proposed a feasible process engineering approach supported by an experimental and speciation simulation methodology to move forward with an industrial application of mcr process in complex multicomponent systems future studies will be needed to move forward this promising approach to the industrial application but there is an interesting

13558,in recent years lithium production has been increasing as a result of the growing market demand salt lake brines are one of the main sources of raw lithium which can be concentrated and purified by natural evaporation this time consuming production causes a loss of around 85 95 of the water contained in the extracted brine in this context new technologies could replace the current process with the aim to improve the water management by recognizing the evaporated water as a critical resource this study proposes a novel fractionation method based on a membrane distillation crystallization process for concentrating and purifying the lithium brine while recovering fresh water synthetic brines containing the major components present in li rich brines were assessed at different temperatures reaching a water flux higher than 3 0 kg m2h at 50 c the process was continuously protracted achieving the fractionation of na and k salts by controlling the supersaturation of the brine and crystallization subsequently the observed water flux for mg brine was 0 22 kg m2h as a result of the water activity decline at high brine concentration 7 0 mol kgh2o moreover thermodynamic speciation simulation supported the potentialities of this process showing the capacity to recover around 95 of the water contained in real brines from salt lakes after three stages of separation overall a conceptual flow sheet of a new membrane based fractional crystallization method was proposed for i the intensification of the brine concentration ii the recovery of water up to 95 iii the brine purification from in presence of major ions i e li na k and mg keywords lithium extraction water recovery membrane distillation crystallization integrated membrane processes lithium salt lake brines 1 introduction the necessity to accelerate the transition of the current energy matrix from fossil fuels to renewable sources is promoting the adoption of various ways to supply and store energy highlighting electric energy as the prominent supply method many countries such as china india united states france germany norway netherlands and united kingdom have implemented policies related to the promotion of electric vehicles ev to reduce the use of the fossil energy sources in motor cars and thereby offering unprecedented opportunities for the broader application of sustainability and renewables in the transport sector 1 on this basis the ev global annual sales is estimated to increase from 2 million vehicles by 2017 to 23 43 million by 2030 1 presently the dominant technology adopted to store energy in order to reach the minimum required level of ev autonomy is based on li ion batteries current li carbonate equivalent lce production is around 400 kt year worldwide increasing up to 900 kt year by 2025 driven by growing ev demand 2 3 particularly chile having 51 of global reserves is one of the main producers of lce worldwide with 29 of total production in 2019 moreover the two li producers in chile i e sqm and albemarle are executing expansion projects to reach a total production over 205 kt year lce by 2025 4 5 therefore the lce production in chile will be duplicated in the short term in this context chile is a key player in the next energetic transition whereas the prominence of li as critical raw material has been recently recognized by both us and eu 6 7 li is currently obtained from two main natural sources 55 from li bearing ores pegmatites and 45 brines extracted from salt lakes salars 4 in chile lce is produced from the li rich atacama salt lake the brine extracted from the salt lake wells is fed into a series of solar evaporation ponds where different components e g ca2 so4 2 na k and mg2 are fractionally eliminated from the brine by evaporative crystallization promoted by solar radiation and wind convection insofar as li must be purified and concentrated from 0 05 wt to 0 2 wt typical li concentration in brines to around 1 0 wt 6 0 wt water evaporation ranges between 85 and 95 of the water contained in the extracted brine 8 11 as shown in fig 1 taking into account the current lce chilean production and making an overall water balance the water lost from brines ranges within 18 000 60 000 m3 day 200 1 400 m3 water per ton of li contained in the extracted brine depending on li concentration in the feed and produced brines these values are expected to duplicate by 2025 according to the expansion plan of involved companies the fact that this process takes place in one of the most arid areas in the world causes several concerns in local communities about the consequences on the water balance of the salt lake particularly regarding the possible impact on aquifers and wetlands downstream of the salt lake 12 13 whereas there are no formal studies showing the quantitative impact of the water evaporation in the salt lake 11 it is reasonable to expect a long term effect given the context of increasing demand for and growth in the production of li and global warming effects moreover the current evaporation process presents additional issues that affects the production performance high residence time 12 24 months depending on local weather conditions which determines high requirement of pond volume and area poor control and very low efficiency of the process due to the fact that crystallization depends on weather conditions loss of energy used to evaporate water into the atmosphere 11 the aforementioned background has encouraged different technology development companies and researchers to rethink the process 14 16 for the selective extraction of li ion from brines such as adsorption on different matrixes solvent extraction using commercial or conventional extractants ionic liquids and li recovery by electrochemical based processes furthermore the study of the application of membrane separation technologies has increased significantly in the last years 17 18 mainly focused on electrodialysis ed and nanofiltration nf for the selective separation of monovalent ions from divalent ions both operations were proposed to remove li ion from brines all these alternative options take into consideration the possibility that the recovered brine without li could be returned into the salt lake although environmental impact has not been studied at date 11 since any technological solution should avoid the addition of non native compounds e g antiscalants ph adjusting agents etc into the salt lake the above mentioned processes might present risks other possible processes with the capacity of recovering fresh water are membrane distillation md 19 21 and hydrate based desalination methods 22 moreover a recent study based on a three stages membrane electrolysis approach presented the possibility to recover water with low dissolved salts contents 23 noteworthy the multi element composition of brines enriched by a wide variety of highly concentrated components presents serious challenges hampering the practical exploration of the above mentioned alternative techniques thus the implementation of novel technologies for the effective selective fractionation of li from brine is a necessity 24 in the absence of a definitive alternative to the evaporation ponds the development of new methods should be highly valued to complement current technological developments membrane distillation crystallization mcr is an innovative and emerging process which synergistically combines md with crystallization mcr intensifies the intrinsic potentialities of both processes on the one hand in absence of osmotic limitations the evaporation of the volatile solvent significantly enhances the volume reduction factor thus leading to a highly concentrated solution on the other hand membranes promote the crystallization of dissolved salts from the supersaturated brine fig 2 mcr removes the solvent from a liquid stream in the form of vapor diffusing through a hydrophobic membrane that works as phase support membrane contactor separating the feed solution and the stripping solution 25 for aqueous solutions the transmembrane flux of water jw is phenomenologically related to the driving force of the mass transfer phenomenon represented by a partial pressure gradient δp 1 j w k δ p where k is the overall mass transfer coefficient of the system that incorporates both internal and external transport resistances the partial pressure gradient is a function of both temperature i e the vapor pressure of the pure water p w 0 and concentration i e the water activity aw 2 δ p p w 0 t f e e d a w c f e e d p w 0 t s t r i p p i n g a w c s t r i p p i n g if the stripping solution also referred as distillate is pure water a w c s t r i p p i n g 1 if vacuum is applied on the stripping side p w 0 t s t r i p p i n g 0 since mcr is operated at relatively low feed temperature typically around 50 70 c its energy demand can be satisfied by waste heat streams or renewable sources geothermal solar etc moreover the use of hollow fiber membrane modules with high specific surface areas results in compact and easily scalable equipment the progressive removal of water determines the supersaturation of dissolved ions contained in the feed solution leading to the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of crystals which can be removed continuously from the treated feed solution 26 31 mcr has been applied for i the treatment of seawater desalination brines recovering salts and increasing the water recovery factor 32 35 ii the extraction of minerals from seawater 36 39 and effluents of shale gas 39 40 and anodizing industry 41 iii the recovery of sodium sulfate from waste effluents 42 45 iv the production of sodium carbonate from co2 streams 46 v the extraction of phosphates from reject water in a dewatering process 47 in this context quist jensen et al 2016 investigated the crystallization of licl from a synthetic solution of pure water and licl 48 the study focused on the impact of concentration and temperature polarization phenomena on the mcr performance interestingly results showed that polarization effect limited the crystallization of licl feed concentration from 6 m to 8 m due to its high solubility and low water activity at high feed concentration allowing the achievement of supersaturation only if applying vacuum on the stripping side however use of vacuum can be impractical from a technological point of view at a large scale due to the high cost associated to vacuum pump and to extra cost related to the condensation of water vapor definitively the high solubility of li salt drastically reduces the water activity hindering the straightforward extraction of li via mcr nevertheless md mcr has emerged as an interesting approach aimed to achieve a rapid and controlled concentration of the brine fulfilling the purpose of an almost total water recovery moreover other salts contained in brine present a lower solubility in comparison with licl offering the prospect of a purification of the brine via a fractional precipitation induced by mcr process overall mcr has the potential to replace the obsolete and time demanding process of solar evaporator ponds ensuring i the intensification of the brine concentration ii the recovery of water iii the purification of the brine form other components than li the present work proposes the implementation of mcr in li extraction from brines lab scale mcr experiments were carried out with synthetic li brines in order to evaluate the efficiency of mcr in terms of water recovery and brine purification to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic study elucidating the effects of the temperature and the composition of the brine on the water flux and on the multi stage fractional crystallization of other dissolved salts i e nacl and kcl thermodynamics simulations were employed for the assessment of the process using real lithium rich brines of different south american salt lakes in addition this is the first study assessing the potential water recovery from li rich brines using a mcr system mimicking the real brines found in salt lakes from south america overall the ambition of this work is to open the door for the advent of fractional mcr in li extraction industry ensuring an outstanding improvement of the efficiency in brine concentration and purification coupled with a high degree of water recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 artificial brines the elemental composition of salt lake brines is highly variable even between different extraction wells in a same salt lake 9 24 table 1 shows an average elemental concentration of different salt lakes located in south america as mentioned before the chilean li production is conducted in the atacama salt lake the most concentrated in terms of total molality mol salt kg h2o mcr tests were carried out using synthetic and simplified brines with the aim of assessing the effect of the main cationic components present in a typical brine i e na k and mg2 on the basis of the typical elemental contents in real brines synthetic brines whose compositions are reported in table 2 were prepared by dissolving licl nacl kcl and mgcl2 6h2o sigma aldrich reagent grade 99 in demineralized water 5 μs cm in addition to weight composition solubility data of the different compounds as a function of temperature are necessary for a proper design of the fractional crystallization process in this regard fig 3 shows the solubility of the main pure salts found in salt lakes brine 1 simulates the feed solution extracted from wells having na and li contents similar to the atacama salt lake brine 2 simulates the concentrated solution exiting from na separation stage and fed to the subsequent k separation stage in this case the tds content was slightly higher than brine 1 since nacl and kcl solubilities are close at ambient temperature fig 3 and na concentration is typically higher than k table 1 brine 3 simulates the solution fed to mg separation stage to be concentrated between 5 8 times to achieve the saturation level of mgcl2 2 2 membrane distillation crystallization tests the mcr prototype assembled at laboratory scale and operated in batch mode is shown in fig 4 the system included a hollow fiber membrane module microdyn nadir md 020 cp 2 n 2 liters tanks for feed and distillate solution two peristaltic pumps cole parmer masterflex model 07518 60 recirculating solutions in counter current flow through the membrane module two thermo regulated baths jeio tech model cw3 10 and model rwe 2025 for heating the feed and cooling the distillate flow using immersed stainless steel coil tubing four thermocouples located at the inlet and outlet of each flow connected to a data logger for temperature registration a balance located below the feed tank was used to register the time dependent variation of weight δw transmembrane flux jv was computed as 3 j v δ w a δ t where a is the membrane surface area and δt is the time interval considered membrane module specifications and operational conditions are reported in table 3 the synthetic brine was circulated through the membrane module up to crystals were formed or in case of brine 3 when the transmembrane water flux declined to zero electric conductivity was measured in the distillate tank hanna instruments model hi98308 at the end of each crystallization test a sample 2 ml of mother liquor was taken from the feed tank crystals filtered and visually inspected by optical microscopy zeiss microscope axiolab all experiments were replicated at least three times 2 3 simulation of potential water recovery from brines simulations of potential water recovery from li rich brines of salt lakes were conducted using the open source geochemical software phreeqc version 3 developed by the usgs 50 with the pitzer data base the database of phreeqc for brines based on chloride previously validated with experimental data 51 was used to estimate the thermodynamic equilibrium of complex solutions i e solubility of each element in li rich brines estimation of activity coefficients was conducted using the pitzer s model included in the same software in addition the phreeqc database was modified to incorporate the thermodynamic data of li carnallite species licl mgcl2 7h2o thermodynamic data were taken and or estimated from different sources solubility constants and enthalpy gradient 52 55 and pitzer s parameters 52 simulations as a function of the percentage of water extracted from each brine were conducted to estimate the equilibrium concentration of each species to support the fractionation stages of the process 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane distillation crystallization tests evaporative tests carried out on brine 1 and brine 2 resulted in substantially stable transmembrane fluxes in undersaturated conditions as shown in fig 5 when the temperature difference δt estimated as the difference between the arithmetic average of inlet and outlet temperatures of feed and distillate streams was raised from 9 c to 27 c the average transmembrane flux increases by 600 from 0 45 to 3 6 kg m2h for brine 1 and by 610 from 0 6 to 3 4 kg m2h for brine 2 the enhancement of transmembrane flux with δt is in agreement with the clausius clapeyron exponential relationship between vapor pressure and temperature on the other hand the average water flux for brine 3 was only 0 22 kg m2h at temperature of 50 c while fig 5 at lower temperature there was no evident water transfer this is a consequence of the high initial solute content in brine 3 35 9 wt compared to brine 1 and brine 2 21 6 wt and 24 3 wt respectively as per table 2 under these circumstances estimation by phreeqc speciation software reveals that the water activity coefficients of brine 1 and brine 2 solutions i e 0 84 and 0 81 respectively are substantially higher than the water activity coefficient for brine 3 i e 0 35 thereby reducing the driving force of the evaporative process eqs 1 and 2 analogously the similarity in tds values for brine 1 and brine 2 reflects the similarity of fluxes for the temperature gradients assessed as a result mcr operations at feed brine temperature of 50 c in na and k separation stages ensured a high rate of brine concentration by removing water at a flux above 3 kg m2h that is one order of magnitude faster than the conventional evaporation ponds where evaporation rates typically range between 0 36 and 0 57 kg m2h 20 these water flux differences can determine an important reduction of equipment installations at industrial scale noteworthy another significant advantage introduced by mcr is the circularity in water management resulting in the production of a distillate with an electric conductivity lower than 20 μs cm thus representing a high quality water exploitable for industrial or human uses conversely mcr at the mg separation stage can recover fresh water with mass transfer rates comparable to natural evaporation although the use of a diluted brine as cooling medium for distillate flow could increase the water flux achieved here this subject will be discussed in section 3 3 the study of park et al 2020 about li enrichment of artificial brine by md 20 reported a transmembrane flux of 22 5 kg m2h i e 6 times higher than values obtained in the present study 3 5 kg m2h at similar feed and distillate temperature 50 c and 20 c respectively although a direct comparison between these two studies is hampered by the differences in operational conditions and process scale 0 00181 m2 membrane surface area versus 0 1 m2 of the present study feed brine composition represents probably the main reason for the different performance 20 in the referenced study the initial brine has tds of 2 84 wt which is around 8 5 12 5 times less than brines assessed in our work as a result a significant reduction in the partial pressure gradient is expected causing the decrease of the driving force and thereby the water flux in the system water recovery trends at different δt values cumulative mass of distillated water per initial water content in feed brine are shown in fig 6 depending on the operational feed temperature from 32 to 50 c brine 1 reached nacl saturation at water recovery in the range of 22 24 and brine 2 reached kcl saturation in the range of 16 20 it is worth nothing that the slope of the plotted curves reflects the variation of the transmembrane flux in time this is of critical importance to assess the alteration of the mcr performance especially after the nucleation of salt crystals that might potentially clog the membrane surface for brine 1 the decline of water flux after the achievement of the nacl saturation point was comprised between 8 5 δt 9 c and 23 δt 27 c suggesting that a higher evaporation rate resulting in a more rapid increment of supersaturation during the batch test leads to a marked deposition of crystals on the membrane surface for brine 2 flux reduction after the beginning of kcl crystallization ranged from 22 δt 9 c to 29 δt 27 c previous investigations suggest that adoption of continuous mcr operations at constant supersaturation level controlled fluid dynamics to move away growing nuclei from membrane surface and to maintain crystals in suspension and continuous removal of solid product from mother liquor by filtration are able to guarantee an appropriate stability to the system 32 the morphology of formed crystals are shown in fig 7 irregular cubic nacl crystals with average size of 900 μm were obtained from brine 1 fig 7a and cubic kcl crystals with average size of around 2000 μm were formed from brine 2 fig 7b this information is relevant in the perspectives of industrial applications to define adequately the type of filtration required to separate crystals as well as their storage and transportation properties in addition the crystal size impacts on the amount of mother liquor entrapped that might lead to particles adhesion shape modification and reduction of crystalline purity for brine 3 after 6 h of operation a dramatic reduction of the instantaneous water recovery was observed before achieving the saturation of mgcl2 or licl thus preventing the crystallization the withdrawal of the driving force was a consequence of the reduction of the water activity by at least 50 once solute content overcame 40 wt also exacerbated by concentration polarization phenomenon over the three fractionation stages of na k and mg investigated separately in stand alone experiments a total water recovery up to 75 sum of dehydration performance of each stage was reached when operating at δt of 27 c fig 6 the barrier to the achievement of higher water recovery is mainly represented by i the high initial tds content of the brines which intrinsically determines a limited water volume available to be transferred before reaching saturation and salt crystallization ii the small driving force to water evaporation for brine 3 determined by its high molality 7 mol kgh2o that results in a feed partial pressure rapidly coming close to that of cold pure water at distillate side however speciation and fractionation of solid phases in multi ion na k mg li solutions mimicking real brines atacama maricunga and caucharí sites demonstrate the capacity to recover around 95 of water at total concentration value around 6 0 mol kgh2o as discussed in the following section 3 2 3 2 simulation of potential water recovery from brines simulation results of the concentration evolution for the main dissolved elements contained in salt lakes are shown in fig 8 under continuous water evaporation at 40 c results consider the output of solid phases in the mass balance when the saturation of a specific salt was achieved in case of atacama salt lake fig 8a the average brine defined by table 1 is saturated for nacl at the beginning of evaporation 0 water extraction whereupon na contents decreased progressively due to crystallization instead the concentration of k and mg increased up to their saturation level around 2 0 mol kgh2o for k and almost 4 0 mol kgh2o for mg at 50 and 82 water extraction respectively then the concentration of both ions decreased due to the crystallization of kcl and potassium carnallite k carnallite kmgcl3 6h2o in case of maricunga and caucharí salt lakes fig 8b and c respectively the tendency of elements concentration was similar to the previous case although na concentration increased up to the saturation level around 6 0 mol kgh2o at 20 and 28 water extraction for maricunga and caucharí respectively for all three cases li was kept dissolved in the brine reaching concentration values closer to 14 mol kgh2o for atacama and maricunga salt lakes and 7 0 mol kgh2o for caucharí salt lake at 99 5 water extraction however precipitation of li carnallite licl mgcl2 7h2o solid phase was predicted at this water extraction value for atacama and maricunga salt lakes as a result of their high mg li mass ratio approaching 6 5 whereas mg li mass ratio in caucharí salt lake was 2 4 an interesting outcome obtained from these simulations is the total concentration value obtained for the three salt lakes after na saturation and before mg saturation a stable value around 6 0 mol kgh2o corresponding to a 95 water recovery this fact is a consequence of the compensation effect between the mass of salts formed and elements progressively concentrated and particularly of the high content of na contained in the brines of salt lakes this result is particularly interesting for mcr process since the driving force to evaporate water could be maintained almost stable until reaching mg crystallization thus ensuring a stable water vapor flux brine 1 and brine 2 defined for mcr tests table 2 had similar concentration values with simulated brine of caucharí salt lake in both cases crystallization of nacl and kcl were achieved around 20 water recovery fig 6a and b agreeing with simulation results in fig 8c where nacl reached the saturation after 25 of water extracted in case of brine 1 water removal reached 40 for a feed brine temperature of 41 c δt 18 c suffering only a moderate decrease in the water recovery slope fig 6a on the other hand the total concentration of 7 07 mol kgh2o defined for brine 3 table 2 was achieved after at least 90 of water extracted hence the last stage of mg removal is not relevant in terms of potential water recovery when compared to na and k separation stages it is necessary to mention that the simulated concentration profiles for 30 c and 50 c were not shown due to their substantial similarity to those obtained at 40 c in terms of elemental concentration in the brine with respect to water extraction 3 3 proposed flow sheet for membrane fractionation process according to results shown in fig 8 the progressive water extraction from brines promotes the sequential crystallization of salts based on their solubility in a multicomponent system on this premise a fractionation process based on multiple mcr stages is proposed where each stage is designed for removing a specific salt the potential water recovery of each mcr stage for the three li rich brines atacama maricunga caucharí assessed at 30 c 40 c and 50 c is shown in fig 9 each stage is fed with the brine saturated for its specific salt these results are presented defining the li concentration at 4 0 wt in the concentrated brine produced in order to minimize the losses of li by the generation of li carnallite potential water recovery attains 80 and 90 for maricunga and caucharí salt lakes in the first stage of halite nacl formation while a 50 recovery is reached in atacama salt lake where the initial total concentration is higher than 6 0 mol kgh2o and near to the saturation point of halite however the potential to extract fresh water from brines with a 50 recovery in the first stage of the process is promising when taking into account the current process used at industrial scale fig 1 in general slight differences with respect to the temperature are foreseen for all brines in the k separation stage the three salt lake brines reached 95 water recovery until attaining k carnallite kmgcl3 6h2o saturation overall exhibiting a similar total molality salts removal in each mcr stage for the three salt lake brines at different temperatures is exemplified in fig 10 in all cases both nacl and kcl are almost completely removed after the k carnallite stage moreover the mg removal is higher than 95 in atacama and maricunga salt lakes brine while it is lower than 80 in caucahrí salt lake brine where crystallization of bischofite mgcl2 6h2o or li carnallite licl mgcl2 7h2o does not occur when the produced li brine reaches 4 0 wt under similar mg li ratio 6 4 and 6 5 for atacama and maricunga respectively the li concentration set in the produced concentrated brine defines the number of mcr fractionation stages required because of higher li content in atacama salt lake with respect to maricunga table 1 li concentration reaches 4 0 wt in the third stage where k carnallite is being generated avoiding li precipitation by generation of li carnallite on the other hand in the case of maricunga five stages are needed to reach 4 0 wt li in the final concentation brine including the li carnallite stage where a part of li is precipitated the enhancement of li carnallite generation at higher temperature is in accordance with literature 52 55 an economic evaluation of li losses with respect to final li concentration in the produced brine is therefore recommended to maximize the li recovery taking into account the experimental results on mcr for different brines and the simulation of potential water recovery and salts removal a conceptual flow sheet of a membrane based fractionation process for enrichment of li in salt lake brines lisa process is proposed in fig 11 this process includes a dedicated stage to remove a specific salt simultaneously recovering water according to the following sequence stage 1 halite stage 2 sylvinite stage 3 k carnallite stage 4 bischofite stage 5 li carnallite in the first three stages pure water is used to condense water vapor at the distillate side of mcr according to simulation results the overall water recovery can reach up to 95 as discussed before the inclusion of stages 4 and 5 depends on the brine characteristics and the targeted li concentration in the produced brine if these last stages are included it is necessary to circulate brine at the distillate side having a lower activity than pure water in order to adequately sustain the water vapor transfer from a high concentrated brine the diluted brine resulting from the last two stages is returned into the salt lake or recycled back to lisa process according to fig 3 the solubility of all salts involved in salt lake brines increases with temperature but the slope of nacl solubility is lower with respect to the others salts this fact allows proposing that lisa stage 1 is operated at high temperature in order to maximize the water flux while subsequent stages can be fed at the outlet temperature of the previous stage thus decreasing salt solubility in this regard the last two stages bischofite and li carnallite can be operated as a thermo osmotic mcr where both temperature and activity gradients synergistically act as driving force to mass transfer the energy required by lisa to evaporate water is similar to the current pond evaporation process since both methods operates at low temperature below 50 c taking into account the heat of vaporization of water of 2 400 kj kg a transmembrane flux of 3 0 kg m2h at feed temperature of 50 c and a water recovery of 75 the specific energy consumption sec approaches to 470 kw h ton brine without heat recovery this is substantially in line with sec values observed in solar desalination by membrane distillation 56 the lisa approach considers the use of sun energy to heat the brine as is currently done in the evaporation ponds in this regard the thermal energy input could be provided by conventional thermo solar panels overall the fractionation approach to treat hypersaline solutions supported by a thermodynamic analysis proposed here can be a useful tool to move forward the mcr process to the industrial application particularly for complex solutions in terms of components variability 4 conclusions in this study lab scale experimental tests and speciation modelling aimed at estimating the performance of a multi stage fractionation process based on membrane crystallization mcr for the production of li enriched salt lake brines three synthetic brines were assessed simulating different stages of the major elements separation na k and mg measured transmembrane water fluxes were in the range of 0 5 3 5 kg m2h for na and k brines average feed temperature of 32 50 c δt of 9 27 c i e at least 5 10 times higher than the current evaporation rates found in salt lakes mcr tests protracted until reaching the solubility limits of nacl and kcl resulted in the production of correspondent salt crystals on the other hand the highest water flux observed when processing concentrated mg and li brine was 0 22 kg m2h at average feed temperature of 50 c δt of 27 c due to the low water activity associated to the hyperconcentrated brine 7 0 mol kgh2o that reduced the driving force to the transport of vapor across the membrane taking into account these results the total fresh water recovery reached by a sequential mcr process could be at least 75 at 50 c in the feed brine thermodynamic simulations carried out by phreeqc software using the ionic composition of three salt lake brines atacama maricunga and caucharí as input predicted a potential water recovery higher than 50 in the first stage of halite nacl crystallization furthermore the potential water recovery reaches about 95 after sequential halite sylvinite kcl and k carnallite kmgcl3 6h2o fractionation stages according with these results a conceptual flow sheet of a fractionation method for recovering water crystallizing salts and enriching li brines based on sequential stages of mcr was proposed lisa process definitively lisa process was found to be beneficial to intensify the process of concentration and purification of the brine and to simultaneously recovery the evaporated water this alternative technology to the current evaporation ponds of lithium rich brines from salt lakes can support additional sustainable development in this high demand industry this study has proposed a feasible process engineering approach supported by an experimental and speciation simulation methodology to move forward with an

13559,clathrate hydrates are gaining interest in their applications in the area of energy and the environment they are also being considered for recovering clean water from brackish water seawater wastewater and industrial effluents water reclamation via clathrate hydrate is based on the formation separation and dissociation of hydrate crystals devoid of salt and metal ions from saline wastewater a comprehensive review of studies undertaken to date on the application of clathrate hydrates as promising carrier for water desalination treatment is presented both fundamental and technological advancements in the clathrate hydrate technology are reported to establish its feasibility and potential for producing quality water from waste effluents the hydrate forming agent and kinetic promoters have been found to be important factors for faster hydrate formation and subsequent water recovery several developments towards novel reactor design efficient separation washing methods hybrid hydrate membrane processes multi functional devices etc present a strong case for considering the clathrate hydrate technique as an available alternative for water reclamation in near future keywords clathrate gas hydrate water reclamation desalination hydrate former 1 introduction increasing global population and standard of living pathways have generated immense pressures on water resources and affected their quality and availability groundwater supplies are diminishing with an estimated 20 of the world s aquifers being over exploited leading to acute water scarcity while non conventional methods like desalination of seawater brackish water are being exploited recovery of quality water from wastewater and or saline effluents can supplement this demand over the years various prominent wastewater treatment strategies like thermal methods evaporation crystallization membrane techniques reverse osmosis electrodialysis and biological methods aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation have been practiced to reclaim quality water however energy consumption of these wastewater treatment techniques becomes significant in the presence of various contaminants e g dissolved salts metal ions etc in effluent there is still a need to identify alternative approaches for water reclamation with emphasis on further reducing energy demand coupled with enhanced water recovery in this context clathrate hydrate based technology offers a potential alternative to treat wastewater containing dissolved minerals and heavy metals in recent years 1 3 also hydrate based techniques have been shown more promising over the membrane and thermal based conventional desalination methods to treat ultra high salinity water 4 this work describes advances in clathrate hydrate technology as an alternative source for water reclamation from saline and industrial wastewater clathrate hydrates are a non stoichiometric crystalline class of inclusion compounds in which molecules of one component i e a guest is enclosed within a crystal structure framework of host water molecules 5 the guest molecule normally referred to as clathrate former for most practical purposes is a gas with water as a host molecule the structure is also referred to as a gas hydrate there has been an increased interest in potential applications of clathrate hydrates for concentrating aqueous fluids 6 7 energy recovery 8 desalination 2 3 9 gas storage 10 and separation 11 12 depending upon the type of guest molecule hydrates show three different crystal structures structure i si 512 51262 structure ii sii 512 51264 and structure h sh 512 435664 51268 as shown in fig 1 each structure consists of cages of different sizes and shapes stabilized by van der walls forces hydrate formation is characterized by low temperature and corresponding pressures depending on the former generally only one former molecule is occluded within each cage resulting in single cage occupancy for all three structures 13 however under high application pressures multiple cage occupancy with small formers e g hydrogen has also been reported 14 some common si clathrate hydrate formers include methane ethane and carbon dioxide co2 whereas nitrogen propane and iso butane are among the sii hydrate formers the number of moles of hydrated water per mole of encaged former gas is known as hydration number n w different formers hold different numbers of water molecules based on their structure and formation conditions this feature of hydration makes them suitable for water treatment applications hydrates can exist at a temperature below as well as above the freezing point of water 15 clathrate hydrate based water treatment is carried out by forming hydrate crystals based on suitable pressure and temperature p t conditions under which these crystals form fig 2 represents the typical phase diagram of any hydrate as a function of p t it is observed from the hydrate phase boundary curve that on increasing temperature the equilibrium pressures increase such a broad range of operating p t conditions corresponding to hydrate formation can be advantageous from an operational flexibility viewpoint the hydrate formation and stability region is indicated by the shaded area which corresponds to a lower temperature and higher pressure than hydrate phase boundary p t it is apparent that for stable hydrate formation the operating pressures at a given temperature should be higher and temperature at a fixed pressure should be lower than that of equilibrium p t hydrate dissociation can be attained by inverting the hydrate stability conditions i e increasing temperature heating and decreasing pressure depressurization in appearance hydrates are ice like structures wherein the water solidifies as hydrate cages at a temperature well above the freezing point of water subjected to a suitable pressure these higher formation temperatures associated with the hydrate system result in reduced energy requirement compared to other freezing based purification processes i e ice crystallization and eutectic crystallization moreover as the hydrate formation is based on the phase transition between liquid and solid phases the concentration of the targeted solution does not affect the separation efficiency unlike thermal and membrane processes 16 this work presents a comprehensive review of the potential of using hydrate based technology for reclamation of water considering the scientific and engineering aspects of this technology several hydrate formers studied in the literature for water treatment applications are summarized and discussed the challenges faced by researchers in terms of hydrate nucleation growth efficient hydrate separation from residual concentrate and impurity removal efficiency have been brought out in the article recent development towards intensifying the process for commercialization has also been analyzed and discussed in detail 2 hydrate based water reclamation process purification of saline water sewage and industrial wastewater by gas hydrate formation has received attention since the early 1960s 17 19 most of the research and developments carried out in hydrate based water treatment focused mainly on seawater desalination however the desalination plants were inefficient because the hydrate crystals were very small and dendritic and were difficult to separate from the residual brine in the 1990s the u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation conducted extensive research on building and operating a clathrate desalination pilot plant 20 21 based on these studies pilot plant facilities were constructed and successfully tested in hawaii and san diego under a water treatment technology program however a wash column for hydrate crystal filtration and washing was never built and tested as part of operation 22 subsequently to achieve efficient crystals separation and materials compatibility a follow up program was undertaken design and operation of a wash column to determine the filterability of hydrate crystals and surveying alternate higher temperature hydrate formers were conducted as part of this program 23 in 2008 sandia national laboratories u s published a report on desalination utilizing clathrate hydrates with a brief description of a generic flow diagram of a desalination process more recently the feasibility of a hydrate based method for the treatment of produced water 9 high salinity water 4 and wastewater containing heavy metal ion 24 25 has been demonstrated by researchers 2 1 mechanism of hydrate based impurity removal the unique structure of clathrate hydrate includes only water host and former guest molecules excluding any contaminant salt ions mineral metal etc from hydrate structure 26 although these contaminants do not participate in hydrate formation the thermodynamics of hydrate crystallization alters due to the interaction of ions with polar water molecules 25 in comparison to pure water the presence of salt ion metal can shift the equilibrium formation conditions to lower temperatures at a given pressure or higher pressures at a given temperature 27 the composition and concentration of pollutants present in the effluent stream directly impact the hydrate formation kinetics from feed water and separation efficiency of hydrate from the residual liquid a typical hydrate formation process see fig 3 involves the dissolution of the former guest molecule in the liquid phase followed by the onset of hydrate crystal nucleation subsequently the crystal growth starts wherein only pure water molecules as hosts participate in hydrate cage formation excluding the non guest molecules the overall process of hydrate formation i e kinetics is slow hydrate crystals obtained as a solid phase can be mechanically separated from the residual liquid phase using an appropriate separation technique the overall efficiency of the water reclamation process is estimated as the mass of freshwater recovered per unit mass of feed water it depends upon the rate of hydrate formation and the amount of recoverable hydrate crystals at the separation stage 28 from a crystal separation and washing viewpoint large or grown crystals are desirable the size and efficiency of wash columns are determined by crystal size the large crystals 400 microns promote high yields with less interstitial trapped water factors like retention time degree of super cooling heat removal rate nucleation etc play a significant role in hydrate crystal growth and size 20 from an energy consumption viewpoint hydrate based water reclamation has four primary functions i inducing hydrate formation under suitable temperature and pressure ii separating hydrates and residual liquid iii post treatment of hydrates to improve water quality washing centrifuging iv dissociating hydrate to obtain product water and reuse hydrate former the most energy intensive part among these is the pressure and temperature control 4 fig 4 shows the mechanism of simultaneous hydrate growth and impurity exclusion at the molecular level hydrate formation essentially requires contact between water and former at suitable conditions of temperature and pressure to diffuse towards their interface to begin hydrate nucleation and growth 29 the time corresponding to dissolution nucleation and initial crystal growth before a hydrate can be detected macroscopically is referred to as the induction time the hydrate nucleation step is generally a mass transfer limited step of any hydrate formation process mechanical stirring or agitation can help to break the mass transfer limitation at hydrate former water interface 30 after nucleation the subsequent crystal growth is relatively fast and continues until former molecules occupy all the hydrate cages and a condition of saturation is attained 31 with the development of hydrate the non guest molecules i e impurities present in water are excluded from the crystals and entered into the residual bulk solution the hydrate formation process is generally time consuming due to long induction time stochastic nucleation and limited mass transfer the slow kinetics of hydrate nucleation is closely related to increasing the surface area in the system and can be addressed by modifying operating conditions such as increasing pressure and former to water ratio decreasing temperature the higher driving force in terms of pressure above the equilibrium pressure and or temperature sub cooling increases the hydrate stability and results in enhanced formation kinetics 30 hydrate kinetics are proportional to the former consumption rate and therefore researchers have also investigated the application of thermodynamic and kinetic promotors as additives to enhance the hydrate formation rates 32 33 the role of surfactants e g sodium dodecyl sulphate sds sodium tetradecyl sulfates sts tween 80 polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether igepal 520 as kinetics promoter have been well established the addition of small quantities of surfactants reduces the surface tension and enhances the mass transfer between the former and water to stimulate nucleation and reduce induction time significantly changes in the morphology of hydrate formation resulting in better gas water contact and water to hydrate conversion were also reported 34 2 2 scheme for a generic hydrate based water reclamation process the generic approach for employing hydrates as a new phase to recover usable water from wastewater is depicted in fig 5 a typical hydrate based treatment process involves combining a potential hydrate former with an aqueous phase under suitable conditions of temperature pressure and water to former ratio the hydrate crystal lattice dimensions are such that it does not allow bigger molecules like salts minerals metals etc to enter inside the crystals thus the solid hydrate phase forms in a relatively pure state leaving the impurities in the residual liquid phase the solid formed is then separated from the remaining liquid followed by washing of the crystal surface to remove the adhered impurities on the external surface the solid hydrates formed have a specific dissociation melting temperature at different pressures reduction of pressure and or elevation of temperature results in dissociation of hydrates into hydrate former and product water the enthalpy of hydrate dissociation melting is equal and opposite to the enthalpy of hydrate formation the hydrate former released during the disintegration step can be recycled back to the hydrate formation loop a small fraction of hydrate former may be lost during hydrate dissociation handling and an equivalent former amount can be added to make up the loss per cycle the non guest impurities concentrate in the residual solution can be recovered by other convenient and economical methods the non guest impurity concentration is expected to increase with water removal during hydrate formation which in turn will increase the severity of operating conditions i e high pressure and low temperature 3 suitable hydrate former and promotor for wastewater treatment prior to the process design of any hydrate based water reclamation system it is crucial to prima facie identify suitable formers for hydrate formation an appropriate former has to meet various criteria like reasonable hydrate formation pressure temperature range non toxicity environment friendliness easy storage and lower energetics 27 to assess the suitability of a hydrate former for wastewater treatment thermodynamics kinetics and morphological data are important both liquid and gaseous phase hydrate formers have been investigated for desalination applications in comparison to liquid formers gaseous formers offer an advantage of easy separation from residual liquid 35 3 1 single hydrate formers in early developments on demineralizing seawater using halogenated hydrocarbons as hydrate formers properties of several chloro fluoro carbons cfcs hydro chloro fluoro carbons hcfcs and hydro fluoro carbons hfcs refrigerants were investigated 17 36 among these formers methyl bromide freon 21 and freon 31 were found useful for desalination from the standpoint of their formation pressure temperature conditions 17 kubota et al 36 investigated refrigerants like chloro trifluoro methane r 13 trifluoro methane r 23 and 1 1 difluoro ethane r 152a as hydrate formers for desalination r 152a was found to have a favorable operating condition for the formation of the associated hydrate the depression of hydrate formation temperature in the presence of salt was also not significant for r 152a while refrigerants have the potential to form hydrates and recover freshwater from wastewater some of them cfc hcfcs pose severe environmental impact i e atmospheric ozone layer depletion and are no longer preferred also their solubility in the aqueous phase can limit water quality to specific end applications only in recent years hfcs are evolved as an alternative to conventional chlorine based refrigerants because of their low atmospheric ozone depletion potential 11 16 37 bradshaw et al have investigated novel hydrate formers that would allow for hydrate formation significantly above the freezing point of water under different nucleation environments hcfc 141b and hfc 32 were tested to determine the impact of these formers on the nucleation environment and morphological characteristics the utilization of additives to inhibit dendritic growth and thus minimize interstitial salt entrapment was also studied the application of environment friendly refrigerants to form hydrates can be attractive as it may enable hydrate formation at near ambient conditions 38 seo et al have performed a thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of gas hydrates using methane hfc 134a and sf6 as formers for desalination of saturated salinity water the hydrate formation rate was found to be fastest with hfc 134a 4 further large scale storage of hfcs and hcfcs pose a challenge due to their flammability and restrict their use as potential formers 39 methane hydrate former based desalination processes have been patented to treat seawater and produced water 40 41 however the high operating pressures 60 bar associated with methane may increase the severity of operation and energy consumption 42 application of carbon dioxide co2 as a potential hydrate former was initiated in the mid 1990s by the u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 20 22 subsequently different processes and apparatus have been reported on co2 based desalination in the last decade 1 2 42 44 based on these studies co2 seems an appropriate former however the slow formation kinetics and relatively high operating pressures 35 bar may limit its application to circumvent these issues the addition of a second former e g propane cyclopentane has been reported discussed in section 3 2 more recently cyclopentane has emerged as a preferred choice of former candidate for water treatment via hydrate process 25 45 50 cyclopentane is capable of forming hydrates at atmospheric pressure above the ice point and is immiscible in water 47 cyclopentane hydrates are reported to have a lower phase change enthalpy than co2 and propane hydrate and thus likely to have lesser energy requirements 49 3 2 mixed hydrate formers it has been observed that in comparison to gaseous formers liquid formers offer lower formation pressure at a given temperature however the liquid formers suffer from slow kinetics these limitations posed by individual hydrate formers have been rectified by using liquid and gaseous formers in combination in the context of desalination of high salinity 9 wt produced water cha and seol 51 have used mixed hydrate formers by adding a second former insoluble hydrocarbons to a primary former co2 in a stirred reactor in two independent studies using cyclopentane and cyclohexane as secondary hydrate guest to co2 primary hydrate former has resulted in elevated formation temperatures 2 c to 16 and 7 c respectively and faster hydrate formation rates 22 and 16 times respectively the moderate hydrate formation temperature and enhanced formation kinetics associated with mixed hydrate formers resulted in higher salt removal 90 and energy efficiency for the desalination process in another work on co2 hydrate based desalination liu et al 52 have used r141b as an accelerant to enhance the formation rate of mixed hydrates the efficiency of co2 hydrate based desalination in the presence of r1414b was found to be three times higher than the efficiency in the absence of r141b a four stage process using mixed hydrate formers resulted in a removal rate of up to 98 4 while high salt rejection was obtained in multi stage operation the product water recovery would decrease from first to the last stage ngema and co workers have experimentally investigated the mixed refrigerants namely r 410a 50 r 32 50 r 125 by mass r 507 50 r 125 50 r 142a by mass and r 134a r 22 systems for water treatment application their results indicated that r 410a would be more suitable for hydrate technology near ambient conditions against r 507 and r 134a 38 two independent research groups 30 31 have reported the application of propane as a co former with co2 as a primary former for integrated co2 capture and seawater desalination the addition of propane as the co guest has resulted in moderate formation temperature and pressure conditions along with higher cage occupancy by the former in a recent study nesterov et al 32 have proposed a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic promotor to enhance co2 hydrate formation using r 134a and sodium dodecyl sulphate sds respectively the addition of r 134a and sds decreased the induction time and increased the hydrate growth and water conversion respectively based on these studies it can be concluded that the application of mixed hydrate formers can ease and enhance the hydrate formation process for water treatment applications 3 3 characteristics of suitable hydrate formers the economics of the hydrate based water reclamation process depends on former properties like equilibrium pressure temperature enthalpy of hydrate formation dissociation the solubility of former in water and hydrate stability lower hydrate formation temperatures are not economically feasible for practical purposes due to associated costs for refrigeration 9 other considerations such as cost and availability of former enthalpies of hydrate formation dissociation also influence the choice of former for hydrate based water purification 18 27 from operational aspects related to the separation of hydrates from residual fluid buoyancy has also been considered an important factor hydrate formers with mild formation temperature 275 285 k and pressures 1 30 bar and lower solubility in water are preferable from a process viewpoint mixed hydrate formers can be an excellent alternative to single hydrate formers for water treatment applications 3 4 application of novel hydrate promotors conventionally surface active agents e g sodium dodecyl sulfate sodium tetradecyl sulfate polyoxyethylene nonylphenylether etc have been used to enhance the hydrate formation kinetics in desalination application 34 53 however the presence of surfactant molecules in the recovered water can limit its use to certain applications and will lead to the necessity of an additional separation step as an alternate novel hydrate promotors additives are being investigated by the researchers in recent times li and co workers have employed low cost and easily separable graphite particles to promote cyclopentane hydrate formation for desalination the added graphite has resulted in enhanced water yield by shortening the induction time required for hydrate nucleation 47 gaikwad et al have employed lecithin a benign bio surfactant to improve the conversion rate of cyclopentane hydrate in the context of removing heavy metal ions from industrial effluent 25 usefulness of such novel and benign hydrate promotors for reducing the induction time and enhancing the hydrate formation should be explored as part of process intensification and feasibility 4 process intensification the commercial success of the clathrate hydrate technology for water treatment will largely depend upon efficient hydrate handling residual liquid separation and hydrate former recycling in this regard the adequate design and operation of the reactor system utilized for the hydrate crystal formation other unit operations associated with the separation and washing system are essential critical issues including improvements in crystal size and morphology continuous crystal formation and separation prevention of brine penetration to crystals efficient recovery of hydrates etc have been investigated and addressed by the researchers over the years the developments towards the necessary unit operation and process equipment involved in hydrate based water reclamation have been discussed in detail 4 1 hydrate reactor most of the fundamental lab studies have employed stirred or non stirred cylindrical reactor vessel operating in batch mode to investigate hydrate formation 9 37 the kinetics is generally slow in such systems as the hydrate formation occurs in a bulk liquid system attempts have been made to enhance the hydrate formation kinetics using innovative gas liquid contact modes by forming hydrate in a dispersed liquid phase mixing is provided to improve multi phase contact using agitator impeller and scraper devices the batch mode of operation has an inherent disadvantage of relatively higher operating times with lower productivity continuous mode designs can help overcome the challenge of operating time prevalent in batch systems in this direction few continuous systems like packed and fluidized bed designs were explored for hydrate formation a patent 54 disclosed the application of a fluidized bed reactor as shown in fig 6 for the formation of hydrates the reactor with a fluidized bed zone consists of an upper portion and a lower portion wherein the cross sectional area of the upper part is larger than the cross section of the lower portion water and former gas were allowed to flow inside the reactor in a counter current manner through the inlets provided at the upper and lower portion respectively for the efficient production of hydrates an atomizing unit spray nozzle was used to divide water into fine droplets spraying of liquid as fine droplets results in an increasing contact area and decreasing mass transfer resistance at suitable conditions of pressure 700 2000 psig and temperature 1 to 13 c the gas hydrate particles start forming and after a sufficient amount of growth falls to the bottom of the reactor the excess former gas is recycled back to the reactor to increase the overall efficiency and yield of the apparatus a defrosting means was suggested to prevent the build up of gas hydrate particles on the walls of the reactor and thus reduce reactor fouling and increase hydrate production interestingly such systems can enhance the rate of hydrate formation as well as efficient removal of localized heat for better kinetics while the fluidized bed method and apparatus offer higher efficiency and capacity per unit of reactor volume it is suitable for high pressure operations as fluidized bed needs to be maintained also the additional power required to maintain the fluidized bed needs to be considered park et al 1 have designed a hydrate reactor fig 7 consisting of a dual cylinder unit along with pistons to produce and pelletize gas hydrates by a squeezing operation continuously hydrate formation experiments were carried out in seawater using co2 as the hydrate forming gas at pressure and temperature conditions of 2 9 mpa and 280 k respectively after the formation of a sufficient amount of hydrates the piston of the upper cylinder moves downwards to squeeze the slurries and residual water flows through passing holes after palletization the upper and lower piston moves downwards to extract the hydrate pellets by discharging them beneath the reactor after the extraction of gas hydrate pellets both upper and lower pistons return to the initial state of starting the next cycle researchers at the national university of singapore have done extensive work on the design and development of a fixed bed reactor with porous media e g silica sand for gas separation 55 and desalination application 56 57 a schematic of the fixed bed column for hydrate based desalination is shown in fig 8 in their fixed bed design the seawater is fed at the bottom of the reactor to fill the interstitial pore space of sand media and the gas is loaded from the top in counter current flow at the suitable condition of temperature and pressure hydrate starts forming above the bed by drawing water through interstitial pore space leaving the salt behind in the sand the particulate bed also acts as a nucleation site and the hydrate formation kinetics were observed to increase significantly in the presence of a fixed bed different characteristics of porous media namely permeability porosity bed height water saturation and particle size were found to affect the hydrate formation kinetics a process for simultaneous co2 capture and seawater desalination using propane as co guest was also presented to attain water recovery of 60 80 pressure of 60 bar and 1 h operating time further improvement in reactor design was continued by the group and a novel prototype design for the hydrate based desalination process was reported in the latest study 57 starting with 3 wt nacl solution as feed water recovery and salt rejection of 34 85 and 87 5 were achieved respectively application of nonporous metallic packing ss 316 having high thermal conductivity in a fixed bed reactor has been investigated in another study significant enhancement in hydrate formation kinetics in terms of former gas uptake rate 115 mol min 1 m 3 was reported concerning co2 hydrate formation toward carbon capture application 58 however the performance was lower than the porous silica material used in the previous studies 56 the structure modification of metallic packing towards the higher surface area to volume ratio was proposed as the scope of improvement while the porous media in fixed column design helps in better former water contact with enhanced hydrate formation rate the separation of porous media from the hydrate may be a major challenge from the operational viewpoint 4 2 separator and washer the hydrate slurry formed in reactors is a complex mixture of hydrates and residual liquid concentrate existing as a multi phase system if not separated adequately the remaining liquid may trap inside the hydrate interstices resulting in a decrease in product water quality obtained from the dissociation of hydrates therefore an efficient separation of hydrate phase from residual liquid phase is desirable to achieve higher quality water also washing hydrate crystal surface during or after separation can enhance the crystal purity by removing the adhered impurities different filtration devices used to separate hydrate crystals from the liquid phase include basket type centrifuge tube type centrifuge vacuum filter pressure filter press etc in an early investigation the hydrate crystal filtration and washing steps were operated in batch mode due to the slow kinetics typically associated with hydrate formation 19 with the advent of continuous hydrate formation with improved kinetics tubular wash columns were designed to remove excess salt entrapped in the interstitial spaces of hydrate crystals 20 22 the clathrate slurry from the crystallizer is fed to the wash column see fig 9 the clathrate crystals are agglomerate into a permeable crystal pack and grow upward by differential pressure the top of the pack is scraped off and collected in a surrounding tank in a recent work dong et al 29 have studied the hydrate removal mechanism from the mother liquor employing various solid liquid separation methods namely vacuum filtration vf washing with a former and vacuum filtration whvf washing with fresh water and vacuum filtration wfvf and vacuum filtration and centrifugation vfc amongst these methods vfc was found to be the most effective method due to associated low cost and high removal efficiency in conclusion the solid liquid separation method was identified as an essential means for improving removal efficiency while using hydrate technology for wastewater treatment 4 3 in situ hydrate based desalination technology in situ hydrate based desalination technology for use in oceans has also been described in several patents 21 40 in this approach hydrate former gas or mixture of gases is injected through a submerged pipeline and mixed with water at sufficiently high pressures and or low temperatures to form buoyant hydrate instantaneously at the base of a treatment column located at sea hydrate formed at the bottom of the column i e the hydrate stability zone rises under buoyancy and crosses into the zone of instability these hydrate crystals are washed and subsequently melted to produce salt free water hydrate forming agent is recycled for re injection through the pipeline these methodologies may be restricted to ocean based near sea installations in another variation of the above method phelps et al 41 presented a pressure vessel combined with co flow injection technology to form methane and co2 hydrates for removal of salt and soluble materials from produced water in oil and gas fields a hydrate former is injected along with produced water to a pressure vessel to form clathrate hydrates subsequently a rapid depressurization well below the hydrate stability zone results in the escaping of former gas to produce ice like crystals these crystals are stored on the elevated screen to drain out surface saline water and to recover freshwater ice with reduced salt trapped in the pore space co flow injection techniques can be efficient for heat exchange between upward flow slurry and downward injected clathrate former in counter current arrangement the longer pipe lengths give rise to increased retention time which may result in large crystal formation building these desalination plants near the ocean can help in reducing the power consumption for seawater pumping natural condition of high pressure and low temperature available in deep ocean for in situ hydrate desalination system near coast can be exploited with reduced capital expenditure required for hydrate formation otherwise 4 4 multi functional hydrate formation and separation process several multi functional systems that combine two or more unit operations i e hydrate formation separation washing dissociation in one single unit have also been reported in the literature an early patent by walton 59 describes a continuous process utilizing a multi chamber device for the conversion of salt laden water into usable salt free water the system consists of a vertical tower having separate chambers as shown in fig 10 saline water and clathrate former propane is feed to the bottom of the tower to form propane clathrate crystals the crystals being less dense than liquid rises as a compact bed in the liquid the residual brine is separated from the crystals in the brine removal chamber in the washing chamber clean water is introduced to wash the rising clathrate crystals the water temperature was maintained between the melting point of the clathrate crystals and the freezing point of water the washed clathrate crystals are heated in the separation chamber using the heat of vaporization of propane and the pure water is collected for storage from the bottom of this chamber for the large scale operation such segmental columns needs to be designed considering the fact that the kinetics or rates associated with hydrate formation washing and dissociation operations are different in addition the possibility of weeping or flooding of such multi chamber columns needs to be studied before scale up in a very recent work 60 a multi functional gas hydrate apparatus consisting of a hydrate reactor with a movable plunger and a quick separator has been investigated the integrated reactor and separator design enabled various operation modes and separation methods in the first variant with a plunger located at the top hydrate is formed after contacting co2 c3h8 gas mixture with seawater at specified temperature and pressure subsequently two separation modes based on the plunger movement have been proposed in the first separation mode the residual wastewater was drained out without a plunger movement leftover solid hydrates post drainage were melted and recovered as product water in second separation mode the plunger movement was used to separate quick separator followed by three treatment methods i e squeezing purging and extracting it was found that squeezing and purging methods have greatly improved the desalination efficiency 80 subsequently a continuous mode of operation including multi time injection separation washing and purging was demonstrated with the freshwater recovery of more than 30 with 80 overall desalination efficiency this novel design having a continuous mode of operation seems promising towards the development of the hydrate based wastewater treatment 4 5 hybrid hydrate and ro systems the application of hybrid processes which combine two or more operations e g hydrate technology with membrane technology have also been investigated to synergize the wastewater treatment process in the context of seawater desalination lee et al 61 have proposed an optimal design approach for gas hydrate gh and reverse osmosis ro hybrid system in their system gh and ro units were configured in series wherein the seawater was fed to the gh system the desalinated product water from gh was sent to the ro unit as feed and concentrate was rejected the permeate from the ro unit was collected as product water and the retentate was recycled to the feed stream of the gh process for the gh process with 90 salt rejection ro recovery of 0 8 and energy consumption of 1 9 kw h m3 was achieved in this hybrid system such hybrid systems can be of more relevance for hyper saline water treatment where the ro system becomes energy intensive and expensive 5 process economics clathrate hydrate technologies for wastewater treatment are at the development stage and reliable economic analysis is critical for large scale implementation while a large amount of literature exists toward equipment and process development limited work has been reported about economic evaluations of this technology javanmardi and moshfeghian 62 have reported the economic evaluation and cost estimation of a hydrate desalination process a modified process based on an earlier work by knox and co workers incorporating heat exchangers reactor separator decomposer compressor and pumps was synthesized a computer program based on mass and energy balance was used to estimate capital operation and maintenance costs an economic evaluation of a propane former based hydrate process in comparison to msf and ro for desalination was carried out and the same is presented in table 1 the capital investment per tonne of product water in the case of the hydrate process was found to be relatively higher as compared to msf and ro this can be attributed to the increased number of unit operations involved in the hydrate process however the operating cost per tonne of product water for this process is lower it was suggested that the total product cost could further be reduced using suitable promoters which can enhance hydrate formation kinetics and by implementing this technology in colder regions where associated refrigeration cost may be lower the economic feasibility of the low temperatures hydrate process can be constrained by the availability of low cost refrigeration required to form the hydrates 31 recently potential refrigeration available in a liquefied natural gas lng stream in regasification plants has attracted the attention of researchers to overcome the need for an external refrigeration cycle employed in the traditional hydrate based desalination process 31 63 a propane former based hydrate desalination process colden hydesal was synthesized and evaluated the specific energy consumption for the proposed process was estimated to be 0 60 0 84 kw h m3 as against 65 13 65 29 kw h m3 for a traditional hydrate process the authors concluded that the colden hydesal process is an energy efficient process and can potentially be used to desalinate seawater and higher concentration brines prevalent near lng regasification terminals in a subsequent work on economic analysis of colden hydesal process the levelized cost of water was estimated to be 1 11 m3 which strongly supports the commercialization of this integrated process in the near future 64 in a subsequent investigation by this group a cyclopentane based hydrate desalination was reported to have even lower specific energy consumption 0 35 kw h m3 and fixed capital cost than propane based process subjected to availability of lng cold these integrated processes reported here show the potential of hydrate technology for the treatment of wastewater and hypersaline water with much lower energy requirement in the overall process 50 it is evident that several studies in the area of equipment design with a focus in enhancing hydrate formation and improving water recovery using various configurations have attempted by researchers however the techno economic feasibility studies of new configurations have not been under taken further opportunities for suitable heat integration utilizing the specific and latent heat associated with hydrate formation and dissociation process needs be examined to improve the overall process efficiency the prospect of harnessing energy from renewable sources like solar wind geothermal and waste energy source like thermal power plants for clathrate hydrate process can also be explored in the near future to make the process sustainable 6 summary because of their ability to capture pure water molecules from aqueous solutions clathrate hydrate have the potential to treat wastewater and high salinity water this review article explores the developments undertaken to realize hydrate based process towards a commercial technology several advancements by researchers in recent times to tackle the issues of slow kinetics energy requirements and efficient separation associated with clathrate hydrate technology supports its techno feasibility water treatment processes employing hydrate formers having lower equilibrium formation pressure at a given temperature are desirable from the energetics viewpoint while potential formers existing in either gas or liquid state can be used the application of gas formers is favorable from ease of separation standpoint towards addressing the issue of slower kinetics associated with hydrates the use of suitable hydrate former and promoters surfactants to enhance the rate of hydrate nucleation and growth is recommended improving the hydrate formation kinetics will favor the continuous mode of operation at the plant scale nevertheless the effect of surfactant concentration on product water quality has to be considered depending upon the end application of product water further investigations on natural and benign promoters can help reducing the negative impact of surfactants on the product water quality with regard to desalination hydrate based technology has been proven to be competitive and economic in comparison with the conventional thermal and membrane based techniques the process intensification undertaken over the years provide a strong case to promote the use of hydrate technology for water treatment application yet further estimations of economic viability of proposed reactor and washing configurations toward commercialization is essential it would be interesting to explore the adequate integration opportunities available for hydrate technology for instance the potential refrigeration load available at lng regasification terminals can be utilized for hydrate based water reclamation to reduce the total energy consumption associated with clathrate hydrate technology also the application of hybrid processes e g hydrate process ro could be attractive for improved water quality and energy recovery simultaneously implementation of renewable energy sources like solar wind etc may further synergize this technology in the near future however a detailed techno economic analysis to estimate the feasibility and costs of such integrations is essential to validate this conclusion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

13559,clathrate hydrates are gaining interest in their applications in the area of energy and the environment they are also being considered for recovering clean water from brackish water seawater wastewater and industrial effluents water reclamation via clathrate hydrate is based on the formation separation and dissociation of hydrate crystals devoid of salt and metal ions from saline wastewater a comprehensive review of studies undertaken to date on the application of clathrate hydrates as promising carrier for water desalination treatment is presented both fundamental and technological advancements in the clathrate hydrate technology are reported to establish its feasibility and potential for producing quality water from waste effluents the hydrate forming agent and kinetic promoters have been found to be important factors for faster hydrate formation and subsequent water recovery several developments towards novel reactor design efficient separation washing methods hybrid hydrate membrane processes multi functional devices etc present a strong case for considering the clathrate hydrate technique as an available alternative for water reclamation in near future keywords clathrate gas hydrate water reclamation desalination hydrate former 1 introduction increasing global population and standard of living pathways have generated immense pressures on water resources and affected their quality and availability groundwater supplies are diminishing with an estimated 20 of the world s aquifers being over exploited leading to acute water scarcity while non conventional methods like desalination of seawater brackish water are being exploited recovery of quality water from wastewater and or saline effluents can supplement this demand over the years various prominent wastewater treatment strategies like thermal methods evaporation crystallization membrane techniques reverse osmosis electrodialysis and biological methods aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation have been practiced to reclaim quality water however energy consumption of these wastewater treatment techniques becomes significant in the presence of various contaminants e g dissolved salts metal ions etc in effluent there is still a need to identify alternative approaches for water reclamation with emphasis on further reducing energy demand coupled with enhanced water recovery in this context clathrate hydrate based technology offers a potential alternative to treat wastewater containing dissolved minerals and heavy metals in recent years 1 3 also hydrate based techniques have been shown more promising over the membrane and thermal based conventional desalination methods to treat ultra high salinity water 4 this work describes advances in clathrate hydrate technology as an alternative source for water reclamation from saline and industrial wastewater clathrate hydrates are a non stoichiometric crystalline class of inclusion compounds in which molecules of one component i e a guest is enclosed within a crystal structure framework of host water molecules 5 the guest molecule normally referred to as clathrate former for most practical purposes is a gas with water as a host molecule the structure is also referred to as a gas hydrate there has been an increased interest in potential applications of clathrate hydrates for concentrating aqueous fluids 6 7 energy recovery 8 desalination 2 3 9 gas storage 10 and separation 11 12 depending upon the type of guest molecule hydrates show three different crystal structures structure i si 512 51262 structure ii sii 512 51264 and structure h sh 512 435664 51268 as shown in fig 1 each structure consists of cages of different sizes and shapes stabilized by van der walls forces hydrate formation is characterized by low temperature and corresponding pressures depending on the former generally only one former molecule is occluded within each cage resulting in single cage occupancy for all three structures 13 however under high application pressures multiple cage occupancy with small formers e g hydrogen has also been reported 14 some common si clathrate hydrate formers include methane ethane and carbon dioxide co2 whereas nitrogen propane and iso butane are among the sii hydrate formers the number of moles of hydrated water per mole of encaged former gas is known as hydration number n w different formers hold different numbers of water molecules based on their structure and formation conditions this feature of hydration makes them suitable for water treatment applications hydrates can exist at a temperature below as well as above the freezing point of water 15 clathrate hydrate based water treatment is carried out by forming hydrate crystals based on suitable pressure and temperature p t conditions under which these crystals form fig 2 represents the typical phase diagram of any hydrate as a function of p t it is observed from the hydrate phase boundary curve that on increasing temperature the equilibrium pressures increase such a broad range of operating p t conditions corresponding to hydrate formation can be advantageous from an operational flexibility viewpoint the hydrate formation and stability region is indicated by the shaded area which corresponds to a lower temperature and higher pressure than hydrate phase boundary p t it is apparent that for stable hydrate formation the operating pressures at a given temperature should be higher and temperature at a fixed pressure should be lower than that of equilibrium p t hydrate dissociation can be attained by inverting the hydrate stability conditions i e increasing temperature heating and decreasing pressure depressurization in appearance hydrates are ice like structures wherein the water solidifies as hydrate cages at a temperature well above the freezing point of water subjected to a suitable pressure these higher formation temperatures associated with the hydrate system result in reduced energy requirement compared to other freezing based purification processes i e ice crystallization and eutectic crystallization moreover as the hydrate formation is based on the phase transition between liquid and solid phases the concentration of the targeted solution does not affect the separation efficiency unlike thermal and membrane processes 16 this work presents a comprehensive review of the potential of using hydrate based technology for reclamation of water considering the scientific and engineering aspects of this technology several hydrate formers studied in the literature for water treatment applications are summarized and discussed the challenges faced by researchers in terms of hydrate nucleation growth efficient hydrate separation from residual concentrate and impurity removal efficiency have been brought out in the article recent development towards intensifying the process for commercialization has also been analyzed and discussed in detail 2 hydrate based water reclamation process purification of saline water sewage and industrial wastewater by gas hydrate formation has received attention since the early 1960s 17 19 most of the research and developments carried out in hydrate based water treatment focused mainly on seawater desalination however the desalination plants were inefficient because the hydrate crystals were very small and dendritic and were difficult to separate from the residual brine in the 1990s the u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation conducted extensive research on building and operating a clathrate desalination pilot plant 20 21 based on these studies pilot plant facilities were constructed and successfully tested in hawaii and san diego under a water treatment technology program however a wash column for hydrate crystal filtration and washing was never built and tested as part of operation 22 subsequently to achieve efficient crystals separation and materials compatibility a follow up program was undertaken design and operation of a wash column to determine the filterability of hydrate crystals and surveying alternate higher temperature hydrate formers were conducted as part of this program 23 in 2008 sandia national laboratories u s published a report on desalination utilizing clathrate hydrates with a brief description of a generic flow diagram of a desalination process more recently the feasibility of a hydrate based method for the treatment of produced water 9 high salinity water 4 and wastewater containing heavy metal ion 24 25 has been demonstrated by researchers 2 1 mechanism of hydrate based impurity removal the unique structure of clathrate hydrate includes only water host and former guest molecules excluding any contaminant salt ions mineral metal etc from hydrate structure 26 although these contaminants do not participate in hydrate formation the thermodynamics of hydrate crystallization alters due to the interaction of ions with polar water molecules 25 in comparison to pure water the presence of salt ion metal can shift the equilibrium formation conditions to lower temperatures at a given pressure or higher pressures at a given temperature 27 the composition and concentration of pollutants present in the effluent stream directly impact the hydrate formation kinetics from feed water and separation efficiency of hydrate from the residual liquid a typical hydrate formation process see fig 3 involves the dissolution of the former guest molecule in the liquid phase followed by the onset of hydrate crystal nucleation subsequently the crystal growth starts wherein only pure water molecules as hosts participate in hydrate cage formation excluding the non guest molecules the overall process of hydrate formation i e kinetics is slow hydrate crystals obtained as a solid phase can be mechanically separated from the residual liquid phase using an appropriate separation technique the overall efficiency of the water reclamation process is estimated as the mass of freshwater recovered per unit mass of feed water it depends upon the rate of hydrate formation and the amount of recoverable hydrate crystals at the separation stage 28 from a crystal separation and washing viewpoint large or grown crystals are desirable the size and efficiency of wash columns are determined by crystal size the large crystals 400 microns promote high yields with less interstitial trapped water factors like retention time degree of super cooling heat removal rate nucleation etc play a significant role in hydrate crystal growth and size 20 from an energy consumption viewpoint hydrate based water reclamation has four primary functions i inducing hydrate formation under suitable temperature and pressure ii separating hydrates and residual liquid iii post treatment of hydrates to improve water quality washing centrifuging iv dissociating hydrate to obtain product water and reuse hydrate former the most energy intensive part among these is the pressure and temperature control 4 fig 4 shows the mechanism of simultaneous hydrate growth and impurity exclusion at the molecular level hydrate formation essentially requires contact between water and former at suitable conditions of temperature and pressure to diffuse towards their interface to begin hydrate nucleation and growth 29 the time corresponding to dissolution nucleation and initial crystal growth before a hydrate can be detected macroscopically is referred to as the induction time the hydrate nucleation step is generally a mass transfer limited step of any hydrate formation process mechanical stirring or agitation can help to break the mass transfer limitation at hydrate former water interface 30 after nucleation the subsequent crystal growth is relatively fast and continues until former molecules occupy all the hydrate cages and a condition of saturation is attained 31 with the development of hydrate the non guest molecules i e impurities present in water are excluded from the crystals and entered into the residual bulk solution the hydrate formation process is generally time consuming due to long induction time stochastic nucleation and limited mass transfer the slow kinetics of hydrate nucleation is closely related to increasing the surface area in the system and can be addressed by modifying operating conditions such as increasing pressure and former to water ratio decreasing temperature the higher driving force in terms of pressure above the equilibrium pressure and or temperature sub cooling increases the hydrate stability and results in enhanced formation kinetics 30 hydrate kinetics are proportional to the former consumption rate and therefore researchers have also investigated the application of thermodynamic and kinetic promotors as additives to enhance the hydrate formation rates 32 33 the role of surfactants e g sodium dodecyl sulphate sds sodium tetradecyl sulfates sts tween 80 polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether igepal 520 as kinetics promoter have been well established the addition of small quantities of surfactants reduces the surface tension and enhances the mass transfer between the former and water to stimulate nucleation and reduce induction time significantly changes in the morphology of hydrate formation resulting in better gas water contact and water to hydrate conversion were also reported 34 2 2 scheme for a generic hydrate based water reclamation process the generic approach for employing hydrates as a new phase to recover usable water from wastewater is depicted in fig 5 a typical hydrate based treatment process involves combining a potential hydrate former with an aqueous phase under suitable conditions of temperature pressure and water to former ratio the hydrate crystal lattice dimensions are such that it does not allow bigger molecules like salts minerals metals etc to enter inside the crystals thus the solid hydrate phase forms in a relatively pure state leaving the impurities in the residual liquid phase the solid formed is then separated from the remaining liquid followed by washing of the crystal surface to remove the adhered impurities on the external surface the solid hydrates formed have a specific dissociation melting temperature at different pressures reduction of pressure and or elevation of temperature results in dissociation of hydrates into hydrate former and product water the enthalpy of hydrate dissociation melting is equal and opposite to the enthalpy of hydrate formation the hydrate former released during the disintegration step can be recycled back to the hydrate formation loop a small fraction of hydrate former may be lost during hydrate dissociation handling and an equivalent former amount can be added to make up the loss per cycle the non guest impurities concentrate in the residual solution can be recovered by other convenient and economical methods the non guest impurity concentration is expected to increase with water removal during hydrate formation which in turn will increase the severity of operating conditions i e high pressure and low temperature 3 suitable hydrate former and promotor for wastewater treatment prior to the process design of any hydrate based water reclamation system it is crucial to prima facie identify suitable formers for hydrate formation an appropriate former has to meet various criteria like reasonable hydrate formation pressure temperature range non toxicity environment friendliness easy storage and lower energetics 27 to assess the suitability of a hydrate former for wastewater treatment thermodynamics kinetics and morphological data are important both liquid and gaseous phase hydrate formers have been investigated for desalination applications in comparison to liquid formers gaseous formers offer an advantage of easy separation from residual liquid 35 3 1 single hydrate formers in early developments on demineralizing seawater using halogenated hydrocarbons as hydrate formers properties of several chloro fluoro carbons cfcs hydro chloro fluoro carbons hcfcs and hydro fluoro carbons hfcs refrigerants were investigated 17 36 among these formers methyl bromide freon 21 and freon 31 were found useful for desalination from the standpoint of their formation pressure temperature conditions 17 kubota et al 36 investigated refrigerants like chloro trifluoro methane r 13 trifluoro methane r 23 and 1 1 difluoro ethane r 152a as hydrate formers for desalination r 152a was found to have a favorable operating condition for the formation of the associated hydrate the depression of hydrate formation temperature in the presence of salt was also not significant for r 152a while refrigerants have the potential to form hydrates and recover freshwater from wastewater some of them cfc hcfcs pose severe environmental impact i e atmospheric ozone layer depletion and are no longer preferred also their solubility in the aqueous phase can limit water quality to specific end applications only in recent years hfcs are evolved as an alternative to conventional chlorine based refrigerants because of their low atmospheric ozone depletion potential 11 16 37 bradshaw et al have investigated novel hydrate formers that would allow for hydrate formation significantly above the freezing point of water under different nucleation environments hcfc 141b and hfc 32 were tested to determine the impact of these formers on the nucleation environment and morphological characteristics the utilization of additives to inhibit dendritic growth and thus minimize interstitial salt entrapment was also studied the application of environment friendly refrigerants to form hydrates can be attractive as it may enable hydrate formation at near ambient conditions 38 seo et al have performed a thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of gas hydrates using methane hfc 134a and sf6 as formers for desalination of saturated salinity water the hydrate formation rate was found to be fastest with hfc 134a 4 further large scale storage of hfcs and hcfcs pose a challenge due to their flammability and restrict their use as potential formers 39 methane hydrate former based desalination processes have been patented to treat seawater and produced water 40 41 however the high operating pressures 60 bar associated with methane may increase the severity of operation and energy consumption 42 application of carbon dioxide co2 as a potential hydrate former was initiated in the mid 1990s by the u s department of the interior bureau of reclamation 20 22 subsequently different processes and apparatus have been reported on co2 based desalination in the last decade 1 2 42 44 based on these studies co2 seems an appropriate former however the slow formation kinetics and relatively high operating pressures 35 bar may limit its application to circumvent these issues the addition of a second former e g propane cyclopentane has been reported discussed in section 3 2 more recently cyclopentane has emerged as a preferred choice of former candidate for water treatment via hydrate process 25 45 50 cyclopentane is capable of forming hydrates at atmospheric pressure above the ice point and is immiscible in water 47 cyclopentane hydrates are reported to have a lower phase change enthalpy than co2 and propane hydrate and thus likely to have lesser energy requirements 49 3 2 mixed hydrate formers it has been observed that in comparison to gaseous formers liquid formers offer lower formation pressure at a given temperature however the liquid formers suffer from slow kinetics these limitations posed by individual hydrate formers have been rectified by using liquid and gaseous formers in combination in the context of desalination of high salinity 9 wt produced water cha and seol 51 have used mixed hydrate formers by adding a second former insoluble hydrocarbons to a primary former co2 in a stirred reactor in two independent studies using cyclopentane and cyclohexane as secondary hydrate guest to co2 primary hydrate former has resulted in elevated formation temperatures 2 c to 16 and 7 c respectively and faster hydrate formation rates 22 and 16 times respectively the moderate hydrate formation temperature and enhanced formation kinetics associated with mixed hydrate formers resulted in higher salt removal 90 and energy efficiency for the desalination process in another work on co2 hydrate based desalination liu et al 52 have used r141b as an accelerant to enhance the formation rate of mixed hydrates the efficiency of co2 hydrate based desalination in the presence of r1414b was found to be three times higher than the efficiency in the absence of r141b a four stage process using mixed hydrate formers resulted in a removal rate of up to 98 4 while high salt rejection was obtained in multi stage operation the product water recovery would decrease from first to the last stage ngema and co workers have experimentally investigated the mixed refrigerants namely r 410a 50 r 32 50 r 125 by mass r 507 50 r 125 50 r 142a by mass and r 134a r 22 systems for water treatment application their results indicated that r 410a would be more suitable for hydrate technology near ambient conditions against r 507 and r 134a 38 two independent research groups 30 31 have reported the application of propane as a co former with co2 as a primary former for integrated co2 capture and seawater desalination the addition of propane as the co guest has resulted in moderate formation temperature and pressure conditions along with higher cage occupancy by the former in a recent study nesterov et al 32 have proposed a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic promotor to enhance co2 hydrate formation using r 134a and sodium dodecyl sulphate sds respectively the addition of r 134a and sds decreased the induction time and increased the hydrate growth and water conversion respectively based on these studies it can be concluded that the application of mixed hydrate formers can ease and enhance the hydrate formation process for water treatment applications 3 3 characteristics of suitable hydrate formers the economics of the hydrate based water reclamation process depends on former properties like equilibrium pressure temperature enthalpy of hydrate formation dissociation the solubility of former in water and hydrate stability lower hydrate formation temperatures are not economically feasible for practical purposes due to associated costs for refrigeration 9 other considerations such as cost and availability of former enthalpies of hydrate formation dissociation also influence the choice of former for hydrate based water purification 18 27 from operational aspects related to the separation of hydrates from residual fluid buoyancy has also been considered an important factor hydrate formers with mild formation temperature 275 285 k and pressures 1 30 bar and lower solubility in water are preferable from a process viewpoint mixed hydrate formers can be an excellent alternative to single hydrate formers for water treatment applications 3 4 application of novel hydrate promotors conventionally surface active agents e g sodium dodecyl sulfate sodium tetradecyl sulfate polyoxyethylene nonylphenylether etc have been used to enhance the hydrate formation kinetics in desalination application 34 53 however the presence of surfactant molecules in the recovered water can limit its use to certain applications and will lead to the necessity of an additional separation step as an alternate novel hydrate promotors additives are being investigated by the researchers in recent times li and co workers have employed low cost and easily separable graphite particles to promote cyclopentane hydrate formation for desalination the added graphite has resulted in enhanced water yield by shortening the induction time required for hydrate nucleation 47 gaikwad et al have employed lecithin a benign bio surfactant to improve the conversion rate of cyclopentane hydrate in the context of removing heavy metal ions from industrial effluent 25 usefulness of such novel and benign hydrate promotors for reducing the induction time and enhancing the hydrate formation should be explored as part of process intensification and feasibility 4 process intensification the commercial success of the clathrate hydrate technology for water treatment will largely depend upon efficient hydrate handling residual liquid separation and hydrate former recycling in this regard the adequate design and operation of the reactor system utilized for the hydrate crystal formation other unit operations associated with the separation and washing system are essential critical issues including improvements in crystal size and morphology continuous crystal formation and separation prevention of brine penetration to crystals efficient recovery of hydrates etc have been investigated and addressed by the researchers over the years the developments towards the necessary unit operation and process equipment involved in hydrate based water reclamation have been discussed in detail 4 1 hydrate reactor most of the fundamental lab studies have employed stirred or non stirred cylindrical reactor vessel operating in batch mode to investigate hydrate formation 9 37 the kinetics is generally slow in such systems as the hydrate formation occurs in a bulk liquid system attempts have been made to enhance the hydrate formation kinetics using innovative gas liquid contact modes by forming hydrate in a dispersed liquid phase mixing is provided to improve multi phase contact using agitator impeller and scraper devices the batch mode of operation has an inherent disadvantage of relatively higher operating times with lower productivity continuous mode designs can help overcome the challenge of operating time prevalent in batch systems in this direction few continuous systems like packed and fluidized bed designs were explored for hydrate formation a patent 54 disclosed the application of a fluidized bed reactor as shown in fig 6 for the formation of hydrates the reactor with a fluidized bed zone consists of an upper portion and a lower portion wherein the cross sectional area of the upper part is larger than the cross section of the lower portion water and former gas were allowed to flow inside the reactor in a counter current manner through the inlets provided at the upper and lower portion respectively for the efficient production of hydrates an atomizing unit spray nozzle was used to divide water into fine droplets spraying of liquid as fine droplets results in an increasing contact area and decreasing mass transfer resistance at suitable conditions of pressure 700 2000 psig and temperature 1 to 13 c the gas hydrate particles start forming and after a sufficient amount of growth falls to the bottom of the reactor the excess former gas is recycled back to the reactor to increase the overall efficiency and yield of the apparatus a defrosting means was suggested to prevent the build up of gas hydrate particles on the walls of the reactor and thus reduce reactor fouling and increase hydrate production interestingly such systems can enhance the rate of hydrate formation as well as efficient removal of localized heat for better kinetics while the fluidized bed method and apparatus offer higher efficiency and capacity per unit of reactor volume it is suitable for high pressure operations as fluidized bed needs to be maintained also the additional power required to maintain the fluidized bed needs to be considered park et al 1 have designed a hydrate reactor fig 7 consisting of a dual cylinder unit along with pistons to produce and pelletize gas hydrates by a squeezing operation continuously hydrate formation experiments were carried out in seawater using co2 as the hydrate forming gas at pressure and temperature conditions of 2 9 mpa and 280 k respectively after the formation of a sufficient amount of hydrates the piston of the upper cylinder moves downwards to squeeze the slurries and residual water flows through passing holes after palletization the upper and lower piston moves downwards to extract the hydrate pellets by discharging them beneath the reactor after the extraction of gas hydrate pellets both upper and lower pistons return to the initial state of starting the next cycle researchers at the national university of singapore have done extensive work on the design and development of a fixed bed reactor with porous media e g silica sand for gas separation 55 and desalination application 56 57 a schematic of the fixed bed column for hydrate based desalination is shown in fig 8 in their fixed bed design the seawater is fed at the bottom of the reactor to fill the interstitial pore space of sand media and the gas is loaded from the top in counter current flow at the suitable condition of temperature and pressure hydrate starts forming above the bed by drawing water through interstitial pore space leaving the salt behind in the sand the particulate bed also acts as a nucleation site and the hydrate formation kinetics were observed to increase significantly in the presence of a fixed bed different characteristics of porous media namely permeability porosity bed height water saturation and particle size were found to affect the hydrate formation kinetics a process for simultaneous co2 capture and seawater desalination using propane as co guest was also presented to attain water recovery of 60 80 pressure of 60 bar and 1 h operating time further improvement in reactor design was continued by the group and a novel prototype design for the hydrate based desalination process was reported in the latest study 57 starting with 3 wt nacl solution as feed water recovery and salt rejection of 34 85 and 87 5 were achieved respectively application of nonporous metallic packing ss 316 having high thermal conductivity in a fixed bed reactor has been investigated in another study significant enhancement in hydrate formation kinetics in terms of former gas uptake rate 115 mol min 1 m 3 was reported concerning co2 hydrate formation toward carbon capture application 58 however the performance was lower than the porous silica material used in the previous studies 56 the structure modification of metallic packing towards the higher surface area to volume ratio was proposed as the scope of improvement while the porous media in fixed column design helps in better former water contact with enhanced hydrate formation rate the separation of porous media from the hydrate may be a major challenge from the operational viewpoint 4 2 separator and washer the hydrate slurry formed in reactors is a complex mixture of hydrates and residual liquid concentrate existing as a multi phase system if not separated adequately the remaining liquid may trap inside the hydrate interstices resulting in a decrease in product water quality obtained from the dissociation of hydrates therefore an efficient separation of hydrate phase from residual liquid phase is desirable to achieve higher quality water also washing hydrate crystal surface during or after separation can enhance the crystal purity by removing the adhered impurities different filtration devices used to separate hydrate crystals from the liquid phase include basket type centrifuge tube type centrifuge vacuum filter pressure filter press etc in an early investigation the hydrate crystal filtration and washing steps were operated in batch mode due to the slow kinetics typically associated with hydrate formation 19 with the advent of continuous hydrate formation with improved kinetics tubular wash columns were designed to remove excess salt entrapped in the interstitial spaces of hydrate crystals 20 22 the clathrate slurry from the crystallizer is fed to the wash column see fig 9 the clathrate crystals are agglomerate into a permeable crystal pack and grow upward by differential pressure the top of the pack is scraped off and collected in a surrounding tank in a recent work dong et al 29 have studied the hydrate removal mechanism from the mother liquor employing various solid liquid separation methods namely vacuum filtration vf washing with a former and vacuum filtration whvf washing with fresh water and vacuum filtration wfvf and vacuum filtration and centrifugation vfc amongst these methods vfc was found to be the most effective method due to associated low cost and high removal efficiency in conclusion the solid liquid separation method was identified as an essential means for improving removal efficiency while using hydrate technology for wastewater treatment 4 3 in situ hydrate based desalination technology in situ hydrate based desalination technology for use in oceans has also been described in several patents 21 40 in this approach hydrate former gas or mixture of gases is injected through a submerged pipeline and mixed with water at sufficiently high pressures and or low temperatures to form buoyant hydrate instantaneously at the base of a treatment column located at sea hydrate formed at the bottom of the column i e the hydrate stability zone rises under buoyancy and crosses into the zone of instability these hydrate crystals are washed and subsequently melted to produce salt free water hydrate forming agent is recycled for re injection through the pipeline these methodologies may be restricted to ocean based near sea installations in another variation of the above method phelps et al 41 presented a pressure vessel combined with co flow injection technology to form methane and co2 hydrates for removal of salt and soluble materials from produced water in oil and gas fields a hydrate former is injected along with produced water to a pressure vessel to form clathrate hydrates subsequently a rapid depressurization well below the hydrate stability zone results in the escaping of former gas to produce ice like crystals these crystals are stored on the elevated screen to drain out surface saline water and to recover freshwater ice with reduced salt trapped in the pore space co flow injection techniques can be efficient for heat exchange between upward flow slurry and downward injected clathrate former in counter current arrangement the longer pipe lengths give rise to increased retention time which may result in large crystal formation building these desalination plants near the ocean can help in reducing the power consumption for seawater pumping natural condition of high pressure and low temperature available in deep ocean for in situ hydrate desalination system near coast can be exploited with reduced capital expenditure required for hydrate formation otherwise 4 4 multi functional hydrate formation and separation process several multi functional systems that combine two or more unit operations i e hydrate formation separation washing dissociation in one single unit have also been reported in the literature an early patent by walton 59 describes a continuous process utilizing a multi chamber device for the conversion of salt laden water into usable salt free water the system consists of a vertical tower having separate chambers as shown in fig 10 saline water and clathrate former propane is feed to the bottom of the tower to form propane clathrate crystals the crystals being less dense than liquid rises as a compact bed in the liquid the residual brine is separated from the crystals in the brine removal chamber in the washing chamber clean water is introduced to wash the rising clathrate crystals the water temperature was maintained between the melting point of the clathrate crystals and the freezing point of water the washed clathrate crystals are heated in the separation chamber using the heat of vaporization of propane and the pure water is collected for storage from the bottom of this chamber for the large scale operation such segmental columns needs to be designed considering the fact that the kinetics or rates associated with hydrate formation washing and dissociation operations are different in addition the possibility of weeping or flooding of such multi chamber columns needs to be studied before scale up in a very recent work 60 a multi functional gas hydrate apparatus consisting of a hydrate reactor with a movable plunger and a quick separator has been investigated the integrated reactor and separator design enabled various operation modes and separation methods in the first variant with a plunger located at the top hydrate is formed after contacting co2 c3h8 gas mixture with seawater at specified temperature and pressure subsequently two separation modes based on the plunger movement have been proposed in the first separation mode the residual wastewater was drained out without a plunger movement leftover solid hydrates post drainage were melted and recovered as product water in second separation mode the plunger movement was used to separate quick separator followed by three treatment methods i e squeezing purging and extracting it was found that squeezing and purging methods have greatly improved the desalination efficiency 80 subsequently a continuous mode of operation including multi time injection separation washing and purging was demonstrated with the freshwater recovery of more than 30 with 80 overall desalination efficiency this novel design having a continuous mode of operation seems promising towards the development of the hydrate based wastewater treatment 4 5 hybrid hydrate and ro systems the application of hybrid processes which combine two or more operations e g hydrate technology with membrane technology have also been investigated to synergize the wastewater treatment process in the context of seawater desalination lee et al 61 have proposed an optimal design approach for gas hydrate gh and reverse osmosis ro hybrid system in their system gh and ro units were configured in series wherein the seawater was fed to the gh system the desalinated product water from gh was sent to the ro unit as feed and concentrate was rejected the permeate from the ro unit was collected as product water and the retentate was recycled to the feed stream of the gh process for the gh process with 90 salt rejection ro recovery of 0 8 and energy consumption of 1 9 kw h m3 was achieved in this hybrid system such hybrid systems can be of more relevance for hyper saline water treatment where the ro system becomes energy intensive and expensive 5 process economics clathrate hydrate technologies for wastewater treatment are at the development stage and reliable economic analysis is critical for large scale implementation while a large amount of literature exists toward equipment and process development limited work has been reported about economic evaluations of this technology javanmardi and moshfeghian 62 have reported the economic evaluation and cost estimation of a hydrate desalination process a modified process based on an earlier work by knox and co workers incorporating heat exchangers reactor separator decomposer compressor and pumps was synthesized a computer program based on mass and energy balance was used to estimate capital operation and maintenance costs an economic evaluation of a propane former based hydrate process in comparison to msf and ro for desalination was carried out and the same is presented in table 1 the capital investment per tonne of product water in the case of the hydrate process was found to be relatively higher as compared to msf and ro this can be attributed to the increased number of unit operations involved in the hydrate process however the operating cost per tonne of product water for this process is lower it was suggested that the total product cost could further be reduced using suitable promoters which can enhance hydrate formation kinetics and by implementing this technology in colder regions where associated refrigeration cost may be lower the economic feasibility of the low temperatures hydrate process can be constrained by the availability of low cost refrigeration required to form the hydrates 31 recently potential refrigeration available in a liquefied natural gas lng stream in regasification plants has attracted the attention of researchers to overcome the need for an external refrigeration cycle employed in the traditional hydrate based desalination process 31 63 a propane former based hydrate desalination process colden hydesal was synthesized and evaluated the specific energy consumption for the proposed process was estimated to be 0 60 0 84 kw h m3 as against 65 13 65 29 kw h m3 for a traditional hydrate process the authors concluded that the colden hydesal process is an energy efficient process and can potentially be used to desalinate seawater and higher concentration brines prevalent near lng regasification terminals in a subsequent work on economic analysis of colden hydesal process the levelized cost of water was estimated to be 1 11 m3 which strongly supports the commercialization of this integrated process in the near future 64 in a subsequent investigation by this group a cyclopentane based hydrate desalination was reported to have even lower specific energy consumption 0 35 kw h m3 and fixed capital cost than propane based process subjected to availability of lng cold these integrated processes reported here show the potential of hydrate technology for the treatment of wastewater and hypersaline water with much lower energy requirement in the overall process 50 it is evident that several studies in the area of equipment design with a focus in enhancing hydrate formation and improving water recovery using various configurations have attempted by researchers however the techno economic feasibility studies of new configurations have not been under taken further opportunities for suitable heat integration utilizing the specific and latent heat associated with hydrate formation and dissociation process needs be examined to improve the overall process efficiency the prospect of harnessing energy from renewable sources like solar wind geothermal and waste energy source like thermal power plants for clathrate hydrate process can also be explored in the near future to make the process sustainable 6 summary because of their ability to capture pure water molecules from aqueous solutions clathrate hydrate have the potential to treat wastewater and high salinity water this review article explores the developments undertaken to realize hydrate based process towards a commercial technology several advancements by researchers in recent times to tackle the issues of slow kinetics energy requirements and efficient separation associated with clathrate hydrate technology supports its techno feasibility water treatment processes employing hydrate formers having lower equilibrium formation pressure at a given temperature are desirable from the energetics viewpoint while potential formers existing in either gas or liquid state can be used the application of gas formers is favorable from ease of separation standpoint towards addressing the issue of slower kinetics associated with hydrates the use of suitable hydrate former and promoters surfactants to enhance the rate of hydrate nucleation and growth is recommended improving the hydrate formation kinetics will favor the continuous mode of operation at the plant scale nevertheless the effect of surfactant concentration on product water quality has to be considered depending upon the end application of product water further investigations on natural and benign promoters can help reducing the negative impact of surfactants on the product water quality with regard to desalination hydrate based technology has been proven to be competitive and economic in comparison with the conventional thermal and membrane based techniques the process intensification undertaken over the years provide a strong case to promote the use of hydrate technology for water treatment application yet further estimations of economic viability of proposed reactor and washing configurations toward commercialization is essential it would be interesting to explore the adequate integration opportunities available for hydrate technology for instance the potential refrigeration load available at lng regasification terminals can be utilized for hydrate based water reclamation to reduce the total energy consumption associated with clathrate hydrate technology also the application of hybrid processes e g hydrate process ro could be attractive for improved water quality and energy recovery simultaneously implementation of renewable energy sources like solar wind etc may further synergize this technology in the near future however a detailed techno economic analysis to estimate the feasibility and costs of such integrations is essential to validate this conclusion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
