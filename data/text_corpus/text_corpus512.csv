2560,under the influences of global climate change and intense human activities the hydrological and biogeochemical processes have been undergoing profound changes in most of the world s watersheds however the long term changes in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes and quantitative attribution of these changes from a basin wide perspective are incompletely understood here we examined the trends of streamflow sediment load and total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and dissolved inorganic carbon dic fluxes in the mississippi river basin mrb and its four major tributary basins during the 1930s 2010s and major causes for streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes changes were quantified the streamflow increased significantly p 0 05 in the entire basin except for the arkansas river basin while the sediment load significantly decreased except in the arkansas river basin and upper mrb generally the tn flux reduced except for an increasing trend in the upper mrb while the tp flux rose except for a decrease in the ohio river basin and the dic flux increased significantly the strength of the relationship between nutrient flux and streamflow sediment load showed four binary patterns and in general the nutrient fluxes were more strongly correlated with streamflow compared to sediment load over the past 80 years the increasing precipitation in the mrb has made the most contribution 67 on average to the river discharge increase whereas human activities contribute the most 58 to the changes in the sediment load and nutrient fluxes the sediment yield coefficient decreased linearly with the increasing impermeable area proportion river revetment length and dam storage capacity p 0 05 in the mrb the decrease in tn flux probably resulted from sedimentation and denitrification in reservoirs and wetlands and increases in farm fertilizer and manure use were the two main factors contributing to the increased tp flux in addition the agricultural practices increased precipitation and raised temperature jointly led to an increase in the dic flux this study provides quantitative results of water sediment nutrient variations in the entire watershed system which facilitates development of watershed management strategies keywords mississippi river basin streamflow and sediment load nutrient fluxes human activities climate change basin wide perspective data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world s climate has changed rapidly over the last 100 years with increasing temperature and extreme precipitation frequency caused by global warming due to excessive carbon emissions which have significantly affected the hydrological processes ipcc 2022 as the world s population increased from about 1 7 billion in 1900 to 7 7 billion united nations 2022 there has been rapid global urbanization and extensive modification of river systems through impoundments diversions and land use land cover changes intended to meet water supply energy flood control and transportation needs nilsson et al 2005 dierauer et al 2012 best 2019 it is increasingly evident that these human activities affect the composition of rivers howarth et al 2012 wilkinson et al 2022 consequently significant changes have taken place in the fluxes and variability of streamflow discharge sediment load and nutrient transport in many large river systems on earth substantially affecting their global cycle patterns and the global carbon fixation and transport processes milly et al 2005 syvitski et al 2022 since the mid twentieth century 24 of the world s larger rivers have experienced significant changes in water flux and 40 of them in sediment flux li et al 2020a along with the changes in river water and sediment discharges terrestrial fluxes of nitrogen n and phosphorus p have also grown severalfold in the past century seitzinger et al 2010 metson et al 2017 munn et al 2018 and become the main driver of the increased fluvial transport of nutrients into the sea that has risen by 10 15 times in recent decades howarth et al 2012 many studies have been conducted on the effects of climate change and human activities on river discharge schilling et al 2010 sediment transport van metre and horowitz 2013 and nutrient loads seitzinger et al 2010 into the coastal waters in different geographical regions collectively these studies advanced our understanding of fluvial and biogeochemical processes in the anthropocene however most of these studies focused on assessing riverine responses over time to the combined influence of climate change and human activities quantifying the individual contribution of these two stressors is needed to develop effective management strategies and plans to address future challenges the mississippi river mr is an iconic and complex large river where streamflow sediment and nutrients are significantly affected by climate change and intensive human activities including extensive agricultural activities intensive dam and reservoir construction and significant land use land cover changes raymond and cole 2003 raymond et al 2008 tran and o neill 2013 the streamflow in the mississippi river basin mrb including its major tributaries i e missouri upper mississippi ohio and arkansas rivers increased from the 1930s to around 2000 with a remarkable change point in the hydrological process around 1970 rossi et al 2009 massei et al 2011 the suspended sediment flux to the coast declined from an average of 350 mt yr 1 during 1952 1962 to 200 mt yr 1 during 1963 2009 li et al 2020b which can be attributed to anthropogenic activities principally the construction of large reservoirs on the missouri river in the 1950s rossi et al 2009 the mr discharges a large quantity of nutrients annually resulting in the formation of the 2nd largest man made hypoxic zone in the world in the northern gulf of mexico allison and pratt 2017 risal and parajuli 2019 rabalais and turner 2019 total phosphorus concentrations in 26 subbasins of the mrb increased with farmland cover and decreased with forest cover and water wetland cover during the period 2013 to 2017 allafta et al 2021 turner and rabalais 2004 estimated annual loads of c n and p from 1973 to 1994 for six watersheds in the mrb and concluded that their yields mainly came from the upper mr and ohio river basins furthermore a large increase in bicarbonate flux to ocean occurred in the mrb raymond et al 2008 although many studies have examined the water sediment changes or nutrient flux changes in the outlet the mrb or its main tributary basins kemp et al 2016 schilling et al 2010 van metre and horowitz 2013 mize et al 2018 the long term and basin wide changes in river loads of water sediment and nutrients still need further study and the relationships of the nutrient fluxes with sediment transport and river discharge are still less clear furthermore a quantitative study on how the changes in climate conditions and land surface characteristics in the mrb contribute to total loading over a relatively long period is lacking therefore we hypothesize that due to the complexity of geology geomorphology and human impacts in the whole basin the long term variations in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes and their major causes would show strong spatial heterogeneity in this study we gathered datasets covering the interval from the 1930s to the 2010s at the outlets of mr and its four major tributaries to provide a long time series study on the changes in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes and their quantitative attribution analysis for the entire basin specifically our objectives were to 1 analyze the basin wide trends of streamflow sediment load and fluxes of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and dissolved inorganic carbon dic of the mrb in recent decades 2 explore the relationships of nutrient fluxes with sediment transport and river discharge and 3 quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on variations of these fluvial fluxes and establish the quantitative relationships of sediment yield and nutrient fluxes with land surface characteristics of the basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mr originates from lake itasca in northwestern minnesota usa flows through the south central part of the north american continent spans 31 states in the united states and two provinces in canada and flows southward into the gulf of mexico fig 1 its drainage area is 3 24 million km2 making it the third largest drainage basin in the world and seventh in terms of streamflow and sediment load rosen and xu 2015 the southeast region of the mrb is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with hot and rainy summers and mild and less rainy winters the remaining features in a temperate continental climate zone with less precipitation and larger temperature differences in winter and summer jha et al 2004 the long term average precipitation and temperature across the mrb are 749 91 mm and 9 85 respectively and the multi year average streamflow sediment load and sediment concentration from the mrb to the ocean are 555 27 km3 yr 237 09 mt yr 1 and 0 33 kg m 3 respectively using the obtained data described in section 2 2 the mrb consists of five sub basins including the upper mrb 16 5 of the total catchment area the missouri river basin 44 6 the ohio river basin 15 2 the arkansas river basin 15 4 and the lower mrb 8 3 rossi et al 2009 meade and moody 2010 agricultural land use is widely distributed throughout the mrb and accounts for 30 of the overall drainage area since the 1980s falcone 2018 most cropland is in the upper mrb and contains the highest percentage of corn and soybean acreage of all the basins zhang and schilling 2006 in addition there are 50 000 dams and reservoirs constructed in the mrb during the past century syvitski and milliman 2007 and approximately 40 000 dams in the missouri river basin usace 2016 rodriguez et al 2020 more details of the mrb and the sub basins can be found in blum and roberts 2014 2 2 data sources in this study nine hydrological stations in the outlet of the upper mrb the missouri river basin the ohio river basin the arkansas river basin and the lower mrb were selected as they can represent the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed features and have long term hydrological records fig 1 the streamflow sediment load and nutrient flux data used in this study are summarized in table 1 daily streamflow during 1931 2018 and sediment load data from around 1950 to 2017 were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs https maps waterdata usgs gov the data is further supplemented by the usgs national water quality assessment nawqa data set https nrtwq usgs gov nwqn only the streamflow data of the mr in 2008 and the upper mr in 1982 were missed the mr flows into the gulf of mexico through two outlets the mainstem channel of the mr and the atchafalaya river in 1963 the u s army corps of engineers usace completed a diversion project of the old river between the mr and the atchafalaya river that diverts approximately one third of the flow from the mr into the atchafalaya river meade and moody 2010 xu et al 2021 the amount of sediment transported from the atchafalaya river at the simmesport station station ⑧ combines suspended sediment from the mr and red river fig 1 therefore the combined measured sediment loads at tarbert landing station station ⑦ located downstream of the bifurcation that links the atchafalaya river and simmesport station is the total sediment discharge from the mr system to the ocean the tn and tp flux data at the hydrological stations during the 1970s 2010s are from the usgs nawqa table 1 missing data were estimated by using the weighted regression on time discharge and season wrtds model according to the discrete concentration data from the unfiltered water sample and daily streamflow data obtained in usgs heimann et al 2011 stackpoole et al 2021 data revisions are rare because of usgs quality assurance practices including documentation of all data before they are officially approved only the tp flux data of the upper mr in 1995 and 1996 were missed the data on dic to the ocean from 1931 to 2004 were obtained from the sewage and water board of new orleans where the inorganic carbon concentrations are calculated from alkalinity titrations raymond et al 2008 the homogeneity and reliability of streamflow sediment load and nutrient flux data were checked and firmly controlled by the usgs before the data were released this set of data has better consistency and less uncertainty and has been widely used in many studies the monthly gridded temperature and precipitation data during 1931 2018 are from the prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model at a 4 km resolution https www prism oregonstate edu the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman method data on the dam storage from 1972 to 2013 impermeable area from 1974 to 2012 cropland area from 1974 to 2012 fig s1 and the other human activities data fertilizer application soybean and corn yield total nitrogen wet deposition livestock production and housing unit number etc from the 1970s to the 2010s fig s2 are from the usgs data set summarized by falcone 2018 data on the cumulative river revetments from 1952 to 1973 fig s1 were extracted from westphal and munger 1976 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 mann kendall trend test and double mass curve we used the bootstrap based nonparametric mann kendal test that was first proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 and improved by yue and pilon 2004 it has been widely used to detect the trend in long time series the method does not require sample distribution to follow certain laws nor is it disturbed by a few outliers so here it is used for the analysis of non normal distribution data such as precipitation streamflow sediment load nutrient fluxes and other hydrological factors the double mass curve between annual precipitation and streamflow as well as sediment load was used to determine the abrupt change points in the variations of streamflow and sediment load hassan et al 2010 figs s3 and s4 similarly the double mass curve between annual streamflow and nutrient fluxes was also used to determine the abrupt change point in the variations of nutrient fluxes fig s5 2 3 2 attribution analysis of streamflow change the elastic coefficient method based on the budyko hypothesis is used to evaluate the sensitivity of streamflow to various environmental factors and to quantitatively analyze the contribution of climate change and human activities to streamflow change budyko 1974 considered that the actual evapotranspiration e is mainly controlled by water supply precipitation p and energy supply on a long time scale based on the budyko hypothesis choudhury 1999 and yang et al 2008 derived the coupled water and heat balance equation which have received the most attention and application the choudhury yang formula reveals that under certain climate and underlying surface conditions the long term hydrological and climatic characteristics of the watershed follow the principle of water and energy balance 1 e p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where e is the long term average annual actual evapotranspiration p is the long term average annual precipitation e 0 is the long term average annual potential evapotranspiration and n is the parameter reflecting the characteristics of the underlying surface of the watershed which includes topography soil and vegetation under the long time hydrological series the water balance equation can be written as p e r r is the average annual runoff and the underlying surface parameter n can be obtained by combining the above formula the elastic coefficient of runoff is the ratio of the change rate of runoff to the change rate of an impact factor the elastic coefficient of each impact factor can be expressed as yang et al 2008 2 ε p 1 ϕ n 1 n 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 n ϕ 3 ε e 0 1 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 n 4 ε n l n 1 ϕ n ϕ n l n 1 ϕ n n 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 n 1 where εp εe 0 and εn are the elasticity of runoff to p e 0 and n respectively then the runoff change caused by each factor δr and the corresponding contribution of each factor can be determined yang et al 2008 5 δ r p ε p r p δ p 6 δ r e 0 ε e 0 r e 0 δ e 0 7 δ r n ε n r n δ n where δrp δre 0 and δrn are the runoff change caused by p e 0 and n respectively it should be noted that the budyko model have different forms and the forms considering watershed specific parameter were shown to be virtually identical yang et al 2008 for attribution analysis of runoff change based on these budyko forms the obtained results are nearly the same wu et al 2017 2 3 3 attribution analysis of sediment load and nutrient flux change the analysis method of sediment load change was based on the kaya identity in economics kauppi et al 2006 raupach et al 2007 which was initially used in the yellow river basin wang et al 2016 the relative rate of change of river sediment load s kg is considered to be caused by p water yield capacity cr m3 mm the ratio of streamflow to precipitation q p and sediment concentration s kg m3 the ratio of sediment load to streamflow s q the specific calculation formula of sediment attribution diagnosis analysis is 8 s p q p s q p c r s in this method the proportional change rate of x t is defined as r x x 1 dx dt and the value of r x was calculated by dividing the changing rate of x by its average value therefore the proportion change rate of sediment load is written as 9 ds d t s d p c r s d t s dp d t p d c r d t r ds d t s then the counterpart for proportional change rates of sediment load can be further simplified as wang et al 2016 10 r s r p r c r r s the water yield capacity and sediment concentration could be estimated as the following regression function of precipitation established in the reference period zhao et al 2022 11 log c r α log p ω 0 12 log s β log p ω 1 where α β ω 0 and ω 1 are the regression coefficients thus the relative change of r cr and r s caused by precipitation is αr p and βr p respectively therefore the relative change of sediment load is estimated by 13 r s 1 α β r p r c r r s α β r p in eq 13 the first term represents the relative change of sediment load caused by precipitation and the second term represents that caused by human activities the relative contribution of each identity factor is the ratio of its proportional change rate to the proportional change rate of s during the same period thus the relative contributions of precipitation and human activities to sediment load change could be determined similarly the identified factors of nutrient flux nf kg were decomposed to p cr and nutrient concentration nc kg m3 the ratio of nutrient flux to streamflow nf q the specific calculation formula of nutrient flux attribution diagnosis analysis is 14 nf p q p nf q p c r n c the counterpart for proportional change rates of nutrient flux can be described as 15 r n f r p r c r r n c the relative contributions of precipitation and human activities to nutrient flux could be determined using the same procedure as the attribution analysis of sediment load furthermore the relationships of nutrient fluxes with streamflow and sediment load were established through regression analysis to investigate the roles of hydrological variations in the changes of nutrient fluxes the critical factors influencing sediment load and nutrient fluxes were identified using correlation analysis and the corresponding quantitative relationships were established 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations of streamflow and sediment load the annual streamflow and sediment load showed a high spatiotemporal variation in the mrb and its four tributary basins table 2 the streamflow of the mrb and the four tributary basins all showed a significant upward trend p 0 05 except for the arkansas river fig 2 a table 3 and the streamflow of the mr into the sea increased the most of all sites at 1 68 km3 yr however the sediment load decreased significantly in the missouri river ohio river and mr p 0 05 fig 2b the sediment load in the missouri river a major sediment source of the mr declined the fastest about 2 80 mt yr 1 of the four tributaries while the annual average sediment concentration of these rivers except the arkansas river decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 2c the sediment concentration in the missouri river was always the highest among the rivers and the multi year mean was 192 5 higher than in the mr the whole study period of streamflow is divided into two periods according to the abrupt change points determined by double mass curves i e the first period 1931 1972 pr1 and the second period 1973 2018 pr2 fig s3 while the whole study period of sediment load is divided into three periods including the first period from 1949 to around 1985 ps1 the second period from around 1985 to 1999 ps2 and the third period from 2000 to 2018 ps3 fig s4 the multi year averages of streamflow and sediment load during different periods are in table s1 compared with the pr1 the streamflow of the upper mississippi missouri ohio arkansas and mississippi rivers during the pr2 increased by 34 1 33 6 19 1 27 4 and 22 2 respectively compared with ps1 the sediment load of the upper mississippi missouri ohio and mississippi rivers during ps2 decreased by 27 4 48 5 26 6 and 27 4 respectively while that of the arkansas river increased by 381 4 compared with the ps1 the sediment load of the upper mississippi missouri ohio and mississippi rivers during ps3 decreased by 32 9 70 1 36 7 and 48 7 respectively while that of the arkansas river increased by 148 0 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of nutrient fluxes the trend and significance of the nutrient fluxes of the mr and its four tributaries are in fig 2 and table 3 respectively the tn fluxes of these rivers all showed a downward trend except for the upper mr while only the trend in the ohio river was significant p 0 05 fig 2d the tp fluxes of these rivers all showed an upward trend except for the ohio river and the trend in the mr was significant with a rate of 0 76 103 tons yr 1 p 0 05 fig 2e the dic flux of the mr increased significantly with a rate of 1 19 105 tons yr 1 p 0 05 fig 2f according to the double mass curves between annual streamflow and nutrient fluxes the change points of tn flux in 1988 tp flux in 1998 and dic flux in 1972 were identified fig s5 the mean fluxes and concentrations of tn tp and dic during different periods in the mr and its four tributaries are in table s2 from the 1970s 1988 to 1989 2010s the annual average tn flux and concentration decreased except in the upper mr which was consistent with the overall trend moreover the largest contributor to the reduction in tn flux from the mr to the sea is the missouri river whose tn flux decreased by 21 23 from the 1970s 1998 to 1999 2010s the annual average tp flux and concentration in all rivers increased with the missouri river increasing the most 41 6 and 51 8 respectively from 1931 to 1972 to 1973 2004 the annual average dic flux and concentration in the mr increased by 33 75 and 9 9 respectively 3 3 relationships of nutrient fluxes with streamflow and sediment load the relationships of tn tp and dic fluxes with annual streamflow and sediment load in the mrb and its four tributary basins are in fig 3 in most cases the tn tp and dic fluxes had a strong correlation with their corresponding streamflow r 2 0 6 p 0 01 however there was a large uncertainty in the relationship between nutrient flux and sediment load therefore according to the strength of the relationship between nutrient flux and streamflow sediment load four binary types were classified double strong ds r 2 0 5 one strong and one weak sw ws and double weak dw r 2 0 5 of these sw means that the nutrient flux has a strong relationship with streamflow and a weak relationship with sediment load while ws is the opposite therefore the type of tn flux in the missouri river and tn flux and tp flux in the arkansas river was ds the type of tp fluxes in the upper mississippi and ohio rivers tn flux in the ohio river and dic flux in the mr was sw the type of tn flux in the mr was ws the type of tn fluxes in the upper mr and tp fluxes in the missouri river and the mr was dw table 4 3 4 attribution of streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes changes runoff is most sensitive to changes in precipitation in the mrb as indicated by the average elasticity coefficient of 2 14 1 14 and 1 37 for p e 0 and n respectively table s3 precipitation plays the most important influence on the increase of streamflow in the mr such that from ps1 to ps2 precipitation makes the largest contribution 50 among all rivers fig 4 the linear relationships between precipitation and runoff in the entire mrb were significant r 2 0 5 p 0 05 except for the missouri river basin r 2 0 46 fig s6 however the role of the underlying surface change cannot be ignored for example the contributions of underlying surface factor n to runoff change from ps1 to ps2 in the upper mr and missouri river were 45 7 and 42 0 respectively human activities were the dominant factor for the reduction in sediment load in the mrb fig 5 the contributions of human activities to sediment load reduction from ps1 to ps2 from ps2 to ps3 and from ps1 to ps3 58 were larger than precipitation whose contributions were mostly 30 human activities contributed 80 to the sediment load reductions in the missouri river and from the mr to the sea in addition the significantly increased precipitation p 0 05 table 3 always increased sediment yield playing a negative effect on sediment load reduction fig 5 overall human activities dominated the changes in tn tp and dic fluxes in the mrb fig 6 the contributions 59 of human activities to the changes of tn tp and dic fluxes were larger than precipitation in detail human activities decreased tn fluxes with contributions of 69 6 93 7 and increased tn flux in the upper mr with a contribution of 63 0 human activities contributed 59 2 95 0 to increased tp in all rivers and 76 1 to dic fluxes increase from the mr to the sea in addition increased precipitation always played an increasing effect on nutrient fluxes fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 responses of streamflow and sediment load to climate change and human activities the percentage contribution of precipitation to increased streamflow in each river basin from pr1 to pr2 was higher than 52 fig 4 which indicates that the impact of climate change on streamflow changes is higher than that of human activities indeed the precipitation in the mrb and the four tributary basins all showed a significant increase p 0 05 table 3 and there was significantly linear relationships between precipitation and runoff fig s6 although precipitation dominated the changes in the streamflow of the mrb the underlying surface factor n of the four tributary basins had 20 of the impact on streamflow increases especially in the upper mr and missouri river basins the underlying surface factor n respectively contributed 45 7 and 42 0 to the increase in streamflow which may be mainly related to the increased proportion of cropland area and cropland drainage channel construction tile drainage fig s1 raymond et al 2008 schilling et al 2010 human activities were the most important factors leading to the decrease in sediment transport in the mrb during the study interval and the quantitative contribution of human activities has been obtained in this study to further quantify the impact of human activities the main anthropogenic factors influencing sediment load i e proportion of impermeable area cumulative length of the revetments and cumulative dam storage capacity were identified using the correlation analysis fig 7 a and the quantitative relationships between sediment yield coefficient and above factors were made in the mrb the sediment yield coefficient decreased linearly with the increase in the proportion of impermeable area fig 7b the cumulative length of the revetments fig 7c and the cumulative dam storage capacity fig 7d r 2 0 5 p 0 05 therefore sediment discharge was reduced considerably owing to these anthropogenic activities i e dam construction the numerous smaller engineering structures meander cutoffs river training structures and bank revetments and other soil conservation practices throughout the mrb system meade and moody 2010 however the proportion of cropland area showed an increasing trend from the 1970s to the 2010s fig s1 except from 1982 to 1992 due to the implementation of the us conservation reserve program in 1986 stackpoole et al 2021 accordingly leading to largely enhanced erosion over the past decades yet numerous engineering structures such as reservoirs dams revetments and levees intercepted sediment yielding from the cropland westphal and munger 1976 heimann et al 2011 furthermore river dam construction is a major factor in sediment reduction in global rivers syvitski and kettner 2011 walling 2012 the fort randall dam 1952 and the garrison dam 1953 built in the missouri river were especially important in causing the change point of sediment load in 1952 and changed the sediment load regime of the missouri river and downstream accordingly the sediment load in the missouri river basin decreased linearly with the increase in the proportion of impermeable area and the cumulative dam capacity r 2 0 75 p 0 05 fig s7 along with the dam construction other river engineering projects were taken after the 1927 mr mega flood these include channel stabilization bank revetment river widening and in channel dike building which collectively contributed to reducing bank erosion and sediment transport wang and xu 2018 li et al 2020b 4 2 critical influencing factors of nutrient fluxes the dominant agricultural land uses in the mrb significantly changed the concentration of nutrients mitsch et al 2001 turner and rabalais 2003 turner et al 2007 and carbon raymond et al 2008 ren et al 2016 in the last century alexander et al 2008 estimated that agricultural sources in the watersheds contribute 70 of the delivered n and p to the gulf of mexico there is evidence that tn and tp mainly came from applied fertilizers and manure and were partially fixed by the crops mainly soybean and corn stackpoole et al 2021 the actual tn flux in the mr has been decreasing insignificantly since the 1970s while it has an increasing trend from 2000 onwards fig 2d in contrast with the increasing nitrogen production caused mainly by significantly increasing fertilizer nitrogen and population density housing unit number etc p 0 05 fig s2 accordingly the tn flux was not significantly or even negatively correlated with the related nitrogen sources such as fertilizer nitrogen and positively correlated with some nitrogen sinks e g planted soybeans table s4 however the tn flux was significantly negatively correlated with the total dam storage capacity in the basin p 0 05 fig 8 table s4 therefore the decrease of tn flux in the mr probably can be attributed to sedimentation and denitrification in the transport process such as in the riverine corridor wetlands noe and hupp 2009 bryantmason et al 2013 and reservoir and dam in the river hansen et al 2018 xu et al 2020 which may lead to the strong linear relationship between tn fluxes and sediment loads in the missouri and arkansas rivers fig 3 furthermore the nitrogen reduction measures implemented since the 1970s may have also played a role in tn reduction such as the clean water act of 1972 litke 1999 and the regional nitrogen oxide reduction plan nox interstate implementation plan after 2003 usepa 2008 the tp flux in the mr was linearly and positively correlated with total soybean yield total corn yield fertilizer phosphorus cropland area proportion and housing unit number fig 8 table s4 which corresponds to the two major sources farm fertilizer and manure use stackpoole et al 2021 although the reservoirs behind the dams intercepted particulate phosphorus in the sediment the increased streamflow increased dissolved phosphorus as indicated in fig 2 and so the tp flux was more correlated with streamflow compared to sediment load according to raymond et al 2008 the increase in streamflow was mainly due to the increase in agricultural watershed discharge which contains p from the increasing applied farm fertilizer and manure use fig s2 therefore the increasing farm fertilizer and manure use are the two identifiable factors that mainly caused the increase of tp flux in the mr the dic in river waters is mainly derived from chemical weathering which in turn reflects meteorological factors e g rainfall and temperature and soil properties among these the increased precipitation and agricultural practices on agricultural land are the dominant factors in the increase of dic in the mrb raymond and cole 2003 raymond et al 2008 this idea is precisely corroborated by our results that an increase in dic flux is accompanied by an increase in cropland area fig s1 and its strong linear correlation with precipitation r 2 0 64 p 0 05 and potential evapotranspiration r 2 0 48 p 0 05 fig 8 the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon reported in this study is quite large but we are not certain how much of it originates from the effluent of wastewater as the treatment plants are not required to remove carbon the discharges after primary and secondary treatments may still contain large amounts of dissolved carbon nishijima et al 2003 in addition precipitation in the mrb increased significantly p 0 01 providing reactants and transport for chemical weathering table 3 and agricultural liming may have provided a considerable source of carbon carbonate raymond et al 2008 furthermore temperatures in all the tributary basins of the mr have continued to rise in recent decades reiman and xu 2019 fig s8 and higher temperatures increase soil temperature soil mineralization and the leaching of dissolved carbon in the soil wallenstein and weintraub 2008 results from the modeling work of ren et al 2015 predict that river dic flux will increase by as much as 65 in the next 100 years due to the increasing precipitation flow and atmospheric temperature 4 3 comparison with other large rivers the variations of river streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes in the world s large rivers differed in time and space and the effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change on the changes in water sediment and nutrient fluxes also showed strong heterogeneity nilsson et al 2005 li et al 2020a the dominant factor of streamflow changes used to be precipitation yet the anthropogenic contribution increased in recent decades while anthropogenic activities in recent decades dominated the change of sediment load in most large rivers including dam and reservoir construction deforestation or vegetation restoration and so on yin et al 2021 however there are a few studies on nutrient flux changes based on a long time series of measurements because of the lack of data although the changes and causes in nutrient fluxes from large rivers to the sea are even more difficult to discern due to the complexity of nutrient source and distribution we reviewed relevant published studies in conjunction with this study and identified three main factors affecting nutrient fluxes from large rivers to the ocean i e dam construction agricultural activities and human emissions table 5 in general dam construction appears to be a major factor leading to some nutrient flux reduction while agricultural activities e g farm fertilizer applications and anthropogenic emissions e g wastewater discharge and manure can lead to increases in the fluxes of some nutrients although the nutrients are contained in streamflow and sediment discharge the relationships between nutrient fluxes and streamflow as well as sediment load differed among large rivers which have important implications for watershed management to reduce nutrient flux in the mississippi rhine and mekong rivers the trends in nutrient fluxes are accompanied by a similar change in streamflow and or sediment load table 5 however the tn and tp fluxes in the yellow river and yangtze river have been increasing regardless of the decrease or at least stability in the streamflow and sediment load the effects of decreasing streamflow and sediment load have been balanced and even exceeded due to high anthropogenic emissions caused by a high population density in the yellow river and yangtze river basin therefore some universal management policies should be retained for the long term such as improving the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer and reducing sewage discharge in addition some targeted management measures in large river basins with specific characteristics should also be adopted such as raising the standards of human emissions from factories in the yellow river and yangtze river basins 5 conclusions this study analyzed the changes in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes in the mississippi river basin separated the quantitative effects of human activities and climate change on their changes in different stages and identified the main factors that drive these changes based on the findings we conclude that streamflow increases are mainly affected by increased precipitation 50 of contribution in the whole basin while human activities also play a crucial role 40 in increasing streamflow in the upper mississippi and missouri rivers human activities contribute the most 58 to the changes in the sediment load and nutrient fluxes the construction of dams and reservoirs bank revetments and impermeable surfaces have strongly reduced the sediment yield coefficient exhibiting a linear decreasing relationship moreover the nutrient fluxes showed stronger linear relationship with streamflow compared to sediment load the decrease in tn flux was mainly attributed to sedimentation and denitrification in the reservoirs and wetlands and the increased farm fertilizer and manure use are the key factors causing the increase in the tp flux in addition the increased precipitation and temperature and agricultural practices may have led to an increase in dic flux in the river this study provides quantitative results of water sediment nutrient variations in the entire watershed system the main novelty of this study is to develop integrated picture of long term changes in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes and provide their quantitative attribution analysis results from a basin wide perspective the findings of this study have important implications for the future river export of sediment and nutrient under global climate change and human activities in the mississippi river rising temperature and precipitation have been projected for the mississippi river basin throughout this century and these trends are anticipated to continue accelerating terrestrial biogeochemical processes and causing increases in soil dissolved carbon production and leaching credit authorship contribution statement shihua yin data curation formal analysis writing original draft

2560,under the influences of global climate change and intense human activities the hydrological and biogeochemical processes have been undergoing profound changes in most of the world s watersheds however the long term changes in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes and quantitative attribution of these changes from a basin wide perspective are incompletely understood here we examined the trends of streamflow sediment load and total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and dissolved inorganic carbon dic fluxes in the mississippi river basin mrb and its four major tributary basins during the 1930s 2010s and major causes for streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes changes were quantified the streamflow increased significantly p 0 05 in the entire basin except for the arkansas river basin while the sediment load significantly decreased except in the arkansas river basin and upper mrb generally the tn flux reduced except for an increasing trend in the upper mrb while the tp flux rose except for a decrease in the ohio river basin and the dic flux increased significantly the strength of the relationship between nutrient flux and streamflow sediment load showed four binary patterns and in general the nutrient fluxes were more strongly correlated with streamflow compared to sediment load over the past 80 years the increasing precipitation in the mrb has made the most contribution 67 on average to the river discharge increase whereas human activities contribute the most 58 to the changes in the sediment load and nutrient fluxes the sediment yield coefficient decreased linearly with the increasing impermeable area proportion river revetment length and dam storage capacity p 0 05 in the mrb the decrease in tn flux probably resulted from sedimentation and denitrification in reservoirs and wetlands and increases in farm fertilizer and manure use were the two main factors contributing to the increased tp flux in addition the agricultural practices increased precipitation and raised temperature jointly led to an increase in the dic flux this study provides quantitative results of water sediment nutrient variations in the entire watershed system which facilitates development of watershed management strategies keywords mississippi river basin streamflow and sediment load nutrient fluxes human activities climate change basin wide perspective data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world s climate has changed rapidly over the last 100 years with increasing temperature and extreme precipitation frequency caused by global warming due to excessive carbon emissions which have significantly affected the hydrological processes ipcc 2022 as the world s population increased from about 1 7 billion in 1900 to 7 7 billion united nations 2022 there has been rapid global urbanization and extensive modification of river systems through impoundments diversions and land use land cover changes intended to meet water supply energy flood control and transportation needs nilsson et al 2005 dierauer et al 2012 best 2019 it is increasingly evident that these human activities affect the composition of rivers howarth et al 2012 wilkinson et al 2022 consequently significant changes have taken place in the fluxes and variability of streamflow discharge sediment load and nutrient transport in many large river systems on earth substantially affecting their global cycle patterns and the global carbon fixation and transport processes milly et al 2005 syvitski et al 2022 since the mid twentieth century 24 of the world s larger rivers have experienced significant changes in water flux and 40 of them in sediment flux li et al 2020a along with the changes in river water and sediment discharges terrestrial fluxes of nitrogen n and phosphorus p have also grown severalfold in the past century seitzinger et al 2010 metson et al 2017 munn et al 2018 and become the main driver of the increased fluvial transport of nutrients into the sea that has risen by 10 15 times in recent decades howarth et al 2012 many studies have been conducted on the effects of climate change and human activities on river discharge schilling et al 2010 sediment transport van metre and horowitz 2013 and nutrient loads seitzinger et al 2010 into the coastal waters in different geographical regions collectively these studies advanced our understanding of fluvial and biogeochemical processes in the anthropocene however most of these studies focused on assessing riverine responses over time to the combined influence of climate change and human activities quantifying the individual contribution of these two stressors is needed to develop effective management strategies and plans to address future challenges the mississippi river mr is an iconic and complex large river where streamflow sediment and nutrients are significantly affected by climate change and intensive human activities including extensive agricultural activities intensive dam and reservoir construction and significant land use land cover changes raymond and cole 2003 raymond et al 2008 tran and o neill 2013 the streamflow in the mississippi river basin mrb including its major tributaries i e missouri upper mississippi ohio and arkansas rivers increased from the 1930s to around 2000 with a remarkable change point in the hydrological process around 1970 rossi et al 2009 massei et al 2011 the suspended sediment flux to the coast declined from an average of 350 mt yr 1 during 1952 1962 to 200 mt yr 1 during 1963 2009 li et al 2020b which can be attributed to anthropogenic activities principally the construction of large reservoirs on the missouri river in the 1950s rossi et al 2009 the mr discharges a large quantity of nutrients annually resulting in the formation of the 2nd largest man made hypoxic zone in the world in the northern gulf of mexico allison and pratt 2017 risal and parajuli 2019 rabalais and turner 2019 total phosphorus concentrations in 26 subbasins of the mrb increased with farmland cover and decreased with forest cover and water wetland cover during the period 2013 to 2017 allafta et al 2021 turner and rabalais 2004 estimated annual loads of c n and p from 1973 to 1994 for six watersheds in the mrb and concluded that their yields mainly came from the upper mr and ohio river basins furthermore a large increase in bicarbonate flux to ocean occurred in the mrb raymond et al 2008 although many studies have examined the water sediment changes or nutrient flux changes in the outlet the mrb or its main tributary basins kemp et al 2016 schilling et al 2010 van metre and horowitz 2013 mize et al 2018 the long term and basin wide changes in river loads of water sediment and nutrients still need further study and the relationships of the nutrient fluxes with sediment transport and river discharge are still less clear furthermore a quantitative study on how the changes in climate conditions and land surface characteristics in the mrb contribute to total loading over a relatively long period is lacking therefore we hypothesize that due to the complexity of geology geomorphology and human impacts in the whole basin the long term variations in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes and their major causes would show strong spatial heterogeneity in this study we gathered datasets covering the interval from the 1930s to the 2010s at the outlets of mr and its four major tributaries to provide a long time series study on the changes in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes and their quantitative attribution analysis for the entire basin specifically our objectives were to 1 analyze the basin wide trends of streamflow sediment load and fluxes of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and dissolved inorganic carbon dic of the mrb in recent decades 2 explore the relationships of nutrient fluxes with sediment transport and river discharge and 3 quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on variations of these fluvial fluxes and establish the quantitative relationships of sediment yield and nutrient fluxes with land surface characteristics of the basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mr originates from lake itasca in northwestern minnesota usa flows through the south central part of the north american continent spans 31 states in the united states and two provinces in canada and flows southward into the gulf of mexico fig 1 its drainage area is 3 24 million km2 making it the third largest drainage basin in the world and seventh in terms of streamflow and sediment load rosen and xu 2015 the southeast region of the mrb is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with hot and rainy summers and mild and less rainy winters the remaining features in a temperate continental climate zone with less precipitation and larger temperature differences in winter and summer jha et al 2004 the long term average precipitation and temperature across the mrb are 749 91 mm and 9 85 respectively and the multi year average streamflow sediment load and sediment concentration from the mrb to the ocean are 555 27 km3 yr 237 09 mt yr 1 and 0 33 kg m 3 respectively using the obtained data described in section 2 2 the mrb consists of five sub basins including the upper mrb 16 5 of the total catchment area the missouri river basin 44 6 the ohio river basin 15 2 the arkansas river basin 15 4 and the lower mrb 8 3 rossi et al 2009 meade and moody 2010 agricultural land use is widely distributed throughout the mrb and accounts for 30 of the overall drainage area since the 1980s falcone 2018 most cropland is in the upper mrb and contains the highest percentage of corn and soybean acreage of all the basins zhang and schilling 2006 in addition there are 50 000 dams and reservoirs constructed in the mrb during the past century syvitski and milliman 2007 and approximately 40 000 dams in the missouri river basin usace 2016 rodriguez et al 2020 more details of the mrb and the sub basins can be found in blum and roberts 2014 2 2 data sources in this study nine hydrological stations in the outlet of the upper mrb the missouri river basin the ohio river basin the arkansas river basin and the lower mrb were selected as they can represent the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed features and have long term hydrological records fig 1 the streamflow sediment load and nutrient flux data used in this study are summarized in table 1 daily streamflow during 1931 2018 and sediment load data from around 1950 to 2017 were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs https maps waterdata usgs gov the data is further supplemented by the usgs national water quality assessment nawqa data set https nrtwq usgs gov nwqn only the streamflow data of the mr in 2008 and the upper mr in 1982 were missed the mr flows into the gulf of mexico through two outlets the mainstem channel of the mr and the atchafalaya river in 1963 the u s army corps of engineers usace completed a diversion project of the old river between the mr and the atchafalaya river that diverts approximately one third of the flow from the mr into the atchafalaya river meade and moody 2010 xu et al 2021 the amount of sediment transported from the atchafalaya river at the simmesport station station ⑧ combines suspended sediment from the mr and red river fig 1 therefore the combined measured sediment loads at tarbert landing station station ⑦ located downstream of the bifurcation that links the atchafalaya river and simmesport station is the total sediment discharge from the mr system to the ocean the tn and tp flux data at the hydrological stations during the 1970s 2010s are from the usgs nawqa table 1 missing data were estimated by using the weighted regression on time discharge and season wrtds model according to the discrete concentration data from the unfiltered water sample and daily streamflow data obtained in usgs heimann et al 2011 stackpoole et al 2021 data revisions are rare because of usgs quality assurance practices including documentation of all data before they are officially approved only the tp flux data of the upper mr in 1995 and 1996 were missed the data on dic to the ocean from 1931 to 2004 were obtained from the sewage and water board of new orleans where the inorganic carbon concentrations are calculated from alkalinity titrations raymond et al 2008 the homogeneity and reliability of streamflow sediment load and nutrient flux data were checked and firmly controlled by the usgs before the data were released this set of data has better consistency and less uncertainty and has been widely used in many studies the monthly gridded temperature and precipitation data during 1931 2018 are from the prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model at a 4 km resolution https www prism oregonstate edu the potential evapotranspiration was estimated using the penman method data on the dam storage from 1972 to 2013 impermeable area from 1974 to 2012 cropland area from 1974 to 2012 fig s1 and the other human activities data fertilizer application soybean and corn yield total nitrogen wet deposition livestock production and housing unit number etc from the 1970s to the 2010s fig s2 are from the usgs data set summarized by falcone 2018 data on the cumulative river revetments from 1952 to 1973 fig s1 were extracted from westphal and munger 1976 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 mann kendall trend test and double mass curve we used the bootstrap based nonparametric mann kendal test that was first proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 and improved by yue and pilon 2004 it has been widely used to detect the trend in long time series the method does not require sample distribution to follow certain laws nor is it disturbed by a few outliers so here it is used for the analysis of non normal distribution data such as precipitation streamflow sediment load nutrient fluxes and other hydrological factors the double mass curve between annual precipitation and streamflow as well as sediment load was used to determine the abrupt change points in the variations of streamflow and sediment load hassan et al 2010 figs s3 and s4 similarly the double mass curve between annual streamflow and nutrient fluxes was also used to determine the abrupt change point in the variations of nutrient fluxes fig s5 2 3 2 attribution analysis of streamflow change the elastic coefficient method based on the budyko hypothesis is used to evaluate the sensitivity of streamflow to various environmental factors and to quantitatively analyze the contribution of climate change and human activities to streamflow change budyko 1974 considered that the actual evapotranspiration e is mainly controlled by water supply precipitation p and energy supply on a long time scale based on the budyko hypothesis choudhury 1999 and yang et al 2008 derived the coupled water and heat balance equation which have received the most attention and application the choudhury yang formula reveals that under certain climate and underlying surface conditions the long term hydrological and climatic characteristics of the watershed follow the principle of water and energy balance 1 e p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where e is the long term average annual actual evapotranspiration p is the long term average annual precipitation e 0 is the long term average annual potential evapotranspiration and n is the parameter reflecting the characteristics of the underlying surface of the watershed which includes topography soil and vegetation under the long time hydrological series the water balance equation can be written as p e r r is the average annual runoff and the underlying surface parameter n can be obtained by combining the above formula the elastic coefficient of runoff is the ratio of the change rate of runoff to the change rate of an impact factor the elastic coefficient of each impact factor can be expressed as yang et al 2008 2 ε p 1 ϕ n 1 n 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 n ϕ 3 ε e 0 1 1 ϕ n 1 1 ϕ n 1 n 4 ε n l n 1 ϕ n ϕ n l n 1 ϕ n n 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 n 1 where εp εe 0 and εn are the elasticity of runoff to p e 0 and n respectively then the runoff change caused by each factor δr and the corresponding contribution of each factor can be determined yang et al 2008 5 δ r p ε p r p δ p 6 δ r e 0 ε e 0 r e 0 δ e 0 7 δ r n ε n r n δ n where δrp δre 0 and δrn are the runoff change caused by p e 0 and n respectively it should be noted that the budyko model have different forms and the forms considering watershed specific parameter were shown to be virtually identical yang et al 2008 for attribution analysis of runoff change based on these budyko forms the obtained results are nearly the same wu et al 2017 2 3 3 attribution analysis of sediment load and nutrient flux change the analysis method of sediment load change was based on the kaya identity in economics kauppi et al 2006 raupach et al 2007 which was initially used in the yellow river basin wang et al 2016 the relative rate of change of river sediment load s kg is considered to be caused by p water yield capacity cr m3 mm the ratio of streamflow to precipitation q p and sediment concentration s kg m3 the ratio of sediment load to streamflow s q the specific calculation formula of sediment attribution diagnosis analysis is 8 s p q p s q p c r s in this method the proportional change rate of x t is defined as r x x 1 dx dt and the value of r x was calculated by dividing the changing rate of x by its average value therefore the proportion change rate of sediment load is written as 9 ds d t s d p c r s d t s dp d t p d c r d t r ds d t s then the counterpart for proportional change rates of sediment load can be further simplified as wang et al 2016 10 r s r p r c r r s the water yield capacity and sediment concentration could be estimated as the following regression function of precipitation established in the reference period zhao et al 2022 11 log c r α log p ω 0 12 log s β log p ω 1 where α β ω 0 and ω 1 are the regression coefficients thus the relative change of r cr and r s caused by precipitation is αr p and βr p respectively therefore the relative change of sediment load is estimated by 13 r s 1 α β r p r c r r s α β r p in eq 13 the first term represents the relative change of sediment load caused by precipitation and the second term represents that caused by human activities the relative contribution of each identity factor is the ratio of its proportional change rate to the proportional change rate of s during the same period thus the relative contributions of precipitation and human activities to sediment load change could be determined similarly the identified factors of nutrient flux nf kg were decomposed to p cr and nutrient concentration nc kg m3 the ratio of nutrient flux to streamflow nf q the specific calculation formula of nutrient flux attribution diagnosis analysis is 14 nf p q p nf q p c r n c the counterpart for proportional change rates of nutrient flux can be described as 15 r n f r p r c r r n c the relative contributions of precipitation and human activities to nutrient flux could be determined using the same procedure as the attribution analysis of sediment load furthermore the relationships of nutrient fluxes with streamflow and sediment load were established through regression analysis to investigate the roles of hydrological variations in the changes of nutrient fluxes the critical factors influencing sediment load and nutrient fluxes were identified using correlation analysis and the corresponding quantitative relationships were established 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations of streamflow and sediment load the annual streamflow and sediment load showed a high spatiotemporal variation in the mrb and its four tributary basins table 2 the streamflow of the mrb and the four tributary basins all showed a significant upward trend p 0 05 except for the arkansas river fig 2 a table 3 and the streamflow of the mr into the sea increased the most of all sites at 1 68 km3 yr however the sediment load decreased significantly in the missouri river ohio river and mr p 0 05 fig 2b the sediment load in the missouri river a major sediment source of the mr declined the fastest about 2 80 mt yr 1 of the four tributaries while the annual average sediment concentration of these rivers except the arkansas river decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 2c the sediment concentration in the missouri river was always the highest among the rivers and the multi year mean was 192 5 higher than in the mr the whole study period of streamflow is divided into two periods according to the abrupt change points determined by double mass curves i e the first period 1931 1972 pr1 and the second period 1973 2018 pr2 fig s3 while the whole study period of sediment load is divided into three periods including the first period from 1949 to around 1985 ps1 the second period from around 1985 to 1999 ps2 and the third period from 2000 to 2018 ps3 fig s4 the multi year averages of streamflow and sediment load during different periods are in table s1 compared with the pr1 the streamflow of the upper mississippi missouri ohio arkansas and mississippi rivers during the pr2 increased by 34 1 33 6 19 1 27 4 and 22 2 respectively compared with ps1 the sediment load of the upper mississippi missouri ohio and mississippi rivers during ps2 decreased by 27 4 48 5 26 6 and 27 4 respectively while that of the arkansas river increased by 381 4 compared with the ps1 the sediment load of the upper mississippi missouri ohio and mississippi rivers during ps3 decreased by 32 9 70 1 36 7 and 48 7 respectively while that of the arkansas river increased by 148 0 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of nutrient fluxes the trend and significance of the nutrient fluxes of the mr and its four tributaries are in fig 2 and table 3 respectively the tn fluxes of these rivers all showed a downward trend except for the upper mr while only the trend in the ohio river was significant p 0 05 fig 2d the tp fluxes of these rivers all showed an upward trend except for the ohio river and the trend in the mr was significant with a rate of 0 76 103 tons yr 1 p 0 05 fig 2e the dic flux of the mr increased significantly with a rate of 1 19 105 tons yr 1 p 0 05 fig 2f according to the double mass curves between annual streamflow and nutrient fluxes the change points of tn flux in 1988 tp flux in 1998 and dic flux in 1972 were identified fig s5 the mean fluxes and concentrations of tn tp and dic during different periods in the mr and its four tributaries are in table s2 from the 1970s 1988 to 1989 2010s the annual average tn flux and concentration decreased except in the upper mr which was consistent with the overall trend moreover the largest contributor to the reduction in tn flux from the mr to the sea is the missouri river whose tn flux decreased by 21 23 from the 1970s 1998 to 1999 2010s the annual average tp flux and concentration in all rivers increased with the missouri river increasing the most 41 6 and 51 8 respectively from 1931 to 1972 to 1973 2004 the annual average dic flux and concentration in the mr increased by 33 75 and 9 9 respectively 3 3 relationships of nutrient fluxes with streamflow and sediment load the relationships of tn tp and dic fluxes with annual streamflow and sediment load in the mrb and its four tributary basins are in fig 3 in most cases the tn tp and dic fluxes had a strong correlation with their corresponding streamflow r 2 0 6 p 0 01 however there was a large uncertainty in the relationship between nutrient flux and sediment load therefore according to the strength of the relationship between nutrient flux and streamflow sediment load four binary types were classified double strong ds r 2 0 5 one strong and one weak sw ws and double weak dw r 2 0 5 of these sw means that the nutrient flux has a strong relationship with streamflow and a weak relationship with sediment load while ws is the opposite therefore the type of tn flux in the missouri river and tn flux and tp flux in the arkansas river was ds the type of tp fluxes in the upper mississippi and ohio rivers tn flux in the ohio river and dic flux in the mr was sw the type of tn flux in the mr was ws the type of tn fluxes in the upper mr and tp fluxes in the missouri river and the mr was dw table 4 3 4 attribution of streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes changes runoff is most sensitive to changes in precipitation in the mrb as indicated by the average elasticity coefficient of 2 14 1 14 and 1 37 for p e 0 and n respectively table s3 precipitation plays the most important influence on the increase of streamflow in the mr such that from ps1 to ps2 precipitation makes the largest contribution 50 among all rivers fig 4 the linear relationships between precipitation and runoff in the entire mrb were significant r 2 0 5 p 0 05 except for the missouri river basin r 2 0 46 fig s6 however the role of the underlying surface change cannot be ignored for example the contributions of underlying surface factor n to runoff change from ps1 to ps2 in the upper mr and missouri river were 45 7 and 42 0 respectively human activities were the dominant factor for the reduction in sediment load in the mrb fig 5 the contributions of human activities to sediment load reduction from ps1 to ps2 from ps2 to ps3 and from ps1 to ps3 58 were larger than precipitation whose contributions were mostly 30 human activities contributed 80 to the sediment load reductions in the missouri river and from the mr to the sea in addition the significantly increased precipitation p 0 05 table 3 always increased sediment yield playing a negative effect on sediment load reduction fig 5 overall human activities dominated the changes in tn tp and dic fluxes in the mrb fig 6 the contributions 59 of human activities to the changes of tn tp and dic fluxes were larger than precipitation in detail human activities decreased tn fluxes with contributions of 69 6 93 7 and increased tn flux in the upper mr with a contribution of 63 0 human activities contributed 59 2 95 0 to increased tp in all rivers and 76 1 to dic fluxes increase from the mr to the sea in addition increased precipitation always played an increasing effect on nutrient fluxes fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 responses of streamflow and sediment load to climate change and human activities the percentage contribution of precipitation to increased streamflow in each river basin from pr1 to pr2 was higher than 52 fig 4 which indicates that the impact of climate change on streamflow changes is higher than that of human activities indeed the precipitation in the mrb and the four tributary basins all showed a significant increase p 0 05 table 3 and there was significantly linear relationships between precipitation and runoff fig s6 although precipitation dominated the changes in the streamflow of the mrb the underlying surface factor n of the four tributary basins had 20 of the impact on streamflow increases especially in the upper mr and missouri river basins the underlying surface factor n respectively contributed 45 7 and 42 0 to the increase in streamflow which may be mainly related to the increased proportion of cropland area and cropland drainage channel construction tile drainage fig s1 raymond et al 2008 schilling et al 2010 human activities were the most important factors leading to the decrease in sediment transport in the mrb during the study interval and the quantitative contribution of human activities has been obtained in this study to further quantify the impact of human activities the main anthropogenic factors influencing sediment load i e proportion of impermeable area cumulative length of the revetments and cumulative dam storage capacity were identified using the correlation analysis fig 7 a and the quantitative relationships between sediment yield coefficient and above factors were made in the mrb the sediment yield coefficient decreased linearly with the increase in the proportion of impermeable area fig 7b the cumulative length of the revetments fig 7c and the cumulative dam storage capacity fig 7d r 2 0 5 p 0 05 therefore sediment discharge was reduced considerably owing to these anthropogenic activities i e dam construction the numerous smaller engineering structures meander cutoffs river training structures and bank revetments and other soil conservation practices throughout the mrb system meade and moody 2010 however the proportion of cropland area showed an increasing trend from the 1970s to the 2010s fig s1 except from 1982 to 1992 due to the implementation of the us conservation reserve program in 1986 stackpoole et al 2021 accordingly leading to largely enhanced erosion over the past decades yet numerous engineering structures such as reservoirs dams revetments and levees intercepted sediment yielding from the cropland westphal and munger 1976 heimann et al 2011 furthermore river dam construction is a major factor in sediment reduction in global rivers syvitski and kettner 2011 walling 2012 the fort randall dam 1952 and the garrison dam 1953 built in the missouri river were especially important in causing the change point of sediment load in 1952 and changed the sediment load regime of the missouri river and downstream accordingly the sediment load in the missouri river basin decreased linearly with the increase in the proportion of impermeable area and the cumulative dam capacity r 2 0 75 p 0 05 fig s7 along with the dam construction other river engineering projects were taken after the 1927 mr mega flood these include channel stabilization bank revetment river widening and in channel dike building which collectively contributed to reducing bank erosion and sediment transport wang and xu 2018 li et al 2020b 4 2 critical influencing factors of nutrient fluxes the dominant agricultural land uses in the mrb significantly changed the concentration of nutrients mitsch et al 2001 turner and rabalais 2003 turner et al 2007 and carbon raymond et al 2008 ren et al 2016 in the last century alexander et al 2008 estimated that agricultural sources in the watersheds contribute 70 of the delivered n and p to the gulf of mexico there is evidence that tn and tp mainly came from applied fertilizers and manure and were partially fixed by the crops mainly soybean and corn stackpoole et al 2021 the actual tn flux in the mr has been decreasing insignificantly since the 1970s while it has an increasing trend from 2000 onwards fig 2d in contrast with the increasing nitrogen production caused mainly by significantly increasing fertilizer nitrogen and population density housing unit number etc p 0 05 fig s2 accordingly the tn flux was not significantly or even negatively correlated with the related nitrogen sources such as fertilizer nitrogen and positively correlated with some nitrogen sinks e g planted soybeans table s4 however the tn flux was significantly negatively correlated with the total dam storage capacity in the basin p 0 05 fig 8 table s4 therefore the decrease of tn flux in the mr probably can be attributed to sedimentation and denitrification in the transport process such as in the riverine corridor wetlands noe and hupp 2009 bryantmason et al 2013 and reservoir and dam in the river hansen et al 2018 xu et al 2020 which may lead to the strong linear relationship between tn fluxes and sediment loads in the missouri and arkansas rivers fig 3 furthermore the nitrogen reduction measures implemented since the 1970s may have also played a role in tn reduction such as the clean water act of 1972 litke 1999 and the regional nitrogen oxide reduction plan nox interstate implementation plan after 2003 usepa 2008 the tp flux in the mr was linearly and positively correlated with total soybean yield total corn yield fertilizer phosphorus cropland area proportion and housing unit number fig 8 table s4 which corresponds to the two major sources farm fertilizer and manure use stackpoole et al 2021 although the reservoirs behind the dams intercepted particulate phosphorus in the sediment the increased streamflow increased dissolved phosphorus as indicated in fig 2 and so the tp flux was more correlated with streamflow compared to sediment load according to raymond et al 2008 the increase in streamflow was mainly due to the increase in agricultural watershed discharge which contains p from the increasing applied farm fertilizer and manure use fig s2 therefore the increasing farm fertilizer and manure use are the two identifiable factors that mainly caused the increase of tp flux in the mr the dic in river waters is mainly derived from chemical weathering which in turn reflects meteorological factors e g rainfall and temperature and soil properties among these the increased precipitation and agricultural practices on agricultural land are the dominant factors in the increase of dic in the mrb raymond and cole 2003 raymond et al 2008 this idea is precisely corroborated by our results that an increase in dic flux is accompanied by an increase in cropland area fig s1 and its strong linear correlation with precipitation r 2 0 64 p 0 05 and potential evapotranspiration r 2 0 48 p 0 05 fig 8 the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon reported in this study is quite large but we are not certain how much of it originates from the effluent of wastewater as the treatment plants are not required to remove carbon the discharges after primary and secondary treatments may still contain large amounts of dissolved carbon nishijima et al 2003 in addition precipitation in the mrb increased significantly p 0 01 providing reactants and transport for chemical weathering table 3 and agricultural liming may have provided a considerable source of carbon carbonate raymond et al 2008 furthermore temperatures in all the tributary basins of the mr have continued to rise in recent decades reiman and xu 2019 fig s8 and higher temperatures increase soil temperature soil mineralization and the leaching of dissolved carbon in the soil wallenstein and weintraub 2008 results from the modeling work of ren et al 2015 predict that river dic flux will increase by as much as 65 in the next 100 years due to the increasing precipitation flow and atmospheric temperature 4 3 comparison with other large rivers the variations of river streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes in the world s large rivers differed in time and space and the effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change on the changes in water sediment and nutrient fluxes also showed strong heterogeneity nilsson et al 2005 li et al 2020a the dominant factor of streamflow changes used to be precipitation yet the anthropogenic contribution increased in recent decades while anthropogenic activities in recent decades dominated the change of sediment load in most large rivers including dam and reservoir construction deforestation or vegetation restoration and so on yin et al 2021 however there are a few studies on nutrient flux changes based on a long time series of measurements because of the lack of data although the changes and causes in nutrient fluxes from large rivers to the sea are even more difficult to discern due to the complexity of nutrient source and distribution we reviewed relevant published studies in conjunction with this study and identified three main factors affecting nutrient fluxes from large rivers to the ocean i e dam construction agricultural activities and human emissions table 5 in general dam construction appears to be a major factor leading to some nutrient flux reduction while agricultural activities e g farm fertilizer applications and anthropogenic emissions e g wastewater discharge and manure can lead to increases in the fluxes of some nutrients although the nutrients are contained in streamflow and sediment discharge the relationships between nutrient fluxes and streamflow as well as sediment load differed among large rivers which have important implications for watershed management to reduce nutrient flux in the mississippi rhine and mekong rivers the trends in nutrient fluxes are accompanied by a similar change in streamflow and or sediment load table 5 however the tn and tp fluxes in the yellow river and yangtze river have been increasing regardless of the decrease or at least stability in the streamflow and sediment load the effects of decreasing streamflow and sediment load have been balanced and even exceeded due to high anthropogenic emissions caused by a high population density in the yellow river and yangtze river basin therefore some universal management policies should be retained for the long term such as improving the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer and reducing sewage discharge in addition some targeted management measures in large river basins with specific characteristics should also be adopted such as raising the standards of human emissions from factories in the yellow river and yangtze river basins 5 conclusions this study analyzed the changes in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes in the mississippi river basin separated the quantitative effects of human activities and climate change on their changes in different stages and identified the main factors that drive these changes based on the findings we conclude that streamflow increases are mainly affected by increased precipitation 50 of contribution in the whole basin while human activities also play a crucial role 40 in increasing streamflow in the upper mississippi and missouri rivers human activities contribute the most 58 to the changes in the sediment load and nutrient fluxes the construction of dams and reservoirs bank revetments and impermeable surfaces have strongly reduced the sediment yield coefficient exhibiting a linear decreasing relationship moreover the nutrient fluxes showed stronger linear relationship with streamflow compared to sediment load the decrease in tn flux was mainly attributed to sedimentation and denitrification in the reservoirs and wetlands and the increased farm fertilizer and manure use are the key factors causing the increase in the tp flux in addition the increased precipitation and temperature and agricultural practices may have led to an increase in dic flux in the river this study provides quantitative results of water sediment nutrient variations in the entire watershed system the main novelty of this study is to develop integrated picture of long term changes in streamflow sediment load and nutrient fluxes and provide their quantitative attribution analysis results from a basin wide perspective the findings of this study have important implications for the future river export of sediment and nutrient under global climate change and human activities in the mississippi river rising temperature and precipitation have been projected for the mississippi river basin throughout this century and these trends are anticipated to continue accelerating terrestrial biogeochemical processes and causing increases in soil dissolved carbon production and leaching credit authorship contribution statement shihua yin data curation formal analysis writing original draft

2561,anthropogenic water use activities contribute substantially to natural hydrological processes however their effects on distributed hydrological simulations are currently poorly understood due to the lack of observed data on water use to address this issue we developed a model by using the water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules namely wetspa ww differently from previous studies roughly estimating water use the observed withdrawal of surface water and groundwater as well as industrial domestic and agricultural water consumption in sub basins were used according to the site based measurements this model was applied to the upper and middle reaches of the weihe river basin umwrb results show that 1 the proposed wetspa ww improved simulation efficiency both of streamflow and actual evapotranspiration aet e g the relative error re of aet decreased from 20 3 to 6 43 1 2 the re of streamflow at the outlet of the basin increases from 10 5 to 15 3 without considering the spatial distribution of water use among sub basins 3 in the period of 2017 2020 the mean water withdrawal stood at 49 64 mm a over the basin resulting in a reduction of streamflow by 22 24 mm a and an increase of actual evapotranspiration by 6 97 mm a this study demonstrates a great potential gain available to the distributed hydrological models integrating records of actual water use rather than more widely used national statistics keywords wetspa model weihe river basin water withdrawal water consumption streamflow data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction streamflow as the most direct manifestation of water resources is not only affected by climatic variability but also by human interventions e g water use biemans et al 2011 li et al 2022 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2018 recent studies have revealed that human activities contributed more to the streamflow decrease than climate change in some basins especially in arid or semi arid areas e g the yellow river basin and the haihe river basin in china li et al 2016a b understanding the mechanisms through which runoff changes respond to human activities can help mitigate droughts and floods in the future wu et al 2020 xu et al 2021 as an important part of human activities anthropogenic water use increased greatly in these years with the rapid development of the economy and the continuous growth of the population gong et al 2022 liu et al 2017 yang et al 2022 on the one hand many studies adopt the method of comparing results in different stages to assess the impact of water withdrawal on streamflow in a small catchment the hydrological model was calibrated and verified during the baseline period then it was used to reconstruct the natural runoff in the human activities influence stage the impact of human activities was estimated by the difference between the observed streamflow and the reconstructed natural runoff zhang et al 2014 for example wu et al 2020 found that direct human activities contributed most to runoff reduction under variation in the luanhe river basin by analyzing the simulations in different periods this approach does not exclude the uncertainty from other human activities like the impact of reservoir operation on the other hand water use activities have increasingly been incorporated into the processes of large scale hydrological models for better water use representation in hydrological models burek et al 2020 e g the h08 hanasaki et al 2008a b watergap alcamo et al 2003 matsiro pokhrel et al 2012 the spatial resolution of the large scale hydrological model is not suitable for the study on small catchments as the water withdrawal data available the 10 100 km typically employed in current models is not accurate enough for small catchments pokhrel et al 2016 few hydrological models are able to provide elaborate simulations at a small time step or over regions with rapid consumptive water use changes in small catchments some efforts have gone into better water use representation in hydrological models to quantify the impact of water use activities with the water use data input burek et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2015 pokhrel et al 2012 for example horan et al 2021 incorporated static estimates of water use based on household and irrigation census and public statistics of aquastat data fao 2016 in cauvery and narmada hall et al 2020 incorporated streamlined data sets of abstractions storage facilities and discharges in an application to the water supply system in england water withdrawal and consumption can be estimated in larger scale hydrological models for example for the global scale h08 model hanasaki et al 2008a b estimated water abstraction amounts from sectoral water use requirements and validated them against reported data from aquastat and other models e g watergap a similar method is used in the regional scale model rameshwaran et al 2021 for which anthropogenic water use activities are estimated from available countrywide sectoral data including information on population irrigated areas and livestock so the water withdrawal and consumption volume are commonly estimated from global statistics e g aquastat data fao 2016 or calculated from available nationwide sectoral data including information on population irrigated areas and livestock to estimate water use yokohata et al 2020 in above mentioned hydrological models however the water withdrawal data estimated by these two methods are still not accurate enough in time and space when compared with observed data especially in the regional hydrological simulations water use varies greatly from region to region due to the difference in water availability and socio economic development feng et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 for example irrigation water use varies due to the difference in regional water availability and crop production over a river basin different population densities contribute to the large spatial heterogeneity of water withdrawal for electricity generation mining and manufacturing huang et al 2018 anthropogenic water use influences regional water availability through water withdrawal and return flow ming et al 2018 in addition water is abstracted from surface water or underground water for agricultural industrial or domestic purposes abstracted water returns to the river or to the land after use the water returned to the land is largely lost from the catchment through evapotranspiration which influences regional water availability transiently since water use has a significant impact on regional water availability accurate estimation of water withdrawal is particularly important although the spatial and temporal distribution of water use plays an important role in water resources management rameshwaran et al 2022 xie et al 2021 many hydrological models do not explicitly include spatiotemporal observed water use data because such data are scarce arheimer et al 2020 as a distributed hydrological model with physical mechanisms although the water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere wetspa is suitable for estimating stocks of natural hydrological components e g streamflow actual evapotranspiration and groundwater the model currently does not account for anthropogenic water use activities yet the high potential of wetspa in predicting spatial hydrological components has been well documented bahremand et al 2006 bahremand et al 2007 karimi et al 2016 a combination of empirical and physical relationships is employed to characterize the hydrological regimes in the wetspa tavakoli and de smedt 2013 concluded that the performance of the model to predict soil moisture is promising which shows that the wetspa can provide an explicit physical representation of the soil moisture dynamics under the impact of irrigation water in addition wetspa provides a high potential in establishing a connection between water users and cells in the model as it is a gis grid based model rameshwaran et al 2022 therefore the water use activities can be coupled with the natural hydrological process in wetspa at a high resolution through the topological relationships in this study site based measurements on water use have enabled the incorporation of the water use activities into a grid based hydrological model the wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules wetspa ww provides daily simulations of streamflow at 1 km resolution to quantify the impacts of water use on streamflow the problems to be solved in this study are 1 to consider water withdrawal and consumption in the traditional distributed hydrological model 2 to find how the spatiotemporal distribution of water withdrawal and consumption has an influence on the streamflow at the watershed outlet and 3 to quantify the reduction in streamflow from water withdrawal and consumption 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yellow river basin is a typical semiarid basin yan et al 2018 with serious water shortage problems especially in the middle reaches of the yellow river mryrb zhao et al 2014 with the rapid development of society and the economy there is a rising demand for water resources in the mryrb the need for research on the impact of human activities on runoff is gradually increasing in the mryrb the weihe river is the largest tributary in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin with a total length of about 818 km and a drainage area of 134 800 km2 it originates from the north of niaoshu mountain in gansu province and flows eastward along the north flank of the qinling mountains into the yellow river the upper and middle reaches of the weihe river basin was studied due to the data limitation umwrb the region above the huaxian gaging station 104 0 e 109 9 e 33 7 n 37 4 n 103 898 km2 fig 1 topographically the altitude decreases from the highest northwestern mountain areas to the lowest southeastern umwrb is located in the transitional zone of continental monsoon climate zone arid and semi humid areas the mean maximum temperature is around 28 c in summer and 4 4 c in winter while the mean minimum temperature is around 19 7 c and 5 9 c respectively the annual average rainfall is approximately 521 mm and ranges from 344 to 761 mm across the umwrb there are distinct soil types with basalt derived soils in the north and sandstone derived soils in the south most of the catchment is cleared for cropping apart from that a small part of the northern catchment is covered with grassland while the southern part is partially covered by forest 2 2 geographical data the dem data were extracted from the srtm digital elevation model srtm with a resolution ratio of 1 km land use cover maps were downloaded from the data sharing infrastructure of earth system science http www geodata cn cropland is the major land use type accounting for about

the huaxian provided by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources yrcc was used for calibration and validation of the hydrological model the daily meteorological data

meteorological administration http data cma cn global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam is a process based semi empirical model aiming at the estimation of land evaporation and its separate components here the recently developed version 3 of the model was used as the actual evaporation which provides the total terrestrial evaporation results from the addition of transpiration rainfall interception loss bare soil evaporation open water evaporation and snow sublimation miralles et al 2010 miralles et al 2011 2 4 water withdrawal and consumption data daily water withdrawal for stations is collected from the national water resources monitoring capacity building project nwrmcbp sector specific irrigation domestic industrial and ecological environment water and source specific surface and groundwater water withdrawal is provided from 2016 to 2020 for each water withdrawal station in the following non agricultural water is used to refer to the volume of the total water used excluding agricultural water including domestic industrial and ecological environment water in umwrb there are a total of 305 water intake monitoring stations of which 89 are surface water intake monitoring stations 197 are underground water well monitoring stations and 19 stations can monitor the water of two types of water intake according to the classification of water use there are 67 stations in the basin for agricultural water 54 industrial water stations 63 domestic water stations 114 stations for other types of water and 7 stations for various types of non agricultural water mixing of agricultural water types the location of the stations is shown in fig 2 a 3 methodology the model wetspa presented in this study is a distributed hydrological model for predicting the water and energy transfer between soil plants and the atmosphere due to the high potential in predicting spatial hydrological components under different conditions karimi et al 2016 in this study we developed wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules wetspa ww by incorporating wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules a schematic of the modeling framework is shown in fig 3 the model provides the opportunity to explicitly simulate water withdrawal and consumption in a finer resolution formulations of wetspa ww with a particular emphasis on the description of the water withdrawal module and water consumption module are provided as followed 3 1 wetspa wetspa was developed by wang et al 1996 to describe water and energy transfer between soil plants and the atmosphere this model has been under development suitable for use in flood prediction and watershed management on a catchment scale by kavian et al 2020 this model is physically based and simulates hydrological processes of precipitation snowmelt interception depression surface runoff infiltration evapotranspiration percolation interflow groundwater flow etc continuously both in time and space for which the water and energy balance are maintained on each raster cell the model can not only simulate and calculate the water balance and flood process at the basin outlet in different time steps but also dynamically reflect any point in the basin at any time thus it is easy to understand the process of runoff formation which is the response of the runoff process to spatial variation of three factors topography soil type and land use a schematic of the runoff modeling framework is shown in fig 3 the content in the orange box flow through the river network is simulated using saint venant equations and solved by the muskingum method morris 1979 gill 1978 hydrological processes in each grid cell are set in a cascading way starting from a precipitation event once the required data are collected and processed for use in the wetspa model identification of spatial model parameters is undertaken terrain features at each grid cell including elevation flow direction flow accumulation stream network stream link stream order slope and hydraulic radius are first extracted from the dem most of the parameters in the wetspa are the correction coefficient of the identified terrain features the name and range of parameters are shown in table s 1 3 2 wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules wetspa ww the wetspa ww is based on wetspa with the consideration of two new modules as for the parameters objective function optimization algorithm etc the wetspa ww remains the same as wetspa 3 2 1 water withdrawal coupling module to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of water withdrawal on runoff a water withdrawal module was developed coupling with wetspa a schematic description of the water intake is shown in figure s 1 a as for the water withdrawal module each sub basin is regarded as the smallest statistical unit of surface water abstraction since there is one and only one digital river in each sub basin as the first step in the water withdrawal module a series of net abstractions at day i from groundwater ww g i and surface waters ww s i separately are acquired in umwrb from nwrmcbp ww g i and ww s i of each sub basin are the sums of the monitored water volume of water withdrawal stations within each sub basin based location of the water withdrawal stations fig 2 a then the water withdrawal module extracts ww s i from the river in the outlet of each sub basin at day i similar to surface water withdrawal the statistical unit of the underground water withdrawal system is a sub basin it is different from surface water extraction directly from river channel in the sub basin the groundwater extraction scheme pumps from the groundwater reservoir of every grid in this sub basin which can be explained by the quick depletion of storage from groundwater reservoirs sharma et al 2020 the water withdrawal from underground in each grid cell on the day i ww g i l t of this sub basin can be obtained as 1 ww g i ww gt i n where the ww gt i l t is total water withdrawal from underground in this sub basin at day i and n is the number of grid cells in the sub basin unlike other groundwater pumping schemes the ww g i is estimated as the deficit in supply from the near surface sources to meet the total demand of a grid cell was obtained from the imaginary source to account for the water use from groundwater hanasaki et al 2018a rost et al 2008 in the water withdrawal module this imaginary source of water has been replaced by an explicit shallow groundwater pumping scheme based on measured data thus providing a dynamic link between human activities and natural water resources the dynamics in the water withdrawal module are determined by groundwater recharge and water pumping and the location of the water table is updated at every time step 3 2 2 water consumption coupling module return flow and delivery loss are important processes in water withdrawal hanasaki et al 2018b excluding the volume of water consumed the rest return flow can return to surface water soil or groundwater finally considering the difference between types of water use and a finer description of the daily water consumption and return flow we developed a water consumption and return flow module in wetspa this new module computes based on the water use data sets from the water withdrawal points the sector specific consumptions and return flows to groundwater and surface waters separately in the water consumption and return flow module water use w u tot is classified as irrigation w u irr and non agricultural water w u nirr the sum of domestic industrial and ecological environment water based on the water use categories from the water withdrawal stations for the non agricultural water use the non consumptive fraction is assumed to flow back to surface water as return flow for irrigation water it infiltrates into the soil as extra rainfall the non consumptive fraction of irrigation water however is stored in the soil or recharges groundwater depending on soil water balance pokhrel et al 2015 return flow was drained into the local river surface water rw s or grid cell groundwater rw g in the next time step hanasaki et al 2018a the module obtains sectoral water uses by counting time series of irrigation and non agricultural water at the scale of individual cities since the water use is closely related to human society a schematic description of the return flow is shown in figure s 1 b then the non irrigation water consumption rate c r nirr for each country is obtained by dividing the annual non irrigation water consumption by the non irrigation water withdrawal table s 2 annual non irrigation water consumption and non irrigation water withdrawal are obtained in the water resources bulletin of gansu province shaanxi province and ningxia province rw s i represents the return flow drainage to the river and at day i so rw s i can be expressed as 2 rw s i w u nirr i 1 cr nirr where w u nirr i is the water used for non irrigation at day i so the change of water storage of river at day i δ s r i l in a sub basin can be expressed as 3 δ s r i δ t q in i q out i w w s i r w s i 1 where δ t t is the model time step the q in i l t is the upstream discharge at i time defined as the streamflow at the outlet of the upstream sub basin q out i l t is the discharge of this sub basin ww s i is the net abstractions from the river at day i rw s i 1 represents the return flow to the river at day i 1 so that the change in groundwater storage at day i δ s g i l can be redefined as 4 δ s g i δ t r g i q g i ww g i rw g i 1 where δ t t is the model time step q g i l t is the groundwater discharge ww g i is the net abstractions from groundwater at i time rw g i 1 represents the return flow to the groundwater at day i 1 which is calculated by soil water balance the r g i l t is the net groundwater recharge excluding rw g i 1 at day i it is worth noting that the sum of r g i and rw g i 1 is defined as the gravity drainage flux less the capillary flux near the water table at i day they are represented separately in the equation to show that the return flow is produced according to the water use at day i 1 3 3 simulation scenarios according to chang et al 2015 human activities such as agricultural irrigation and reservoirs dramatically increased in the 1970 s at the weihe river basin and abrupt changes in annual runoff occurred around 1970 li et al 2016a b details are showed in section 5 1 in general there were relatively minor anthropogenic disturbances in the weihe river basin during 1960 1965 thus the umwrb can be seen as a pristine catchment during this period the data during 1960 1965 was used to verify the suitability of wetspa in the study area the year 1960 was used only as a spin up then the data during 1961 1963 and 1964 1965 were used to calibrate the parameters and validate the performance of the hydrological model respectively the second simulation was applied in 1966 2020 with wetspa since the main assessment was over the period 2017 2020 in the following study on water use the result in 2017 2020 was analyzed to confirm whether the parameters had changed under the influence of climate change and human activities to evaluate the model performance of the two models under the influence of intense human activities wetspa and wetspa ww are calibrated during 2017 2018 respectively with the year 2016 as a spin up and validation in 2019 2020 due to the limitation of water use data then the effectiveness of wetspa ww was verified by the comparison between the two models a schematic diagram of the simulations is shown in fig 4 3 4 evaluation metrics dynamically dimensioned search dds was used in the calibration of the model parameters and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was calculated based on observed and simulated streamflow was used as the objective function 5 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 additionally relative error re was used to evaluate model performance re is defined as follows 6 re i 1 n q sim i q obs i i 1 n q obs i where q sim i and q obs i are the daily simulated and observed daily streamflow at time step i n is the number of observations nse values range from infinitesimal to 1 the closer nse is to 1 the better the model performs re was used to evaluate the runoff volume bias between the observed and simulated streamflow the re value of 0 indicates no bias and a positive one indicates the overestimation of the simulation results relative to measured streamflow the calculation interval was 1 day this means all the water flows accompanying both the natural water cycle and anthropogenic water use were calculated and exchanged among the components at a daily interval by strictly tracking all water fluxes and storage 4 results 4 1 performance of wetspa ww in umwrb fig 5 shows the results of wetspa and wetspa ww in calibration and validation during 2017 2020 as for streamflow both wetspa of wetspa ww perform well the nses of calibration and validation are about 0 7 table 1 fig 5 however in the umwrb most rains fell in the summer and lasted for 1 or 2 h which typically triggered the generation of excess runoff exceeding the infiltration capacity and daily scale simulation could not describe the runoff process well this might explain why the inaccurate simulation of the peak flow in summary these results indicated that both wetspa and wetspa ww are validated well in the heavily human affected stage in terms of streamflow since the objective function is nse based on observed streamflow evapotranspiration is additionally used to validate the effectiveness of wetspa ww according to the results in fig 6 and table 1 it is found that wetspa ww simulated a better et than wetspa when compared with gleam the re of wetspa ww is less than 10 which is much smaller than that of wetspa table 1 wetspa ww outperforms wetspa in terms of nse in addition the wetspa ww is more accurate for actual evapotranspiration simulation than wetspa especially in winter and spring fig 6 also there is a general need for irrigation during winter wheat cultivation in the weihe river basin which illustrates that wetspa ww simulation performs better through the integration with water withdrawal and consumption modules therefore it can be argued that the accuracy of the streamflow simulation is improved by the water withdrawal and use modules the proposed model provides a better description of the hydrological processes when compared to wetspa the results in table 1 show that both nse and re of wetspa ww are better than wetspa confirming the superiority of wetspa ww too 4 2 response of streamflow to the resolution of data on water use water withdrawal in cities in the southeast such as xi an baoji and weinan which are located in the guanzhong plain is higher than that in the northwest relatively speaking the upstream area like tianshui and pingliang has smaller water intake and the main water source there is surface water in terms of water use in most regions irrigation is the dominant sector agricultural water in the umwrb accounts for more than 50 of the total water use as there are more irrigation areas in the downstream area the guanzhong plain there are denser water withdrawal stations in this area the volume of water used in agriculture fluctuated greatly throughout the year non agricultural water use changed less frequently over time agricultural water use mainly increased in march june and december since a winter wheat summer maize rotation system was adopted for the climate in the study area details of the temporal and spatial variation of water withdrawal and consumption can be found in fig s 4 7 to explore the impact of the resolution of water use on runoff water use was appropriately redistributed in different scenarios the differences between the streamflow simulated by wetspa ww in water withdrawal scenarios with other inputs remaining the same are attributed to disturbances of water withdrawal activities in the umwrb spatiotemporal variation of water use in different scenarios is shown in table 2 fig 7 fig 8 shows the streamflow of the simulations by using the wetspa ww model at huaxian station in varied water user scenarios table 3 shows the re of simulated streamflow in varied scenarios with simulated streamflow in sv tv the difference between the simulation results of the models is obvious in the low flow stage indicating that water use activities have a greater impact on runoff at this stage when spatial variation at the basin scale was ignored but observation based temporal variation was included su tv poor quality simulations of daily catchment streamflow were obtained the streamflow time series at huaxian station were overestimated by over 15 in this case which shows that the change of the upstream water intake can have a large impact on the downstream flow this increased the annual streamflow from 73 15 mm a to 84 36 mm a when the sv tv model was used the data in su tv is homogeneous in the catchment but varies over time while sv tu provided better simulations of daily streamflow than su tv which shows that the spatial resolution of the water intake data has a great impact on the runoff simulation the result is consistent with the conclusion of rameshwaran et al 2022 which indicates that abstractions and discharge measurements provide a means to improve the performance of spatially distributed hydrological models for sv tv 1 5 only amplify or minify the daily water withdrawal in all sites by a factor of 1 5 with the same temporal and spatial variation as sv tv the operation of sv tv 0 5 was similar to that of sv tv 1 5 with only the factor replaced by 0 5 by comparing the results of sv tv 0 5 sv tv and sv tv 1 5 it can be concluded that the larger the water consumption the smaller the actual evaporation which further proves that the actual evaporation would be overestimated without considering water withdrawal and consumption it is worth noting that sv tv 1 5 showed a better re compared with that of sv tv which may have been the result of the uncertainty of the model or that the water withdrawal data was relatively small compared to the reality or the misestimation of the water consumption rate 4 3 the impact on streamflow from water withdrawal and consumption fig 9 summarizes the monthly streamflow difference between the blue line the scenario without water withdrawal and consumption data input and the red line the scenario with water withdrawal and consumption data input during 2017 2020 with wetspa ww the difference between the simulations of streamflow under the two scenarios can be seen as the effect of water use on runoff while the two scenarios are run with the same meteorological data input and parameters among them 2016 is the warm up period then the results were not shown water use had negative effects on streamflow in the umwrb the scenario without water use data input is regarded as the simulation of runoff with the interventions of water withdrawal and water consumption relatively speaking the scenario with water use data input is the nearly natural streamflow simulation ignoring the water management since other human interventions like land use change and reservoir regulation are not considered since the short duration and no large reservoir in the study area the differences in hydrograph demonstrate the hydrological response of the water use exhibiting generally lower streamflow especially in the low flow periods for annual runoff the difference between the results under the two scenarios is shown in table 4 the results show an increase at a rate of 10 mm per year which reflects that the impact of water use on runoff has a cumulative effect during the calculation period therefore the difference between the two simulations in 2020 can be seen as the cumulative value of the impact of water use on streamflow over four years so the annual impact of water use is 26 85 mm a furthermore annual water use is 49 64 mm a it can be concluded that the impact of water use on streamflow is about 54 of the volume of water use in the umwrb besides the deviation of the runoff process fig 10 presents the average monthly variations of streamflow estimations from a scenario with water use input and streamflow estimations from the scenario without water withdrawal and consumption data input during the simulation period compared with the other scenario the simulation in the scenario with water use data input is generally smaller and the simulation results in winter and irrigation period march june to august have greater deviations during a year as irrigation consumes most of the water use according to the figure s 4 5 discussions 5 1 changes in parameters due to human activities the results of calibration and validation from 1960 to 1965 were shown in fig 11 simulated daily discharge of the huaxian station correlated well with the natural discharge during this period the nses were both larger than 0 7 and the values of the re during the calibration and validation periods were 11 0 and 1 7 fig 11 table 5 respectively the calibrated parameters were applied in simulation during 1966 2020 results in periods from 1961 to 1965 and 2017 2020 which were used to analyze whether parameters had changed are represented in fig 11 the unabridged result from 1961 to 2020 is shown in figure s 3 the nse was below zero and re was larger than 100 during 2017 2020 table 5 fig 11 which shows that the parameters calibrated in the natural water cycle simulation are not suitable for simulating the streamflow in the state affected by intense human activities due to climate change and land use cover change the parameters of wetspa in the study area have changed during these decades zhang et al 2021 so the parameters of wetspa need to be re calibrated in 2017 2020 the result is shown in table 6 in addition to the effects of climate change and human activities the neglect of anthropogenic human use can cause changes in parameters zhou et al 2022 the parameters set 2 and set 3 are the result calibrated by wetspa and wetspa ww in 2017 2020 respectively table 6 it can be seen from a comparison of parameters set 2 and set 3 that the petm evaporation correction coefficient in wetspa ww 0 75 is smaller than that in wetspa 0 95 also the depressm depression capacity correction coefficient has increased from 0 99 in wetspa to 1 22 in wetspa ww so that there is more evaporation from the surface water compared with wetspa ww wetspa overestimates evapotranspiration by modifying parameters through parameter calibration to compensate for the water consumed in human social activities that were not considered in the model table 1 fig 6 it may be that only if consumption increased namely evaporation in simulation the simulated streamflow can be close to the observed runoff without considering water consumed through anthropogenic water use activities 5 2 water use was identified as the major anthropogenic impact on streamflow in umwrb to further address the impacts of water withdrawal and consumption on streamflow with other human activities double mass curves dmcs gao et al 2017 and linear regression lines were used in this study the mann kendall burn and hag elnur 2002 kendall 1948 mann 1945 method was applied to detect abrupt changes in streamflow from 1960 to 2020 at huaxian the results in fig 12 indicate that an abrupt change occurred in 1970 the years before 1970 were considered a near natural period i e the impact of human activities could be neglected in the period the result is consistent with the abrupt change point identification in the weihe river basin by luan et al 2021 the period after the abrupt change point was defined as the impact period according to zhao et al 2014 the dmcs at huanxian displayed abrupt changes in the mid 1980 s meanwhile the amount of annual water withdrawal from the wei river has increased significantly since the 1990 s figure s 2 a mild impact period 1971 1989 and an intense impact period 1990 2020 were distinguished between the years 1971 2020 the dmcs of cumulative annual precipitation versus cumulative annual runoff at huaxian are shown in fig 13 the relative contributions of precipitation and human activities to changes in streamflow were assessed at huaxian table 7 according to the results of dmcs human activities have a significant impact on the runoff decrease contributing 83 33 and 91 03 in 1971 1989 and 1990 2020 respectively the result is generally consistent with that from ji and duan 2019 who analyzed the results from swat in the weihe river basin regarding 1960 1988 as the baseline and found that the contribution of human activities to the runoff decrease in the 1990 s was 86 43 which is similar to our findings in addition liu et al 2019 found that water use is a major direct human impact on streamflow in china during 1971 2010 in this study the results from section 4 3 indicate that water use reduces streamflow by 26 85 mm a in 2017 2020 while those from the dmcs reveal that human activities between 1990 and 2020 influenced 48 50 mm a therefore the impact of water use on streamflow accounted for 50 4 of the impact of human activities on streamflow which agrees with the conclusion of liu et al 2019 5 3 uncertainties of wetspa ww the major uncertainty in this quantitative assessment usually originates from input data müller schmied et al 2014 that is the uncertainties in streamflow simulations would spread to the assessment for example the monitoring of water resources of nwrmcbp was insufficient and there may have been missing measurement points incorrect data and other issues this indicates a large potential for the distributed hydrological models to improve streamflow simulations in china in addition to the direct impact of water withdrawal and water use on runoff other human activities are influencing hydrological processes such as dams and levees because of the lack of detailed data on reservoir regulation they were not considered as separate impact factors in our case study li et al 2016a b indicated that the impact degrees of reservoirs and dams were less than 10 in the weihe river basin nevertheless these factors should be considered in future research by modifying the wetspa ww to simulate the effect of reservoir regulation on the surface confluence process by interpreting the position collecting the storage capacity of each reservoir and obtaining water levels from remote sensing data to calculate the amount of water storage and release in addition to the uncertainties in simulations of streamflow the quantitative assessment depended on the selection of periods for comparison we performed similar assessments for different sub periods i e streamflow changes in 1971 1989 and 1990 2020 compared to the first decade 1961 1970 section 5 2 however the effects of water withdrawal on streamflow during 2017 2020 were assessed due to the limitation of water use data the proportion of the impact of water withdrawal to the impact of human activities was well worth obtaining more robust assessments over the same time 6 conclusions in past decades significant variation has taken place in the weihe river basin regarding streamflow due to the effects of human activities especially in the umwrb caused by irrigation and the development of human society and industry water intake activities have become increasingly fierce however the lack of high resolution water use information extremely limited our understanding of the dynamic variations in streamflow under the impact of water intake this study aimed to the impact of water withdrawal and consumption on runoff the major conclusions can be drawn as follows the developed model considered that water use activities promote simulation efficiency the re of streamflow decreased from 16 5 to 10 0 in calibration and from 11 1 to 10 7 in validation in terms of actual evapotranspiration re increased from 20 8 to 4 31 in calibration and 20 3 to 6 43 in validation when the water use process is ignored in the distributed hydrological model the actual evapotranspiration was overestimated in the calibration with the changed parameters thus the simulation can be close to the calibration target observed streamflow because the unrealistic neglect of water use activities in wetspa precludes the infiltration from irrigation more runoff evaporates from the surfaces therefore evapotranspiration will be overestimated and larger than the actual values the spatial resolution of the water use data has a great impact on the streamflow when the differences in water use among sub basins in the basin are not considered the streamflow at the outlet of the basin increases from 10 5 to 15 3 in the umwrb the downstream plain areas use more water and the upstream water consumption is relatively small however when the water withdrawal and consumption of the entire watershed are consistent the water consumption of the upstream sub basins will be high when the water consumption is higher than the available water resources the excess water consumption will be supplied by deep groundwater which has little impact on runoff but as the water withdrawal and consumption in downstream areas is underestimated the volume of water pumped from surface water or shallow groundwater is reduced so runoff will also be overestimated ultimately the inherent sub basin heterogeneities of water withdrawal consumption and water availability lead to an overestimation of runoff at the outlet of the umwrb the developed modeling framework wetspa ww is a useful tool for quantifying the impact of water withdrawal and water consumption that alter the streamflow directly the average water use is 49 64 mm a in the umwrb during 2017 2020 resulting in a reduction of streamflow by 22 24 mm a and an increase of actual evapotranspiration by 6 97 mm a this paper presents a novel approach to the use of spatiotemporal records of water use data in hydrological models by configuring individual water withdrawal and consumption values onto a 1 km grid then adapting a grid based hydrological model wetspa ww to use them also this study provides a comprehensive analysis and quantificationof the impact of water withdrawal and consumption on streamflow in a river basin the findings demonstrate the potential gains available to the distributed hydrological model from using records of actual water use where available in place of more widely used national statistics the developed model can also be further used to be a tool for balancing the often competing demands of different users and the natural environment with the consideration of human use and water resources together however the current research is only based on the observed data from nwrmcbp limited by the accuracy and period of project monitoring and is unable to be used for long series of historical or future water use activities therefore in future research the existing monitoring data can be used to construct the relationship between social factors meteorological factors hydrological factors and water use deeply coupling

2561,anthropogenic water use activities contribute substantially to natural hydrological processes however their effects on distributed hydrological simulations are currently poorly understood due to the lack of observed data on water use to address this issue we developed a model by using the water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules namely wetspa ww differently from previous studies roughly estimating water use the observed withdrawal of surface water and groundwater as well as industrial domestic and agricultural water consumption in sub basins were used according to the site based measurements this model was applied to the upper and middle reaches of the weihe river basin umwrb results show that 1 the proposed wetspa ww improved simulation efficiency both of streamflow and actual evapotranspiration aet e g the relative error re of aet decreased from 20 3 to 6 43 1 2 the re of streamflow at the outlet of the basin increases from 10 5 to 15 3 without considering the spatial distribution of water use among sub basins 3 in the period of 2017 2020 the mean water withdrawal stood at 49 64 mm a over the basin resulting in a reduction of streamflow by 22 24 mm a and an increase of actual evapotranspiration by 6 97 mm a this study demonstrates a great potential gain available to the distributed hydrological models integrating records of actual water use rather than more widely used national statistics keywords wetspa model weihe river basin water withdrawal water consumption streamflow data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction streamflow as the most direct manifestation of water resources is not only affected by climatic variability but also by human interventions e g water use biemans et al 2011 li et al 2022 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2018 recent studies have revealed that human activities contributed more to the streamflow decrease than climate change in some basins especially in arid or semi arid areas e g the yellow river basin and the haihe river basin in china li et al 2016a b understanding the mechanisms through which runoff changes respond to human activities can help mitigate droughts and floods in the future wu et al 2020 xu et al 2021 as an important part of human activities anthropogenic water use increased greatly in these years with the rapid development of the economy and the continuous growth of the population gong et al 2022 liu et al 2017 yang et al 2022 on the one hand many studies adopt the method of comparing results in different stages to assess the impact of water withdrawal on streamflow in a small catchment the hydrological model was calibrated and verified during the baseline period then it was used to reconstruct the natural runoff in the human activities influence stage the impact of human activities was estimated by the difference between the observed streamflow and the reconstructed natural runoff zhang et al 2014 for example wu et al 2020 found that direct human activities contributed most to runoff reduction under variation in the luanhe river basin by analyzing the simulations in different periods this approach does not exclude the uncertainty from other human activities like the impact of reservoir operation on the other hand water use activities have increasingly been incorporated into the processes of large scale hydrological models for better water use representation in hydrological models burek et al 2020 e g the h08 hanasaki et al 2008a b watergap alcamo et al 2003 matsiro pokhrel et al 2012 the spatial resolution of the large scale hydrological model is not suitable for the study on small catchments as the water withdrawal data available the 10 100 km typically employed in current models is not accurate enough for small catchments pokhrel et al 2016 few hydrological models are able to provide elaborate simulations at a small time step or over regions with rapid consumptive water use changes in small catchments some efforts have gone into better water use representation in hydrological models to quantify the impact of water use activities with the water use data input burek et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2015 pokhrel et al 2012 for example horan et al 2021 incorporated static estimates of water use based on household and irrigation census and public statistics of aquastat data fao 2016 in cauvery and narmada hall et al 2020 incorporated streamlined data sets of abstractions storage facilities and discharges in an application to the water supply system in england water withdrawal and consumption can be estimated in larger scale hydrological models for example for the global scale h08 model hanasaki et al 2008a b estimated water abstraction amounts from sectoral water use requirements and validated them against reported data from aquastat and other models e g watergap a similar method is used in the regional scale model rameshwaran et al 2021 for which anthropogenic water use activities are estimated from available countrywide sectoral data including information on population irrigated areas and livestock so the water withdrawal and consumption volume are commonly estimated from global statistics e g aquastat data fao 2016 or calculated from available nationwide sectoral data including information on population irrigated areas and livestock to estimate water use yokohata et al 2020 in above mentioned hydrological models however the water withdrawal data estimated by these two methods are still not accurate enough in time and space when compared with observed data especially in the regional hydrological simulations water use varies greatly from region to region due to the difference in water availability and socio economic development feng et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 for example irrigation water use varies due to the difference in regional water availability and crop production over a river basin different population densities contribute to the large spatial heterogeneity of water withdrawal for electricity generation mining and manufacturing huang et al 2018 anthropogenic water use influences regional water availability through water withdrawal and return flow ming et al 2018 in addition water is abstracted from surface water or underground water for agricultural industrial or domestic purposes abstracted water returns to the river or to the land after use the water returned to the land is largely lost from the catchment through evapotranspiration which influences regional water availability transiently since water use has a significant impact on regional water availability accurate estimation of water withdrawal is particularly important although the spatial and temporal distribution of water use plays an important role in water resources management rameshwaran et al 2022 xie et al 2021 many hydrological models do not explicitly include spatiotemporal observed water use data because such data are scarce arheimer et al 2020 as a distributed hydrological model with physical mechanisms although the water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere wetspa is suitable for estimating stocks of natural hydrological components e g streamflow actual evapotranspiration and groundwater the model currently does not account for anthropogenic water use activities yet the high potential of wetspa in predicting spatial hydrological components has been well documented bahremand et al 2006 bahremand et al 2007 karimi et al 2016 a combination of empirical and physical relationships is employed to characterize the hydrological regimes in the wetspa tavakoli and de smedt 2013 concluded that the performance of the model to predict soil moisture is promising which shows that the wetspa can provide an explicit physical representation of the soil moisture dynamics under the impact of irrigation water in addition wetspa provides a high potential in establishing a connection between water users and cells in the model as it is a gis grid based model rameshwaran et al 2022 therefore the water use activities can be coupled with the natural hydrological process in wetspa at a high resolution through the topological relationships in this study site based measurements on water use have enabled the incorporation of the water use activities into a grid based hydrological model the wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules wetspa ww provides daily simulations of streamflow at 1 km resolution to quantify the impacts of water use on streamflow the problems to be solved in this study are 1 to consider water withdrawal and consumption in the traditional distributed hydrological model 2 to find how the spatiotemporal distribution of water withdrawal and consumption has an influence on the streamflow at the watershed outlet and 3 to quantify the reduction in streamflow from water withdrawal and consumption 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yellow river basin is a typical semiarid basin yan et al 2018 with serious water shortage problems especially in the middle reaches of the yellow river mryrb zhao et al 2014 with the rapid development of society and the economy there is a rising demand for water resources in the mryrb the need for research on the impact of human activities on runoff is gradually increasing in the mryrb the weihe river is the largest tributary in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin with a total length of about 818 km and a drainage area of 134 800 km2 it originates from the north of niaoshu mountain in gansu province and flows eastward along the north flank of the qinling mountains into the yellow river the upper and middle reaches of the weihe river basin was studied due to the data limitation umwrb the region above the huaxian gaging station 104 0 e 109 9 e 33 7 n 37 4 n 103 898 km2 fig 1 topographically the altitude decreases from the highest northwestern mountain areas to the lowest southeastern umwrb is located in the transitional zone of continental monsoon climate zone arid and semi humid areas the mean maximum temperature is around 28 c in summer and 4 4 c in winter while the mean minimum temperature is around 19 7 c and 5 9 c respectively the annual average rainfall is approximately 521 mm and ranges from 344 to 761 mm across the umwrb there are distinct soil types with basalt derived soils in the north and sandstone derived soils in the south most of the catchment is cleared for cropping apart from that a small part of the northern catchment is covered with grassland while the southern part is partially covered by forest 2 2 geographical data the dem data were extracted from the srtm digital elevation model srtm with a resolution ratio of 1 km land use cover maps were downloaded from the data sharing infrastructure of earth system science http www geodata cn cropland is the major land use type accounting for about

meteorological administration http data cma cn global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam is a process based semi empirical model aiming at the estimation of land evaporation and its separate

stations is collected from the national water resources monitoring capacity building project nwrmcbp sector specific irrigation domestic industrial and ecological environment water and source specific surface and groundwater water withdrawal is provided from 2016 to 2020 for each water withdrawal station in the following non agricultural water is used to refer to the volume of the total water used excluding agricultural water including domestic industrial and ecological environment water in umwrb there are a total of 305 water intake monitoring stations of which 89 are surface water intake monitoring stations 197 are underground water well monitoring stations and 19 stations can monitor the water of two types of water intake according to the classification of water use there are 67 stations in the basin for agricultural water 54 industrial water stations 63 domestic water stations 114 stations for other types of water and 7 stations for various types of non agricultural water mixing of agricultural water types the location of the stations is shown in fig 2 a 3 methodology the model wetspa presented in this study is a distributed hydrological model for predicting the water and energy transfer between soil plants and the atmosphere due to the high potential in predicting spatial hydrological components under different conditions karimi et al 2016 in this study we developed wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules wetspa ww by incorporating wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules a schematic of the modeling framework is shown in fig 3 the model provides the opportunity to explicitly simulate water withdrawal and consumption in a finer resolution formulations of wetspa ww with a particular emphasis on the description of the water withdrawal module and water consumption module are provided as followed 3 1 wetspa wetspa was developed by wang et al 1996 to describe water and energy transfer between soil plants and the atmosphere this model has been under development suitable for use in flood prediction and watershed management on a catchment scale by kavian et al 2020 this model is physically based and simulates hydrological processes of precipitation snowmelt interception depression surface runoff infiltration evapotranspiration percolation interflow groundwater flow etc continuously both in time and space for which the water and energy balance are maintained on each raster cell the model can not only simulate and calculate the water balance and flood process at the basin outlet in different time steps but also dynamically reflect any point in the basin at any time thus it is easy to understand the process of runoff formation which is the response of the runoff process to spatial variation of three factors topography soil type and land use a schematic of the runoff modeling framework is shown in fig 3 the content in the orange box flow through the river network is simulated using saint venant equations and solved by the muskingum method morris 1979 gill 1978 hydrological processes in each grid cell are set in a cascading way starting from a precipitation event once the required data are collected and processed for use in the wetspa model identification of spatial model parameters is undertaken terrain features at each grid cell including elevation flow direction flow accumulation stream network stream link stream order slope and hydraulic radius are first extracted from the dem most of the parameters in the wetspa are the correction coefficient of the identified terrain features the name and range of parameters are shown in table s 1 3 2 wetspa with water withdrawal and consumption modules wetspa ww the wetspa ww is based on wetspa with the consideration of two new modules as for the parameters objective function optimization algorithm etc the wetspa ww remains the same as wetspa 3 2 1 water withdrawal coupling module to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of water withdrawal on runoff a water withdrawal module was developed coupling with wetspa a schematic description of the water intake is shown in figure s 1 a as for the water withdrawal module each sub basin is regarded as the smallest statistical unit of surface water abstraction since there is one and only one digital river in each sub basin as the first step in the water withdrawal module a series of net abstractions at day i from groundwater ww g i and surface waters ww s i separately are acquired in umwrb from nwrmcbp ww g i and ww s i of each sub basin are the sums of the monitored water volume of water withdrawal stations within each sub basin based location of the water withdrawal stations fig 2 a then the water withdrawal module extracts ww s i from the river in the outlet of each sub basin at day i similar to surface water withdrawal the statistical unit of the underground water withdrawal system is a sub basin it is different from surface water extraction directly from river channel in the sub basin the groundwater extraction scheme pumps from the groundwater reservoir of every grid in this sub basin which can be explained by the quick depletion of storage from groundwater reservoirs sharma et al 2020 the water withdrawal from underground in each grid cell on the day i ww g i l t of this sub basin can be obtained as 1 ww g i ww gt i n where the ww gt i l t is total water withdrawal from underground in this sub basin at day i and n is the number of grid cells in the sub basin unlike other groundwater pumping schemes the ww g i is estimated as the deficit in supply from the near surface sources to meet the total demand of a grid cell was obtained from the imaginary source to account for the water use from groundwater hanasaki et al 2018a rost et al 2008 in the water withdrawal module this imaginary source of water has been replaced by an explicit shallow groundwater pumping scheme based on measured data thus providing a dynamic link between human activities and natural water resources the dynamics in the water withdrawal module are determined by groundwater recharge and water pumping and the location of the water table is updated at every time step 3 2 2 water consumption coupling module return flow and delivery loss are important processes in water withdrawal hanasaki et al 2018b excluding the volume of water consumed the rest return flow can return to surface water soil or groundwater finally considering the difference between types of water use and a finer description of the daily water consumption and return flow we developed a water consumption and return flow module in wetspa this new module computes based on the water use data sets from the water withdrawal points the sector specific consumptions and return flows to groundwater and surface waters separately in the water consumption and return flow module water use w u tot is classified as irrigation w u irr and non agricultural water w u nirr the sum of domestic industrial and ecological environment water based on the water use categories from the water withdrawal stations for the non agricultural water use the non consumptive fraction is assumed to flow back to surface water as return flow for irrigation water it infiltrates into the soil as extra rainfall the non consumptive fraction of irrigation water however is stored in the soil or recharges groundwater depending on soil water balance pokhrel et al 2015 return flow was drained into the local river surface water rw s or grid cell groundwater rw g in the next time step hanasaki et al 2018a the module obtains sectoral water uses by counting time series of irrigation and non agricultural water at the scale of individual cities since the water use is closely related to human society a schematic description of the return flow is shown in figure s 1 b then the non irrigation water consumption rate c r nirr for each country is obtained by dividing the annual non irrigation water consumption by the non irrigation water withdrawal table s 2 annual non irrigation water consumption and non irrigation water withdrawal are obtained in the water resources bulletin of gansu province shaanxi province and ningxia province rw s i represents the return flow drainage to the river and at day i so rw s i can be expressed as 2 rw s i w u nirr i 1 cr nirr where w u nirr i is the water used for non irrigation at day i so the change of water storage of river at day i δ s r i l in a sub basin can be expressed as 3 δ s r i δ t q in i q out i w w s i r w s i 1 where δ t t is the model time step the q in i l t is the upstream discharge at i time defined as the streamflow at the outlet of the upstream sub basin q out i l t is the discharge of this sub basin ww s i is the net abstractions from the river at day i rw s i 1 represents the return flow to the river at day i 1 so that the change in groundwater storage at day i δ s g i l can be redefined as 4 δ s g i δ t r g i q g i ww g i rw g i 1 where δ t t is the model time step q g i l t is the groundwater discharge ww g i is the net abstractions from groundwater at i time rw g i 1 represents the return flow to the groundwater at day i 1 which is calculated by soil water balance the r g i l t is the net groundwater recharge excluding rw g i 1 at day i it is worth noting that the sum of r g i and rw g i 1 is defined as the gravity drainage flux less the capillary flux near the water table at i day they are represented separately in the equation to show that the return flow is produced according to the water use at day i 1 3 3 simulation scenarios according to chang et al 2015 human activities such as agricultural irrigation and reservoirs dramatically increased in the 1970 s at the weihe river basin and abrupt changes in annual runoff occurred around 1970 li et al 2016a b details are showed in section 5 1 in general there were relatively minor anthropogenic disturbances in the weihe river basin during 1960 1965 thus the umwrb can be seen as a pristine catchment during this period the data during 1960 1965 was used to verify the suitability of wetspa in the study area the year 1960 was used only as a spin up then the data during 1961 1963 and 1964 1965 were used to calibrate the parameters and validate the performance of the hydrological model respectively the second simulation was applied in 1966 2020 with wetspa since the main assessment was over the period 2017 2020 in the following study on water use the result in 2017 2020 was analyzed to confirm whether the parameters had changed under the influence of climate change and human activities to evaluate the model performance of the two models under the influence of intense human activities wetspa and wetspa ww are calibrated during 2017 2018 respectively with the year 2016 as a spin up and validation in 2019 2020 due to the limitation of water use data then the effectiveness of wetspa ww was verified by the comparison between the two models a schematic diagram of the simulations is shown in fig 4 3 4 evaluation metrics dynamically dimensioned search dds was used in the calibration of the model parameters and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was calculated based on observed and simulated streamflow was used as the objective function 5 nse 1 i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 additionally relative error re was used to evaluate model performance re is defined as follows 6 re i 1 n q sim i q obs i i 1 n q obs i where q sim i and q obs i are the daily simulated and observed daily streamflow at time step i n is the number of observations nse values range from infinitesimal to 1 the closer nse is to 1 the better the model performs re was used to evaluate the runoff volume bias between the observed and simulated streamflow the re value of 0 indicates no bias and a positive one indicates the overestimation of the simulation results relative to measured streamflow the calculation interval was 1 day this means all the water flows accompanying both the natural water cycle and anthropogenic water use were calculated and exchanged among the components at a daily interval by strictly tracking all water fluxes and storage 4 results 4 1 performance of wetspa ww in umwrb fig 5 shows the results of wetspa and wetspa ww in calibration and validation during 2017 2020 as for streamflow both wetspa of wetspa ww perform well the nses of calibration and validation are about 0 7 table 1 fig 5 however in the umwrb most rains fell in the summer and lasted for 1 or 2 h which typically triggered the generation of excess runoff exceeding the infiltration capacity and daily scale simulation could not describe the runoff process well this might explain why the inaccurate simulation of the peak flow in summary these results indicated that both wetspa and wetspa ww are validated well in the heavily human affected stage in terms of streamflow since the objective function is nse based on observed streamflow evapotranspiration is additionally used to validate the effectiveness of wetspa ww according to the results in fig 6 and table 1 it is found that wetspa ww simulated a better et than wetspa when compared with gleam the re of wetspa ww is less than 10 which is much smaller than that of wetspa table 1 wetspa ww outperforms wetspa in terms of nse in addition the wetspa ww is more accurate for actual evapotranspiration simulation than wetspa especially in winter and spring fig 6 also there is a general need for irrigation during winter wheat cultivation in the weihe river basin which illustrates that wetspa ww simulation performs better through the integration with water withdrawal and consumption modules therefore it can be argued that the accuracy of the streamflow simulation is improved by the water withdrawal and use modules the proposed model provides a better description of the hydrological processes when compared to wetspa the results in table 1 show that both nse and re of wetspa ww are better than wetspa confirming the superiority of wetspa ww too 4 2 response of streamflow to the resolution of data on water use water withdrawal in cities in the southeast such as xi an baoji and weinan which are located in the guanzhong plain is higher than that in the northwest relatively speaking the upstream area like tianshui and pingliang has smaller water intake and the main water source there is surface water in terms of water use in most regions irrigation is the dominant sector agricultural water in the umwrb accounts for more than 50 of the total water use as there are more irrigation areas in the downstream area the guanzhong plain there are denser water withdrawal stations in this area the volume of water used in agriculture fluctuated greatly throughout the year non agricultural water use changed less frequently over time agricultural water use mainly increased in march june and december since a winter wheat summer maize rotation system was adopted for the climate in the study area details of the temporal and spatial variation of water withdrawal and consumption can be found in fig s 4 7 to explore the impact of the resolution of water use on runoff water use was appropriately redistributed in different scenarios the differences between the streamflow simulated by wetspa ww in water withdrawal scenarios with other inputs remaining the same are attributed to disturbances of water withdrawal activities in the umwrb spatiotemporal variation of water use in different scenarios is shown in table 2 fig 7 fig 8 shows the streamflow of the simulations by using the wetspa ww model at huaxian station in varied water user scenarios table 3 shows the re of simulated streamflow in varied scenarios with simulated streamflow in sv tv the difference between the simulation results of the models is obvious in the low flow stage indicating that water use activities have a greater impact on runoff at this stage when spatial variation at the basin scale was ignored but observation based temporal variation was included su tv poor quality simulations of daily catchment streamflow were obtained the streamflow time series at huaxian station were overestimated by over 15 in this case which shows that the change of the upstream water intake can have a large impact on the downstream flow this increased the annual streamflow from 73 15 mm a to 84 36 mm a when the sv tv model was used the data in su tv is homogeneous in the catchment but varies over time while sv tu provided better simulations of daily streamflow than su tv which shows that the spatial resolution of the water intake data has a great impact on the runoff simulation the result is consistent with the conclusion of rameshwaran et al 2022 which indicates that abstractions and discharge measurements provide a means to improve the performance of spatially distributed hydrological models for sv tv 1 5 only amplify or minify the daily water withdrawal in all sites by a factor of 1 5 with the same temporal and spatial variation as sv tv the operation of sv tv 0 5 was similar to that of sv tv 1 5 with only the factor replaced by 0 5 by comparing the results of sv tv 0 5 sv tv and sv tv 1 5 it can be concluded that the larger the water consumption the smaller the actual evaporation which further proves that the actual evaporation would be overestimated without considering water withdrawal and consumption it is worth noting that sv tv 1 5 showed a better re compared with that of sv tv which may have been the result of the uncertainty of the model or that the water withdrawal data was relatively small compared to the reality or the misestimation of the water consumption rate 4 3 the impact on streamflow from water withdrawal and consumption fig 9 summarizes the monthly streamflow difference between the blue line the scenario without water withdrawal and consumption data input and the red line the scenario with water withdrawal and consumption data input during 2017 2020 with wetspa ww the difference between the simulations of streamflow under the two scenarios can be seen as the effect of water use on runoff while the two scenarios are run with the same meteorological data input and parameters among them 2016 is the warm up period then the results were not shown water use had negative effects on streamflow in the umwrb the scenario without water use data input is regarded as the simulation of runoff with the interventions of water withdrawal and water consumption relatively speaking the scenario with water use data input is the nearly natural streamflow simulation ignoring the water management since other human interventions like land use change and reservoir regulation are not considered since the short duration and no large reservoir in the study area the differences in hydrograph demonstrate the hydrological response of the water use exhibiting generally lower streamflow especially in the low flow periods for annual runoff the difference between the results under the two scenarios is shown in table 4 the results show an increase at a rate of 10 mm per year which reflects that the impact of water use on runoff has a cumulative effect during the calculation period therefore the difference between the two simulations in 2020 can be seen as the cumulative value of the impact of water use on streamflow over four years so the annual impact of water use is 26 85 mm a furthermore annual water use is 49 64 mm a it can be concluded that the impact of water use on streamflow is about 54 of the volume of water use in the umwrb besides the deviation of the runoff process fig 10 presents the average monthly variations of streamflow estimations from a scenario with water use input and streamflow estimations from the scenario without water withdrawal and consumption data input during the simulation period compared with the other scenario the simulation in the scenario with water use data input is generally smaller and the simulation results in winter and irrigation period march june to august have greater deviations during a year as irrigation consumes most of the water use according to the figure s 4 5 discussions 5 1 changes in parameters due to human activities the results of calibration and validation from 1960 to 1965 were shown in fig 11 simulated daily discharge of the huaxian station correlated well with the natural discharge during this period the nses were both larger than 0 7 and the values of the re during the calibration and validation periods were 11 0 and 1 7 fig 11 table 5 respectively the calibrated parameters were applied in simulation during 1966 2020 results in periods from 1961 to 1965 and 2017 2020 which were used to analyze whether parameters had changed are represented in fig 11 the unabridged result from 1961 to 2020 is shown in figure s 3 the nse was below zero and re was larger than 100 during 2017 2020 table 5 fig 11 which shows that the parameters calibrated in the natural water cycle simulation are not suitable for simulating the streamflow in the state affected by intense human activities due to climate change and land use cover change the parameters of wetspa in the study area have changed during these decades zhang et al 2021 so the parameters of wetspa need to be re calibrated in 2017 2020 the result is shown in table 6 in addition to the effects of climate change and human activities the neglect of anthropogenic human use can cause changes in parameters zhou et al 2022 the parameters set 2 and set 3 are the result calibrated by wetspa and wetspa ww in 2017 2020 respectively table 6 it can be seen from a comparison of parameters set 2 and set 3 that the petm evaporation correction coefficient in wetspa ww 0 75 is smaller than that in wetspa 0 95 also the depressm depression capacity correction coefficient has increased from 0 99 in wetspa to 1 22 in wetspa ww so that there is more evaporation from the surface water compared with wetspa ww wetspa overestimates evapotranspiration by modifying parameters through parameter calibration to compensate for the water consumed in human social activities that were not considered in the model table 1 fig 6 it may be that only if consumption increased namely evaporation in simulation the simulated streamflow can be close to the observed runoff without considering water consumed through anthropogenic water use activities 5 2 water use was identified as the major anthropogenic impact on streamflow in umwrb to further address the impacts of water withdrawal and consumption on streamflow with other human activities double mass curves dmcs gao et al 2017 and linear regression lines were used in this study the mann kendall burn and hag elnur 2002 kendall 1948 mann 1945 method was applied to detect abrupt changes in streamflow from 1960 to 2020 at huaxian the results in fig 12 indicate that an abrupt change occurred in 1970 the years before 1970 were considered a near natural period i e the impact of human activities could be neglected in the period the result is consistent with the abrupt change point identification in the weihe river basin by luan et al 2021 the period after the abrupt change point was defined as the impact period according to zhao et al 2014 the dmcs at huanxian displayed abrupt changes in the mid 1980 s meanwhile the amount of annual water withdrawal from the wei river has increased significantly since the 1990 s figure s 2 a mild impact period 1971 1989 and an intense impact period 1990 2020 were distinguished between the years 1971 2020 the dmcs of cumulative annual precipitation versus cumulative annual runoff at huaxian are shown in fig 13 the relative contributions of precipitation and human activities to changes in streamflow were assessed at huaxian table 7 according to the results of dmcs human activities have a significant impact on the runoff decrease contributing 83 33 and 91 03 in 1971 1989 and 1990 2020 respectively the result is generally consistent with that from ji and duan 2019 who analyzed the results from swat in the weihe river basin regarding 1960 1988 as the baseline and found that the contribution of human activities to the runoff decrease in the 1990 s was 86 43 which is similar to our findings in addition liu et al 2019 found that water use is a major direct human impact on streamflow in china during 1971 2010 in this study the results from section 4 3 indicate that water use reduces streamflow by 26 85 mm a in 2017 2020 while those from the dmcs reveal that human activities between 1990 and 2020 influenced 48 50 mm a therefore the impact of water use on streamflow accounted for 50 4 of the impact of human activities on streamflow which agrees with the conclusion of liu et al 2019 5 3 uncertainties of wetspa ww the major uncertainty in this quantitative assessment usually originates from input data müller schmied et al 2014 that is the uncertainties in streamflow simulations would spread to the assessment for example the monitoring of water resources of nwrmcbp was insufficient and there may have been missing measurement points incorrect data and other issues this indicates a large potential for the distributed hydrological models to improve streamflow simulations in china in addition to the direct impact of water withdrawal and water use on runoff other human activities are influencing hydrological processes such as dams and levees because of the lack of detailed data on reservoir regulation they were not considered as separate impact factors in our case study li et al 2016a b indicated that the impact degrees of reservoirs and dams were less than 10 in the weihe river basin nevertheless these factors should be considered in future research by modifying the wetspa ww to simulate the effect of reservoir regulation on the surface confluence process by interpreting the position collecting the storage capacity of each reservoir and obtaining water levels from remote sensing data to calculate the amount of water storage and release in addition to the uncertainties in simulations of streamflow the quantitative assessment depended on the selection of periods for comparison we performed similar assessments for different sub periods i e streamflow changes in 1971 1989 and 1990 2020 compared to the first decade 1961 1970 section 5 2 however the effects of water withdrawal on streamflow during 2017 2020 were assessed due to the limitation of water use data the proportion of the impact of water withdrawal to the impact of human activities was well worth obtaining more robust assessments over the same time 6 conclusions in past decades significant variation has taken place in the weihe river basin regarding streamflow due to the effects of human activities especially in the umwrb caused by irrigation and the development of human society and industry water intake activities have become increasingly fierce however the lack of high resolution water use information extremely limited our understanding of the dynamic variations in streamflow under the impact of water intake this study aimed to the impact of water withdrawal and consumption on runoff the major conclusions can be drawn as follows the developed model considered that water use activities promote simulation efficiency the re of streamflow decreased from 16 5 to 10 0 in calibration and from 11 1 to 10 7 in validation in terms of actual evapotranspiration re increased from 20 8 to 4 31 in calibration and 20 3 to 6 43 in validation when the water use process is ignored in the distributed hydrological model the actual evapotranspiration was overestimated in the calibration with the changed parameters thus the simulation can be close to the calibration target observed streamflow because the unrealistic neglect of water use activities in wetspa precludes the infiltration from irrigation more runoff evaporates from the surfaces therefore evapotranspiration will be overestimated and larger than the actual values the spatial resolution of the water use data has a great impact on the streamflow when the differences in water use among sub basins in the basin are not considered the streamflow at the outlet of the basin increases from 10 5 to 15 3 in the umwrb the downstream plain areas use more water and the upstream water consumption is relatively small however when the water withdrawal and consumption of the entire watershed are consistent the water consumption of the upstream sub basins will be high when the water consumption is higher than the available water resources the excess water consumption will be supplied by deep groundwater which has little impact on runoff but as the water withdrawal and consumption in downstream areas is underestimated the volume of water pumped from surface water or shallow groundwater is reduced so runoff will also be overestimated ultimately the inherent sub basin heterogeneities of water withdrawal consumption and water availability lead to an overestimation of runoff at the outlet of the umwrb the developed modeling framework wetspa ww is a useful tool for quantifying the impact of water withdrawal and water consumption that alter the streamflow directly the average water use is 49 64 mm a in the umwrb during 2017 2020 resulting in a reduction of streamflow by 22 24 mm a and an increase of actual evapotranspiration by 6 97 mm a this paper presents a novel approach to the use of spatiotemporal records of water use data in hydrological models by configuring individual water withdrawal and consumption values onto a 1 km grid then adapting a grid based hydrological model wetspa ww to use them also this study provides a comprehensive analysis and quantificationof the impact of water withdrawal and consumption on streamflow in a river basin the findings demonstrate the potential gains available to the distributed hydrological model from using records of actual water use where available in place of more widely used national statistics the developed model can also be further used to be a tool for balancing the often competing demands of different users and the natural environment with the consideration of human use and water resources together however the current research is only based on the observed data from nwrmcbp limited by the accuracy and period of project monitoring and is unable to be used for long series of historical or future water use activities therefore in future research the existing monitoring data can be used to construct the relationship between social factors meteorological factors hydrological factors and water use deeply coupling

2562,morphodynamics is essential to the sustainable development of estuaries and plays an importance role in sediment movement material and energy exchange and ecosystem health the divergent morphology of estuary commonly traps sediment and causes sediment deposition which threats flood control navigation and ecological environment and finally leads to the unsustainability of estuarine development shenzhen bay china is highly anthropogenic influenced waters between shenzhen and hong kong two densely populated and highly urbanized cities due to an expansion in the middle of the bay shenzhen bay has been experiencing persistent siltation in order to keep the sustainability of the bay an artificial island scheme ais was proposed on the tidal flat of the expansion area which aimed to fundamentally control or reduce sedimentation by changing the morphology of the bay and at the same time made ecological compensation for habitat loss the hydrodynamic and sediment transport models were applied to evaluate the impact of the ais on tidal current sediment control and siltation the numerical results indicated that the proposed ais increased the tidal current around the island thus reducing the sediment transport into the inner bay and effectively mitigating the sedimentation in the siltation areas on the other hand the island was proposed to be designed as an appropriate ecological site to provide multiple functions such as foraging nesting and breeding of estuarine species especially important migratory birds to improve health and sustainable development this idea of estuary governance is also applicable to other estuaries with similar conditions to promote the sustainable management of estuaries keywords estuarine sustainability morphodynamics sediment deposition and control artificial island scheme shenzhen bay data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction estuarine region is an important area of economy society and environment which supports diverse civilizations and ecosystems with abundant resources and convenient transportation branch 1999 chee et al 2017 vousdoukas et al 2020 it provides essential nutrients and habitats to various species constructing one of the most productive ecosystems with high biodiversity on the earth canuel hardison 2016 du et al 2018 in addition about 70 of the world s largest cities are situated near estuaries leuven et al 2019 based on the potentials estuaries offered people have developed navigation fishery mining reclamation and so on to support their social and economic needs ranasinghe et al 2013 thus human development requires a healthy estuary now and in the future however frequent human activities have brought the estuarine health into a state of great danger branch 1999 so far sediment deposition flooding eutrophication and ecological degradation are the major challenges that estuaries all over the world are experiencing de araujo barbosa et al 2016 vellinga et al 2014 sustainable management of estuaries to recover and maintain the estuarine health and sustainability is urgently needed for the development of both human and ecosystem among the aforementioned challenges faced by estuaries siltation is a common problem in estuaries all over the world azhikodan yokoyama 2019 horikawa 1981 it not only threatens navigation safety and flooding control but also aggravates other related estuarine problems such as water quality deterioration and ecological degradation against the sustainable development of estuaries antunes do carmo 2019 hanley et al 2014 dredging is a common method to reduce sediment deposition bianchini et al 2019 jeuken wang 2010 which is a routine process to maintain the necessary water depth to ensure the safety of navigation in global estuaries such as the seine estuary carpentier et al 2002 the mersey estuary brown et al 2015 and the delaware estuary carr et al 2018 however it must be acknowledged that the large scale dredging project has brought some negative effects on the estuarine environment and the treatment and dumping of a large amount of dredged sediments has also become another major problem gross 1978 manap voulvoulis 2015 in addition sediment may re enter the dredging area resulting in new and even more serious sediment deposition in the estuary monge ganuzas et al 2013 townend whitehead 2003 this re siltation will increase the frequency of dredging indicating the unsustainability of simple dredging operations van maren et al 2015 therefore it is urgent to implement comprehensive management strategies to control sediment deposition based on sediment deposition mechanism such as changing estuarine morphology and hydrodynamic conditions in order to achieve environmental societal and economic sustainability in estuarine areas bianchini et al 2019 estuaries are commonly considered as effective sediment trapping with the consequence of sedimentation due to the divergent morphology burchard et al 2018 gross 1978 therefore modification of estuarine morphology and improvement of hydrodynamic conditions are two essential aspects of the sustainable siltation control in estuaries in the yangtze river estuary of china the modification of the morphology by training walls led to stronger flow at the subaqueous delta and resulting in erosion in this area luan et al 2018 in the developing alluvial system it is expected that islands will be generated in the widest reach to improve the flow by reducing the channel width with the sedimentary balance of the system leli stevaux 2021 midchannel island greatly affected the flow structure around the island thus dominate the channel morphology heidari et al 2021 channel morphology after the restored poplar island influenced flood ebb dominance in marshes in the chesapeake bay fleri et al 2019 a well designed artificial island based on morphodynamics can promote the sustainable development of the alluvial system sadek 2013 proposed different alternatives for island development to mitigate the sedimentation and maintain channel stability in the nile river shenzhen bay china is transboundary waters between shenzhen and hong kong two densely populated and highly urbanized cities this region experienced rapid population growth and fast economic development in the past 50 years in 2019 more than 390 billion dollars annual gross domestic product of shenzhen and over 10 million populations there were intimately related to shenzhen bay shenzhen government 2020 meanwhile the bay is of great ecological value with a large area of mangroves and the winter habitat for numerous east asian migratory birds feng et al 2020 firth et al 2014 however with the increasing growth of economy and population shenzhen bay has resulted in a series of environmental issues such as eutrophication zhou et al 2020 flow attenuation lei et al 2022 wang et al 2020a and sediment deposition zhang mao 2015 due to anthropogenic activities such as increasing effluent discharge aquaculture reclamation etc these issues have aroused great concerns of the governments of both shenzhen and hong kong the core issue is whether the bay could maintain sustainable development notably continuous siltation has occurred in shenzhen bay in a long period due to divergent morphology which reduced the flood carrying capacity and was one of the most challenging issues to the estuarine environment and sustainability especially in the area near dasha estuary the shape of the estuary formed as a right angled triangle after more than 10 km2 area reclaimed from the bay thus the cross sections from dasha river to the bay showed a sudden amplification a large area of tidal flat was formed in this triangular region with around 33 area exposed at low tide this serious siltation with unpleasant odour in the area near dasha estuary is one of the most urgent issues that need to be managed in the sustainable development of shenzhen bay dredging alone cannot fundamentally solve the problem of continuous sediment deposition which will cost a lot and damage the estuarine ecosystem a sustainable development scheme that expects to control or reduce the continuous sedimentation with the concerns of ecological environment is urgent to be proposed in shenzhen bay therefore in this study an artificial island scheme ais was proposed based on the mechanism of sediment deposition the hydrodynamic model and sediment transport model were applied to investigate the effect of the ais on the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shenzhen bay and the effectiveness on controlling sedimentation the feasibility and practicability of the scheme in silt treatment environment improvement and ecological protection were discussed 2 methods 2 1 study area shenzhen bay 22 5 n 114 e is located in the eastern pearl river estuary south china fig 1 which is the cross border waters between shenzhen and hong kong it is a semi enclosed bay with an area of about 85 km2 the tide in the bay is irregular semi diurnal tide with an average range of 1 5 m the fresh water entering the bay is mainly from shenzhen river dasha river xiaosha river and yuen long river shenzhen river contributes about 74 6 of fresh water with an average annual discharge of 5 3 108 m3 zhou et al 2020 seven cross sections s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 were set to investigate the effects on the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shenzhen bay fig 1 for ease of description the area from the section s0 to s1 is called outer bay from s1 to s3 called middle bay and from s3 to s5 called inner bay and the triangular region from dasha river mouth to s6 is called the area outside dasha estuary from inner bay to outer bay the average water depth gradually deepens from 1 0 m to about 7 0 m with a deep channel in the central fig 1 the average water depth in the triangular area outside dasha estuary is less than 1 0 m in recent decades the rapid development of urbanization on both sides of the bay has affected the coastal environment resulted in eutrophication wang et al 2016 and accelerated sediment deposition zhang mao 2015 in shenzhen bay especially since the 1990s the land reclamation in the north has shaped the bay in expansion in the middle with a right triangle area outside dasha estuary fig 1 therefore the area of the bay decreased and the hydrodynamic conditions changed which aggravated the sediment deposition in the tidal flat especially the northern part from shenzhen river to dasha river fig 1 the average rate of sediment deposition above 0 m contour reached 2 5 cm a wu et al 2015 the measured seabed change in shenzhen bay from 2010 to 2014 showed that 78 4 of the area was silted fig 2 the total volume of siltation was 1 1 107 m3 with an average siltation thickness of 0 031 m a in the northern outer bay the seabed was significantly deepened due to dredging in the triangular area outside dasha estuary the average siltation thickness was 0 05 m a and continuous siltation led to large areas exposed at low tide the area of tidal flat in inner bay was more than 7 km2 as a result it greatly reduced the flood carrying capacity of the estuary and increased the flood risk therefore the siltation treatment was an urgent problem to the sustainable development of shenzhen bay shenzhen bay is located in the subtropical monsoon region with an average annual rainfall of 1750 mm and an average annual air temperature of 23 c mai po nature reserve fig 1 is located in the south of inner bay with a total area of about 15 km2 and it is in the list of wetland of international importance under the ramsar convention together with inner deep bay jia et al 2014 liang et al 1999 futian mangrove reserve one of china s national nature reserves is located along the northern inner bay with an area of about 3 68 km2 fig 1 the suitable climate abundant food in the tidal flats and the habitat provided by mangroves and wetlands make shenzhen bay an important migratory stopover site for migratory birds in the east asian australasian flyway more than 100 thousand migratory birds with approximate 180 species including black faced spoonbills came to shenzhen bay for wintering every year wei et al 2017 yang chui 2018 therefore the sustainable management of shenzhen bay needs to take its important ecological functions into account 2 2 artificial island scheme based on the geomorphology and mechanism of sediment deposition a triangular artificial island with an area of about 2 2 km2 was proposed to be built on the tidal flat outside dasha estuary as shown in fig 1 the size and location of the artificial island were designed according to 1 the southeast boundary of the artificial island was along the northern shoreline of shenzhen bay the western and northern boundaries of the island were parallel to the shoreline 2 the western and northern channels between the island and the shoreline with a breadth of 800 m were dredged to 1 2 m below the mean low tide level 3 the breadth of the channels must be greater than the roosting scare distance 700 m for black faced spoonbills save international u o c berkeley 2014 4 the dredged volume was about 4 8 105 m3 all of which could be used to build the island the ais aimed to reduce sediment trapping in estuary and provided habitat for estuarine creatures as ecological compensation on the other hand it was expected to improve the flood carrying capacity for dasha river with minimal ecological damage 2 3 numerical modelling and verification numerical models are commonly used to evaluate hydrodynamic effect and sediment transport fleri et al 2019 guan et al 2018 zhang mao 2015 in this study the 2 d depth averaged model of delft3d deltares 2014 was applied to investigate the changes of flow field and sediment transport and evaluate the effect of the ais in shenzhen bay the pearl river estuary shenzhen bay and shenzhen river were included in the model to reduce the boundary influence fig 1 the structure gird was constructed using curvilinear orthogonal coordinates with a resolution of about 60 m 80 m to 380 m 390 m in shenzhen bay the boundary conditions of the open boundaries op1 op2 and op3 were given by the observed hourly tide level from hong kong observatory hko the daily observed river fluxes at the boundary op4 were given from the observation of water affairs bureau of shenzhen municipality of china wabsm the average river flow of shenzhen river in wet season apr sep was around 30 m3 s while the average river flow in dry season oct mar was around 10 m3 s river flow of dasha river was around 4 m3 s suspended sediment transport was calculated by solving the advection diffusion equation the suspended sediment in the bay is mostly cohesive fines silt and clay with coarser particles occasionally found near the mouth and top of the bay the empirical partheniades formula for cohesive materials was adopted to calculate the equilibrium sediment transport rate the erosional parameters and shear stress were set to match the measured data two kinds of sediments were selected with a settling velocity of 0 30 mm s and 0 03 mm s detailed model description of the delft3d can be found in the delft3d manual deltares 2014 the model was verified using the field data of synchronous surveys in 2012 the hourly tide data observed at two tide gauge stations tsim bei tsui tbt and chek lap kok clk were obtained from hko the verification period included rainy season from 14 july 2012 to 29 july 2012 and dry season from 12 oct 2012 to 27 oct 2012 the current velocity and suspended sediment concentration ssc measured in spring tide from 18 oct 2012 11 00 to 19 oct 2012 11 00 and neap tide from 25 oct 2012 06 00 to 26 oct 2012 06 00 at st and sm stations were obtained from wabsm the bathymetry in the study was also provided by wabsm all the observation stations are shown in fig 1 the index of agreement d willmott 1981 was used to estimate model performance 1 d 1 s m 2 s m m m 2 where s is the simulated data m is the measured data and m is the mean value of measured data the closer the d value is to 1 the higher the agreement between the measured and simulated data is the simulated results were compared with the measured data as shown in fig 3 the fluctuation trend and magnitude of water level velocity and ssc calculated by the model were consistent with the observations the root mean square errors rmses between the simulated results and the measured ones are shown in table 1 the d values for water level at tbt and clk were 0 96 and 0 93 respectively the rmses were 0 17 m and 0 15 m at tbt and clk respectively the d values for velocity at st and sm were 0 89 and 0 90 the average rmses of velocity were 0 16 m s and 0 10 m s at st and sm respectively the d values for ssc at st and sm were 0 80 and 0 76 respectively the average rmses of ssc were 0 04 kg m3 and 0 01 kg m3 at st and sm respectively at st the model results including speed and ssc were slightly underestimated at neap tide which might be affected by the accuracy of local bathymetry and the upstream daily flow totally the verification results showed that the model was reliable and supported that the model was dependable for subsequent applications after the model was verified the flow field and ssc in shenzhen bay were simulated for the entire year of 2012 and we focused on the bathymetry changes in the bay due to the deposition and erosion of sediment after the implementation of the ais the deposition or erosion was estimated through sediment volume change calculations using the model 3 results 3 1 current and sediment transport in shenzhen bay the distribution of depth averaged velocity and ssc in shenzhen bay is shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of velocity and ssc was affected by the morphology of the bay compared with the reach between s0 and s1 the speed and ssc at the maximum ebb and flood were a little larger due to the narrower cross section between s1 to s2 while the speed and ssc were a little smaller due to the wider cross section between s2 and s4 from s4 to upstream the speed and ssc increased greatly with the decrease of cross section area in the area outside dasha estuary it presented low speed and low ssc at the maximum ebb and flood because of its shallow water depth from middle bay to this area the speed and ssc decreased greatly the average speed and ssc in middle bay at the maximum flood ebb were 0 40 0 38 m s and 0 041 0 055 kg m3 respectively while in this area they were 0 17 0 14 m s and 0 021 0 017 kg m3 respectively compared with middle bay the speed and ssc decreased by about 60 and a low ssc zone was formed in the area outside dasha estuary the formation of this low ssc zone was related to the expanded geometry of the area outside dasha estuary and led to continuous siltation in this region during flood tide the velocity fig 4a and sediment transport fig 4c showed divergent distribution from s2 to s3 and then convergent distribution from s3 to s4 just the opposite during ebb tide the velocity fig 4b and sediment transport fig 4d showed divergent distribution from s4 to s3 and then convergent distribution from s3 to s2 in the area outside dasha estuary the velocity and sediment transport decreased significantly the average sediment transport at the maximum flood and ebb was around 0 02 10 4 m3 m s and 0 01 10 4 m3 m s respectively which decreased by 95 compared with those of middle bay it indicated that the suspended sediments transported into the area might settle in this region and forming continuous siltation the distribution of simulated annual seabed change of shenzhen bay is shown in fig 5 about 71 of the bay was silted with an annual siltation volume of about 3 01 106 m3 the deposition mainly happened in inner bay south of middle bay outer bay and the area outside dasha estuary while the erosion occurred in the deep channel of the bay in the area outside dasha estuary it experienced siltation with an average sediment thickness of about 0 05 m the erosion and deposition were well correlated to the measured data fig 2 combined with the results of sediment transport in the bay the sediment might mainly come from the erosion of middle bay and be transported to inner bay and the area outside dasha estuary due to the divergent geometry the velocity decreased and suspended sediments deposited in this area with a formation of the low ssc zone therefore the shape expansion of the area outside dasha estuary caused the continuous deposition in this region the ais we proposed aimed to reduce this expansion and might mitigate the siltation in the area 3 2 effect on hydrodynamics and sediment transport after the ais the construction of artificial island changed the morphology of shenzhen bay thus changing the flow field and sediment transport of the bay as shown in fig 6 the tidal current around the island greatly increased at the maximum flood after the ais the average speed in the northern channel increased from 0 18 m s to 0 20 m s an increase of 11 in the western channel the average speed increased from 0 17 m s to 0 28 m s an increase of 65 the average speed increased slightly from 0 31 m s to 0 32 m s in inner bay but decreased slightly in middle bay from 0 40 m s to 0 38 m s and outer bay from 0 37 m s to 0 36 m s similarly at the maximum ebb the average speed in the northern channel increased from 0 14 m s to 0 19 m s an increase of 36 in the western channel the speed increased from 0 15 m s to 0 29 m s an increase of 93 the average speed didn t change in inner bay 0 26 m s but decreased slightly in middle bay from 0 38 m s to 0 36 m s and outer bay from 0 37 m s to 0 36 m s it indicated that after the ais the current increased greatly in the area outside dasha estuary while it changed slightly in other area of the bay in the areas outside dasha estuary there was a large area of tidal flats which was exposed at low tide level and the current was small at high tide level due to shallow water depth the construction of the artificial island greatly altered the local morphology as a result the tidal current in the two channels around the island increased significantly which would help to mitigate sedimentation in this area the distribution of ssc difference without and with the ais in shenzhen bay is shown in fig 7 after the ais the average ssc in the area outside dasha estuary either at the maximum flood or ebb increased by 0 004 0 005 kg m3 more than 20 while the average sscs decreased by about 0 003 kg m3 in middle bay less than 7 it indicated that the ais increased the ssc in the area around artificial island while there was a little influence in other area of the bay the average ssc increased greatly 0 01 kg m3 in the western channel but changed a little 0 004 kg m3 in the northern channel after the ais the distribution of depth averaged sediment transport and 15 day cumulative sediment transport cst at cross sections without and with the ais is shown in fig 8 sediment transport was driven by hydrodynamics so sediment transport and velocity distribution were similar at the maximum flood the distribution of sediment transport was similar except the two channels around the island without and with the ais the average sediment transport of outer bay middle bay and inner bay was 0 52 10 4 m3 m s 0 31 10 4 m3 m s and 0 11 10 4 m3 m s without the ais respectively and they decreased a little by 5 13 and 2 in the corresponding reaches with the ais and the directions of transport were landward almost the same fig 8a at the maximum ebb the average sediment transport of outer bay middle bay and inner bay was 0 41 10 4 m3 m s 0 26 10 4 m3 m s and 0 05 10 4 m3 m s without the ais respectively they decreased by 8 and 11 in outer bay and middle bay and increased by 1 in inner bay after the ais and the directions of transport were seaward almost the same fig 8b however in the area outside dasha estuary the sediment transport increased significantly after the ais at the maximum flood ebb the average sediment transport increased from 0 01 10 4 0 01 10 4 m3 m s to 0 03 10 4 0 06 10 4 m3 m s in the northern channel and increased from 0 03 10 4 0 01 10 4 m3 m s to 0 15 10 4 0 06 10 4 m3 m s in the western channel the direction of transport completely changed and they were all along the channel after the ais the 15 day cst at different cross sections in wet season fig 8c was similar to that in dry season fig 8d the 15 day cst at s0 to s4 and s6 was landward while it was seaward at s5 indicating that the sediment in shenzhen bay was transported from pearl river estuary and shenzhen river the average cst at s0 was around 2 9 104 m3 m s and decreased to 0 21 104 m3 m s at s1 and then increased to 0 32 104 m3 m s at s2 it showed that most of the sediment deposited in outer bay and the increase of cst from s1 to s2 might be due to sediment resuspension from s2 to s4 the cst gradually decreased to 0 14 104 m3 m s and 0 13 104 m3 m s the cst from shenzhen river to the bay through s5 was only 0 06 104 m3 m s at s6 the cst was landward with a total of 0 18 104 m3 m s indicating that the sediment was transported to the area outside dasha estuary and deposited there after the ais the cst decreased by 0 12 3 25 and 9 at s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 respectively but the directions were almost the same however the cst decreased by 41 at s6 therefore after the ais less sediment was transported to inner bay and the area outside dasha estuary which would mitigate the sedimentation in these areas 3 3 effect on deposition and erosion the distribution of erosion and deposition in shenzhen bay after the ais is shown in fig 9 the change mainly occurred in the areas around island especially in the western channel in the northern channel the sedimentation was similar to that without the scheme with an average thickness of about 0 04 m however in the western channel the seabed changed from sedimentation with a depth of 0 02 0 08 m to erosion with a depth of 0 02 0 08 m and in the area between s2 and s4 outside the island the seabed changed from sedimentation with a depth of 0 02 m to erosion with a depth of 0 02 m the area of siltation and erosion is shown in table 2 before the ais the area of siltation aos and area of erosion aoe in shenzhen bay were about 64 155 106 m2 and 21 442 106 m2 respectively after the scheme the aos and aoe were about 61 659 106 m2 and 21 809 106 m2 in the area outside dasha estuary the aos and aoe were about 6 267 106 m2 and 0 266 106 m2 before the scheme while the aos decreased by 41 and aoe increased by 169 after the scheme especially in the western channel the aos decreased by 24 and aoe increased by 202 after the scheme showing that the more areas near dasha estuary experienced erosion after the scheme the volume of siltation vos and volume of erosion voe in shenzhen bay before and after the ais are shown in table 3 after the ais the vos decreased from 37 64 105 m3 to 37 16 105 m3 and the voe decreased from 7 55 105 m3 to 7 30 105 m3 respectively in the area outside dasha estuary the vos decreased from 1 64 105 m3 to 1 03 105 m3 a decrease of 37 and the voe increased from 0 12 105 m3 to 0 26 105 m3 an increase of 116 the net volume of sedimentation decreased by 49 in the western channel the vos decreased from 0 94 105 m3 to 0 60 105 m3 and the voe increased from 0 09 105 m3 to 0 26 105 m3 the net volume of siltation decreased by 60 the results showed that the ais reduced deposition volume in the area outside dasha estuary 4 discussions 4 1 the mechanism of siltation estuaries are generally considered as efficient traps for sediment especially estuaries with expanded shapes burchard et al 2018 pye blott 2014 the morphology of the estuary determines the flow distribution thus affecting sediment transport and deposition de swart zimmerman 2008 the shape of the area outside dasha estuary is almost a right triangle which led to a large seaward divergence of the cross section on the other hand this triangular region caused the expansion of shenzhen bay in the middle the expansion of morphology led to relatively low tidal current and caused this region silted up resulting a large area of tidal flat the simulated results showed the directions of current and sediment transport were divergent from middle bay to this area due to the expanded geometry fig 4 at the maximum flood and ebb the average speed and ssc in the area decreased by about 40 of those in middle bay at low tide more than 30 of the triangular region was exposed the sediment transport from middle bay to this area decreased by around 95 as a result the whole area experienced sedimentation with an average thickness of deposition of about 0 05 m a fig 5 it indicated that the geometric expansion of the area outside dasha estuary led to the decrease of current speed and ssc thus resulting in the formation of low ssc zone and continues deposition the estuary can be dredged to deal with siltation to maintain a certain water depth however the weak current related to divergent morphology will lead to new sedimentation in the estuary which means simple dredging is unsustainable in sediment control in the oka estuary of spain sediment re worked into the region after dredging operation and caused new siltation in the estuary even worse than the condition before dredging monge ganuzas et al 2013 therefore sustainable sediment management requires an appropriate morphological modification scheme to increase flow and mitigate sedimentation in the estuary intertidal sedimentary delta is a feature of estuarine geomorphology development which is usually formed in natural funnel shaped estuaries pye blott 2014 this kind of delta often appears at the mouth of the river where the cross section expands rapidly and forms a divergent shape the delta usually emerges in the central of the estuary with two tidal channels along both sides de swart zimmerman 2008 fagherazzi overeem 2007 therefore the artificial island we proposed was similar to the nature delta in the central area outside dasha estuary which aimed to increase the current and mitigate the siltation by reducing the divergence of geometry the island was designed as an impermeable and exposed area except in high tide level the island was built in the sedimentation region outside dasha estuary with dredged materials dredged from the two channels along the island the two 800 m wide channels were dredged to 1 2 m below the mean low tide level on one hand it increased the ebb flow velocity by 36 and 93 in the tidal channels to reduce the deposition on the other hand since the width of dasha river was only about 60 m the flood carrying capacity of dasha river could be improved greatly with the increase of water depth in the area outside dasha estuary the southeast boundary section s6 of the island was along the northern shoreline of shenzhen bay after the ais from middle bay to inner bay the shape of shenzhen bay was convergent as a result the siltation was reduced and even became a little erosion in some areas fig 9 4 2 sediment deposition control of the ais the tidal flat outside dasha estuary was the key area of siltation control in shenzhen bay the ais completely changed its bathymetry to an island and two channels the simulated results indicated that the ais could reduce the sedimentation in the area around the island with slight impacts in the other areas of the bay after the ais the landward cst at s3 and s6 decreased 25 and 41 respectively it indicated that the morphological alteration of shenzhen bay after the scheme reduced the sediment transport from middle bay to inner bay and into the area outside dasha estuary fig 8 the simulated result showed that the ais effectively mitigated the sedimentation in the area around the island in the area outside dasha estuary after the scheme the aos decreased by 41 and aoe increased by 169 the vos decreased by 37 the voe increased by 116 and the net volume of sedimentation decreased by 49 especially in the western channel the net volume of siltation decreased by 60 in particular some areas around the island appeared to be erosional after the scheme in which it experienced deposition without the scheme the aos of the western channel decreased by 24 and the aoe increased by 202 therefore more areas in the western channel could keep depth after the ais and it would improve the flood carrying capacity of dasha estuary although the northern channel still experienced the deposition dredging the channel was much easier than dredging the whole tidal flat therefore the ais could effectively increase the tidal current and reduce the deposition in the area around the island and make the morphology of the area more stable and easier to manage so as to make the whole shenzhen bay sustainable development 4 3 ecological compensation although the ais fundamentally changed the state of tidal flat from deposition to erosion the ecological impact of the scheme should be considered in shenzhen bay human activities such as dredging reclamation and urbanization caused the loss of estuarine wetland and ecological degradation wolanski richmond 2008 the artificial island was proposed to be designed as an uninhabited wetland as ecological compensation to provide more diverse habitats for estuarine species especially a large number of migratory birds the use of dredged materials for habitat construction or restoration as effective compensation for habitat loss has been widely implemented worldwide gabler et al 2017 in the chesapeake bay poplar island has recovered from 1 6 ha to more than 460 ha since 1998 which attracted numerous birds fishes terrapins and other species to return to this region fleri et al 2019 kelly et al 2017 hopefully the artificial island was expected to be a nature reserve providing habitat for estuarine species such as birds fishes benthos as well as a protected region for mangroves and other estuarine plants to improve the biodiversity and ecological value of the system which in turn could promote the sustainable health of shenzhen bay there is a large area of tidal flat in inner shenzhen bay some of which are covered with mangrove posing significant ecological and environmental value compared with the hong kong side the habitat area for estuarine species on the shenzhen side especially for numerous migratory birds is relatively small in addition the habitat on the shenzhen side is adjacent to communities and commercial areas which seriously interfere with the birds in the habitat making the habitat unfavorable to the settlement of birds the roosting scare distance for black faced spoonbills at the prime habitat sites has been documented to be as much as 700 m save international u o c berkeley 2014 therefore there were two 800 m wide channels between the coastline and the artificial island the distance of 800 m was far enough to keep the birds on the artificial island away from human disturbance in the future the two channels were expected to protect birds well from potential human disturbances thus making the island more adaptive for bird habitat the dredged sediment from the two channels was used to construct the artificial island so it would save lots of costs of sediment transportation treatment and disposal in addition the use of nearby sediments instead of other ecosystem materials to build an island could mitigate ecosystem changes which was better for local ecological recovery in eastern scheldt of the netherlands the species richness of macrobenthos in the area restored by nearby dredged materials was basically recovered soon van der werf et al 2015 the island was proposed to be designed to have multiple ecological functions rather than a simple tidal flat which could provide a better habitat for estuarine species referring to the layout of poplar island fleri et al 2019 the artificial island could be designed as several units with tidal flat upland marsh and mangrove aiming to provide different places for more ecological functions such as foraging nesting and breeding more species and improve biodiversity fig 10 this was expected to provide a higher quality habitat for migratory birds and might attract more species and numbers of migratory birds to choose this island as a stopover site through migration vegetation on the island could improve the habitat quality of estuarine species and at the same time it could reduce island erosion and improve nearshore water quality by removing contaminants from the water zedler kercher 2005 in the texas coast plovers nesting on artificial islands were more successful than those nesting on natural islands catlin et al 2011 through professional design the artificial island was expected to provide a more attractive habitat than natural wetlands the ais was expected to be a good attempt of estuarine sediment management the idea could be applied to other estuaries with similar conditions to promote the sustainable governance of estuaries however it is impossible to achieve sustainability or address all the challenges and stresses of the estuarine environment with a one shot management scheme since the system is constantly changing sustainable management of estuaries requires long term and adaptive strategies including continuous monitoring comprehensive information collection timely assessment and adjustment the ecological effects of island habitat constructed by estuarine dredged materials need to be evaluated through long term experiments and researches it is also necessary to investigate the impacts of sea level rise wang et al 2018 and storm surge wang et al 2020b on the ais 5 conclusions the sustainable management of estuaries requires the restoration and maintenance of the health of estuarine ecological environment in estuarine processes morphodynamics is the most fundamental factor that can influence hydrodynamics sediment and contaminant transport thus affecting sedimentation water quality and biodiversity at the same time estuarine morphology is greatly affected by human activities morphodynamics should be considered in the operation and engineering application of sustainable management in this study the ais was proposed in shenzhen bay to improve the sustainability of the estuary through sedimentation control and ecological compensation for local species the simulated results showed that the ais could increase the tidal current and reduce sedimentation in the area outside dasha estuary and inner bay through the morphology modifications in the area outside dasha estuary after the scheme the aos decreased by 41 and aoe increased by 169 the vos decreased by 37 the voe increased by 116 and the net volume of sedimentation decreased by 49 it showed that the erosion area increased and the deposition volume decreased on the other hand the artificial island was designed as an ecological one which was expected to be a habitat for birds and other species to improve the ecological value of shenzhen bay the concept of governance measures based on the principle of estuarine sedimentation was also applicable to other estuaries with similar conditions to promote the sustainable management of estuaries credit

2562,morphodynamics is essential to the sustainable development of estuaries and plays an importance role in sediment movement material and energy exchange and ecosystem health the divergent morphology of estuary commonly traps sediment and causes sediment deposition which threats flood control navigation and ecological environment and finally leads to the unsustainability of estuarine development shenzhen bay china is highly anthropogenic influenced waters between shenzhen and hong kong two densely populated and highly urbanized cities due to an expansion in the middle of the bay shenzhen bay has been experiencing persistent siltation in order to keep the sustainability of the bay an artificial island scheme ais was proposed on the tidal flat of the expansion area which aimed to fundamentally control or reduce sedimentation by changing the morphology of the bay and at the same time made ecological compensation for habitat loss the hydrodynamic and sediment transport models were applied to evaluate the impact of the ais on tidal current sediment control and siltation the numerical results indicated that the proposed ais increased the tidal current around the island thus reducing the sediment transport into the inner bay and effectively mitigating the sedimentation in the siltation areas on the other hand the island was proposed to be designed as an appropriate ecological site to provide multiple functions such as foraging nesting and breeding of estuarine species especially important migratory birds to improve health and sustainable development this idea of estuary governance is also applicable to other estuaries with similar conditions to promote the sustainable management of estuaries keywords estuarine sustainability morphodynamics sediment deposition and control artificial island scheme shenzhen bay data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction estuarine region is an important area of economy society and environment which supports diverse civilizations and ecosystems with abundant resources and convenient transportation branch 1999 chee et al 2017 vousdoukas et al 2020 it provides essential nutrients and habitats to various species constructing one of the most productive ecosystems with high biodiversity on the earth canuel hardison 2016 du et al 2018 in addition about 70 of the world s largest cities are situated near estuaries leuven et al 2019 based on the potentials estuaries offered people have developed navigation fishery mining reclamation and so on to support their social and economic needs ranasinghe et al 2013 thus human development requires a healthy estuary now and in the future however frequent human activities have brought the estuarine health into a state of great danger branch 1999 so far sediment deposition flooding eutrophication and ecological degradation are the major challenges that estuaries all over the world are experiencing de araujo barbosa et al 2016 vellinga et al 2014 sustainable management of estuaries to recover and maintain the estuarine health and sustainability is urgently needed for the development of both human and ecosystem among the aforementioned challenges faced by estuaries siltation is a common problem in estuaries all over the world azhikodan yokoyama 2019 horikawa 1981 it not only threatens navigation safety and flooding control but also aggravates other related estuarine problems such as water quality deterioration and ecological degradation against the sustainable development of estuaries antunes do carmo 2019 hanley et al 2014 dredging is a common method to reduce sediment deposition bianchini et al 2019 jeuken wang 2010 which is a routine process to maintain the necessary water depth to ensure the safety of navigation in global estuaries such as the seine estuary carpentier et al 2002 the mersey estuary brown et al 2015 and the delaware estuary carr et al 2018 however it must be acknowledged that the large scale dredging project has brought some negative effects on the estuarine environment and the treatment and dumping of a large amount of dredged sediments has also become another major problem gross 1978 manap voulvoulis 2015 in addition sediment may re enter the dredging area resulting in new and even more serious sediment deposition in the estuary monge ganuzas et al 2013 townend whitehead 2003 this re siltation will increase the frequency of dredging indicating the unsustainability of simple dredging operations van maren et al 2015 therefore it is urgent to implement comprehensive management strategies to control sediment deposition based on sediment deposition mechanism such as changing estuarine morphology and hydrodynamic conditions in order to achieve environmental societal and economic sustainability in estuarine areas bianchini et al 2019 estuaries are commonly considered as effective sediment trapping with the consequence of sedimentation due to the divergent morphology burchard et al 2018 gross 1978 therefore modification of estuarine morphology and improvement of hydrodynamic conditions are two essential aspects of the sustainable siltation control in estuaries in the yangtze river estuary of china the modification of the morphology by training walls led to stronger flow at the subaqueous delta and resulting in erosion in this area luan et al 2018 in the developing alluvial system it is expected that islands will be generated in the widest reach to improve the flow by reducing the channel width with the sedimentary balance of the system leli stevaux 2021 midchannel island greatly affected the flow structure around the island thus dominate the channel morphology heidari et al 2021 channel morphology after the restored poplar island influenced flood ebb dominance in marshes in the chesapeake bay fleri et al 2019 a well designed artificial island based on morphodynamics can promote the sustainable development of the alluvial system sadek 2013 proposed different alternatives for island development to mitigate the sedimentation and maintain channel stability in the nile river shenzhen bay china is transboundary waters between shenzhen and hong kong two densely populated and highly urbanized cities this region experienced rapid population growth and fast economic development in the past 50 years in 2019 more than 390 billion dollars annual gross domestic product of shenzhen and over 10 million populations there were intimately related to shenzhen bay shenzhen government 2020 meanwhile the bay is of great ecological value with a large area of mangroves and the winter habitat for numerous east asian migratory birds feng et al 2020 firth et al 2014 however with the increasing growth of economy and population shenzhen bay has resulted in a series of environmental issues such as eutrophication zhou et al 2020 flow attenuation lei et al 2022 wang et al 2020a and sediment deposition zhang mao 2015 due to anthropogenic activities such as increasing effluent discharge aquaculture reclamation etc these issues have aroused great concerns of the governments of both shenzhen and hong kong the core issue is whether the bay could maintain sustainable development notably continuous siltation has occurred in shenzhen bay in a long period due to divergent morphology which reduced the flood carrying capacity and was one of the most challenging issues to the estuarine environment and sustainability especially in the area near dasha estuary the shape of the estuary formed as a right angled triangle after more than 10 km2 area reclaimed from the bay thus the cross sections from dasha river to the bay showed a sudden amplification a large area of tidal flat was formed in this triangular region with around 33 area exposed at low tide this serious siltation with unpleasant odour in the area near dasha estuary is one of the most urgent issues that need to be managed in the sustainable development of shenzhen bay dredging alone cannot fundamentally solve the problem of continuous sediment deposition which will cost a lot and damage the estuarine ecosystem a sustainable development scheme that expects to control or reduce the continuous sedimentation with the concerns of ecological environment is urgent to be proposed in shenzhen bay therefore in this study an artificial island scheme ais was proposed based on the mechanism of sediment deposition the hydrodynamic model and sediment transport model were applied to investigate the effect of the ais on the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shenzhen bay and the effectiveness on controlling sedimentation the feasibility and practicability of the scheme in silt treatment environment improvement and ecological protection were discussed 2 methods 2 1 study area shenzhen bay 22 5 n 114 e is located in the eastern pearl river estuary south china fig 1 which is the cross border waters between shenzhen and hong kong it is a semi enclosed bay with an area of about 85 km2 the tide in the bay is irregular semi diurnal tide with an average range of 1 5 m the fresh water entering the bay is mainly from shenzhen river dasha river xiaosha river and yuen long river shenzhen river contributes about 74 6 of fresh water with an average annual discharge of 5 3 108 m3 zhou et al 2020 seven cross sections s0 s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 were set to investigate the effects on the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shenzhen bay fig 1 for ease of description the area from the section s0 to s1 is called outer bay from s1 to s3 called middle bay and from s3 to s5 called inner bay and the triangular region from dasha river mouth to s6 is called the area outside dasha estuary from inner bay to outer bay the average water depth gradually deepens from 1 0 m to about 7 0 m with a deep channel in the central fig 1 the average water depth in the triangular area outside dasha estuary is less than 1 0 m in recent decades the rapid development of urbanization on both sides of the bay has affected the coastal environment resulted in eutrophication wang et al 2016 and accelerated sediment deposition zhang mao 2015 in shenzhen bay especially since the 1990s the land reclamation in the north has shaped the bay in expansion in the middle with a right triangle area outside dasha estuary fig 1 therefore the area of the bay decreased and the hydrodynamic conditions changed which aggravated the sediment deposition in the tidal flat especially the northern part from shenzhen river to dasha river fig 1 the average rate of sediment deposition above 0 m contour reached 2 5 cm a wu et al 2015 the measured seabed change in shenzhen bay from 2010 to 2014 showed that 78 4 of the area was silted fig 2 the total volume of siltation was 1 1 107 m3 with an average siltation thickness of 0 031 m a in the northern outer bay the seabed was significantly deepened due to dredging in the triangular area outside dasha estuary the average siltation thickness was 0 05 m a and continuous siltation led to large areas exposed at low tide the area of tidal flat in inner bay was more than 7 km2 as a result it greatly reduced the flood carrying capacity of the estuary and increased the flood risk therefore the siltation treatment was an urgent problem to the sustainable development of shenzhen bay shenzhen bay is located in the subtropical monsoon region with an average annual rainfall of 1750 mm and an average annual air temperature of 23 c mai po nature reserve fig 1 is located in the south of inner bay with a total area of about 15 km2 and it is in the list of wetland of international importance under the ramsar convention together with inner deep bay jia et al 2014 liang et al 1999 futian mangrove reserve one of china s national nature reserves is located along the northern inner bay with an area of about 3 68 km2 fig 1 the suitable climate abundant food in the tidal flats and the habitat provided by mangroves and wetlands make shenzhen bay an important migratory stopover site for migratory birds in the east asian australasian flyway more than 100 thousand migratory birds with approximate 180 species including black faced spoonbills came to shenzhen bay for wintering every year wei et al 2017 yang chui 2018 therefore the sustainable management of shenzhen bay needs to take its important ecological functions into account 2 2 artificial island scheme based on the geomorphology and mechanism of sediment deposition a triangular artificial island with an area of about 2 2 km2 was proposed to be built on the tidal flat outside dasha estuary as shown in fig 1 the size and location of the artificial island were designed according to 1 the southeast boundary of the artificial island was along the northern shoreline of shenzhen bay the western and northern boundaries of the island were parallel to the shoreline 2 the western and northern channels between the island and the shoreline with a breadth of 800 m were dredged to 1 2 m below the mean low tide level 3 the breadth of the channels must be greater than the roosting scare distance 700 m for black faced spoonbills save international u o c berkeley 2014 4 the dredged volume was about 4 8 105 m3 all of which could be used to build the island the ais aimed to reduce sediment trapping in estuary and provided habitat for estuarine creatures as ecological compensation on the other hand it was expected to improve the flood carrying capacity for dasha river with minimal ecological damage 2 3 numerical modelling and verification numerical models are commonly used to evaluate hydrodynamic effect and sediment transport fleri et al 2019 guan et al 2018 zhang mao 2015 in this study the 2 d depth averaged model of delft3d deltares 2014 was applied to investigate the changes of flow field and sediment transport and evaluate the effect of the ais in shenzhen bay the pearl river estuary shenzhen bay and shenzhen river were included in the model to reduce the boundary influence fig 1 the structure gird was constructed using curvilinear orthogonal coordinates with a resolution of about 60 m 80 m to 380 m 390 m in shenzhen bay the boundary conditions of the open boundaries op1 op2 and op3 were given by the observed hourly tide level from hong kong observatory hko the daily observed river fluxes at the boundary op4 were given from the observation of water affairs bureau of shenzhen municipality of china wabsm the average river flow of shenzhen river in wet season apr sep was around 30 m3 s while the average river flow in dry season oct mar was around 10 m3 s river flow of dasha river was around 4 m3 s suspended sediment transport was calculated by solving the advection diffusion equation the suspended sediment in the bay is mostly cohesive fines silt and clay with coarser particles occasionally found near the mouth and top of the bay the empirical partheniades formula for cohesive materials was adopted to calculate the equilibrium sediment transport rate the erosional parameters and shear stress were set to match the measured data two kinds of sediments were selected with a settling velocity of 0 30 mm s and 0 03 mm s detailed model description of the delft3d can be found in the delft3d manual deltares 2014 the model was verified using the field data of synchronous surveys in 2012 the hourly tide data observed at two tide gauge stations tsim bei tsui tbt and chek lap kok clk were obtained from hko the verification period included rainy season from 14 july 2012 to 29 july 2012 and dry season from 12 oct 2012 to 27 oct 2012 the current velocity and suspended sediment concentration ssc measured in spring tide from 18 oct 2012 11 00 to 19 oct 2012 11 00 and neap tide from 25 oct 2012 06 00 to 26 oct 2012 06 00 at st and sm stations were obtained from wabsm the bathymetry in the study was also provided by wabsm all the observation stations are shown in fig 1 the index of agreement d willmott 1981 was used to estimate model performance 1 d 1 s m 2 s m m m 2 where s is the simulated data m is the measured data and m is the mean value of measured data the closer the d value is to 1 the higher the agreement between the measured and simulated data is the simulated results were compared with the measured data as shown in fig 3 the fluctuation trend and magnitude of water level velocity and ssc calculated by the model were consistent with the observations the root mean square errors rmses between the simulated results and the measured ones are shown in table 1 the d values for water level at tbt and clk were 0 96 and 0 93 respectively the rmses were 0 17 m and 0 15 m at tbt and clk respectively the d values for velocity at st and sm were 0 89 and 0 90 the average rmses of velocity were 0 16 m s and 0 10 m s at st and sm respectively the d values for ssc at st and sm were 0 80 and 0 76 respectively the average rmses of ssc were 0 04 kg m3 and 0 01 kg m3 at st and sm respectively at st the model results including speed and ssc were slightly underestimated at neap tide which might be affected by the accuracy of local bathymetry and the upstream daily flow totally the verification results showed that the model was reliable and supported that the model was dependable for subsequent applications after the model was verified the flow field and ssc in shenzhen bay were simulated for the entire year of 2012 and we focused on the bathymetry changes in the bay due to the deposition and erosion of sediment after the implementation of the ais the deposition or erosion was estimated through sediment volume change calculations using the model 3 results 3 1 current and sediment transport in shenzhen bay the distribution of depth averaged velocity and ssc in shenzhen bay is shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of velocity and ssc was affected by the morphology of the bay compared with the reach between s0 and s1 the speed and ssc at the maximum ebb and flood were a little larger due to the narrower cross section between s1 to s2 while the speed and ssc were a little smaller due to the wider cross section between s2 and s4 from s4 to upstream the speed and ssc increased greatly with the decrease of cross section area in the area outside dasha estuary it presented low speed and low ssc at the maximum ebb and flood because of its shallow water depth from middle bay to this area the speed and ssc decreased greatly the average speed and ssc in middle bay at the maximum flood ebb were 0 40 0 38 m s and 0 041 0 055 kg m3 respectively while in this area they were 0 17 0 14 m s and 0 021 0 017 kg m3 respectively compared with middle bay the speed and ssc decreased by about 60 and a low ssc zone was formed in the area outside dasha estuary the formation of this low ssc zone was related to the expanded geometry of the area outside dasha estuary and led to continuous siltation in this region during flood tide the velocity fig 4a and sediment transport fig 4c showed divergent distribution from s2 to s3 and then convergent distribution from s3 to s4 just the opposite during ebb tide the velocity fig 4b and sediment transport fig 4d showed divergent distribution from s4 to s3 and then convergent distribution from s3 to s2 in the area outside dasha estuary the velocity and sediment transport decreased significantly the average sediment transport at the maximum flood and ebb was around 0 02 10 4 m3 m s and 0 01 10 4 m3 m s respectively which decreased by 95 compared with those of middle bay it indicated that the suspended sediments transported into the area might settle in this region and forming continuous siltation the distribution of simulated annual seabed change of shenzhen bay is shown in fig 5 about 71 of the bay was silted with an annual siltation volume of about 3 01 106 m3 the deposition mainly happened in inner bay south of middle bay outer bay and the area outside dasha estuary while the erosion occurred in the deep channel of the bay in the area outside dasha estuary it experienced siltation with an average sediment thickness of about 0 05 m the erosion and deposition were well correlated to the measured data fig 2 combined with the results of sediment transport in the bay the sediment might mainly come from the erosion of middle bay and be transported to inner bay and the area outside dasha estuary due to the divergent geometry the velocity decreased and suspended sediments deposited in this area with a formation of the low ssc zone therefore the shape expansion of the area outside dasha estuary caused the continuous deposition in this region the ais we proposed aimed to reduce this expansion and might mitigate the siltation in the area 3 2 effect on hydrodynamics and sediment transport after the ais the construction of artificial island changed the morphology of shenzhen bay thus changing the flow field and sediment transport of the bay as shown in fig 6 the tidal current around the island greatly increased at the maximum flood after the ais the average speed in the northern channel increased from 0 18 m s to 0 20 m s an increase of 11 in the western channel the average speed increased from 0 17 m s to 0 28 m s an increase of 65 the average speed increased slightly from 0 31 m s to 0 32 m s in inner bay but decreased slightly in middle bay from 0 40 m s to 0 38 m s and outer bay from 0 37 m s to 0 36 m s similarly at the maximum ebb the average speed in the northern channel increased from 0 14 m s to 0 19 m s an increase of 36 in the western channel the speed increased from 0 15 m s to 0 29 m s an increase of 93 the average speed didn t change in inner bay 0 26 m s but decreased slightly in middle bay from 0 38 m s to 0 36 m s and outer bay from 0 37 m s to 0 36 m s it indicated that after the ais the current increased greatly in the area outside dasha estuary while it changed slightly in other area of the bay in the areas outside dasha estuary there was a large area of tidal flats which was exposed at low tide level and the current was small at high tide level due to shallow water depth the construction of the artificial island greatly altered the local morphology as a result the tidal current in the two channels around the island increased significantly which would help to mitigate sedimentation in this area the distribution of ssc difference without and with the ais in shenzhen bay is shown in fig 7 after the ais the average ssc in the area outside dasha estuary either at the maximum flood or ebb increased by 0 004 0 005 kg m3 more than 20 while the average sscs decreased by about 0 003 kg m3 in middle bay less than 7 it indicated that the ais increased the ssc in the area around artificial island while there was a little influence in other area of the bay the average ssc increased greatly 0 01 kg m3 in the western channel but changed a little 0 004 kg m3 in the northern channel after the ais the distribution of depth averaged sediment transport and 15 day cumulative sediment transport cst at cross sections without and with the ais is shown in fig 8 sediment transport was driven by hydrodynamics so sediment transport and velocity distribution were similar at the maximum flood the distribution of sediment transport was similar except the two channels around the island without and with the ais the average sediment transport of outer bay middle bay and inner bay was 0 52 10 4 m3 m s 0 31 10 4 m3 m s and 0 11 10 4 m3 m s without the ais respectively and they decreased a little by 5 13 and 2 in the corresponding reaches with the ais and the directions of transport were landward almost the same fig 8a at the maximum ebb the average sediment transport of outer bay middle bay and inner bay was 0 41 10 4 m3 m s 0 26 10 4 m3 m s and 0 05 10 4 m3 m s without the ais respectively they decreased by 8 and 11 in outer bay and middle bay and increased by 1 in inner bay after the ais and the directions of transport were seaward almost the same fig 8b however in the area outside dasha estuary the sediment transport increased significantly after the ais at the maximum flood ebb the average sediment transport increased from 0 01 10 4 0 01 10 4 m3 m s to 0 03 10 4 0 06 10 4 m3 m s in the northern channel and increased from 0 03 10 4 0 01 10 4 m3 m s to 0 15 10 4 0 06 10 4 m3 m s in the western channel the direction of transport completely changed and they were all along the channel after the ais the 15 day cst at different cross sections in wet season fig 8c was similar to that in dry season fig 8d the 15 day cst at s0 to s4 and s6 was landward while it was seaward at s5 indicating that the sediment in shenzhen bay was transported from pearl river estuary and shenzhen river the average cst at s0 was around 2 9 104 m3 m s and decreased to 0 21 104 m3 m s at s1 and then increased to 0 32 104 m3 m s at s2 it showed that most of the sediment deposited in outer bay and the increase of cst from s1 to s2 might be due to sediment resuspension from s2 to s4 the cst gradually decreased to 0 14 104 m3 m s and 0 13 104 m3 m s the cst from shenzhen river to the bay through s5 was only 0 06 104 m3 m s at s6 the cst was landward with a total of 0 18 104 m3 m s indicating that the sediment was transported to the area outside dasha estuary and deposited there after the ais the cst decreased by 0 12 3 25 and 9 at s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 respectively but the directions were almost the same however the cst decreased by 41 at s6 therefore after the ais less sediment was transported to inner bay and the area outside dasha estuary which would mitigate the sedimentation in these areas 3 3 effect on deposition and erosion the distribution of erosion and deposition in shenzhen bay after the ais is shown in fig 9 the change mainly occurred in the areas around island especially in the western channel in the northern channel the sedimentation was similar to that without the scheme with an average thickness of about 0 04 m however in the western channel the seabed changed from sedimentation with a depth of 0 02 0 08 m to erosion with a depth of 0 02 0 08 m and in the area between s2 and s4 outside the island the seabed changed from sedimentation with a depth of 0 02 m to erosion with a depth of 0 02 m the area of siltation and erosion is shown in table 2 before the ais the area of siltation aos and area of erosion aoe in shenzhen bay were about 64 155 106 m2 and 21 442 106 m2 respectively after the scheme the aos and aoe were about 61 659 106 m2 and 21 809 106 m2 in the area outside dasha estuary the aos and aoe were about 6 267 106 m2 and 0 266 106 m2 before the scheme while the aos decreased by 41 and aoe increased by 169 after the scheme especially in the western channel the aos decreased by 24 and aoe increased by 202 after the scheme showing that the more areas near dasha estuary experienced erosion after the scheme the volume of siltation vos and volume of erosion voe in shenzhen bay before and after the ais are shown in table 3 after the ais the vos decreased from 37 64 105 m3 to 37 16 105 m3 and the voe decreased from 7 55 105 m3 to 7 30 105 m3 respectively in the area outside dasha estuary the vos decreased from 1 64 105 m3 to 1 03 105 m3 a decrease of 37 and the voe increased from 0 12 105 m3 to 0 26 105 m3 an increase of 116 the net volume of sedimentation decreased by 49 in the western channel the vos decreased from 0 94 105 m3 to 0 60 105 m3 and the voe increased from 0 09 105 m3 to 0 26 105 m3 the net volume of siltation decreased by 60 the results showed that the ais reduced deposition volume in the area outside dasha estuary 4 discussions 4 1 the mechanism of siltation estuaries are generally considered as efficient traps for sediment especially estuaries with expanded shapes burchard et al 2018 pye blott 2014 the morphology of the estuary determines the flow distribution thus affecting sediment transport and deposition de swart zimmerman 2008 the shape of the area outside dasha estuary is almost a right triangle which led to a large seaward divergence of the cross section on the other hand this triangular region caused the expansion of shenzhen bay in the middle the expansion of morphology led to relatively low tidal current and caused this region silted up resulting a large area of tidal flat the simulated results showed the directions of current and sediment transport were divergent from middle bay to this area due to the expanded geometry fig 4 at the maximum flood and ebb the average speed and ssc in the area decreased by about 40 of those in middle bay at low tide more than 30 of the triangular region was exposed the sediment transport from middle bay to this area decreased by around 95 as a result the whole area experienced sedimentation with an average thickness of deposition of about 0 05 m a fig 5 it indicated that the geometric expansion of the area outside dasha estuary led to the decrease of current speed and ssc thus resulting in the formation of low ssc zone and continues deposition the estuary can be dredged to deal with siltation to maintain a certain water depth however the weak current related to divergent morphology will lead to new sedimentation in the estuary which means simple dredging is unsustainable in sediment control in the oka estuary of spain sediment re worked into the region after dredging operation and caused new siltation in the estuary even worse than the condition before dredging monge ganuzas et al 2013 therefore sustainable sediment management requires an appropriate morphological modification scheme to increase flow and mitigate sedimentation in the estuary intertidal sedimentary delta is a feature of estuarine geomorphology development which is usually formed in natural funnel shaped estuaries pye blott 2014 this kind of delta often appears at the mouth of the river where the cross section expands rapidly and forms a divergent shape the delta usually emerges in the central of the estuary with two tidal channels along both sides de swart zimmerman 2008 fagherazzi overeem 2007 therefore the artificial island we proposed was similar to the nature delta in the central area outside dasha estuary which aimed to increase the current and mitigate the siltation by reducing the divergence of geometry the island was designed as an impermeable and exposed area except in high tide level the island was built in the sedimentation region outside dasha estuary with dredged materials dredged from the two channels along the island the two 800 m wide channels were dredged to 1 2 m below the mean low tide level on one hand it increased the ebb flow velocity by 36 and 93 in the tidal channels to reduce the deposition on the other hand since the width of dasha river was only about 60 m the flood carrying capacity of dasha river could be improved greatly with the increase of water depth in the area outside dasha estuary the southeast boundary section s6 of the island was along the northern shoreline of shenzhen bay after the ais from middle bay to inner bay the shape of shenzhen bay was convergent as a result the siltation was reduced and even became a little erosion in some areas fig 9 4 2 sediment deposition control of the ais the tidal flat outside dasha estuary was the key area of siltation control in shenzhen bay the ais completely changed its bathymetry to an island and two channels the simulated results indicated that the ais could reduce the sedimentation in the area around the island with slight impacts in the other areas of the bay after the ais the landward cst at s3 and s6 decreased 25 and 41 respectively it indicated that the morphological alteration of shenzhen bay after the scheme reduced the sediment transport from middle bay to inner bay and into the area outside dasha estuary fig 8 the simulated result showed that the ais effectively mitigated the sedimentation in the area around the island in the area outside dasha estuary after the scheme the aos decreased by 41 and aoe increased by 169 the vos decreased by 37 the voe increased by 116 and the net volume of sedimentation decreased by 49 especially in the western channel the net volume of siltation decreased by 60 in particular some areas around the island appeared to be erosional after the scheme in which it experienced deposition without the scheme the aos of the western channel decreased by 24 and the aoe increased by 202 therefore more areas in the western channel could keep depth after the ais and it would improve the flood carrying capacity of dasha estuary although the northern channel still experienced the deposition dredging the channel was much easier than dredging the whole tidal flat therefore the ais could effectively increase the tidal current and reduce the deposition in the area around the island and make the morphology of the area more stable and easier to manage so as to make the whole shenzhen bay sustainable development 4 3 ecological compensation although the ais fundamentally changed the state of tidal flat from deposition to erosion the ecological impact of the scheme should be considered in shenzhen bay human activities such as dredging reclamation and urbanization caused the loss of estuarine wetland and ecological degradation wolanski richmond 2008 the artificial island was proposed to be designed as an uninhabited wetland as ecological compensation to provide more diverse habitats for estuarine species especially a large number of migratory birds the use of dredged materials for habitat construction or restoration as effective compensation for habitat loss has been widely implemented worldwide gabler et al 2017 in the chesapeake bay poplar island has recovered from 1 6 ha to more than 460 ha since 1998 which attracted numerous birds fishes terrapins and other species to return to this region fleri et al 2019 kelly et al 2017 hopefully the artificial island was expected to be a nature reserve providing habitat for estuarine species such as birds fishes benthos as well as a protected region for mangroves and other estuarine plants to improve the biodiversity and ecological value of the system which in turn could promote the sustainable health of shenzhen bay there is a large area of tidal flat in inner shenzhen bay some of which are covered with mangrove posing significant ecological and environmental value compared with the hong kong side the habitat area for estuarine species on the shenzhen side especially for numerous migratory birds is relatively small in addition the habitat on the shenzhen side is adjacent to communities and commercial areas which seriously interfere with the birds in the habitat making the habitat unfavorable to the settlement of birds the roosting scare distance for black faced spoonbills at the prime habitat sites has been documented to be as much as 700 m save international u o c berkeley 2014 therefore there were two 800 m wide channels between the coastline and the artificial island the distance of 800 m was far enough to keep the birds on the artificial island away from human disturbance in the future the two channels were expected to protect birds well from potential human disturbances thus making the island more adaptive for bird habitat the dredged sediment from the two channels was used to construct the artificial island so it would save lots of costs of sediment transportation treatment and disposal in addition the use of nearby sediments instead of other ecosystem materials to build an island could mitigate ecosystem changes which was better for local ecological recovery in eastern scheldt of the netherlands the species richness of macrobenthos in the area restored by nearby dredged materials was basically recovered soon van der werf et al 2015 the island was proposed to be designed to have multiple ecological functions rather than a simple tidal flat which could provide a better habitat for estuarine species referring to the layout of poplar island fleri et al 2019 the artificial island could be designed as several units with tidal flat upland marsh and mangrove aiming to provide different places for more ecological functions such as foraging nesting and breeding more species and improve biodiversity fig 10 this was expected to provide a higher quality habitat for migratory birds and might attract more species and numbers of migratory birds to choose this island as a stopover site through migration vegetation on the island could improve the habitat quality of estuarine species and at the same time it could reduce island erosion and improve nearshore water quality by removing contaminants from the water zedler kercher 2005 in the texas coast plovers nesting on artificial islands were more successful than those nesting on natural islands catlin et al 2011 through professional design the artificial island was expected to provide a more attractive habitat than natural wetlands the ais was expected to be a good attempt of estuarine sediment management the idea could be applied to other estuaries with similar conditions to promote the sustainable governance of estuaries however it is impossible to achieve sustainability or address all the challenges and stresses of the estuarine environment with a one shot management scheme since the system is constantly changing sustainable management of estuaries requires long term and adaptive strategies including continuous monitoring comprehensive information collection timely assessment and adjustment the ecological effects of island habitat constructed by estuarine dredged materials need to be evaluated through long term experiments and researches it is also necessary to investigate the impacts of sea level rise wang et al 2018 and storm surge wang et al 2020b on the ais 5 conclusions the sustainable management of estuaries requires the restoration and maintenance of the health of estuarine ecological environment in estuarine processes morphodynamics is the most fundamental factor that can influence hydrodynamics sediment and contaminant transport thus affecting sedimentation water quality and biodiversity at the same time estuarine morphology is greatly affected by human activities morphodynamics should be considered in the operation and engineering application of sustainable management in this study the ais was proposed in shenzhen bay to improve the sustainability of the estuary through sedimentation control and ecological compensation for local species the simulated results showed that the ais could increase the tidal current and reduce sedimentation in the area outside dasha estuary and inner bay through the morphology modifications in the area outside dasha estuary after the scheme the aos decreased by 41 and aoe increased by 169 the vos decreased by 37 the voe increased by 116 and the net volume of sedimentation decreased by 49 it showed that the erosion area increased and the deposition volume decreased on the other hand the artificial island was designed as an ecological one which was expected to be a habitat for birds and other species to improve the ecological value of shenzhen bay the concept of governance measures based on the principle of estuarine sedimentation was also applicable to other estuaries with similar conditions to promote the sustainable management of estuaries credit

2563,severe soil desiccation in mature forests has been discovered in many water stressed regions around the world threatening sustainable forest development only by understanding fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns of different forest stands can we timely deal with the severe water stress in tree growth during the 2019 growing season we repeated isotopic and soil water content sampling for four populus tomentosa stands in the north china plain two young stands with lower or higher competition structure and two mature stands with lower or higher competition structure and fine root sampling was performed at the end of the growing season the hydrogen oxygen stable isotope method and the bayesian mixture model were used to determine root water uptake patterns the findings revealed that stand age had no effect on fine root distributions in the 0 2 m profile however p tomentosa became more reliant on the deeper soil water with stand development the stand structure did not affect fine root distributions of young stands but significantly affected that of mature stands regardless of developmental stage the higher competition structure would increase trees relative water uptake from the middle layers however this increase was at the expense of a decrease in the relative water uptake from shallow layers during the young stage and from deep layers during the mature stage furthermore we discovered that the groundwater level in this area may have dropped to an extent that groundwater cannot provide sufficient water supply for p tomentosa this study clearly shows that fine root distribution patterns cannot be used to replace root water uptake patterns in addition the findings of this article will serve as a theoretical foundation for sustainable forest management in fast growing plantations in other water stressed areas around the world keywords root water uptake fine root soil water stand age stand structure populus tomentosa data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction water uptake is an important function of roots because it not only meets the water needs of plants but also serves as a critical link in the pathway of water flow from the soil through plants to the atmosphere dawson et al 2020 the soil hydrological environment can have a significant impact on root water uptake processes climate projections show that rainfall is becoming more stochastic and unpredictable in many parts of the world as a result of global climate change which will increase uncertainty about soil water availability in terrestrial ecosystems allen and ingram 2002 dore 2005 sillmann et al 2017 as a result there is a pressing need to comprehend the spatial distribution pattern of roots as well as the seasonal dynamics of root water uptake patterns this information will be critical in developing sustainable water resource management strategies as well as in building and refining terrestrial biosphere models to predict biosphere responses to climate change lu et al 2019 warren et al 2015 zaehle et al 2005 the fine root distribution and water uptake patterns of stands can be distinct across developmental stages coleman and aubrey 2018 huo et al 2018 nan et al 2019 yuan and chen 2012 in general as stands grow the root zone gradually expands vertically and deep soil water resources become more readily available for plants to meet their water demands drake et al 2011 feild and dawson 1998 finér et al 2007 geng et al 2022 huo et al 2018 however some contradictory phenomena have been observed for example in tropical rainforest regions of south america tree size had little effect on root water uptake depth stahl et al 2013 whereas in some arid or semi arid regions fine root distribution and water uptake depth would move up to shallow soil when the deep soil layer became severely dry nan et al 2019 tao et al 2021 wang et al 2020 therefore there is still a lot of uncertainty about how stand age affects fine roots and root water uptake furthermore many studies only focused on the root functions within the shallow soil layer resulting in a large knowledge gap in this field deep roots which are generally defined as roots distributed below 1 m soil depth are a feature of many plant species and biomes maeght et al 2013 pierret et al 2016 the functional importance of deep roots is becoming more widely recognized in many forest ecosystems christina et al 2017 christoffersen et al 2014 giambelluca et al 2016 xi et al 2013 yang et al 2017 however as far as we know the fine root distribution and water uptake pattern of trees involving deep soil at different stand ages have been only investigated in very limited regions such as the loess plateau sandy regions of northern china and south western australia drake et al 2011 li et al 2019 nan et al 2019 song et al 2020 wang et al 2021a zhou et al 2019 thus such information remains scarce for many regions and forest ecosystems around the world stand density and tree species composition are two important attributes of stand structure ali 2019 gao et al 2014 which may affect the development and spatial distribution of fine roots and the access of trees to soil water resources cahill et al 2010 schmid et al 2015 schmid et al 2013 however most existing studies have primarily focused on the effects of tree species composition on fine root distribution and water uptake function with inconsistent results benomar et al 2013 finér et al 2017 ma and chen 2016 o keefe et al 2019 tang et al 2018 trogisch et al 2016 in comparison little research has been conducted to investigate the effects of stand density on water uptake patterns in monoculture plantations puri et al 1994 wang et al 2022 the relatively shallow depths of sampling in most studies also limit a thorough understanding of how stand structure affects fine root development and function in deep soil layers finér et al 2007 finér et al 2011 jagodzinski et al 2016 yuan and chen 2012 besides plant plant interactions change with stand development callaway and walker 1997 forrester 2014 wang et al 2021b so the effects of stand structure on fine root distribution and water uptake patterns may differ at different developmental stages unfortunately previous research has rarely addressed these concerns it is well understood that the fine root distribution can potentially determine the pattern of root water uptake cai et al 2018 kühnhammer et al 2020 nippert and knapp 2007 volkmann et al 2016 as a result when parameterizing the root water uptake model many studies used the fine root distribution as the embodiment of the potential water uptake distribution cai et al 2018 kumar et al 2015 montagnoli et al 2019 peng and chen 2021 weemstra et al 2020 however the root water uptake pattern does not necessarily match fine root distribution garrigues et al 2006 hamblin and tennant 1987 this is because root hydraulic architecture soil salinity soil water distribution root anatomy soil texture and transpiration demand can all influence root water uptake javaux et al 2013 kulmatiski and beard 2013 kulmatiski et al 2010 quijano et al 2012 van der ploeg et al 2008 similarly it is reasonable to speculate that the role of stand age and stand structure on the fine root distributions may not be applicable to root water uptake patterns however to the best of our knowledge there have been few attempts to simultaneously investigate the responses of fine root distribution and water uptake pattern to changing stand age and stand structure bello et al 2019 fruleux et al 2020 fruleux et al 2018 guderle et al 2018 jia et al 2012 this will inevitably impede our comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying root water uptake as well as the development and refinement of root water uptake models cai et al 2018 dardanelli et al 2004 kumar et al 2015 the north china plain ncp one of the most densely populated areas in the world kang and eltahir 2018 is facing a severe water crisis caused by overexploitation of water resources reducing precipitation and declining groundwater level kang and eltahir 2018 wang et al 2008 populus tomentosa is one of the most commonly used tree species in the ncp for establishing shelterbelt and timber forests xi 2013 zhang et al 2012 a recent study however revealed that mature poplar forests in this region may be suffering from severe deep soil desiccation which can severely impair tree performance and devastate the water ecological environment liu et al 2022 therefore it is critical to thoroughly assess the fine root development characteristics and water uptake dynamics of poplar plantations in this region which will facilitate the development of sustainable management techniques to cope with the serious water crisis p tomentosa is a tree species with a dimorphic root system which allows it to obtain water resources from both shallow and deep soil layers di et al 2018 quantitative research on the fine root distribution and seasonal water uptake patterns of p tomentosa stands on the other hand is still lacking we asked three scientific questions based on the above knowledge gaps to begin how did stand age and stand structure affect fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns second did the impact of stand structure on fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns change with stand development finally were the effects of stand age structure consistent on fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns in response to these scientific issues we proposed a hypothesis 1 stands would absorb more water in deeper soil layers as stand age or competitive intensity stand structure increased 2 the effects of stand structure on fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns varied with stand development 3 the effects of stand age structure on fine root distributions and water uptake patterns were inconsistent 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and experimental plantation the study was conducted in gaotang county liaocheng city shandong province which is located in the ncp 36 48 n 116 05 e altitude of about 30 m fig s1 this region has a warm temperate monsoon climate with an average air temperature of 13 9 c and an average annual precipitation of 553 mm 1981 2020 the experimental site has a very flat terrain with groundwater levels ranging from 6 to 9 m deep the soil texture at this site is sandy loam in the 0 140 cm layer and alternating silt loam and silt below 140 cm depth the other physical and chemical properties of soil can be found in li et al 2020 and he et al 2021 during the 2019 growing season april october the experiment was carried out in four p tomentosa stands two of these stands were young 3 year old yplc and yphc stands and two were mature 40 year old mplc and mphc stands fig 1 fig s1 both the yplc 6 m 6 m 277 trees ha 1 and yphc stands 3 m 3 m 1111 trees ha 1 were pure plantation forests with different planting densities mplc stand 6 m 6 m 277 trees ha 1 was a pure plantation forest with the same stand density as the yplc stand the mphc stand was a p tomentosa and robinia pseudoacacia mixed plantation forest with a tree planting distance of 3 m 6 m 555 trees ha 1 the information on the tree growth of the four stands was shown in table 1 increased stand density increases competition intensity within stands but mixing different tree species may result in below ground niche differentiation among different trees brassard et al 2011 case et al 2020 rodríguez robles et al 2020 sun et al 2017 reducing intra specific competition silvertown et al 2015 however in species diverse ecosystems resource competition may outweigh potential positive interactions at high stand density forrester 2014 therefore in this study we uniformly defined yplc stand and mplc stand as stands with lower competition structure and yphc stand and mphc stand as stands with higher competition structure according to the characteristics of different stands we investigated the effects of stand age on fine root distribution and root water uptake of p tomentosa using the data of yplc and mplc stands while yplc vs yphc stands and mplc vs mphc stands were used to investigate the effect of stand structure on those of p tomentosa at young and mature stages respectively 2 2 environmental factors measurement meteorological factors including solar radiation photosynthetically active radiation air temperature and relative humidity wind speed and direction and precipitation were measured by a weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk installed at about 2 2 km distance from the experimental stands from april to october 2019 all variables were measured every 10 min the measured meteorological data were used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration according to the penman monteith equation in fao 56 allen et al 1998 the oven drying method was used to measure the dynamics of gravimetric soil water content swc in all stands from april to october 2019 soil samples for swc were collected in the middle of each month at 50 cm in the yplc and yphc stands or 100 cm in the mplc stand distances from three average sized trees in each pure stand however in the mixed stand mphc the sampling point n 3 was 150 cm away from the sample trees between the poplar and locust we used the same soil sampling depths for all stands 0 30 30 50 50 70 70 100 100 150 150 200 200 400 and 400 600 cm finally 576 soil samples for swc measurement were collected 2 3 fine roots sampling at the end of september 2019 fine roots were sampled in four stands using the soil coring diameter of 8 cm method the fine roots were sampled at the same sampling locations as the swc measurements but the sampling depth varied between stands roots were sampled to 200 cm depth with an interval of 10 cm n 4 5 in the yplc and yphc stands because it was initially assumed that rooting depth in young stands would be shallow the sampling depth in the mplc and mphc stands was 600 cm with sampling intervals of 10 cm in the 0 140 cm soil layer and 20 cm below 140 cm depth n 4 fig 1 finally 624 soil samples were collected each soil sample was washed by hand with tap water and a sieve to separate the roots from soil particles and organic matter after washing the roots were immersed in water to manually separate live roots from dead roots which were distinguished by their lighter color and greater elasticity these live roots were then placed in labeled valve bags and frozen until root traits were determined using dissecting needles and forceps the fine root samples were carefully spread out on a transparent plastic sheet without overlapping and abutments these roots were scanned using a high quality scanner epson perfection v800 photo epson japan the length and mean diameter of roots were then determined using the automatic image analysis software winrhizo regent instruments inc quebec canada in this study we only used the data from fine roots with a diameter 2 mm block et al 2006 the fine root length density frld cm cm 3 was calculated as the total fine root length of a soil core sample volume to compare the rooting depths among stands the vertical distribution of cumulative frld throughout the soil profile was modeled using eq 1 to obtain the root extinction coefficient β gale and grigal 1987 a high β value indicates a greater proportion of roots at depth whereas a low β value implies a greater proportion of roots close to the soil surface 1 y 1 β d where y is the proportion of frld cumulated from the soil surface to the depth of d cm 2 4 determination of root water uptake source from april to september 2019 soil and xylem samples were collected monthly for δ2h and δ18o isotope analysis fig 2 before dawn three average sized sample trees from each stand were selected for xylem sampling during each sampling event xylem samples n 3 were collected from 1 year old branches in the middle canopy of each sample tree in young stands yplc and yphc stands and their bark and phloem were removed immediately after sampling however xylem samples n 3 were collected from the trunk at 1 3 m above the ground using a growth cone in mature stands mplc and mphc stands as mature trees were too tall to obtain branches no oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h fractionation occurs during root water uptake and sap transfer within the xylem tissue according to research ehleringer and dawson 1992 zimmermann et al 1968 as a result the differences in xylem sampling locations in mature and young stands should not affect the final determination of the source of root water uptake de deurwaerder et al 2018 all xylem samples for isotope measurement were transferred to glass vials which were then sealed with parafilm paired with xylem sampling soil samples for isotope measurement were collected near the sample trees and placed directly in vials sealed with parafilm soil isotope samples were collected concurrently with swc samples and the sampling locations and depths can be found in the swc sampling description fig 1 groundwater samples were taken from wells near the experimental stands finally 576 soil 90 plant and 36 groundwater samples were collected for isotope ratio analysis all of these samples were returned to the laboratory and kept in a freezer 20 c until the water extraction an automatic vacuum condensation extraction system was used to extract xylem and soil water li 2100 lica china a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia dlt 100 los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa with a δ2h precision of 0 10 and a δ18o precision of 0 20 was used to determine the hydrogen and

standard vienna standard mean ocean water v smow on a per mil basis 2 δ r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where δ is the isotope ratio and r is the molar ratio of heavy to light isotopes because this model takes into account uncertainties associated with discrimination factors and multiple source values a bayesian isotope mixing model r package mixsiar version 3 1 was used to calculate the contribution of each water source to root water uptake rwu stock et al 2018 to be more specific we created a id column one id for each sample tree in the raw data of xylem isotope values δ2h and δ18o to assess the source of water uptake for each sample tree id was treated as a fixed effect second the raw data of isotope values from each water source soil water in the 0 30 30 50 50 70 70 100 100

not occur during the process of root water uptake dawson and ehleringer 1991 the model was run using the normal markov chain monte carlo mcmc run option chain length 100 000 burn in 50 000 thin 50 the

calculation of each water source s contribution the combine sources function in the mixsiar package was used to combine nine water sources into four sources shallow soil layer 0 30 cm middle soil

assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity if a variable s data did not meet these assumptions it was log or square root transformed the effects of stand age structure and measurement date on rwu were investigated using the nlme r package and fitting linear mixed effects models with maximum likelihood in the models stand age structure level and measurement date were used as fixed effects while individual tree was treated as a random effect the corar1 function in the nlme package was included in the models to account for repeated measurements with a first order autoregressive covariate

accounting for 75 of the total growing season value 459 mm fig 2 daily reference evapotranspiration increased gradually over time until june when it peaked and then decreased gradually until the growing season ended the experimental year could be divided into three periods based on the above results spring to mid summer drought period period i mid to late summer wet period period ii and autumn drought period period iii the four stands soil water content showed a similar growing season variation trend fig 3 swc decreased gradually with time in all soil layers during period i but increased dramatically during period ii swc decreased again during period iii but at a slower rate with the exception of the surface 30 cm soil in the yplc yphc and mphc stands fig 3abd throughout the growing season there was a distinct difference in swc among soil layers in the yphc stand fig 3b whereas the swc difference between 0 and 30 and 30 100 cm layers decreased in the yplc stand fig 3a the swc difference among soil layers decreased significantly as the stand became mature the mplc and mphc stands fig 3cd the statistical analysis revealed that the four stands had comparable swc ranging from 5 57 to 7 30 p 0 05 in the surface 30 cm soil table s1 however in soil below 30 cm depth the average swc in the yphc stand was 28 127 higher than that in the other stands p 0 05 the average swc in the yplc stand was 75 78 higher than that in the mplc and mphc stands p 0 05 but the swc in the latter two stands was very close p 0 05 table s1 3 2 fine root distribution the vertical distribution patterns of p tomentosa roots varied greatly among stands fig 4 variation in stand age had no effect on the frld fig 4a frld proportions in different layers fig s2a or the root extinction coefficient

proportion in the deep soil layer p 0 05 fig s2c 3 3 seasonal variation of the root water uptake pattern stand age date and their interaction all had a significant impact on the rwu contributions of different water sources p 0 05 table s2 fig s3a averaging the data over the growing season revealed that the mature stand could absorb a higher proportion of water from the middle and deep soil layers than the young stand but its relative rwu from the shallow soil layer and groundwater decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 6 a meanwhile as the stand matured the primary water source of trees remained deep soil water 41 for the yplc stand 47 for the mplc stand with groundwater contributing the least 10 for the yplc stand and 8 for the mplc stand fig 6a but trees began to absorb significantly more water from the middle soil layer than the shallow soil layer p 0 05 fig 6a on a monthly scale in comparison to the young stand the primary water source of the mature stand was always deep soil water throughout the growing season from 39 to 51 and did not transform to shallow soil water in april and august fig 7 a furthermore increasing stand age reduced the seasonal variability of rwu contributions from the middle and deep soil layers groundwater and the average seasonal variability of all water sources p 0 05 fig 8 fig s3a except for the groundwater source at the young stage stand structure had a significant effect on the rwu contributions of most water sources at different stages and this effect varied across seasons i e significant interaction between date and structure p 0 05 table s2 fig s3bc on average over the growing season increasing competition at the young stage significantly increased relative water uptake from the middle soil layer by 23 and decreased relative water uptake from the shallow soil layer by 19 p 0 05 but had no effect on the rwu contributions of deep soil water and groundwater p 0 05 fig 6b at the mature stage higher competition structure increased relative water uptake of trees from the middle soil layer by 23 p 0 05 but decreased relative water uptake from the deep soil layer rather than the shallow soil layer by 18 p 0 05 fig 6c meanwhile increasing competition did not affect the relative water uptake from the shallow soil layer and groundwater p 0 05 fig 6c in addition although the primary water sources of the two stands were both the deep soil water average contribution 40 and the rwu contribution from groundwater average contribution 10 was the lowest at the young stage the difference of the rwu contribution between the shallow and middle layers increased under higher competition structure difference is 10 than under lower competition structure difference is 1 p 0 05 fig 6b in contrast the rwu contribution from groundwater to mature stands was also the lowest but increasing competition resulted in the thickening of the main water uptake soil zone i e changed from deep layer to deep plus middle layers fig 6c on a monthly scale the stand structure did not influence vertical root water uptake patterns for both young and mature stages during most periods of the growing season fig 7bc in may however increased competition shifted the primary water uptake zones of both young and mature stands from the deep layer to the middle layer fig 7bc in addition at the mature stage an increasing competition promoted the relative water uptake from the shallow soil layer by 100 and 104 in august and september respectively p 0 05 fig 7c furthermore stand structure had little effect on the seasonal variation of rwu contributions from each water source and the average seasonal variation from all water sources at the young stage p 0 05 fig 8 fig s3b on the contrary as competition increased the seasonal variation of rwu contribution from the middle soil layer at the mature stage increased significantly p 0 05 fig 8 fig s3c 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to look at how the effect of stand structure on fine root distributions and water uptake patterns changes over time furthermore we discovered that stand age and stand structure had different effects on fine root distributions and water uptake patterns this discovery refutes our conventional manipulation of fine root morphology as a representation of root water uptake function which contributes to our further understanding of the relationship between plant morphology and function 4 1 the effect of stand age on fine root distribution and root water uptake the fine root will change with stand development but its variation pattern is inconclusive yuan and chen 2010 in this study there was no difference in the fine root density within the 0 2 m soil between the 3 and 40 year old stands fig 4a this finding is inconsistent with the phenomenon widely observed in previous chronosequence studies which have found that as the stands developed the fine root biomass increased finér et al 2007 geng et al 2022 varik et al 2013 increased and then decreased or stabilized reaching a peak when the canopy closed coleman and aubrey 2018 yuan and chen 2010 yuan and chen 2012 or even decreased finér et al 2007 it was speculated that the effect of stand age on the root distribution and biomass in our stands would be most pronounced in the deep soil layer this is because a previous study in the same area found that the soil layer below 2 m depth was the main water consuming zone of p tomentosa liu et al 2022 which can also be confirmed from our isotopic data fig 6a fig 7a this finding suggests that if the root sampling depth is shallow the effect of stand age on root development of tree species with deep rooting habits may not be detected unfortunately most studies sampling depths were limited to the soil layer above 1 m so their findings may be not applicable to stands with deep root systems finér et al 2007 finér et al 2011 jagodzinski et al 2016 yuan and chen 2012 despite the non significant difference in fine root distribution between the young and mature stands in the 0 2 m soil fig 4a there were considerable differences in vertical water uptake patterns between them fig 7a as a result the results supported our third hypothesis that the effects of stand age on fine root distributions and water uptake patterns were inconsistent consistent with the findings of many previous studies drake et al 2011 geng et al 2022 huo et al 2018 p tomentosa became more reliant on middle and deep soil water as the stand developed at the expense of decreasing the contribution of shallow soil water fig 6a fig s3a that is our first hypothesis that stands would absorb more water in deeper soil layers with increasing stand age was supported this is due to the fact that rooting depth generally increases with stand development allowing mature stands greater access to the abundant deep soil water resources drake et al 2011 feild and dawson 1998 huo et al 2018 however when deep soil desiccation occurs in some arid and semi arid regions the primary water sources of mature stands could shift to the shallower soil layer nan et al 2019 tao et al 2021 or to both the shallower and deeper soil layers wang et al 2020 this phenomenon does not appear to occur in our p tomentosa stands as evidenced by the lack of change in the primary water source with stand development fig 6a despite the fact that mature poplar stands in this study area are suffering from severe deep soil desiccation liu et al 2022 this finding implies that deep soil desiccation in this study area has not yet reached a level of severity sufficient to cause changes in tree water sources even after a long period of drought in spring and early summer the mature stands root water uptake pattern i e the vertical distribution curve of rwu did not change as a result of the intense summer rainfall events in august fig 7a other studies have discovered similar phenomena in mature stands drake et al 2011 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2020 in contrast after the heavy summer rainfall the young stands of p tomentosa were able to rapidly change their water uptake patterns absorbing the increased available water in the shallow layers fig 7a this is consistent with the hypothesis proposed by volkmann et al 2016 which demonstrated that young deciduous trees in temperate regions can rapidly utilize abundant and rapidly infiltrating summer rainwater by increasing root activities hence the different water use strategies of different aged stands could be used to explain this discrepancy carbon limitation with increasing stand age may lead to decreased carbon input for maintaining the activities of roots hishi et al 2017 zhu et al 2022 when there is an abundance of water in deep soil mature p tomentosa may adopt a conservative water use strategy that is retaining water uptake from the deep soil layer may be less expensive and more efficient than rebuilding shallow fine roots to absorb precious rainwater resources su et al 2014 wang et al 2021a in the face of abundant summer rainfall however young stands of p tomentosa appeared to use an opportunistic strategy to rapidly switch the main water uptake zone from deep to shallow soil drake et al 2011 su et al 2014 4 2 the effect of stand structure on fine root distribution and root water uptake the change in stand structure stand density and tree species composition will lead to changes in multiple resource availability and interactions of trees casper and jackson 1997 thereby affecting fine root growth finér et al 2017 fu et al 2015 ma and chen 2016 meinen et al 2009 puri et al 1994 and root water uptake fruleux et al 2020 grossiord et al 2014 o keefe et al 2019 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2022 in this study we found that the fine root distribution of p tomentosa did not change significantly with increasing stand density at the young stage fig 4b fig 5b fig s2b this could be because in the presence of adequate living space and abundant resources the less fully developed root zone and lower resource requirements of individuals lead to the possibility of weak underground interaction between trees forrester 2014 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2021b the fine root density of p tomentosa in the shallow soil layer was higher in the mixed stand with higher stand density than in the pure stand with lower stand density at the mature stage fig 4c there are two explanations for this to begin plants should allocate additional biomass to organs with the most limited resource uptake according to the optimal partitioning theory opt bloom et al 1985 gedroc et al 1996 in our mixed stands higher stand density may constrain tree growth due to limited soil nutrients or water in which case competitive strategies may benefit fine root growth in the shallow soil layer aerts and chapin 1999 liao et al 2019 shipley and meziane 2002 secondly r pseudoacacia in mixed forests improved soil nutrient conditions to promote fine root growth of p tomentosa boring and swank 1984 forrester 2014 marquard et al 2009 olesniewicz and thomas 1999 vitkova et al 2017 although the stand structure did not affect the root density at the young stage it did have an effect on the vertical root water uptake pattern fig 6b fig 7b this finding supported our third hypothesis once again first these findings indicate that while stand structure has not yet affected the fine root density phenotype of young stands it has affected the water uptake phenotype second it implies that in the process of evaluating plant plant interactions relying only on a certain phenotype of a plant may lead to misjudgment kulmatiski et al 2020a kulmatiski et al 2020b additionally the effects of stand structure on root length density and averaged rwu contribution over the growing season were not exactly the same at the mature stage fig 4c fig 6c the difference is that in the mixed stand increasing p tomentosa root length density in the shallow soil layer did not significantly increase its reliance on shallow soil water fig 6c nonetheless the apparent increase in root length density in the shallow soil layer could help the rapid absorption of summer rainfall by p tomentosa in the mixed stand after drought fig s3c p tomentose in the mixed stand was more sensitive to summer rainfall which could be attributed to the mixed stand s higher canopy cover higher stand density of higher canopy closure reduced summer soil temperature paul et al 2004 alleviating the inhibition of fine root activity caused by high summer soil temperature williams and ehleringer 2000 at the young stage increased competitive intensity promoted root water uptake from the middle soil layer at the expense of reduced contributions of the shallow soil layer however at the mature stage this promotion came at the expense of diminished contributions from the deep soil layer fig 6bc therefore our first hypothesis that stands would absorb more water in deeper soil layers with increasing competitive intensity was only supported at the young stage this may be because the water consumption of stands increased with stand density correspondingly forrester 2015 hakamada et al 2020 tsamir et al 2019 when shallow water became insufficient to meet the transpiration demand of trees in denser stands trees moved down the central root water uptake area the energy required by the root system to absorb water on the other hand would increase with soil depth christina et al 2017 davidson et al 2011 yang et al 2017 therefore the difference in the rwu contribution among young stands with different stand structures was currently only reflected in the soil layer above 1 m fig 6b as the stand developed the significant difference in rwu contribution between stands with different stand structures shifted to deeper soil layers fig 6c this implies that as the stand develops the main soil area where the underground interaction occurs will gradually move downward vertically along the soil profile furthermore we discovered that a higher competition structure promoted p tomentosa relative water uptake from the middle soil layer throughout the entire drought season both at the mature and young stages fig s3bc this indicates that in the higher competition structure stand the fine roots in the middle soil layer have relatively higher water uptake activity during drought seasons and this characteristic remains unchanged as the stand develops as a result the results only partially supported our second hypothesis that the effects of stand structure on fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns varied with stand development 4 3 implications for the sustainable development of p tomentosa plantations on the north china plain as the stand grows the p tomentosa plantations constantly absorb water from the deep critical zone fig 3 fig 7a resulting in thicker and thicker dried soil layers liu et al 2022 groundwater recharge will be significantly reduced as the unsaturated zone thickens cao et al 2016 it is well known that groundwater is an important water source for trees in arid semi arid and seasonally drought regions dawson and pate 1996 ehleringer and dawson 1992 roupsard et al 1999 yin et al 2015 however in this study the transpiration contribution of groundwater to young and mature p tomentosa fluctuated around 10 throughout the growing season fig 6 fig s2 which was much lower than the global contribution of groundwater sources to the plant xylem water mixture 23 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 this finding suggests that the groundwater level in this area may has dropped to the point where groundwater cannot supply enough water to poplar plantations when the groundwater level falls below 3 m depth p tomentosa s transpiration will be inhibited xi et al 2017 to realize the sustainable development of p tomentosa plantations in the context of climate change a series of forest management measures to alleviate the excessive consumption of deep soil water are required otherwise many poplar forests on the north china plain will be degraded by drought stress just like many other poplar forests in northern china ji et al 2020 liu et al 2020 sun et al 2018 our findings may provide some insights into management strategies in this study we found that the fine roots of young stands as well as the mature mixed stand with higher stand density in the 0 30 cm soil layer were more sensitive to rainfall fig 7ac fig s3ac in addition regardless of developmental stage the higher competition stand structure may promote p tomentosa relative water uptake from the 30 100 cm soil layer fig 6bc fig s3bc furthermore the middle and deep soil water in young stands was significantly higher than that in mature stands table s1 in this area an appropriate increase in stand density did not result in a decrease or even an increase in soil water table s1 therefore forest managers in this water stressed area are advised to advance plantation harvesting increase the diversity of tree size and species and appropriately increase stand density to improve the water uptake activity of fine roots in the 0 100 cm soil layer and mitigate the consumption of deep soil water correspondingly 5 conclusions based on our findings we created a conceptual map to show how stand age and structure affect fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns fig 9 the fine root length density in the 0 2 m profile was unaffected by stand age however as the stand grew the contribution of the middle and deep soil layers to the water uptake of p tomentosa increased at young stage the effect of stand structure on fine roots was insignificant at the mature stage however the higher competition structure increased the fine root length density of p tomentosa in the shallow soil layer significantly the higher competition structure will dramatically promote relative water uptake from the middle soil layer by trees regardless of developmental stage however the increase in the water uptake contribution of the middle soil layer was at the expense of shallow soil water reduction at the young stage but at the expense of deep soil water reduction at the mature stage in conclusion this study revealed the role of stand age and structure on fine root distribution and root water uptake pattern in a water limited region providing a theoretical reference for sustainable forest management in fast growing plantations in other water limited areas around the world in addition the effects of stand age or structure on fine root distributions are not applicable to root water uptake patterns which will be an important reference for the future development of root water uptake models furthermore we unexpectedly found that the groundwater level in this area may have dropped to the point where groundwater cannot provide sufficient water supply for poplar plantations which would seriously affect the sustainable development of poplar plantations in the region therefore we advocate for a range of forest management measures to address this crisis funding this study was financially supported by the national natural science

2563,severe soil desiccation in mature forests has been discovered in many water stressed regions around the world threatening sustainable forest development only by understanding fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns of different forest stands can we timely deal with the severe water stress in tree growth during the 2019 growing season we repeated isotopic and soil water content sampling for four populus tomentosa stands in the north china plain two young stands with lower or higher competition structure and two mature stands with lower or higher competition structure and fine root sampling was performed at the end of the growing season the hydrogen oxygen stable isotope method and the bayesian mixture model were used to determine root water uptake patterns the findings revealed that stand age had no effect on fine root distributions in the 0 2 m profile however p tomentosa became more reliant on the deeper soil water with stand development the stand structure did not affect fine root distributions of young stands but significantly affected that of mature stands regardless of developmental stage the higher competition structure would increase trees relative water uptake from the middle layers however this increase was at the expense of a decrease in the relative water uptake from shallow layers during the young stage and from deep layers during the mature stage furthermore we discovered that the groundwater level in this area may have dropped to an extent that groundwater cannot provide sufficient water supply for p tomentosa this study clearly shows that fine root distribution patterns cannot be used to replace root water uptake patterns in addition the findings of this article will serve as a theoretical foundation for sustainable forest management in fast growing plantations in other water stressed areas around the world keywords root water uptake fine root soil water stand age stand structure populus tomentosa data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction water uptake is an important function of roots because it not only meets the water needs of plants but also serves as a critical link in the pathway of water flow from the soil through plants to the atmosphere dawson et al 2020 the soil hydrological environment can have a significant impact on root water uptake processes climate projections show that rainfall is becoming more stochastic and unpredictable in many parts of the world as a result of global climate change which will increase uncertainty about soil water availability in terrestrial ecosystems allen and ingram 2002 dore 2005 sillmann et al 2017 as a result there is a pressing need to comprehend the spatial distribution pattern of roots as well as the seasonal dynamics of root water uptake patterns this information will be critical in developing sustainable water resource management strategies as well as in building and refining terrestrial biosphere models to predict biosphere responses to climate change lu et al 2019 warren et al 2015 zaehle et al 2005 the fine root distribution and water uptake patterns of stands can be distinct across developmental stages coleman and aubrey 2018 huo et al 2018 nan et al 2019 yuan and chen 2012 in general as stands grow the root zone gradually expands vertically and deep soil water resources become more readily available for plants to meet their water demands drake et al 2011 feild and dawson 1998 finér et al 2007 geng et al 2022 huo et al 2018 however some contradictory phenomena have been observed for example in tropical rainforest regions of south america tree size had little effect on root water uptake depth stahl et al 2013 whereas in some arid or semi arid regions fine root distribution and water uptake depth would move up to shallow soil when the deep soil layer became severely dry nan et al 2019 tao et al 2021 wang et al 2020 therefore there is still a lot of uncertainty about how stand age affects fine roots and root water uptake furthermore many studies only focused on the root functions within the shallow soil layer resulting in a large knowledge gap in this field deep roots which are generally defined as roots distributed below 1 m soil depth are a feature of many plant species and biomes maeght et al 2013 pierret et al 2016 the functional importance of deep roots is becoming more widely recognized in many forest ecosystems christina et al 2017 christoffersen et al 2014 giambelluca et al 2016 xi et al 2013 yang et al 2017 however as far as we know the fine root distribution and water uptake pattern of trees involving deep soil at different stand ages have been only investigated in very limited regions such as the loess plateau sandy regions of northern china and south western australia drake et al 2011 li et al 2019 nan et al 2019 song et al 2020 wang et al 2021a zhou et al 2019 thus such information remains scarce for many regions and forest ecosystems around the world stand density and tree species composition are two important attributes of stand structure ali 2019 gao et al 2014 which may affect the development and spatial distribution of fine roots and the access of trees to soil water resources cahill et al 2010 schmid et al 2015 schmid et al 2013 however most existing studies have primarily focused on the effects of tree species composition on fine root distribution and water uptake function with inconsistent results benomar et al 2013 finér et al 2017 ma and chen 2016 o keefe et al 2019 tang et al 2018 trogisch et al 2016 in comparison little research has been conducted to investigate the effects of stand density on water uptake patterns in monoculture plantations puri et al 1994 wang et al 2022 the relatively shallow depths of sampling in most studies also limit a thorough understanding of how stand structure affects fine root development and function in deep soil layers finér et al 2007 finér et al 2011 jagodzinski et al 2016 yuan and chen 2012 besides plant plant interactions change with stand development callaway and walker 1997 forrester 2014 wang et al 2021b so the effects of stand structure on fine root distribution and water uptake patterns may differ at different developmental stages unfortunately previous research has rarely addressed these concerns it is well understood that the fine root distribution can potentially determine the pattern of root water uptake cai et al 2018 kühnhammer et al 2020 nippert and knapp 2007 volkmann et al 2016 as a result when parameterizing the root water uptake model many studies used the fine root distribution as the embodiment of the potential water uptake distribution cai et al 2018 kumar et al 2015 montagnoli et al 2019 peng and chen 2021 weemstra et al 2020 however the root water uptake pattern does not necessarily match fine root distribution garrigues et al 2006 hamblin and tennant 1987 this is because root hydraulic architecture soil salinity soil water distribution root anatomy soil texture and transpiration demand can all influence root water uptake javaux et al 2013 kulmatiski and beard 2013 kulmatiski et al 2010 quijano et al 2012 van der ploeg et al 2008 similarly it is reasonable to speculate that the role of stand age and stand structure on the fine root distributions may not be applicable to root water uptake patterns however to the best of our knowledge there have been few attempts to simultaneously investigate the responses of fine root distribution and water uptake pattern to changing stand age and stand structure bello et al 2019 fruleux et al 2020 fruleux et al 2018 guderle et al 2018 jia et al 2012 this will inevitably impede our comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying root water uptake as well as the development and refinement of root water uptake models cai et al 2018 dardanelli et al 2004 kumar et al 2015 the north china plain ncp one of the most densely populated areas in the world kang and eltahir 2018 is facing a severe water crisis caused by overexploitation of water resources reducing precipitation and declining groundwater level kang and eltahir 2018 wang et al 2008 populus tomentosa is one of the most commonly used tree species in the ncp for establishing shelterbelt and timber forests xi 2013 zhang et al 2012 a recent study however revealed that mature poplar forests in this region may be suffering from severe deep soil desiccation which can severely impair tree performance and devastate the water ecological environment liu et al 2022 therefore it is critical to thoroughly assess the fine root development characteristics and water uptake dynamics of poplar plantations in this region which will facilitate the development of sustainable management techniques to cope with the serious water crisis p tomentosa is a tree species with a dimorphic root system which allows it to obtain water resources from both shallow and deep soil layers di et al 2018 quantitative research on the fine root distribution and seasonal water uptake patterns of p tomentosa stands on the other hand is still lacking we asked three scientific questions based on the above knowledge gaps to begin how did stand age and stand structure affect fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns second did the impact of stand structure on fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns change with stand development finally were the effects of stand age structure consistent on fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns in response to these scientific issues we proposed a hypothesis 1 stands would absorb more water in deeper soil layers as stand age or competitive intensity stand structure increased 2 the effects of stand structure on fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns varied with stand development 3 the effects of stand age structure on fine root distributions and water uptake patterns were inconsistent 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and experimental plantation the study was conducted in gaotang county liaocheng city shandong province which is located in the ncp 36 48 n 116 05 e altitude of about 30 m fig s1 this region has a warm temperate monsoon climate with an average air temperature of 13 9 c and an average annual precipitation of 553 mm 1981 2020 the experimental site has a very flat terrain with groundwater levels ranging from 6 to 9 m deep the soil texture at this site is sandy loam in the 0 140 cm layer and alternating silt loam and silt below 140 cm depth the other physical and chemical properties of soil can be found in li et al 2020 and he et al 2021 during the 2019 growing season april october the experiment was carried out in four p tomentosa stands two of these stands were young 3 year old yplc and yphc stands and two were mature 40 year old mplc and mphc stands fig 1 fig s1 both the yplc 6 m 6 m 277 trees ha 1 and yphc stands 3 m 3 m 1111 trees ha 1 were pure plantation forests with different planting densities mplc stand 6 m 6 m 277 trees ha 1 was a pure plantation forest with the same stand density as the yplc stand the mphc stand was a p tomentosa and robinia pseudoacacia mixed plantation forest with a tree planting distance of 3 m 6 m 555 trees ha 1 the information on the tree growth of the four stands was shown in table 1 increased stand density increases competition intensity within stands but mixing different tree species may result in below ground niche differentiation among different trees brassard et al 2011 case et al 2020 rodríguez robles et al 2020 sun et al 2017 reducing intra specific competition silvertown et al 2015 however in species diverse ecosystems resource competition may outweigh potential positive interactions at high stand density forrester 2014 therefore in this study we uniformly defined yplc stand and mplc stand as stands with lower competition structure and yphc stand and mphc stand as stands with higher competition structure according to the characteristics of different stands we investigated the effects of stand age on fine root distribution and root water uptake of p tomentosa using the data of yplc and mplc stands while yplc vs yphc stands and mplc vs mphc stands were used to investigate the effect of stand structure on those of p tomentosa at young and mature stages respectively 2 2 environmental factors measurement meteorological factors including solar radiation photosynthetically active radiation air temperature and relative humidity wind speed and direction and precipitation were measured by a weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk installed at about 2 2 km distance from the experimental stands from april to october 2019 all variables were measured every 10 min the measured meteorological data were used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration according to the penman monteith equation in fao 56 allen et al 1998 the oven drying method was used to measure the dynamics of gravimetric soil water content swc in all stands from april to october 2019 soil samples for swc were collected in the middle of each month at 50 cm in the yplc and yphc stands or 100 cm in the mplc stand distances from three average sized trees in each pure stand however in the mixed stand mphc the sampling point n 3 was 150 cm away from the sample trees between the poplar and locust we used the same soil sampling depths for all stands 0 30 30 50 50 70 70 100 100 150 150 200 200 400 and 400 600 cm finally 576 soil samples for swc measurement were collected 2 3 fine roots sampling at the end of september 2019 fine roots were sampled in four stands using the soil coring diameter of 8 cm method the fine roots were sampled at the same sampling locations as the swc measurements but the sampling depth varied between stands roots were sampled to 200 cm depth with an interval of 10 cm n 4 5 in the yplc and yphc stands because it was initially assumed that rooting depth in young stands would be shallow the sampling depth in the mplc and mphc stands was 600 cm with sampling intervals of 10 cm in the 0 140 cm soil layer and 20 cm below 140 cm depth n 4 fig 1 finally 624 soil samples were collected each soil sample was washed by hand with tap water and a sieve to separate the roots from soil particles and organic matter after washing the roots were immersed in water to manually separate live roots from dead roots which were distinguished by their lighter color and greater elasticity these live roots were then placed in labeled valve bags and frozen until root traits were determined using dissecting needles and forceps the fine root samples were carefully spread out on a transparent plastic sheet without overlapping and abutments these roots were scanned using a high quality scanner epson perfection v800 photo epson japan the length and mean diameter of roots were then determined using the automatic image analysis software winrhizo regent instruments inc quebec canada in this study we only used the data from fine roots with a diameter 2 mm block et al 2006 the fine root length density frld cm cm 3 was calculated as the total fine root length of a soil core sample volume to compare the rooting depths among stands the vertical distribution of cumulative frld throughout the soil profile was modeled using eq 1 to obtain the root extinction coefficient β gale and grigal 1987 a high β value indicates a greater proportion of roots at depth whereas a low β value implies a greater proportion of roots close to the soil surface 1 y 1 β d where y is the proportion of frld cumulated from the soil surface to the depth of d cm 2 4 determination of root water uptake source from april to september 2019 soil and xylem samples were collected monthly for δ2h and δ18o isotope analysis fig 2 before dawn three average sized sample trees from each stand were selected for xylem sampling during each sampling event xylem samples n 3 were collected from 1 year old branches in the middle canopy of each sample tree in young stands yplc and yphc stands and their bark and phloem were removed immediately after sampling however xylem samples n 3 were collected from the trunk at 1 3 m above the ground using a growth cone in mature stands mplc and mphc stands as mature trees were too tall to obtain branches no oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h fractionation occurs during root water uptake and sap transfer within the xylem tissue according to research ehleringer and dawson 1992 zimmermann et al 1968 as a result the differences in xylem sampling locations in mature and young stands should not affect the final determination of the source of root water uptake de deurwaerder et al 2018 all xylem samples for isotope measurement were transferred to glass vials which were then sealed with parafilm paired with xylem sampling soil samples for isotope measurement were collected near the sample trees and placed directly in vials sealed with parafilm soil isotope samples were collected concurrently with swc samples and the sampling locations and depths can be found in the swc sampling description fig 1 groundwater samples were taken from wells near the experimental stands finally 576 soil 90 plant and 36 groundwater samples were collected for isotope ratio analysis all of these samples were returned to the laboratory and kept in a freezer 20 c until the water extraction an automatic vacuum condensation extraction system was used to extract xylem and soil water li 2100 lica china a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia dlt 100 los gatos research inc mountain view ca usa with a δ2h precision of 0 10 and a δ18o precision of 0 20 was used to determine the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of all water samples all δ2h and δ18o values were reported in δ calculated by eq 2 which expresses the isotopic composition of a material relative to that of an accepted standard vienna standard mean ocean water v smow on a per mil basis 2 δ r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where δ is the isotope ratio and r is the molar ratio of heavy to light isotopes because this model takes into account uncertainties associated with discrimination factors and multiple source values a bayesian isotope mixing model r package mixsiar version 3 1 was used to calculate the contribution of each water source to root water uptake rwu stock et al 2018 to be more specific we created a id column one id for each sample tree in the raw data of xylem isotope values δ2h and δ18o to assess the source of water uptake for each sample tree id was treated as a fixed effect second the raw data of isotope values from each water source soil water in the 0 30 30 50 50 70 70 100 100 150 150 200 200 400 and 400 600 cm layers as well as groundwater were added into the model third the discrimination data for both δ2h and δ18o was set to zero because the isotope fractionation will not occur during the process of root water uptake dawson and ehleringer 1991 the model was run using the normal markov chain monte carlo mcmc run option chain length 100 000 burn in 50 000 thin 50 the number of chains three and the process only error structure before accepting the output of mixsiar gelman rubin and geweke diagnostic tests were used to determine whether the model had reached convergence stock et al 2018 the specific steps and codes can be found in the official case of mixsiar ex 6 cladocera https brianstock github io mixsiar articles cladocera ex html following the calculation of each water source s contribution the combine sources function in the mixsiar package was used to combine nine water sources into four sources shallow soil layer 0 30 cm middle soil layer 30 100 cm deep soil layer 100 600 cm and groundwater gw 2 5 data analysis the shapiro wilk and kolmogorov smirnov tests were used first to determine whether the data for each variable met the assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity if a variable s data did not meet these assumptions it was log or square root transformed the effects of stand age structure and measurement date on rwu were investigated using the nlme r package and fitting linear mixed effects models with maximum likelihood in the models stand age structure level and measurement date were used as fixed effects while individual tree was treated as a random effect the corar1 function in the nlme package was included in the models to account for repeated measurements with a first order autoregressive covariate

accounting for 75 of the total growing season value 459 mm fig 2 daily reference evapotranspiration increased gradually over time until june when it peaked and then decreased gradually until the growing season ended the experimental year could be divided into three periods based on the above results spring to mid summer drought period period i mid to late summer wet period period ii and autumn drought period period iii the four stands soil water content showed a similar growing season variation trend fig 3 swc decreased gradually with time in all soil layers during period i but increased dramatically during period ii swc decreased again during period iii but at a slower rate with the exception of the surface 30 cm soil in the yplc yphc and mphc stands fig 3abd throughout the growing season there was a distinct difference in swc among soil layers in the yphc stand fig 3b whereas the swc difference between 0 and 30 and 30 100 cm layers decreased in the yplc stand fig 3a the swc difference among soil layers decreased significantly as the stand became mature the mplc and mphc stands fig 3cd the statistical analysis revealed that the four stands had comparable swc ranging from 5 57 to 7 30 p 0 05 in the surface 30 cm soil table s1 however in soil below 30 cm depth the average swc in the yphc stand was 28 127 higher than that in the other stands p 0 05 the average swc in the yplc stand was 75 78 higher than that in the mplc and mphc stands p 0 05 but the swc in the latter two stands was very close p 0 05 table s1 3 2 fine root distribution the vertical distribution patterns of p tomentosa roots varied greatly among stands fig 4 variation in stand age had no effect on the frld fig 4a frld proportions in different layers fig s2a or the root extinction coefficient

5b when stands matured higher competition structure increased the frld in the 10 40 cm soil layer by 500 0 18 cm cm 3 for higher competition 0 03 cm cm 3 for lower competition but decreased the frld in the 240 280 300 320 and 420 440 cm soil layers by 83 0 006 cm cm 3 for higher competition 0 036 cm cm 3 for lower competition fig 4c resulting in significantly larger β p 0 05 fig 5c and lower frld proportion in the deep soil layer p 0 05 fig s2c 3 3 seasonal variation of the root water uptake pattern stand age date and their interaction all had a significant impact on the rwu contributions of different water sources p 0 05 table s2 fig s3a averaging the data over the growing season revealed that the mature stand could absorb a higher proportion of water from the middle and deep soil layers than the young stand but its relative rwu from the shallow soil layer and groundwater decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 6 a meanwhile as the stand matured the primary water source of trees remained deep soil water 41 for the yplc stand 47 for the mplc stand with groundwater contributing the least 10 for the yplc stand and 8 for the mplc stand fig 6a but trees began to absorb significantly more water from the middle soil layer than the shallow soil layer p 0 05 fig 6a on a monthly scale in comparison to the young stand the primary water source of the mature stand was always deep soil water throughout the growing season from 39 to 51 and did not transform to shallow soil water in april and august fig 7 a furthermore increasing stand age reduced the seasonal variability of rwu contributions from the middle and deep soil layers groundwater and the average seasonal variability of all water sources p 0 05 fig 8 fig s3a except for the groundwater source at the young stage stand structure had a significant effect on the rwu contributions of most water sources at different stages and this effect varied across seasons i e significant interaction between date and structure p 0 05 table s2 fig s3bc on average over the growing season increasing competition at the young stage significantly increased relative water uptake from the middle soil layer by 23 and decreased relative water uptake from the shallow soil layer by 19 p 0 05 but had no effect on the rwu contributions of deep soil water and groundwater p 0 05 fig 6b at the mature stage higher competition structure increased relative water uptake of trees from the middle soil layer by 23 p 0 05 but decreased relative water uptake from the deep soil layer rather than the shallow soil layer by 18 p 0 05 fig 6c meanwhile increasing competition did not affect the relative water uptake from the shallow soil layer and groundwater p 0 05 fig 6c in addition although the primary water sources of the two stands were both the deep soil water average contribution 40 and the rwu contribution from groundwater average contribution 10 was the lowest at the young stage the difference of the rwu contribution between the shallow and middle layers increased under higher competition structure difference is 10 than under lower competition structure difference is 1 p 0 05 fig 6b in contrast the rwu contribution from groundwater to mature stands was also the lowest but increasing competition resulted in the thickening of the main water uptake soil zone i e changed from deep layer to deep plus middle layers fig 6c on a monthly scale the stand structure did not influence vertical root water uptake patterns for both young and mature stages during most periods of the growing season fig 7bc in may however increased competition shifted the primary water uptake zones of both young and mature stands from the deep layer to the middle layer fig 7bc in addition at the mature stage an increasing competition promoted the relative water uptake from the shallow soil layer by 100 and 104 in august and september respectively p 0 05 fig 7c furthermore stand structure had little effect on the seasonal variation of rwu contributions from each water source and the average seasonal variation from all water sources at the young stage p 0 05 fig 8 fig s3b on the contrary as competition increased the seasonal variation of rwu contribution from the middle soil layer at the mature stage increased significantly p 0 05 fig 8 fig s3c 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to look at how the effect of stand structure on fine root distributions and water uptake patterns changes over time furthermore we discovered that stand age and stand structure had different effects on fine root distributions and water uptake patterns this discovery refutes our conventional manipulation of fine root morphology as a representation of root water uptake function which contributes to our further understanding of the relationship between plant morphology and function 4 1 the effect of stand age on fine root distribution and root water uptake the fine root will change with stand development but its variation pattern is inconclusive yuan and chen 2010 in this study there was no difference in the fine root density within the 0 2 m soil between the 3 and 40 year old stands fig 4a this finding is inconsistent with the phenomenon widely observed in previous chronosequence studies which have found that as the stands developed the fine root biomass increased finér et al 2007 geng et al 2022 varik et al 2013 increased and then decreased or stabilized reaching a peak when the canopy closed coleman and aubrey 2018 yuan and chen 2010 yuan and chen 2012 or even decreased finér et al 2007 it was speculated that the effect of stand age on the root distribution and biomass in our stands would be most pronounced in the deep soil layer this is because a previous study in the same area found that the soil layer below 2 m depth was the main water consuming zone of p tomentosa liu et al 2022 which can also be confirmed from our isotopic data fig 6a fig 7a this finding suggests that if the root sampling depth is shallow the effect of stand age on root development of tree species with deep rooting habits may not be detected unfortunately most studies sampling depths were limited to the soil layer above 1 m so their findings may be not applicable to stands with deep root systems finér et al 2007 finér et al 2011 jagodzinski et al 2016 yuan and chen 2012 despite the non significant difference in fine root distribution between the young and mature stands in the 0 2 m soil fig 4a there were considerable differences in vertical water uptake patterns between them fig 7a as a result the results supported our third hypothesis that the effects of stand age on fine root distributions and water uptake patterns were inconsistent consistent with the findings of many previous studies drake et al 2011 geng et al 2022 huo et al 2018 p tomentosa became more reliant on middle and deep soil water as the stand developed at the expense of decreasing the contribution of shallow soil water fig 6a fig s3a that is our first hypothesis that stands would absorb more water in deeper soil layers with increasing stand age was supported this is due to the fact that rooting depth generally increases with stand development allowing mature stands greater access to the abundant deep soil water resources drake et al 2011 feild and dawson 1998 huo et al 2018 however when deep soil desiccation occurs in some arid and semi arid regions the primary water sources of mature stands could shift to the shallower soil layer nan et al 2019 tao et al 2021 or to both the shallower and deeper soil layers wang et al 2020 this phenomenon does not appear to occur in our p tomentosa stands as evidenced by the lack of change in the primary water source with stand development fig 6a despite the fact that mature poplar stands in this study area are suffering from severe deep soil desiccation liu et al 2022 this finding implies that deep soil desiccation in this study area has not yet reached a level of severity sufficient to cause changes in tree water sources even after a long period of drought in spring and early summer the mature stands root water uptake pattern i e the vertical distribution curve of rwu did not change as a result of the intense summer rainfall events in august fig 7a other studies have discovered similar phenomena in mature stands drake et al 2011 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2020 in contrast after the heavy summer rainfall the young stands of p tomentosa were able to rapidly change their water uptake patterns absorbing the increased available water in the shallow layers fig 7a this is consistent with the hypothesis proposed by volkmann et al 2016 which demonstrated that young deciduous trees in temperate regions can rapidly utilize abundant and rapidly infiltrating summer rainwater by increasing root activities hence the different water use strategies of different aged stands could be used to explain this discrepancy carbon limitation with increasing stand age may lead to decreased carbon input for maintaining the activities of roots hishi et al 2017 zhu et al 2022 when there is an abundance of water in deep soil mature p tomentosa may adopt a conservative water use strategy that is retaining water uptake from the deep soil layer may be less expensive and more efficient than rebuilding shallow fine roots to absorb precious rainwater resources su et al 2014 wang et al 2021a in the face of abundant summer rainfall however young stands of p tomentosa appeared to use an opportunistic strategy to rapidly switch the main water uptake zone from deep to shallow soil drake et al 2011 su et al 2014 4 2 the effect of stand structure on fine root distribution and root water uptake the change in stand structure stand density and tree species composition will lead to changes in multiple resource availability and interactions of trees casper and jackson 1997 thereby affecting fine root growth finér et al 2017 fu et al 2015 ma and chen 2016 meinen et al 2009 puri et al 1994 and root water uptake fruleux et al 2020 grossiord et al 2014 o keefe et al 2019 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2022 in this study we found that the fine root distribution of p tomentosa did not change significantly with increasing stand density at the young stage fig 4b fig 5b fig s2b this could be because in the presence of adequate living space and abundant resources the less fully developed root zone and lower resource requirements of individuals lead to the possibility of weak underground interaction between trees forrester 2014 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2021b the fine root density of p tomentosa in the shallow soil layer was higher in the mixed stand with higher stand density than in the pure stand with lower stand density at the mature stage fig 4c there are two explanations for this to begin plants should allocate additional biomass to organs with the most limited resource uptake according to the optimal partitioning theory opt bloom et al 1985 gedroc et al 1996 in our mixed stands higher stand density may constrain tree growth due to limited soil nutrients or water in which case competitive strategies may benefit fine root growth in the shallow soil layer aerts and chapin 1999 liao et al 2019 shipley and meziane 2002 secondly r pseudoacacia in mixed forests improved soil nutrient conditions to promote fine root growth of p tomentosa boring and swank 1984 forrester 2014 marquard et al 2009 olesniewicz and thomas 1999 vitkova et al 2017 although the stand structure did not affect the root density at the young stage it did have an effect on the vertical root water uptake pattern fig 6b fig 7b this finding supported our third hypothesis once again first these findings indicate that while stand structure has not yet affected the fine root density phenotype of young stands it has affected the water uptake phenotype second it implies that in the process of evaluating plant plant interactions relying only on a certain phenotype of a plant may lead to misjudgment kulmatiski et al 2020a kulmatiski et al 2020b additionally the effects of stand structure on root length density and averaged rwu contribution over the growing season were not exactly the same at the mature stage fig 4c fig 6c the difference is that in the mixed stand increasing p tomentosa root length density in the shallow soil layer did not significantly increase its reliance on shallow soil water fig 6c nonetheless the apparent increase in root length density in the shallow soil layer could help the rapid absorption of summer rainfall by p tomentosa in the mixed stand after drought fig s3c p tomentose in the mixed stand was more sensitive to summer rainfall which could be attributed to the mixed stand s higher canopy cover higher stand density of higher canopy closure reduced summer soil temperature paul et al 2004 alleviating the inhibition of fine root activity caused by high summer soil temperature williams and ehleringer 2000 at the young stage increased competitive intensity promoted root water uptake from the middle soil layer at the expense of reduced contributions of the shallow soil layer however at the mature stage this promotion came at the expense of diminished contributions from the deep soil layer fig 6bc therefore our first hypothesis that stands would absorb more water in deeper soil layers with increasing competitive intensity was only supported at the young stage this may be because the water consumption of stands increased with stand density correspondingly forrester 2015 hakamada et al 2020 tsamir et al 2019 when shallow water became insufficient to meet the transpiration demand of trees in denser stands trees moved down the central root water uptake area the energy required by the root system to absorb water on the other hand would increase with soil depth christina et al 2017 davidson et al 2011 yang et al 2017 therefore the difference in the rwu contribution among young stands with different stand structures was currently only reflected in the soil layer above 1 m fig 6b as the stand developed the significant difference in rwu contribution between stands with different stand structures shifted to deeper soil layers fig 6c this implies that as the stand develops the main soil area where the underground interaction occurs will gradually move downward vertically along the soil profile furthermore we discovered that a higher competition structure promoted p tomentosa relative water uptake from the middle soil layer throughout the entire drought season both at the mature and young stages fig s3bc this indicates that in the higher competition structure stand the fine roots in the middle soil layer have relatively higher water uptake activity during drought seasons and this characteristic remains unchanged as the stand develops as a result the results only partially supported our second hypothesis that the effects of stand structure on fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns varied with stand development 4 3 implications for the sustainable development of p tomentosa plantations on the north china plain as the stand grows the p tomentosa plantations constantly absorb water from the deep critical zone fig 3 fig 7a resulting in thicker and thicker dried soil layers liu et al 2022 groundwater recharge will be significantly reduced as the unsaturated zone thickens cao et al 2016 it is well known that groundwater is an important water source for trees in arid semi arid and seasonally drought regions dawson and pate 1996 ehleringer and dawson 1992 roupsard et al 1999 yin et al 2015 however in this study the transpiration contribution of groundwater to young and mature p tomentosa fluctuated around 10 throughout the growing season fig 6 fig s2 which was much lower than the global contribution of groundwater sources to the plant xylem water mixture 23 barbeta and peñuelas 2017 this finding suggests that the groundwater level in this area may has dropped to the point where groundwater cannot supply enough water to poplar plantations when the groundwater level falls below 3 m depth p tomentosa s transpiration will be inhibited xi et al 2017 to realize the sustainable development of p tomentosa plantations in the context of climate change a series of forest management measures to alleviate the excessive consumption of deep soil water are required otherwise many poplar forests on the north china plain will be degraded by drought stress just like many other poplar forests in northern china ji et al 2020 liu et al 2020 sun et al 2018 our findings may provide some insights into management strategies in this study we found that the fine roots of young stands as well as the mature mixed stand with higher stand density in the 0 30 cm soil layer were more sensitive to rainfall fig 7ac fig s3ac in addition regardless of developmental stage the higher competition stand structure may promote p tomentosa relative water uptake from the 30 100 cm soil layer fig 6bc fig s3bc furthermore the middle and deep soil water in young stands was significantly higher than that in mature stands table s1 in this area an appropriate increase in stand density did not result in a decrease or even an increase in soil water table s1 therefore forest managers in this water stressed area are advised to advance plantation harvesting increase the diversity of tree size and species and appropriately increase stand density to improve the water uptake activity of fine roots in the 0 100 cm soil layer and mitigate the consumption of deep soil water correspondingly 5 conclusions based on our findings we created a conceptual map to show how stand age and structure affect fine root distributions and root water uptake patterns fig 9 the fine root length density in the 0 2 m profile was unaffected by stand age however as the stand grew the contribution of the middle and deep soil layers to the water uptake of p tomentosa increased at young stage the effect of stand structure on fine roots was insignificant at the mature stage however the higher competition structure increased the fine root length density of p tomentosa in the shallow soil layer significantly the higher competition structure will dramatically promote relative water uptake from the middle soil layer by trees regardless of developmental stage however the increase in the water uptake contribution of the middle soil layer was at the expense of shallow soil water reduction at the young stage but at the expense of deep soil water reduction at the mature stage in conclusion this study revealed the role of stand age and structure on fine root distribution and root water uptake pattern in a water limited region providing a theoretical reference for sustainable forest management in fast growing plantations in other water limited areas around the world in addition the effects of stand age or structure on fine root distributions are not applicable to root water uptake patterns which will be an important reference for the future development of root water uptake models furthermore we unexpectedly found that the groundwater level in this area may have dropped to the point where groundwater cannot provide sufficient water supply for poplar plantations which would seriously affect the sustainable development of poplar plantations in the region therefore we advocate for a range of forest management measures to address this crisis funding this study was financially supported by the national natural science

2564,accurate estimation and partitioning of terrestrial evapotranspiration et is essential for understanding the hydrological cycle and water use efficiency at different scales such knowledge is particularly important for sustainable water resources management in arid ecosystems a daily scale framework for continuous et mapping and partitioning was proposed in this study based on a universal solution of the traditional t s v i models its essence is to transform the t s v i feature space from regional to pixel scale on the basis of surface energy balance principle consequently the et estimation and partitioning was only related to the boundary conditions at pixel scale regardless of the t s v i configuration over the spatial domain we demonstrated the framework with modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products in qaidam basin a poorly gauged basin with arid ecosystems in the qinghai tibet plateau in china the scheme was performed pixel by pixel using as much of the remote sensing observations as possible aiming at that it could be applied to other poorly gauged regions the comparative analysis indicates that our et estimates agreed well with three readily available et products and those retrieved from water balance analysis the advantages of our universal t s v i model mainly lie in its high spatial resolution and daily continuity which enables it to capture the spatial details and temporal variations more accurately the results show that our annual average et estimation from 2001 to 2020 was around 179 20 mm year which was very close to its annual average precipitation the annual average soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t was 168 77 and 10 43 mm year accounting for 94 and 6 of the total et respectively et in qaidam basin decreased generally from southeast to northwest and from surrounding mountains to the interior with significant vertical zonality consequently et of different landscapes followed the order woodland shrubland alpine vegetation alpine meadow bare rock alpine grassland salt crust desert grassland bare soil gobi sandy land as an arid basin the spatial distribution of et in qaidam basin was mainly controlled by precipitation however with the further decrease of temperature in high mountains et started to be controlled by energy availability rather than water availability accordingly the variations of our et estimates with altitude increased first and then decreased with a peak value of 287 67 mm observed at altitudes of 4600 4800 m keywords evapotranspiration estimation evapotranspiration partitioning poorly gauged basins arid ecosystems remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is the quantity of water released to the atmosphere via the process of soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t as a key hydrological component of the land surface et plays a vital role in the water energy and carbon cycles jung et al 2010 from a global point of view it returns about 65 of the precipitation to the atmosphere and utilizes more than half of the solar energy absorbed by the earth s surface oki and kanae 2006 bu et al 2021 mondal et al 2022 it has been established that agricultural irrigation accounts for around 70 of all the water used for human activities and that about 99 of the water resources in the cropland system is consumed through et kite 2000 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2021 wolff et al 2022 therefore accurate characterization of the et process is not only important for further understanding the water and energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere but also for making decisions on sustainable agricultural water resources management xu et al 2021 awada et al 2022 chen et al 2022a jiang et al 2022 located in the northwest of china qaidam basin has its unique advantages in natural resources besides diverse salt lake resources qaidam basin abounds with fossil fuel and renewable energy such as wind and solar power as a result qaidam basin has earned it the alternative name of cornucopia however as a closed arid basin the looming water shortage becomes a critical factor restricting the sustainable development of qaidam basin on the one hand more water use is required to sustain local agricultural production and natural resources exploitation on the other hand the special geographical location and climate characteristics make qaidam basin an ecologically sensitive region to be specific qaidam basin is located in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau which is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate and environmental changes yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2022 in addition numerous studies suggest that the water deficit in arid and semi arid regions turns them into fragile ecosystems with land desertification xu et al 2020 bao et al 2022 for example the average et in arid ecosystems accounts for 95 of the precipitation far exceeding the ratio over other ecosystems wang et al 2014 stoy et al 2019 qubaja et al 2020 gao et al 2022 in contrast its transpiration fraction of et an indicator representing an ecosystem s transpiration efficiency is much lower zhang et al 2016 scott et al 2021 under this background accurate estimation of the total et and its components becomes particularly significant for understanding the terrestrial hydrological cycles and water use efficiency in arid ecosystems such knowledge is just urgently needed for water resources and environmental management in qaidam basin however due to the harsh natural environment qaidam basin is typically a poorly gauged basin to the best of our knowledge few in situ observations are available now to reflect the spatial patterns of its total et let alone its two components spatially distributed remote sensing based et models have proved to be useful in capturing the basin and global scale et fluxes which has distinct advantages for et estimation in ungauged regions yang et al 2013 sheffield et al 2018 talsma et al 2018 over the past few decades a series of models such as the penman monteith pm surface energy balance seb priestley taylor pt and statistical empirical models have been developed to retrieve et from satellite remote sensing rs images courault et al 2005 li et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 accordingly several rs based et products are available now making it possible for us to derive et information in most parts of the world nevertheless it must be noted that the et estimation or partitioning is always not easy for arid ecosystems take the widely used mod16 et product developed based on pm model for example mu et al 2007 2011 its et estimation is absent in most arid ecosystems such as sharan africa and qaidam basin apart from spatial discontinuity there are many common challenges to be addressed for all the above rs based et models for instance the land surface temperature t s and vegetation index vi retrieved from optical and thermal remote sensing are indispensable parameters for et mapping chen and liu 2020 however due to the contamination of cloud cover such parameters are only available under clear sky conditions making the continuous et estimation a challenging task many global et products adopt land surface models and reanalysis datasets to fill the above gaps as such global products are aimed to provide extensive et estimation it is expected that their uncertainties at the local scales are considerable douna et al 2021 zhu et al 2022 further work suggests that their performance at regional scales relies heavily on the availability of ground based observations which opens space to the development of new et models for local application barraza et al 2017 the lack of ground based observations in ungauged basins reinforces the need of developing et models at local scales that rely only on remote sensing data douna et al 2021 a promising method to solve above difficulties is the so called t s v i method which is developed based on an extension of the pt model carlson 2007 chen and liu 2020 the essence of this method is to derive evaporative fraction ef the fraction of available energy released as latent heat from the scatterplots of remotely sensed t s and vi collected in a given spatial domain the capability of reasonable et estimation with less complexity and fewer input parameters makes this method hold great potential application in ungauged basins stisen et al 2008 tang et al 2010 minacapilli et al 2016 carlson 2020 however traditional t s v i methods are only applicable when most of the study domain is under clear sky conditions so that enough pixels with valid t s and vi values can be collected the continuous monitoring of ef and et is still a challenging task thus the focus of this study was to quantify comprehensively the et process in qaidam basin based on a further development of the t s v i method specifically the goals of this study were to 1 develop a daily scale rs based framework for continuous et mapping and partitioning in poorly gauged basins 2 evaluate the performance of this framework through comparative and water balance analysis 3 analyze the spatial temporal patterns of total et and its two components in qaidam basin from 2001 to 2020 and 4 identify its et features in different landscapes as well as their influencing factors 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area qaidam basin is one of the four largest basins in china with an area of about 250 000 km2 it is situated in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau extending in longitude from 87 60 e to 99 50 e and in latitude from 34 50 n to 39 40 n fig 1 a as a closed inland basin it is surrounded by kunlun mountains in the south altun mountain in the northwest and qilian mountains in the northeast consequently the average altitude of qaidam basin is around 3600 m which is highest among china s four largest basins its climate is typical of a plateau continental climate characterized by low precipitation and strong solar radiation wei et al 2021 the annual precipitation decreases gradually from southeast to northwest with an average below 200 mm year the mean annual air temperature ranges from 1 5 to 4 8 and the average pan evaporation ranges from 1974 to 3000 mm year bibi et al 2019 the land cover in qaidam basin is dominated by arid landscapes which have very limited distribution of shrubland and woodland fig 1b the shrubs are mainly distributed in valleys and riversides around the middle and lower reaches of some large rivers and coniferous forest is only scattered in sunny slope of the mountains in the east because both precipitation and temperature correlate significantly with altitude the vegetation in qaidam basin presents vertical zonality clearly zhu et al 2011 to be specific the interior is generally covered with bare soil because of little precipitation vegetation is only scattered around inland rivers lakes and alluvial fans while salt crust sandy land and gobi are widely distributed zhu et al 2012 it is well known that grassland is the dominant vegetation in arid and semi arid regions as for qaidam basin it mainly includes desert grassland and alpine grassland two types the former is widely distributed in low mountains and the latter is scattered mostly in mountains with altitude higher than 4000 m besides alpine grassland alpine meadow is another dominant vegetation type in the high altitude areas of kunlun and qilian mountains but it has stricter demand for water supply the vegetation coverage decreases with the further increase of altitude subsequently han et al 2021a specifically alpine talus and cushion vegetation is sparsely distributed in high mountains of qaidan basin most of these areas are occupied by bare rock because of low temperature with the further decrease of temperature in high mountains the landscapes are dominated by glacier and snow without vegetation coverage 2 2 materials used for et estimation the remote sensing observations used in this study for et mapping come from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis an instrument onboard nasa s terra satellite launched in 1999 terra is in a circular sun synchronous polar orbit with daytime overpass time around 10 30 local time seven modis version 6 products from 2001 to 2020 were adopted for et estimation including daily land surface temperature product at 1 km resolution mod11a1 daily solar zenith angle product at 1 km resolution mod03 daily atmosphere profile product at 5 km resolution mod07 l2 daily cloud product at 5 km resolution mod06 l2 daily albedo product at 500 m resolution mcd43a3 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product at 1 km resolution mod13a2 and 8 day leaf area index lai product at 500 m resolution mod15a2h all products were transformed into world geodetic system 1984 with 1 km pixel size based on mrt and heg tools provided by modis website to coincide with other daily modis products the 16 day ndvi and 8 day lai products were time series smoothed and interpolated linearly to the daily values using the locally adjusted cubic spline capping method proposed by chen et al 2006 ground based meteorological observations are also indispensable for et estimation hourly air temperature t a relative humidity rh and wind speed w s measurements from the national meteorological information centre nmic of china meteorological administration cma were adopted in this study t a and rh measurements were utilized for the estimation of dew point temperature t d through the combination of modis observations so only the measurements observed at the time that approximates most the overpass time of terra satellite were used in this work it should be noted that nmic currently has more than two thousand meteorological stations on a national scale however there are only nine stations available for qaidam basin the density of which is much lower than the national average level fig 1a 2 3 materials used for et evaluation the lack of in situ observations also makes it difficult to evaluate et estimation effectively in ungauged basins consequently the accuracy of our et estimates from 2001 to 2020 was evaluated by comparative analysis four ancillary datasets were adopted for reference which were classified into two categories according to their utilities the first category includes three readily available et products for direct comparison the first one is the gleam global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology et dataset which is generated by a set of algorithms that separately estimate different et components exclusively from satellite forcing data miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 it provides global et estimates at both daily and monthly scales from 1980 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 although there are several global et products to choose from the good performance of gleam has been confirmed at both global and chinese national scales in previous studies bai and liu 2018 zhu et al 2022 the second et product is developed by ma et al 2019 based on a calibration free diagnostic and benchmarking tool of the complementary relationship this product is released by the national tibetan plateau data center ntpdc https data tpdc ac cn zh hans it provides nationwide et estimates at monthly scale from 1982 to 2017 with a spatial resolution of 0 1 apart from superiority in algorithms their meteorological forcing inputs are retrieved from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd which makes this et product perform well in china the third et product is produced using the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay et al 2013 for 2003 to present its original algorithms are designed based on sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and metric allen et al 2007 models the early warning and environmental monitoring program provides multi temporal ssebop et product with a spatial resolution of 1 km https earlywarning usgs gov fews product 461 the key inputs of this global product include modis and gdas global data assimilation system data streams the second category of our ancillary datasets is for water balance analysis at basin scale which includes precipitation and terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa two datasets the monthly gridded precipitation from 2001 to 2018 was retrieved from the cmfd this dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 1 is produced by yang and he 2019 through fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis dataset and in situ observation data at weather stations the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twsa dataset was adopted in this study to account for water storage change over qaidam basin the level 3 product at 0 5 spatial resolution was downloaded from the grace tellus website https grace jpl nasa gov in order to identify et features in different landscapes the vegetation map of china 1 1 000 000 supplied by the ntpdc was adopted as landscape mask hou 2019 it was produced by a team of over 250 scientist based on field surveys lasting around 10 years su et al 2022 thirteen landscapes were identified from this vegetation dataset including water woodland shrubland alpine vegetation alpine meadow alpine grassland desert grassland bare rock gobi bare soil salt crust sandy land and other types fig 1b 3 methodology in this paper we first calculated the total et at pixel scale using a single source rs based model and then partitioned it into soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t based on the theoretical framework of the dual source et model according to the definition of evaporative fraction ef et of a given pixel can be calculated as the product of available energy and ef the available energy is the vector sum of net radiation flux r n w m 2 and soil heat flux g w m 2 due to the counteraction between daytime and nighttime soil heat flux g at daily scale is usually assumed to be negligible for et estimation cammalleri et al 2012 samain et al 2012 thus daily available energy is totally determined by r n in this work r n under all sky conditions was estimated through the combination of bisht and bras 2010 and rivas and cormora 2013 and ef was retrieved from modis products based on our further development of the traditional t s v i models fig 2 shows the flowchart of our daily scale framework for continuous et mapping and partitioning based on a universal solution of the traditional t s v i models its specific procedures are explained step by step as below 3 1 net radiation estimation under all sky conditions 3 1 1 instantaneous net radiation estimation for clear sky pixels according to bisht and bras 2010 net radiation at the land surface for clear sky pixels r n clear w m 2 could be expressed in terms of its components as follows 1 r n clear r s clear 1 α ε s ε a σ t a 4 ε s σ t s 4 2 r s clear s 0 cos 2 θ 1 085 cos θ e a 2 7 c o s θ 10 3 0 2 where r s clear w m 2 is the downwelling shortwave radiation α is the land surface albedo ε s and ε a are the surface and air emissivity respectively σ 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 is the stefan boltzmann constant s 0 1367 w m 2 is the solar constant at the top of atmosphere θ r a d is the solar zenith angle t s k and t a k are the land surface and air temperature respectively and e a h p a is the near surface vapor pressure which was computed from t d k using the clausius clapeyron equation rogers and yau 1989 in the above equations both t s and ε s were retrieved from mod11a1 product α and θ were retrieved from mcd43a3 and mod03 respectively t a was estimated from mod07 l2 and mod06 products based on the method proposed by zhu et al 2017a and t d was estimated using the method proposed by bisht and bras 2010 through the combination of mod07 l2 product and in situ observations ε a was parameterized from e a and t a using a scheme proposed by prata 1996 3 1 2 instantaneous net radiation estimation for cloudy pixels net radiation for cloudy pixels r n cloudy was computed in terms of its components as 3 r n cloudy r s cloudy 1 α ε s ε a σ t a 4 ε s ε c 1 ε a σ t c 4 ε s σ t s 4 4 r s cloudy r s clear 1 f cc r s cloud f cc 5 r s cloud τ m s 0 c o s θ 0 3 1 τ m s 0 c o s θ where ε c t c k and f cloud represent the cloud emissivity cloud temperature and fractional cloud coverage respectively all these three variables were available in mod06 product τ 0 27 is the atmospheric transparency under extremely cloudy conditions yu et al 2021 m is the optical air mass which was parameterized from surface pressure and θ using the scheme proposed by kocifaj 2016 two terms need to be distinguished here r s cloudy w m 2 represents the actual downwelling shortwave radiation for cloudy pixels while r s cloud w m 2 represents the ideal downwelling shortwave radiation under extremely cloudy conditions f cloud 1 it is obvious that r n cloudy was calculated on the basis of r n clear on the one hand the downwelling shortwave radiation was estimated as a linear combination of the fluxes between the extreme cases of completely clear and cloudy conditions on the other hand the downwelling longwave radiation was estimated as a combination of downwelling radiation from near surface conditions and clouds as proposed by forman and margulis 2007 3 1 3 net radiation estimation at daily scale with the instantaneous net radiation r n i n s w m 2 calculated above the empirical formula proposed by rivas and cormora 2013 was adopted for net radiation estimation at daily scale r n d w m 2 as 6 r n d 0 43 r n i n s 54 3 2 evaporative fraction model for clear sky pixels 3 2 1 basic framework of the t s v i models ef in the t s v i models was estimated based on an extension of the pt equation as follows 7 ef δ t a δ t a γ where γ k p a k 1 is the psychrometric constant δ k p a k 1 as a function of temperature is the gradient of saturated vapor pressure to t a and is a dimensionless parameter accounting for aerodynamic and canopy resistances jiang and islam 1999 zhao and liu 2014 tomás et al 2014 in traditional t s v i models is usually estimated from the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi proposed by sandholt et al 2002 by contrast it was retrieved from a modified version of tvdi mtvdi in our previous universal triangle method zhu et al 2017b specifically for the soil surface soil was parameterized from mtvdi following komatsu 2003 and wang et al 2006 as 8 soil 1 26 1 e x p m t v d i 1 following the assumption that the radiometric temperature of a full vegetated canopy t canopy is in equilibrium with the temperature of the air within the canopy for the full cover vegetation canopy is always close to its maximum value canopy 1 26 consequently for a mixed pixel was interpolated linearly between canopy and soil by using fractional vegetation coverage f vc as the weight 9 soil 1 f vc canopy f vc 10 f vc ndvi ndvi soil ndvi canopy ndvi soil 2 f vc in this paper was retrieved from ndvi using the methodology proposed by gillies et al 1997 ndvi canopy and ndvi soil represent the ndvi values of full cover vegetation and bare soil respectively following zhu et al 2013 ndvi canopy was set as 0 86 and ndvi soil was set as 0 05 3 2 2 a universal solution of the t s v i models the t s v i models have been used widely for ef estimation jiang and islam 2001 garcia et al 2014 tang and li 2017 petropoulos et al 2020 it derives spatially distributed ef by using a contextual interpretation of the relationship between t s and ndvi two easily remotely sensed surface variables a central assumption involved in the t s v i method is that if there exist sufficient pixels representing a broad range of f vc and soil moisture sm in a given spatial domain the envelope of these pixels could constitute a physically meaningful triangle or trapezoid carlson et al 2007 petropoulos et al 2009 chen and liu 2020 the logic behind it is that low t s values generally correspond to high f vc values for pixels where large et rates would occur and vice versa long and singh 2012 obviously the original t s v i method only works when most of the study domain is under clear sky conditions so that enough pixels can be collected minacapilli et al 2016 carlson et al 2020 in addition uniform topographic and atmospheric conditions are also required to guarantee that the spatial variations of t s are mainly controlled by sm and f vc long et al 2012 tomás et al 2014 the combination of these two aspects makes it difficult to retrieve continuous ef from the traditional t s v i feature space especially for regions like qaidam basin with heterogeneous topographic and atmospheric conditions to solve these difficulties a universal triangle method was proposed in our previous work by transforming the t s v i feature space from regional to pixel scale zhu et al 2017c consequently the retrieval of ef was only related to the boundary conditions at pixel scale regardless of the t s v i configuration over the spatial domain nonetheless it adopted the regional average and maximum air temperature as the initial inputs for each pixel which is still not applicable to large areas with heterogeneous land surface in view of this we incorporated the temperature correction scheme proposed by szilagyi et al 2014 2017 into our previous universal t s v i models in this paper for continuous ef estimation in qaidam basin the specific procedures and logics behind are listed as below both tvdi and mtvdi are derived by using linear interpolation procedures in previous t s v i models sandholt et al 2002 leng et al 2017 zhu et al 2017b ryu et al 2021 consequently the success of this method depends heavily on the correct choice of the two extreme points used for interpolation which are defined by the land surface temperature under extreme sm conditions sun et al 2012 yang et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2017 chen et al 2022b in this study the dry point with the lowest et rate was defined as the maximum surface temperature the bare soil can reach under extremely water stressed conditions t dry k and the wet point with the largest et rate was defined as the surface temperature of bare soil under unlimited water access conditions t wet k assuming that sm availability decreases linearly from wet point to dry point the sm state at pixel scale was determined based on the position of its actual soil temperature t soil k between t dry and t wet as 11 mtvdi t soil t wet t dry t wet the retrieval of t soil for a mixed pixel has been investigated by numerous studies in our universal t s v i triangle models it was determined as 12 t soil t s f vc t canopy 1 f vc t s f vc t a 1 f vc the logic behind eq 12 is that t s at pixel scale is a weighted sum of t soil and t canopy and that t canopy is in equilibrium with t a within the canopy due to evaporative cooling effect norman et al 1995 anderson et al 2007 nieto et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 the determination of t wet is straightforward in previous studies for example the minimum t s in an image was adopted as a proxy for t wet by sandholt et al 2002 for the development of tvdi and the regional average t a served as a proxy for t wet in long and singh 2012 and zhu et al 2017c for the derivation of the theoretical boundary conditions as we mentioned earlier in this lecture the above practice makes sense for uniform topographic and atmospheric conditions but it is not applicable to the case of qaidam basin in this paper the wet bulb temperature t wb deduced by szilagyi 2014 was adopted to substitute for t wet which is expressed as 13 t wet t wb γ t a t d δ t d γ δ t d t wb as a proxy for t wet has at least two advantages firstly t wb is the lowest temperature that can be reached under current ambient conditions by evaporative cooling effect only the physical meaning of which is very close to t wet secondly it can be computed pixel by pixel based on conventional meteorological observations which is feasible for large scale applications the theoretical solution of t dry has been well described in zhang et al 2008 sun et al 2012 and long and singh 2012 inspired by these studies t dry at pixel scale has been deduced in our previous universal t s v i triangle models based on the land surface energy balance principle zhu et al 2017c we would not present its deduction process in detail in this study and just give its numerical solution formula as 14 t dry r s clear 1 α sd 0 95 ε a σ t a s d 4 0 95 σ t a s d 4 3 8 σ t a s d 3 ρ c p 0 685 r a s d t a s d where ρ is air density c p is the specific heat of air under constant pressure and r a is the aerodynamic resistance which was estimated from wind speed using a simple method developed by brutsaert 1982 the subscript sd denotes that these parameters are only applicable for dry and bare soil a close look at eq 14 indicates that it is not ready for the practical estimation of t dry at pixel scale because the air temperature over dry and bare soil t a s d is unknown yet the regional maximum t a was adopted as a substitute for t a s d in sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017c for plain areas but it is not the case in qaidam basin in order to apply eq 14 at pixel scale t a s d in this paper was determined based on the maximum possible evaporation e pmax concept proposed by szilagyi et al 2017 specifically e pmax is the evaporation rate that can be reached when the air becomes void of any moisture and thus t a s d can be derived as the intercept of the adiabatic line defined by t a and e a 15 t a s d e t wb t a t wb e t wb e a t wb where e h p a is the saturation vapor pressure retrieved from the clausius clapeyron equation rogers and yau 1989 3 3 daily et estimation and partitioning under all sky conditions 3 3 1 daily et estimation under all sky conditions as we mentioned earlier in this lecture the traditional spatial domain based t s v i models are only applicable when most of the selected domain is under clear sky conditions by contrast the universal solution scheme proposed in this paper was performed pixel by pixel regardless of the t s v i configuration over the spatial domain which makes it possible to conduct a continuous estimation of ef note that the continuous here means that ef of all pixels with valid remote sensing observations can be retrieved from this scheme however due to the data missing problem caused by cloud occurrence our universal t s v i model is still not ready for the ef estimation under extremely cloudy conditions there is a need to interpolate ef between the dates of two successive ef estimates according to delogu et al 2012 and alfieri et al 2017 ef on intermediate cloudy days was interpolated linearly between the closest previous and following clear sky days as 16 ef cloud k ef clear i ef clear j ef clear i j i k i where ef cloud k is the ef to be interpolated on doy day number of a year k and ef clear i and ef clear j are the clear sky rs based ef estimates on doy i and j respectively there are two reasons for the selection of this simple linear interpolation method firstly the comparative study of alfieri et al 2017 suggests that more computational complex interpolation methods present no substantive advantage over linear regression secondly the study of delogu et al 2012 shows that the linear interpolation algorithm performs well enough to capture the seasonal variations of ef the above two aspects particularly hold true for arid areas like qaidam basin because of the low frequency of cloud occurrence once ef has been estimated and interpolated under all sky conditions et at daily scale et d m m d 1 could be calculated continuously by the combination of ef and r n d as follows 17 et d c et r n d e f where c et 0 0353 is a constant to transform the unit of et from w m 2 to m m d 1 3 3 2 daily et partitioning in the t s v i models although most of the t s v i models pertain to the one source scheme they have great potential to discriminate vegetation transpiration t from soil evaporation e several two source models have been developed based on the t s v i feature space in previous studies long and singh 2012 tang et al 2017 chen et al 2022b inspired by these studies and others et partitioning in this study was achieved through a specific estimation of e and t was determined as the residual given r n estimation in section 3 1 net radiation at the soil surface r n s o i l w m 2 could be computed as 18 r n s o i l r n e k r n l a i where k r n 0 60 according to purdy et al 2018 ef for soil evaporation ef soil was determined through the combination of eqs 7 and 8 as 19 ef soil 1 26 1 e x p m t v d i 1 δ t a δ t a γ consequently the partitioning of et estimates between e and t was expressed as 20 e 1 26 r n e k r n l a i 1 e x p m t v d i 1 δ t a δ t a γ 21 t e t e 3 4 model evaluation approach due to the lack of ground based et observations the performance of our above et model was evaluated by comparison with three readily available et products pearson correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and mean bias error mbe were selected as evaluation metrics which are defined as 22 r i 1 n x i x x i x i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 23 mae 1 n i 1 n x i x i 24 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 25 mbe 1 n i 1 n x i x i where x i and x are our estimated and the average estimated et values during the evaluation period and x i and x are the corresponding reference and the average reference et values respectively as a closed inland basin qaidam basin allows no surface outflow and retains water in a landlocked storage that equilibrates through evaporation wang et al 2018 bibi et al 2019 wei et al 2021 accordingly et at basin scale could be determined based on water balance analysis as 26 et p δ s where δ s represents change in total water storage eq 26 provides important reference data for et evaluation at basin scale which is particularly valuable for ungauged areas in this study the above water balance analysis was conducted at monthly scale and δ s was derived from grace twsa following the numerical differentiation algorithm described in xu et al 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of et models in the study area due to the lack of ground based observations the performance of our et model was evaluated indirectly through comparative analysis specifically the results of our et estimation from 2001 to 2020 were compared with three readily available et products namely et ma et gleam and et ssebop as well as those retrieved from grace observations based on water balance analysis et grace gleam provides both daily and monthly et estimates but et ma et ssebop and grace only provide monthly datasets therefore all the comparisons were performed at monthly scale for consistency due to the difference in time span of above datasets it should also be noted that the sample size for comparison varies with products the comparison of our et estimates with et ma was performed from 2001 to 2017 the comparison with et gleam was performed from 2001 to 2020 and the comparison with et ssebop was performed from 2003 to 2020 the water balance analysis was conducted from 2003 to 2018 however due to satellite batteries and accelerometer failure grace observations are absent in individual months in addition the errors and uncertainties involved in the grace based water balance analysis would lead to negative et estimates during water stressed seasons pan et al 2017 schoups and nasseri 2021 all these anomalies have been eliminated in our comparison as a result the sample size of et grace is much less than 192 the evaluation metrics at basin scale are presented in fig 3 the comparison indicates that our monthly et estimates agreed well with all three et products with r values higher than 0 90 however all the three other statistics suggest that the best agreement was observed when the estimates were compared with et gleam the mae rmse and mbe achieved by et gleam comparison were 3 14 4 39 and 0 86 mm month while those achieved by et ma comparison and et ssebop comparison were 3 89 5 53 1 09 and 4 31 5 80 0 86 mm month respectively obviously the model proposed in this paper underestimated et ma and overestimated et gleam and et ssebop slightly in order to further investigate the performance of different et models the et estimation produced by water balance analysis was adopted as the benchmark table 1 the results show that the accuracy of different et estimates varies with statistical metrics compared with the two et products with coarse spatial resolution the values of mae and rmse indicate that the best and worst accuracy was achieved by et gleam and et ma respectively to be specific the mae of et gleam and et ma was 6 18 and 6 46 mm month and the rmse of these two models was 8 24 and 9 00 mm month respectively in contrast the mae and rmse of our et estimates were 6 41 and 8 93 mm month both of which took an intermediate position between these two products however when judged from mbe the performance of et ma and et gleam has been reversed the complementary relationship et model proposed by ma et al 2019 achieved a slight systematic error with mbe as small as 0 12 mm month while the mbe of gleam model was 1 61 mm month suggesting a relatively significant underestimation in et by contrast the mbe achieved by our universal t s v i model was 0 46 mm month which was still located in the middle of these two products both et ssebop and our et estimates were achieved with 1 km pixel size which means that these two products are more comparable in performance the results show that et ssebop was superior to our et estimates in terms of r and rmse but our t s v i model performed better when judged from mae and mbe in general the above comparison indicates that the model proposed in this paper showed no advantage in accuracy over the three reference et datasets as a matter of fact the lack of ground truth benchmark in qaidam basin even makes it impossible for us to evaluate the accuracy of different et models effectively nevertheless it at least demonstrates that the accuracy produced by our t s v i model has reached a level comparable to those achieved by other widely used et products on this basis the advantage of our t s v i model over these products lies in its high spatial resolution and daily continuity of et estimates which enables us to gain a better understanding of the et patterns in qaidam basin 4 2 spatial and temporal patterns of total et fig 4 a shows the variations of our annual et estimates from 2001 to 2020 et gleam et ma et ssebop and precipitation provided by the ntpdc are also presented for comparison the results show that a slight decreasing trend was observed in precipitation from 2001 to 2018 with an annual average around 181 82 mm year and a slope of 2 13 mm year however all the four et estimates show a slight increasing trend over the same period specifically the annual average of our et estimates et gleam et ma and et ssebop were 179 20 168 80 190 87 and 168 46 mm year and their increasing rates were 0 22 2 50 0 97 and 0 66 mm year respectively it is obvious that our et estimates are closest to precipitation in amount this makes sense because water storage change at basin scale is typically assumed to be negligible on multiyear time scales which particularly holds true for arid basins hu et al 2021 the combination of this assumption and eq 26 suggests that the annual average et of a closed basin is theoretically equal to its annual average precipitation in addition the similarity of our et estimates with precipitation was also confirmed by correlation analysis in terms of inter annual variations significant correlation was observed between our et estimates and precipitation with r as high as 0 60 to be specific the variations of precipitation from 2001 to 2018 present seven obvious peaks 2002 2005 2007 2010 2012 2015 and 2018 and seven obvious valleys 2001 2003 2006 2008 2011 2014 and 2017 respectively our et estimates captured six out of seven peaks 2002 2005 2007 2012 2015 and 2018 and five out of seven valleys 2001 2003 2006 2008 and 2014 in contrast precipitation was not significantly correlated with et gleam et ma or et ssebop their respective correlation coefficients with precipitation were only 0 21 0 32 and 0 44 as for the reasons why the variation trend of et and precipitation is opposite several studies highlighted the role of glacier meltwater and permafrost degradation in et increase over the tibet plateau yang et al 2020 han et al 2021b lin et al 2021 consequently the increase trend of et in qaidam basin is probably caused by these factors as snow melt and glacier retreat in the tibet plateau is accelerating lau et al 2010 wang et al 2022 fig 4b presents the boxplots of our monthly et estimates from 2001 to 2020 like in most areas of china the seasonal variations of et in qiadam basin followed a sinusoidal trend over 12 months with the largest and lowest values arising in july 31 53 mm month and december 1 62 mm month judging from the average over twenty years the et in spring summer autumn and winter accounted for 28 02 49 71 18 50 and 3 77 of the annual total respectively the inter annual fluctuation of monthly et followed the same trend with their et quantity both the overall and interquartile range of these boxplots indicate that the fluctuation amplitude of monthly et followed the order summer spring autumn winter the spatial distribution of our annual average et estimates from 2001 to 2020 is presented in fig 5 the annual average of et gleam from 2001 to 2020 et ma from 2001 to 2017 and et ssebop from 2003 to 2020 is also presented for comparison note that the universal t s v i model proposed in this paper was designed for terrestrial et estimates therefore the water bodies in fig 5a have been eliminated using a mask retrieved from mod44w product it is obvious that the et decreasing trend from southeast to northwest and from surrounding mountains to the interior has been captured by all products however a close look at these maps suggests that our et estimates have significant advantages over et ma and et gleam in capturing details to be specific the spatial distribution of et ma accorded well with the altitudes in fig 1a consequently it was homogeneous on a relatively small scale with little ability to reflect et variations caused by non topographic factors this can be explained by the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd adopted in et ma the cmfd was developed through fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ observations from approximately 700 stations ma et al 2019 however due to the low density of meteorological stations in western china great significance was attached to high resolution elevation data in the interpolation of air temperature and pressure yang and he 2019 he et al 2020 by comparison et gleam was capable of reflecting high value zones of et in the interior of the basin however its low spatial resolution makes it difficult to reflect the gradual variation of et in local areas as a result there existed sharp boundaries in the east and south of qaidam basin both our et estimates and et ssebop were retrieved from modis products at 1 km resolution consequently these two products exhibited a more heterogeneous et distribution to be specific the standard deviation sd of our et estimates and et ssebop was 103 48 and 126 69 mm year by comparison the sd values of et gleam and et ma were only 84 44 and 87 80 mm year respectively therefore our et estimates had no superiority over et ssebop in capturing spatial details the advantage of our universal t s v i model over ssebop mainly lied in its daily continuity because the original et ssebop was created every 10 days senay et al 2020 4 3 et partitioning and water consumption efficiency fig 6 a shows the variations of annual soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t from 2001 to 2020 consistent with the et trend in fig 4a both e and t exhibited a slight increasing trend over the past twenty years specifically the annual average e was 168 77 mm year with an increasing rate of 0 09 mm year and the annual average t was 10 43 mm year with an increasing rate of 0 13 mm year it is obvious that the et increase in qaidam basin was controlled by plant transpiration in terms of speed however as an arid basin the total et in qaidam basin was dominated by soil evaporation in quantity as a result annual et and e was correlated significantly with each other with r as high as 0 99 in comparison the correlation coefficient between et and t was 0 74 and the r observed between e and t was 0 67 similarly the seasonal variations of e and t followed the same trend as total et both of them exhibited a trend similar to sinusoidal curves with the peak values arising in summer fig 6b this is understandable because both et and its components in arid basins are dominated by water availability however a close look at their seasonal variations shows that there was a time lag between t and e in peak values specifically e reached its peak value in june in twelve out of twenty years while t always reached its peak value in july this time lag is mainly caused by vegetation phenology according to liu et al 2021 the peak growth of vegetation can be indicated by the maximum ndvi ndvi max during the year the study performed by xu and yang 2014 based on modis ndvi product suggests that ndvi max in qaidam basin usually occurs at the end of july consequently our estimates reveal that the peak value of plant transpiration occurred in july rather than june fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of annual average e and t as well as their proportions in total et as an arid basin the vegetation coverage in qaidam basin only accounts for 4 of its total area fu et al 2018 consequently the spatial distribution of e generally followed the same trend as et which ranged from 19 61 to 405 66 mm year with an average of 168 77 mm year in comparison plant transpiration was mostly concentrated in the southeast of the basin with an obvious semi ring structure it ranged from 0 00 to 172 86 mm year with an average of 10 43 mm year because the total et was only divided into e and t two components it is natural that their proportions in total et were complementary in spatial patterns the e et ratio varied from 0 31 to 1 00 with an average of 0 94 and the t et ratio varied from 0 00 to 0 69 with an average of 0 06 due to the absence of vegetation cover t and t et with zero values were widely distributed in the interior of the basin according to van halsema and vincent 2012 and kool et al 2014 the function of e and t within ecosystems is distinctly different t is considered to be an effective water consumption that contributes directly to plant productivity whereas e is regarded as an undesirable component that causes a waste of water however there are also studies arguing that e supports vegetation growth by creating a more favorable micro climate kustas and norman 1999 xu et al 2021 on the basis of these literatures et at pixel scale was further divided into t e with t et larger than zero and e with t et close to zero which were designated as water consumption with high medium and low efficiency respectively the results show that their proportions at the basin scale were 6 49 and 45 respectively obviously there is a need to increase the proportion of productive water use in natural ecosystems 4 4 et features in different landscapes and their controls table 2 shows the average altitude et and t et in different landscapes as well as their et proportions in the whole basin the variations of their et with altitude are also presented in fig 8 as expected woodland and shrubland presented the largest et and t et among all landscapes which was particularly obvious for woodland its et and t et values were as high as 337 04 mm and 0 22 respectively however due to the limited distribution of woodland in qaidam basin its et proportion in the whole basin was only around 0 61 as for the et amount of the rest landscapes it generally followed the order that et in the surrounding mountains was higher than that in the interior specifically the largest et was observed in alpine vegetation 278 71 mm among the four landscapes in the surrounding mountains followed subsequently by alpine meadow 268 58 mm bare rock 217 39 mm and alpine grassland 217 15 mm in comparison et of the five landscapes in the interior followed the order salt crust 183 97 mm desert grassland 163 81 mm bare soil 86 20 mm gobi 84 65 mm sandy land 73 26 mm as we described in section 2 1 grassland is the dominant vegetation in arid and semi arid regions consequently desert grassland and alpine grassland accounted for the largest proportion of the total et which was 31 95 and 20 59 respectively it is noteworthy that both bare rock and salt crust were landscapes with relatively high et but low vegetation cover despite all this the reasons behind are different the high et of bare rock was caused by high precipitation in the mountain areas while the high et of salt crust was caused by river flow around salt lakes the low vegetation cover of bare rock and salt crust was also confirmed by their low t et values which were 0 01 and 0 00 respectively in addition zero t et values were also observed in three out of the rest four landscapes in the interior including sandy land gobi and bare soil the t et of the remaining landscapes followed the order woodland 0 22 shrubland 0 14 alpine meadow 0 12 alpine grassland 0 07 alpine vegetation 0 04 desert grassland 0 02 as an inland basin located in arid areas both precipitation and temperature correlate significantly with altitude in qaidam basin therefore it is natural that the spatial patterns of vegetation and et also have vertical zonality this can be identified simply by correlation analysis at pixel scale our annual average et estimates correlated significantly with precipitation retrieved from cmfd ndvi retrieved from mod13a2 and altitude retrieved from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with r values as 0 56 0 58 and 0 60 respectively in order to further investigate the vertical zonality of et distribution we divided the topography of qaidam basins into 21 altitude zones with an interval of 200 m table 3 presents the average precipitation et and t et in different altitude zones as well as their proportions of area precipitation and et in the whole basin the comparison of precipitation et and t et is also shown in fig 8 for illustration the results indicate that the precipitation retrieved from cmfd always increased gradually with altitude in contrast the variations of et with altitude increased first and then decreased with a peak value of 287 67 mm observed at altitudes of 4600 4800 m a slight upward trend of et was also observed at altitudes above 6200 m however this finding was only supported by three altitude zones with area proportion close to zero further studies are needed to confirm its rationality in comparison the obvious increasing trend of et and precipitation below 4800 m was confirmed by eleven altitude zones which accounted for 93 02 of qaidam basin s total area besides trend similarity fig 8 suggests that precipitation and et agreed well with each other in quantity at most of these eleven zones noticeable difference was only observed at three out of these eleven zones z1 z8 and z9 by contrast significant dissimilarity between precipitation and et was observed in both trend and quantity at the rest ten zones with altitude above 4800 m however due to the small area proportion of these ten zones the above dissimilarity did not lead to remarkable difference in their proportion to be specific the total precipitation and et of these ten zones only accounted for 11 42 and 9 76 of the whole basin respectively in comparison 88 58 of the precipitation and 90 24 of the total et occurred at the eleven zones with altitude below 4800 m with the largest et proportion 13 75 observed at altitudes of 2600 2800 m and the largest precipitation proportion 12 33 observed at altitudes of 4400 4600 m the reasons why et did not increase continuously with precipitation at high altitudes can be partly explained by the variations of t et like et the variations of t et with altitude also increased first and then decreased but the peak value of 0 09 was observed at altitudes of 4400 4600 m the decrease of t et at high altitudes means that the growth and distribution of vegetation started to be limited by the low temperature consequently et in these areas was mainly controlled by energy availability rather than water availability in return the precipitation surplus was converged to the interior of the basin in the form of runoff and then released to the atmosphere via the process of et that also explains why et was noticeably higher than precipitation at z1 where the altitude was lowest 5 conclusion a daily scale framework for continuous et mapping and partitioning was proposed in this study based on a universal solution of the traditional t s v i models specifically we transformed the t s v i feature space from regional to pixel scale on the basis of surface energy balance principle consequently the et estimation and partitioning was only related to the boundary conditions at pixel scale regardless of the t s v i configuration over the spatial domain the framework was demonstrated with modis products in qaidam basin during the period from 2001 to 2020 and the parameterization scheme was designed by using as much of the remote sensing observations as possible so that it could be applied to poorly gauged regions with few ground based observations the results show that our et estimates agreed well with three readily available et products and those retrieved from water balance analysis in comparison our universal t s v i model has unique advantages in spatial resolution and time continuity for et estimation and partitioning which enables it to capture the spatial details and temporal variations effectively to be specific the total et of qaidam basin presented a slight increasing trend from 2001 to 2020 with an annual average around 179 20 mm year and a slope of 0 22 mm year due to the insufficiency of vegetation cover the et in qaidam basin was dominated by soil evaporation its average multi year e et and t et ratios were 0 94 and 0 06 respectively both e and t exhibited seasonal variations similar to sinusoidal curves with the peak values arising in summer however because of vegetation phenology t always reached its peak value in july with one month lag in terms of spatial distribution the et in qaidam basin decreased generally from southeast to northwest and from surrounding mountains to the interior woodland presented the largest et and t et among all landscapes however due to the limited distribution of woodland in qaidam basin its et proportion in the whole basin was only around 0 61 by comparison the two dominant landscapes desert grassland and alpine grassland accounted for the largest proportion of the total et which was 31 95 and 20 59 respectively as an inland basin located in arid areas both precipitation and temperature correlate significantly with altitude in qaidam basin therefore it is natural that the spatial patterns of et also have vertical zonality our estimates indicate that the variations of et with altitude increased first and then decreased with a peak value of 287 67 mm observed at altitudes of 4600 4800 m with the further decrease of temperature in high mountains et started to be controlled by energy availability rather than water availability accordingly our results suggest that et did not increase continuously with precipitation in return the precipitation surplus at high altitudes was converged to the interior of the basin in the form of runoff and then released to the atmosphere via the process of et that explains why our et estimates were noticeably higher than precipitation at low altitudes the lack of ground truth benchmark in qaidam basin makes it difficult for us to evaluate the accuracy of our universal t s v i models effectively nevertheless the comparative analysis demonstrates that its accuracy has reached a level comparable to those achieved by other widely used et products on this basis our present study may contribute to the development of remote sensing based models for continuous et estimation and partitioning in poorly gauged basins it may also contribute to better understanding the terrestrial

2564,accurate estimation and partitioning of terrestrial evapotranspiration et is essential for understanding the hydrological cycle and water use efficiency at different scales such knowledge is particularly important for sustainable water resources management in arid ecosystems a daily scale framework for continuous et mapping and partitioning was proposed in this study based on a universal solution of the traditional t s v i models its essence is to transform the t s v i feature space from regional to pixel scale on the basis of surface energy balance principle consequently the et estimation and partitioning was only related to the boundary conditions at pixel scale regardless of the t s v i configuration over the spatial domain we demonstrated the framework with modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products in qaidam basin a poorly gauged basin with arid ecosystems in the qinghai tibet plateau in china the scheme was performed pixel by pixel using as much of the remote sensing observations as possible aiming at that it could be applied to other poorly gauged regions the comparative analysis indicates that our et estimates agreed well with three readily available et products and those retrieved from water balance analysis the advantages of our universal t s v i model mainly lie in its high spatial resolution and daily continuity which enables it to capture the spatial details and temporal variations more accurately the results show that our annual average et estimation from 2001 to 2020 was around 179 20 mm year which was very close to its annual average precipitation the annual average soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t was 168 77 and 10 43 mm year accounting for 94 and 6 of the total et respectively et in qaidam basin decreased generally from southeast to northwest and from surrounding mountains to the interior with significant vertical zonality consequently et of different landscapes followed the order woodland shrubland alpine vegetation alpine meadow bare rock alpine grassland salt crust desert grassland bare soil gobi sandy land as an arid basin the spatial distribution of et in qaidam basin was mainly controlled by precipitation however with the further decrease of temperature in high mountains et started to be controlled by energy availability rather than water availability accordingly the variations of our et estimates with altitude increased first and then decreased with a peak value of 287 67 mm observed at altitudes of 4600 4800 m keywords evapotranspiration estimation evapotranspiration partitioning poorly gauged basins arid ecosystems remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is the quantity of water released to the atmosphere via the process of soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t as a key hydrological component of the land surface et plays a vital role in the water energy and carbon cycles jung et al 2010 from a global point of view it returns about 65 of the precipitation to the atmosphere and utilizes more than half of the solar energy absorbed by the earth s surface oki and kanae 2006 bu et al 2021 mondal et al 2022 it has been established that agricultural irrigation accounts for around 70 of all the water used for human activities and that about 99 of the water resources in the cropland system is consumed through et kite 2000 food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2021 wolff et al 2022 therefore accurate characterization of the et process is not only important for further understanding the water and energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere but also for making decisions on sustainable agricultural water resources management xu et al 2021 awada et al 2022 chen et al 2022a jiang et al 2022 located in the northwest of china qaidam basin has its unique advantages in natural resources besides diverse salt lake resources qaidam basin abounds with fossil fuel and renewable energy such as wind and solar power as a result qaidam basin has earned it the alternative name of cornucopia however as a closed arid basin the looming water shortage becomes a critical factor restricting the sustainable development of qaidam basin on the one hand more water use is required to sustain local agricultural production and natural resources exploitation on the other hand the special geographical location and climate characteristics make qaidam basin an ecologically sensitive region to be specific qaidam basin is located in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau which is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate and environmental changes yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2022 in addition numerous studies suggest that the water deficit in arid and semi arid regions turns them into fragile ecosystems with land desertification xu et al 2020 bao et al 2022 for example the average et in arid ecosystems accounts for 95 of the precipitation far exceeding the ratio over other ecosystems wang et al 2014 stoy et al 2019 qubaja et al 2020 gao et al 2022 in contrast its transpiration fraction of et an indicator representing an ecosystem s transpiration efficiency is much lower zhang et al 2016 scott et al 2021 under this background accurate estimation of the total et and its components becomes particularly significant for understanding the terrestrial hydrological cycles and water use efficiency in arid ecosystems such knowledge is just urgently needed for water resources and environmental management in qaidam basin however due to the harsh natural environment qaidam basin is typically a poorly gauged basin to the best of our knowledge few in situ observations are available now to reflect the spatial patterns of its total et let alone its two components spatially distributed remote sensing based et models have proved to be useful in capturing the basin and global scale et fluxes which has distinct advantages for et estimation in ungauged regions yang et al 2013 sheffield et al 2018 talsma et al 2018 over the past few decades a series of models such as the penman monteith pm surface energy balance seb priestley taylor pt and statistical empirical models have been developed to retrieve et from satellite remote sensing rs images courault et al 2005 li et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 accordingly several rs based et products are available now making it possible for us to derive et information in most parts of the world nevertheless it must be noted that the et estimation or partitioning is always not easy for arid ecosystems take the widely used mod16 et product developed based on pm model for example mu et al 2007 2011 its et estimation is absent in most arid ecosystems such as sharan africa and qaidam basin apart from spatial discontinuity there are many common challenges to be addressed for all the above rs based et models for instance the land surface temperature t s and vegetation index vi retrieved from optical and thermal remote sensing are indispensable parameters for et mapping chen and liu 2020 however due to the contamination of cloud cover such parameters are only available under clear sky conditions making the continuous et estimation a challenging task many global et products adopt land surface models and reanalysis datasets to fill the above gaps as such global products are aimed to provide extensive et estimation it is expected that their uncertainties at the local scales are considerable douna et al 2021 zhu et al 2022 further work suggests that their performance at regional scales relies heavily on the availability of ground based observations which opens space to the development of new et models for local application barraza et al 2017 the lack of ground based observations in ungauged basins reinforces the need of developing et models at local scales that rely only on remote sensing data douna et al 2021 a promising method to solve above difficulties is the so called t s v i method which is developed based on an extension of the pt model carlson 2007 chen and liu 2020 the essence of this method is to derive evaporative fraction ef the fraction of available energy released as latent heat from the scatterplots of remotely sensed t s and vi collected in a given spatial domain the capability of reasonable et estimation with less complexity and fewer input parameters makes this method hold great potential application in ungauged basins stisen et al 2008 tang et al 2010 minacapilli et al 2016 carlson 2020 however traditional t s v i methods are only applicable when most of the study domain is under clear sky conditions so that enough pixels with valid t s and vi values can be collected the continuous monitoring of ef and et is still a challenging task thus the focus of this study was to quantify comprehensively the et process in qaidam basin based on a further development of the t s v i method specifically the goals of this study were to 1 develop a daily scale rs based framework for continuous et mapping and partitioning in poorly gauged basins 2 evaluate the performance of this framework through comparative and water balance analysis 3 analyze the spatial temporal patterns of total et and its two components in qaidam basin from 2001 to 2020 and 4 identify its et features in different landscapes as well as their influencing factors 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area qaidam basin is one of the four largest basins in china with an area of about 250 000 km2 it is situated in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau extending in longitude from 87 60 e to 99 50 e and in latitude from 34 50 n to 39 40 n fig 1 a as a closed inland basin it is surrounded by kunlun mountains in the south altun mountain in the northwest and qilian mountains in the northeast consequently the average altitude of qaidam basin is around 3600 m which is highest among china s four largest basins its climate is typical of a plateau continental climate characterized by low precipitation and strong solar radiation wei et al 2021 the annual precipitation decreases gradually from southeast to northwest with an average below 200 mm year the mean annual air temperature ranges from 1 5 to 4 8 and the average pan evaporation ranges from 1974 to 3000 mm year bibi et al 2019 the land cover in qaidam basin is dominated by arid landscapes which have very limited distribution of shrubland and woodland fig 1b the shrubs are mainly distributed in valleys and riversides around the middle and lower reaches of some large rivers and coniferous forest is only scattered in sunny slope of the mountains in the east because both precipitation and temperature correlate significantly with altitude the vegetation in qaidam basin presents vertical zonality clearly zhu et al 2011 to be specific the interior is generally covered with bare soil because of little precipitation vegetation is only scattered around inland rivers lakes and alluvial fans while salt crust sandy land and gobi are widely distributed zhu et al 2012 it is well known that grassland is the dominant vegetation in arid and semi arid regions as for qaidam basin it mainly includes desert grassland and alpine grassland two types the former is widely distributed in low mountains and the latter is scattered mostly in mountains with altitude higher than 4000 m besides alpine grassland alpine meadow is another dominant vegetation type in the high altitude areas of kunlun and qilian mountains but it has stricter demand for water supply the vegetation coverage decreases with the further increase of altitude subsequently han et al 2021a specifically alpine talus and cushion vegetation is sparsely distributed in high mountains of qaidan basin most of these areas are occupied by bare rock because of low temperature with the further decrease of temperature in high mountains the landscapes are dominated by glacier and snow without vegetation coverage 2 2 materials used for et estimation the remote sensing observations used in this study for et mapping come from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis an instrument onboard nasa s terra satellite launched in 1999 terra is in a circular sun synchronous polar orbit with daytime overpass time around 10 30 local time seven modis version 6 products from 2001 to 2020 were adopted for et estimation including daily land surface temperature product at 1 km resolution mod11a1 daily solar zenith angle product at 1 km resolution mod03 daily atmosphere profile product at 5 km resolution mod07 l2 daily cloud product at 5 km resolution mod06 l2 daily albedo product at 500 m resolution mcd43a3 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product at 1 km resolution mod13a2 and 8 day leaf area index lai product at 500 m resolution mod15a2h all products were transformed into world geodetic system 1984 with 1 km pixel size based on mrt and heg tools provided by modis website to coincide with other daily modis products the 16 day ndvi and 8 day lai products were time series smoothed and interpolated linearly to the daily values using the locally adjusted cubic spline capping method proposed by chen et al 2006 ground based meteorological observations are also indispensable for et estimation hourly air temperature t a relative humidity rh and wind speed w s measurements from the national meteorological information centre nmic of china meteorological administration cma were adopted in this study t a and rh measurements were utilized for the estimation of dew point temperature t d through the combination of modis observations so only the measurements observed at the time that approximates most the overpass time of terra satellite were used in this work it should be noted that nmic currently has more than two thousand meteorological stations on a national scale however there are only nine stations available for qaidam basin the density of which is much lower than the national average level fig 1a 2 3 materials used for et evaluation the lack of in situ observations also makes it difficult to evaluate et estimation effectively in ungauged basins consequently the accuracy of our et estimates from 2001 to 2020 was evaluated by comparative analysis four ancillary datasets were adopted for reference which were classified into two categories according to their utilities the first category includes three readily available et products for direct comparison the first one is the gleam global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology et dataset which is generated by a set of algorithms that separately estimate different et components exclusively from satellite forcing data miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 it provides global et estimates at both daily and monthly scales from 1980 to 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 although there are several global et products to choose from the good performance of gleam has been confirmed at both global and chinese national scales in previous studies bai and liu 2018 zhu et al 2022 the second et product is developed by ma et al 2019 based on a calibration free diagnostic and benchmarking tool of the complementary relationship this product is released by the national tibetan plateau data center ntpdc https data tpdc ac cn zh hans it provides nationwide et estimates at monthly scale from 1982 to 2017 with a spatial resolution of 0 1 apart from superiority in algorithms their meteorological forcing inputs are retrieved from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd which makes this et product perform well in china the third et product is produced using the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay et al 2013 for 2003 to present its original algorithms are designed based on sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and metric allen et al 2007 models the early warning and environmental monitoring program provides multi temporal ssebop et product with a spatial resolution of 1 km https earlywarning usgs gov fews product 461 the key inputs of this global product include modis and gdas global data assimilation system data streams the second category of our ancillary datasets is for water balance analysis at basin scale which includes precipitation and terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa two datasets the monthly gridded precipitation from 2001 to 2018 was retrieved from the cmfd this dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 1 is produced by yang and he 2019 through fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis dataset and in situ observation data at weather stations the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twsa dataset was adopted in this study to account for water storage change over qaidam basin the level 3 product at 0 5 spatial resolution was downloaded from the grace tellus website https grace jpl nasa gov in order to identify et features in different landscapes the vegetation map of china 1 1 000 000 supplied by the ntpdc was adopted as landscape mask hou 2019 it was produced by a team of over 250 scientist based on field surveys lasting around 10 years su et al 2022 thirteen landscapes were identified from this vegetation dataset including water woodland shrubland alpine vegetation alpine meadow alpine grassland desert grassland bare rock gobi bare soil salt crust sandy land and other types fig 1b 3 methodology in this paper we first calculated the total et at pixel scale using a single source rs based model and then partitioned it into soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t based on the theoretical framework of the dual source et model according to the definition of evaporative fraction ef et of a given pixel can be calculated as the product of available energy and ef the available energy is the vector sum of net radiation flux r n w m 2 and soil heat flux g w m 2 due to the counteraction between daytime and nighttime soil heat flux g at daily scale is usually assumed to be negligible for et estimation cammalleri et al 2012 samain et al 2012 thus daily available energy is totally determined by r n in this work r n under all sky conditions was estimated through the combination of bisht and bras 2010 and rivas and cormora 2013 and ef was retrieved from modis products based on our further development of the traditional t s v i models fig 2 shows the flowchart of our daily scale framework for continuous et mapping and partitioning based on a universal solution of the traditional t s v i models its specific procedures are explained step by step as below 3 1 net radiation estimation under all sky conditions 3 1 1 instantaneous net radiation estimation for clear sky pixels according to bisht and bras 2010 net radiation at the land surface for clear sky pixels r n clear w m 2 could be expressed in terms of its components as follows 1 r n clear r s clear 1 α ε s ε a σ t a 4 ε s σ t s 4 2 r s clear s 0 cos 2 θ 1 085 cos θ e a 2 7 c o s θ 10 3 0 2 where r s clear w m 2 is the downwelling shortwave radiation α is the land surface albedo ε s and ε a are the surface and air emissivity respectively σ 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 is the stefan boltzmann constant s 0 1367 w m 2 is the solar constant at the top of atmosphere θ r a d is the solar zenith angle t s k and t a k are the land surface and air temperature respectively and e a h p a is the near surface vapor pressure which was computed from t d k using the clausius clapeyron equation rogers and yau 1989 in the above equations both t s and ε s were retrieved from mod11a1 product α and θ were retrieved from mcd43a3 and mod03 respectively t a was estimated from mod07 l2 and mod06 products based on the method proposed by zhu et al 2017a and t d was estimated using the method proposed by bisht and bras 2010 through the combination of mod07 l2 product and in situ observations ε a was parameterized from e a and t a using a scheme proposed by prata 1996 3 1 2 instantaneous net radiation estimation for cloudy pixels net radiation for cloudy pixels r n cloudy was computed in terms of its components as 3 r n cloudy r s cloudy 1 α ε s ε a σ t a 4 ε s ε c 1 ε a σ t c 4 ε s σ t s 4 4 r s cloudy r s clear 1 f cc r s cloud f cc 5 r s cloud τ m s 0 c o s θ 0 3 1 τ m s 0 c o s θ where ε c t c k and f cloud represent the cloud emissivity cloud temperature and fractional cloud coverage respectively all these three variables were available in mod06 product τ 0 27 is the atmospheric transparency under extremely cloudy conditions yu et al 2021 m is the optical air mass which was parameterized from surface pressure and θ using the scheme proposed by kocifaj 2016 two terms need to be distinguished here r s cloudy w m 2 represents the actual downwelling shortwave radiation for cloudy pixels while r s cloud w m 2 represents the ideal downwelling shortwave radiation under extremely cloudy conditions f cloud 1 it is obvious that r n cloudy was calculated on the basis of r n clear on the one hand the downwelling shortwave radiation was estimated as a linear combination of the fluxes between the extreme cases of completely clear and cloudy conditions on the other hand the downwelling longwave radiation was estimated as a combination of downwelling radiation from near surface conditions and clouds as proposed by forman and margulis 2007 3 1 3 net radiation estimation at daily scale with the instantaneous net radiation r n i n s w m 2 calculated above the empirical formula proposed by rivas and cormora 2013 was adopted for net radiation estimation at daily scale r n d w m 2 as 6 r n d 0 43 r n i n s 54 3 2 evaporative fraction model for clear sky pixels 3 2 1 basic framework of the t s v i models ef in the t s v i models was estimated based on an extension of the pt equation as follows 7 ef δ t a δ t a γ where γ k p a k 1 is the psychrometric constant δ k p a k 1 as a function of temperature is the gradient of saturated vapor pressure to t a and is a dimensionless parameter accounting for aerodynamic and canopy resistances jiang and islam 1999 zhao and liu 2014 tomás et al 2014 in traditional t s v i models is usually estimated from the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi proposed by sandholt et al 2002 by contrast it was retrieved from a modified version of tvdi mtvdi in our previous universal triangle method zhu et al 2017b specifically for the soil surface soil was parameterized from mtvdi following komatsu 2003 and wang et al 2006 as 8 soil 1 26 1 e x p m t v d i 1 following the assumption that the radiometric temperature of a full vegetated canopy t canopy is in equilibrium with the temperature of the air within the canopy for the full cover vegetation canopy is always close to its maximum value canopy 1 26 consequently for a mixed pixel was interpolated linearly between canopy and soil by using fractional vegetation coverage f vc as the weight 9 soil 1 f vc canopy f vc 10 f vc ndvi ndvi soil ndvi canopy ndvi soil 2 f vc in this paper was retrieved from ndvi using the methodology proposed by gillies et al 1997 ndvi canopy and ndvi soil represent the ndvi values of full cover vegetation and bare soil respectively following zhu et al 2013 ndvi canopy was set as 0 86 and ndvi soil was set as 0 05 3 2 2 a universal solution of the t s v i models the t s v i models have been used widely for ef estimation jiang and islam 2001 garcia et al 2014 tang and li 2017 petropoulos et al 2020 it derives spatially distributed ef by using a contextual interpretation of the relationship between t s and ndvi two easily remotely sensed surface variables a central assumption involved in the t s v i method is that if there exist sufficient pixels representing a broad range of f vc and soil moisture sm in a given spatial domain the envelope of these pixels could constitute a physically meaningful triangle or trapezoid carlson et al 2007 petropoulos et al 2009 chen and liu 2020 the logic behind it is that low t s values generally correspond to high f vc values for pixels where large et rates would occur and vice versa long and singh 2012 obviously the original t s v i method only works when most of the study domain is under clear sky conditions so that enough pixels can be collected minacapilli et al 2016 carlson et al 2020 in addition uniform topographic and atmospheric conditions are also required to guarantee that the spatial variations of t s are mainly controlled by sm and f vc long et al 2012 tomás et al 2014 the combination of these two aspects makes it difficult to retrieve continuous ef from the traditional t s v i feature space especially for regions like qaidam basin with heterogeneous topographic and atmospheric conditions to solve these difficulties a universal triangle method was proposed in our previous work by transforming the t s v i feature space from regional to pixel scale zhu et al 2017c consequently the retrieval of ef was only related to the boundary conditions at pixel scale regardless of the t s v i configuration over the spatial domain nonetheless it adopted the regional average and maximum air temperature as the initial inputs for each pixel which is still not applicable to large areas with heterogeneous land surface in view of this we incorporated the temperature correction scheme proposed by szilagyi et al 2014 2017 into our previous universal t s v i models in this paper for continuous ef estimation in qaidam basin the specific procedures and logics behind are listed as below both tvdi and mtvdi are derived by using linear interpolation procedures in previous t s v i models sandholt et al 2002 leng et al 2017 zhu et al 2017b ryu et al 2021 consequently the success of this method depends heavily on the correct choice of the two extreme points used for interpolation which are defined by the land surface temperature under extreme sm conditions sun et al 2012 yang et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2017 chen et al 2022b in this study the dry point with the lowest et rate was defined as the maximum surface temperature the bare soil can reach under extremely water stressed conditions t dry k and the wet point with the largest et rate was defined as the surface temperature of bare soil under unlimited water access conditions t wet k assuming that sm availability decreases linearly from wet point to dry point the sm state at pixel scale was determined based on the position of its actual soil temperature t soil k between t dry and t wet as 11 mtvdi t soil t wet t dry t wet the retrieval of t soil for a mixed pixel has been investigated by numerous studies in our universal t s v i triangle models it was determined as 12 t soil t s f vc t canopy 1 f vc t s f vc t a 1 f vc the logic behind eq 12 is that t s at pixel scale is a weighted sum of t soil and t canopy and that t canopy is in equilibrium with t a within the canopy due to evaporative cooling effect norman et al 1995 anderson et al 2007 nieto et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 the determination of t wet is straightforward in previous studies for example the minimum t s in an image was adopted as a proxy for t wet by sandholt et al 2002 for the development of tvdi and the regional average t a served as a proxy for t wet in long and singh 2012 and zhu et al 2017c for the derivation of the theoretical boundary conditions as we mentioned earlier in this lecture the above practice makes sense for uniform topographic and atmospheric conditions but it is not applicable to the case of qaidam basin in this paper the wet bulb temperature t wb deduced by szilagyi 2014 was adopted to substitute for t wet which is expressed as 13 t wet t wb γ t a t d δ t d γ δ t d t wb as a proxy for t wet has at least two advantages firstly t wb is the lowest temperature that can be reached under current ambient conditions by evaporative cooling effect only the physical meaning of which is very close to t wet secondly it can be computed pixel by pixel based on conventional meteorological observations which is feasible for large scale applications the theoretical solution of t dry has been well described in zhang et al 2008 sun et al 2012 and long and singh 2012 inspired by these studies t dry at pixel scale has been deduced in our previous universal t s v i triangle models based on the land surface energy balance principle zhu et al 2017c we would not present its deduction process in detail in this study and just give its numerical solution formula as 14 t dry r s clear 1 α sd 0 95 ε a σ t a s d 4 0 95 σ t a s d 4 3 8 σ t a s d 3 ρ c p 0 685 r a s d t a s d where ρ is air density c p is the specific heat of air under constant pressure and r a is the aerodynamic resistance which was estimated from wind speed using a simple method developed by brutsaert 1982 the subscript sd denotes that these parameters are only applicable for dry and bare soil a close look at eq 14 indicates that it is not ready for the practical estimation of t dry at pixel scale because the air temperature over dry and bare soil t a s d is unknown yet the regional maximum t a was adopted as a substitute for t a s d in sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017c for plain areas but it is not the case in qaidam basin in order to apply eq 14 at pixel scale t a s d in this paper was determined based on the maximum possible evaporation e pmax concept proposed by szilagyi et al 2017 specifically e pmax is the evaporation rate that can be reached when the air becomes void of any moisture and thus t a s d can be derived as the intercept of the adiabatic line defined by t a and e a 15 t a s d e t wb t a t wb e t wb e a t wb where e h p a is the saturation vapor pressure retrieved from the clausius clapeyron equation rogers and yau 1989 3 3 daily et estimation and partitioning under all sky conditions 3 3 1 daily et estimation under all sky conditions as we mentioned earlier in this lecture the traditional spatial domain based t s v i models are only applicable when most of the selected domain is under clear sky conditions by contrast the universal solution scheme proposed in this paper was performed pixel by pixel regardless of the t s v i configuration over the spatial domain which makes it possible to conduct a continuous estimation of ef note that the continuous here means that ef of all pixels with valid remote sensing observations can be retrieved from this scheme however due to the data missing problem caused by cloud occurrence our universal t s v i model is still not ready for the ef estimation under extremely cloudy conditions there is a need to interpolate ef between the dates of two successive ef estimates according to delogu et al 2012 and alfieri et al 2017 ef on intermediate cloudy days was interpolated linearly between the closest previous and following clear sky days as 16 ef cloud k ef clear i ef clear j ef clear i j i k i where ef cloud k is the ef to be interpolated on doy day number of a year k and ef clear i and ef clear j are the clear sky rs based ef estimates on doy i and j respectively there are two reasons for the selection of this simple linear interpolation method firstly the comparative study of alfieri et al 2017 suggests that more computational complex interpolation methods present no substantive advantage over linear regression secondly the study of delogu et al 2012 shows that the linear interpolation algorithm performs well enough to capture the seasonal variations of ef the above two aspects particularly hold true for arid areas like qaidam basin because of the low frequency of cloud occurrence once ef has been estimated and interpolated under all sky conditions et at daily scale et d m m d 1 could be calculated continuously by the combination of ef and r n d as follows 17 et d c et r n d e f where c et 0 0353 is a constant to transform the unit of et from w m 2 to m m d 1 3 3 2 daily et partitioning in the t s v i models although most of the t s v i models pertain to the one source scheme they have great potential to discriminate vegetation transpiration t from soil evaporation e several two source models have been developed based on the t s v i feature space in previous studies long and singh 2012 tang et al 2017 chen et al 2022b inspired by these studies and others et partitioning in this study was achieved through a specific estimation of e and t was determined as the residual given r n estimation in section 3 1 net radiation at the soil surface r n s o i l w m 2 could be computed as 18 r n s o i l r n e k r n l a i where k r n 0 60 according to purdy et al 2018 ef for soil evaporation ef soil was determined through the combination of eqs 7 and 8 as 19 ef soil 1 26 1 e x p m t v d i 1 δ t a δ t a γ consequently the partitioning of et estimates between e and t was expressed as 20 e 1 26 r n e k r n l a i 1 e x p m t v d i 1 δ t a δ t a γ 21 t e t e 3 4 model evaluation approach due to the lack of ground based et observations the performance of our above et model was evaluated by comparison with three readily available et products pearson correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and mean bias error mbe were selected as evaluation metrics which are defined as 22 r i 1 n x i x x i x i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 23 mae 1 n i 1 n x i x i 24 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 25 mbe 1 n i 1 n x i x i where x i and x are our estimated and the average estimated et values during the evaluation period and x i and x are the corresponding reference and the average reference et values respectively as a closed inland basin qaidam basin allows no surface outflow and retains water in a landlocked storage that equilibrates through evaporation wang et al 2018 bibi et al 2019 wei et al 2021 accordingly et at basin scale could be determined based on water balance analysis as 26 et p δ s where δ s represents change in total water storage eq 26 provides important reference data for et evaluation at basin scale which is particularly valuable for ungauged areas in this study the above water balance analysis was conducted at monthly scale and δ s was derived from grace twsa following the numerical differentiation algorithm described in xu et al 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of et models in the study area due to the lack of ground based observations the performance of our et model was evaluated indirectly through comparative analysis specifically the results of our et estimation from 2001 to 2020 were compared with three readily available et products namely et ma et gleam and et ssebop as well as those retrieved from grace observations based on water balance analysis et grace gleam provides both daily and monthly et estimates but et ma et ssebop and grace only provide monthly datasets therefore all the comparisons were performed at monthly scale for consistency due to the difference in time span of above datasets it should also be noted that the sample size for comparison varies with products the comparison of our et estimates with et ma was performed from 2001 to 2017 the comparison with et gleam was performed from 2001 to 2020 and the comparison with et ssebop was performed from 2003 to 2020 the water balance analysis was conducted from 2003 to 2018 however due to satellite batteries and accelerometer failure grace observations are absent in individual months in addition the errors and uncertainties involved in the grace based water balance analysis would lead to negative et estimates during water stressed seasons pan et al 2017 schoups and nasseri 2021 all these anomalies have been eliminated in our comparison as a result the sample size of et grace is much less than 192 the evaluation metrics at basin scale are presented in fig 3 the comparison indicates that our monthly et estimates agreed well with all three et products with r values higher than 0 90 however all the three other statistics suggest that the best agreement was observed when the estimates were compared with et gleam the mae rmse and mbe achieved by et gleam comparison were 3 14 4 39 and 0 86 mm month while those achieved by et ma comparison and et ssebop comparison were 3 89 5 53 1 09 and 4 31 5 80 0 86 mm month respectively obviously the model proposed in this paper underestimated et ma and overestimated et gleam and et ssebop slightly in order to further investigate the performance of different et models the et estimation produced by water balance analysis was adopted as the benchmark table 1 the results show that the accuracy of different et estimates varies with statistical metrics compared with the two et products with coarse spatial resolution the values of mae and rmse indicate that the best and worst accuracy was achieved by et gleam and et ma respectively to be specific the mae of et gleam and et ma was 6 18 and 6 46 mm month and the rmse of these two models was 8 24 and 9 00 mm month respectively in contrast the mae and rmse of our et estimates were 6 41 and 8 93 mm month both of which took an intermediate position between these two products however when judged from mbe the performance of et ma and et gleam has been reversed the complementary relationship et model proposed by ma et al 2019 achieved a slight systematic error with mbe as small as 0 12 mm month while the mbe of gleam model was 1 61 mm month suggesting a relatively significant underestimation in et by contrast the mbe achieved by our universal t s v i model was 0 46 mm month which was still located in the middle of these two products both et ssebop and our et estimates were achieved with 1 km pixel size which means that these two products are more comparable in performance the results show that et ssebop was superior to our et estimates in terms of r and rmse but our t s v i model performed better when judged from mae and mbe in general the above comparison indicates that the model proposed in this paper showed no advantage in accuracy over the three reference et datasets as a matter of fact the lack of ground truth benchmark in qaidam basin even makes it impossible for us to evaluate the accuracy of different et models effectively nevertheless it at least demonstrates that the accuracy produced by our t s v i model has reached a level comparable to those achieved by other widely used et products on this basis the advantage of our t s v i model over these products lies in its high spatial resolution and daily continuity of et estimates which enables us to gain a better understanding of the et patterns in qaidam basin 4 2 spatial and temporal patterns of total et fig 4 a shows the variations of our annual et estimates from 2001 to 2020 et gleam et ma et ssebop and precipitation provided by the ntpdc are also presented for comparison the results show that a slight decreasing trend was observed in precipitation from 2001 to 2018 with an annual average around 181 82 mm year and a slope of 2 13 mm year however all the four et estimates show a slight increasing trend over the same period specifically the annual average of our et estimates et gleam et ma and et ssebop were 179 20 168 80 190 87 and 168 46 mm year and their increasing rates were 0 22 2 50 0 97 and 0 66 mm year respectively it is obvious that our et estimates are closest to precipitation in amount this makes sense because water storage change at basin scale is typically assumed to be negligible on multiyear time scales which particularly holds true for arid basins hu et al 2021 the combination of this assumption and eq 26 suggests that the annual average et of a closed basin is theoretically equal to its annual average precipitation in addition the similarity of our et estimates with precipitation was also confirmed by correlation analysis in terms of inter annual variations significant correlation was observed between our et estimates and precipitation with r as high as 0 60 to be specific the variations of precipitation from 2001 to 2018 present seven obvious peaks 2002 2005 2007 2010 2012 2015 and 2018 and seven obvious valleys 2001 2003 2006 2008 2011 2014 and 2017 respectively our et estimates captured six out of seven peaks 2002 2005 2007 2012 2015 and 2018 and five out of seven valleys 2001 2003 2006 2008 and 2014 in contrast precipitation was not significantly correlated with et gleam et ma or et ssebop their respective correlation coefficients with precipitation were only 0 21 0 32 and 0 44 as for the reasons why the variation trend of et and precipitation is opposite several studies highlighted the role of glacier meltwater and permafrost degradation in et increase over the tibet plateau yang et al 2020 han et al 2021b lin et al 2021 consequently the increase trend of et in qaidam basin is probably caused by these factors as snow melt and glacier retreat in the tibet plateau is accelerating lau et al 2010 wang et al 2022 fig 4b presents the boxplots of our monthly et estimates from 2001 to 2020 like in most areas of china the seasonal variations of et in qiadam basin followed a sinusoidal trend over 12 months with the largest and lowest values arising in july 31 53 mm month and december 1 62 mm month judging from the average over twenty years the et in spring summer autumn and winter accounted for 28 02 49 71 18 50 and 3 77 of the annual total respectively the inter annual fluctuation of monthly et followed the same trend with their et quantity both the overall and interquartile range of these boxplots indicate that the fluctuation amplitude of monthly et followed the order summer spring autumn winter the spatial distribution of our annual average et estimates from 2001 to 2020 is presented in fig 5 the annual average of et gleam from 2001 to 2020 et ma from 2001 to 2017 and et ssebop from 2003 to 2020 is also presented for comparison note that the universal t s v i model proposed in this paper was designed for terrestrial et estimates therefore the water bodies in fig 5a have been eliminated using a mask retrieved from mod44w product it is obvious that the et decreasing trend from southeast to northwest and from surrounding mountains to the interior has been captured by all products however a close look at these maps suggests that our et estimates have significant advantages over et ma and et gleam in capturing details to be specific the spatial distribution of et ma accorded well with the altitudes in fig 1a consequently it was homogeneous on a relatively small scale with little ability to reflect et variations caused by non topographic factors this can be explained by the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd adopted in et ma the cmfd was developed through fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ observations from approximately 700 stations ma et al 2019 however due to the low density of meteorological stations in western china great significance was attached to high resolution elevation data in the interpolation of air temperature and pressure yang and he 2019 he et al 2020 by comparison et gleam was capable of reflecting high value zones of et in the interior of the basin however its low spatial resolution makes it difficult to reflect the gradual variation of et in local areas as a result there existed sharp boundaries in the east and south of qaidam basin both our et estimates and et ssebop were retrieved from modis products at 1 km resolution consequently these two products exhibited a more heterogeneous et distribution to be specific the standard deviation sd of our et estimates and et ssebop was 103 48 and 126 69 mm year by comparison the sd values of et gleam and et ma were only 84 44 and 87 80 mm year respectively therefore our et estimates had no superiority over et ssebop in capturing spatial details the advantage of our universal t s v i model over ssebop mainly lied in its daily continuity because the original et ssebop was created every 10 days senay et al 2020 4 3 et partitioning and water consumption efficiency fig 6 a shows the variations of annual soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t from 2001 to 2020 consistent with the et trend in fig 4a both e and t exhibited a slight increasing trend over the past twenty years specifically the annual average e was 168 77 mm year with an increasing rate of 0 09 mm year and the annual average t was 10 43 mm year with an increasing rate of 0 13 mm year it is obvious that the et increase in qaidam basin was controlled by plant transpiration in terms of speed however as an arid basin the total et in qaidam basin was dominated by soil evaporation in quantity as a result annual et and e was correlated significantly with each other with r as high as 0 99 in comparison the correlation coefficient between et and t was 0 74 and the r observed between e and t was 0 67 similarly the seasonal variations of e and t followed the same trend as total et both of them exhibited a trend similar to sinusoidal curves with the peak values arising in summer fig 6b this is understandable because both et and its components in arid basins are dominated by water availability however a close look at their seasonal variations shows that there was a time lag between t and e in peak values specifically e reached its peak value in june in twelve out of twenty years while t always reached its peak value in july this time lag is mainly caused by vegetation phenology according to liu et al 2021 the peak growth of vegetation can be indicated by the maximum ndvi ndvi max during the year the study performed by xu and yang 2014 based on modis ndvi product suggests that ndvi max in qaidam basin usually occurs at the end of july consequently our estimates reveal that the peak value of plant transpiration occurred in july rather than june fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of annual average e and t as well as their proportions in total et as an arid basin the vegetation coverage in qaidam basin only accounts for 4 of its total area fu et al 2018 consequently the spatial distribution of e generally followed the same trend as et which ranged from 19 61 to 405 66 mm year with an average of 168 77 mm year in comparison plant transpiration was mostly concentrated in the southeast of the basin with an obvious semi ring structure it ranged from 0 00 to 172 86 mm year with an average of 10 43 mm year because the total et was only divided into e and t two components it is natural that their proportions in total et were complementary in spatial patterns the e et ratio varied from 0 31 to 1 00 with an average of 0 94 and the t et ratio varied from 0 00 to 0 69 with an average of 0 06 due to the absence of vegetation cover t and t et with zero values were widely distributed in the interior of the basin according to van halsema and vincent 2012 and kool et al 2014 the function of e and t within ecosystems is distinctly different t is considered to be an effective water consumption that contributes directly to plant productivity whereas e is regarded as an undesirable component that causes a waste of water however there are also studies arguing that e supports vegetation growth by creating a more favorable micro climate kustas and norman 1999 xu et al 2021 on the basis of these literatures et at pixel scale was further divided into t e with t et larger than zero and e with t et close to zero which were designated as water consumption with high medium and low efficiency respectively the results show that their proportions at the basin scale were 6 49 and 45 respectively obviously there is a need to increase the proportion of productive water use in natural ecosystems 4 4 et features in different landscapes and their controls table 2 shows the average altitude et and t et in different landscapes as well as their et proportions in the whole basin the variations of their et with altitude are also presented in fig 8 as expected woodland and shrubland presented the largest et and t et among all landscapes which was particularly obvious for woodland its et and t et values were as high as 337 04 mm and 0 22 respectively however due to the limited distribution of woodland in qaidam basin its et proportion in the whole basin was only around 0 61 as for the et amount of the rest landscapes it generally followed the order that et in the surrounding mountains was higher than that in the interior specifically the largest et was observed in alpine vegetation 278 71 mm among the four landscapes in the surrounding mountains followed subsequently by alpine meadow 268 58 mm bare rock 217 39 mm and alpine grassland 217 15 mm in comparison et of the five landscapes in the interior followed the order salt crust 183 97 mm desert grassland 163 81 mm bare soil 86 20 mm gobi 84 65 mm sandy land 73 26 mm as we described in section 2 1 grassland is the dominant vegetation in arid and semi arid regions consequently desert grassland and alpine grassland accounted for the largest proportion of the total et which was 31 95 and 20 59 respectively it is noteworthy that both bare rock and salt crust were landscapes with relatively high et but low vegetation cover despite all this the reasons behind are different the high et of bare rock was caused by high precipitation in the mountain areas while the high et of salt crust was caused by river flow around salt lakes the low vegetation cover of bare rock and salt crust was also confirmed by their low t et values which were 0 01 and 0 00 respectively in addition zero t et values were also observed in three out of the rest four landscapes in the interior including sandy land gobi and bare soil the t et of the remaining landscapes followed the order woodland 0 22 shrubland 0 14 alpine meadow 0 12 alpine grassland 0 07 alpine vegetation 0 04 desert grassland 0 02 as an inland basin located in arid areas both precipitation and temperature correlate significantly with altitude in qaidam basin therefore it is natural that the spatial patterns of vegetation and et also have vertical zonality this can be identified simply by correlation analysis at pixel scale our annual average et estimates correlated significantly with precipitation retrieved from cmfd ndvi retrieved from mod13a2 and altitude retrieved from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm with r values as 0 56 0 58 and 0 60 respectively in order to further investigate the vertical zonality of et distribution we divided the topography of qaidam basins into 21 altitude zones with an interval of 200 m table 3 presents the average precipitation et and t et in different altitude zones as well as their proportions of area precipitation and et in the whole basin the comparison of precipitation et and t et is also shown in fig 8 for illustration the results indicate that the precipitation retrieved from cmfd always increased gradually with altitude in contrast the variations of et with altitude increased first and then decreased with a peak value of 287 67 mm observed at altitudes of 4600 4800 m a slight upward trend of et was also observed at altitudes above 6200 m however this finding was only supported by three altitude zones with area proportion close to zero further studies are needed to confirm its rationality in comparison the obvious increasing trend of et and precipitation below 4800 m was confirmed by eleven altitude zones which accounted for 93 02 of qaidam basin s total area besides trend similarity fig 8 suggests that precipitation and et agreed well with each other in quantity at most of these eleven zones noticeable difference was only observed at three out of these eleven zones z1 z8 and z9 by contrast significant dissimilarity between precipitation and et was observed in both trend and quantity at the rest ten zones with altitude above 4800 m however due to the small area proportion of these ten zones the above dissimilarity did not lead to remarkable difference in their proportion to be specific the total precipitation and et of these ten zones only accounted for 11 42 and 9 76 of the whole basin respectively in comparison 88 58 of the precipitation and 90 24 of the total et occurred at the eleven zones with altitude below 4800 m with the largest et proportion 13 75 observed at altitudes of 2600 2800 m and the largest precipitation proportion 12 33 observed at altitudes of 4400 4600 m the reasons why et did not increase continuously with precipitation at high altitudes can be partly explained by the variations of t et like et the variations of t et with altitude also increased first and then decreased but the peak value of 0 09 was observed at altitudes of 4400 4600 m the decrease of t et at high altitudes means that the growth and distribution of vegetation started to be limited by the low temperature consequently et in these areas was mainly controlled by energy availability rather than water availability in return the precipitation surplus was converged to the interior of the basin in the form of runoff and then released to the atmosphere via the process of et that also explains why et was noticeably higher than precipitation at z1 where the altitude was lowest 5 conclusion a daily scale framework for continuous et mapping and partitioning was proposed in this study based on a universal solution of the traditional t s v i models specifically we transformed the t s v i feature space from regional to pixel scale on the basis of surface energy balance principle consequently the et estimation and partitioning was only related to the boundary conditions at pixel scale regardless of the t s v i configuration over the spatial domain the framework was demonstrated with modis products in qaidam basin during the period from 2001 to 2020 and the parameterization scheme was designed by using as much of the remote sensing observations as possible so that it could be applied to poorly gauged regions with few ground based observations the results show that our et estimates agreed well with three readily available et products and those retrieved from water balance analysis in comparison our universal t s v i model has unique advantages in spatial resolution and time continuity for et estimation and partitioning which enables it to capture the spatial details and temporal variations effectively to be specific the total et of qaidam basin presented a slight increasing trend from 2001 to 2020 with an annual average around 179 20 mm year and a slope of 0 22 mm year due to the insufficiency of vegetation cover the et in qaidam basin was dominated by soil evaporation its average multi year e et and t et ratios were 0 94 and 0 06 respectively both e and t exhibited seasonal variations similar to sinusoidal curves with the peak values arising in summer however because of vegetation phenology t always reached its peak value in july with one month lag in terms of spatial distribution the et in qaidam basin decreased generally from southeast to northwest and from surrounding mountains to the interior woodland presented the largest et and t et among all landscapes however due to the limited distribution of woodland in qaidam basin its et proportion in the whole basin was only around 0 61 by comparison the two dominant landscapes desert grassland and alpine grassland accounted for the largest proportion of the total et which was 31 95 and 20 59 respectively as an inland basin located in arid areas both precipitation and temperature correlate significantly with altitude in qaidam basin therefore it is natural that the spatial patterns of et also have vertical zonality our estimates indicate that the variations of et with altitude increased first and then decreased with a peak value of 287 67 mm observed at altitudes of 4600 4800 m with the further decrease of temperature in high mountains et started to be controlled by energy availability rather than water availability accordingly our results suggest that et did not increase continuously with precipitation in return the precipitation surplus at high altitudes was converged to the interior of the basin in the form of runoff and then released to the atmosphere via the process of et that explains why our et estimates were noticeably higher than precipitation at low altitudes the lack of ground truth benchmark in qaidam basin makes it difficult for us to evaluate the accuracy of our universal t s v i models effectively nevertheless the comparative analysis demonstrates that its accuracy has reached a level comparable to those achieved by other widely used et products on this basis our present study may contribute to the development of remote sensing based models for continuous et estimation and partitioning in poorly gauged basins it may also contribute to better understanding the terrestrial
