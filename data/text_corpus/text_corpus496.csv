2480,to adjust heavy radar rainfall a novel approach based on combining adaptive network based fuzzy inference system and particle swarm optimization anfis pso and six geographical variables was proposed this study is the first to adjust radar rainfall using anfis pso and it has the advantages of a fuzzy inference system for quantifying the contribution of related factors to phenomena and artificial neural networks in a data driven approach six geographic variables including slope aspect elevation distance from the sea plan curvature and profile curvature were utilized to adjust the radar rainfall at three south korean stations the adjusted rainfall captured well the location and heavy rainfall amount for comparison with the marshall palmer based rainfall m p the adjusted rainfall also showed an improved mean absolute percentage error of approximately 70 and correlation value of approximately 12 compared to the m p the sensitivity results of geographical variables showed that adjusted rainfall has a high sensitivity ratio to elevation and distance from the sea with values of 28 7 and 12 0 respectively while other variables showed 6 9 sensitivity ratios since most sensitivity and relationship results are consistent with previous studies the data driven results were reasonable this study contributes to the radar rainfall adjustment field by analyzing the causal link between rainfall and geographic variables due to the ability of this method to consider the effect of geographic variables in radar adjustment it can be utilized in mountainous areas that are highly affected by spatial variables keywords weather radar adjustment heavy rainfall geographical variables anfis pso data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction providing spatial quantitative precipitation estimation qpe of heavy rainfall is a vital part of hydrological modeling due to the spatial variability in rainfall point measurements such as using gauge stations are not able to provide exact rainfall information in all areas king et al 2013 foehn et al 2018 calculation of weather radar precipitation estimation potentially provides continuous high resolution large coverage data giangrande and ryzhkov 2008 kim et al 2018 tsai et al 2018 derin et al 2019 hu et al 2019 however there are two main sources of error in radar qpes including errors in the measurement of reflectivity hubbert et al 2009 park et al 2009 nikahd et al 2016 marra and morin 2018 and errors from attempts to convert this reflectivity to the precipitation rate hasan et al 2014 cecinati et al 2017 sivasubramaniam et al 2018 wijayarathne et al 2020 kim et al 2021 nanding and rico ramirez 2021 in particular geographical factors such as topography and distance from the sea directly or indirectly lead to different precipitation formation conditions marra et al 2021 and drop size distribution das and maitra 2018 which require considering different conditions in the reflectivity rainfall rate z r relationship kim et al 2021 furthermore geographical factors cause disturbances in reflectivity measurements harrison et al 2000 germann et al 2006 picciotti et al 2020 therefore geographic variables can greatly affect both types of errors various adjustment methods to gain accurate radar qpes have been examined in many studies berenguer et al 2006 velasco forero et al 2009 anagnostou et al 2018 bližňák et al 2018 ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 silver et al 2019 2020 yang et al 2020 nanding and rico ramirez 2021 typically the adjustment of radar qpes using the relationship between observed rainfall amount and radar qpes is an accepted process in most studies berndt et al 2014 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2016 hu et al 2019 nanding and rico ramirez 2021 yoon et al 2012 however these methods have limitations in adjusting the qpes due to a lack of consideration of geographical factors this limitation leads to low accuracy when representing heavy or local convective storms with large spatial variability goodrich et al 1995 morin et al 2005 silver et al 2020 to solve this problem and achieve better performance in radar qpe adjustment it is recommended to consider the effect of geographical variables such as topographic variables and distance from the sea on precipitation silver et al 2020 wang et al 2020 numerous studies have confirmed the relationship and effects of geographical variables on rainfall accordingly five variables affecting rainfall including elevation guan et al 2005 jin et al 2016 bhuiyan et al 2020 slope johansson and chen 2003 ragab et al 2003 aspect pourghasemi and rossi 2019 distance from the sea makarieva et al 2009 and curvature ninyerola et al 2000 meseguer ruiz et al 2019 have been reported it should be mentioned that to further investigate the features of curvature this variable was divided into plan curvature and profile curvature parts in this study despite the effectiveness of geographical variables on rainfall there are few studies that quantified the relationship between radar rainfall and geographical variables and it is also difficult to find radar rainfall adjustment studies using these variables morin and gabella 2007 applied weight regression wr and multiple weight regression wmr to utilize the effect of auxiliary variables in radar qpe adjustment these methods operate poorly when the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is nonlinear other techniques used to consider the effect of auxiliary variables include geostatistical methods that are represented as kriging interpolation despite their acceptable performance there are limitations associated with these methods the kriging method was conducted with model estimated variograms rather than empirical variograms since the models fit the variogram using parameters based on normality when input data are not adequate to extract parameters or are not normally distributed many uncertainties occur ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 yoon and bae 2013 recently machine learning methods such as neural network based methods that have the ability to create strong and accurate nonlinear relationships of input and output variables have been performed to consider the effect of geographical variables on adjusted radar qpes chen et al 2011 yu et al 2017 in addition a fuzzy inference system has been used to adjust radar data with geographical variables silver et al 2020 and is known to be one of the best solutions to quantify the effect of related factors on phenomena sen 2009 to consider the effect of these factors a fuzzy inference system fis can be implemented to adopt a membership function mf kluska 2009 since the mf determines the contribution of input to output variables with various nonlinear functions it is powerful for quantifying the effectiveness of vague input on output and provides flexibility to fis that is not available in other methods the most critical part of fis is the determination of mf but there is no systematic approach to determining the shape and threshold of mf medsker 1995 therefore the mf is commonly determined based on the expert s decision with an empirical experiment since there is not enough experimental data to support mf for most regions and the expert s decision is only dependent on experience there is a high degree of uncertainty and error when using the fis therefore to overcome this limitation an adaptive fuzzy inference system anfis has been applied in many fields shu and ouarda 2008 yeom and kwak 2019 babanezhad et al 2020 anfis is a hybrid framework that is obtained by combining the concepts of fis and artificial neural networks anns anfis combines the advantages of anns to find nonlinear relationships between input and output without expert knowledge and the advantages of fis to use mf polykretis et al 2019 it performs better than either of the two individual methods shu and ouarda 2008 in addition the combination of anfis with particle swarm optimization pso leads to an improved optimization performance of anfis and due to this advantage it is widely applied in hydrological fields azad et al 2019 shahabi et al 2021 anfis pso is a promising approach for radar rainfall adjustment with geographical variables for the abovementioned reasons but thus far to the best of our knowledge no study in the radar rainfall adjustment field based on anfis pso has been conducted this study pursues two main objectives design a new approach of weather radar adjustment for heavy rainfall events by using the anfis pso algorithm to achieve accurate qpe in each grid and investigate the effect of geographical variables on the weather radar adjustment model 2 study area and data preprocessing 2 1 study area in this research three radar stations with different geographical conditions were considered in south korea the kwanaksan kwk study area is located in the northwest the average elevation is 217 m and the highest elevation is 1485 m above sea level the gwangdeoksan gdk is located in the north and most of this area is mountainous with an average elevation of 361 m and a maximum elevation of 1728 m both sides of this study area are connected to the sea the third radar is gudeoksan psn which is located in the southeast and is affected by sea conditions the average and maximum elevations in this area are 230 and 1925 m respectively the location of the radars study area and distribution of ground gauge stations indicated by the green color are shown in fig 1 in the study area of the kwk gdk and psn radar stations 155 130 and 78 gauge stations were selected to adjust the radar qpe respectively 2 2 data collection and preprocessing according to the definition of heavy rainfall by swain et al 2018 nine events were selected among the periods that showed the highest amounts of rainfall in each year rainfall events of type 1 type 2 and type 3 were assigned these assignments represent heavy rainfall in several consecutive 10 minute hour and day time steps without stop respectively and heavy rainfall is recorded during these events for 3 years 2018 2019 and 2020 the reason for considering these types of rainfall is that the analysis of geographical variables is affected by the duration of rainfall and by selecting events with different durations especially type 3 events the effect of geographic variables on the adjustment of radar for rainfall events of different durations can be evaluated therefore type 3 rainfall events have the longest duration of rainfall and type 1 events have the shortest duration of rainfall the observed rainfall data from the automatic weather station aws were gathered from the korea meteorological administration kma then the accumulative rainfall amount for each event was calculated as shown in table 1 because the cumulative rainfall distribution is different at different stations for each event it is not possible to report the amount of rainfall for all stations for each event for this reason the minimum and maximum accumulated rainfall values recorded at the rain gauge stations are presented in table 1 the quality controlled radar data for selected events were collected from the kma in this study radar data including nine plan position indicators ppis ranging from 0 4 to 15 were used ppi is composed of 360 bins that correspond to 360 azimuths from 0 5 to 359 5 the complete volume of radar data is presented every 5 min the radar beamwidth is 1 with a 1 km bin length which affects the radar range by approximately 240 km however based on studies of the quality of radar rainfall in the korean peninsula the quality of radar data is only acceptable until 120 km yoon et al 2012 therefore the radar reflectivity data were extracted to obtain constant altitude ppi cappi at an elevation of 1 5 km as the best altitude by using the bilinear interpolation method based on mohr and vaughan 1979 in this study to convert radar reflectivity z to precipitation r the marshall palmer m p equation which is widely applied in south korea yoo et al 2016 kim et al 2021 is used as indicated in eq 1 1 z 200 r 1 6 o r r z 200 1 1 6 based on studies conducted in these regions elevation has been introduced as an important parameter for the amount of precipitation um et al 2010 2011 yoon et al 2015 the aspect variable is affected by the direction of the wind and the aspects that oppose the direction of the wind are more likely to receive rainfall according to the characteristics of monsoon precipitation at this time this rainfall is from the south and southwest directions lee et al 2015 qian et al 2002 the effects of slope on precipitation are positive and usually considered to the effects of slope on the speed of the air mass horizontal wind and cooling of the air mass the distance from the sea reflects the effect of sea conditions on rainfall and based on a study in south korea by rim 2010 there is an inverse relationship between precipitation and distance from the sea except in july to date no studies have been conducted on the relationship between the type of curvature and precipitation in south korea but these variables can reflect the effect of orography in each region meseguer ruiz et al 2019 the positive negative and zero values of curvature indicate that the surface is convex concave and linear at that cell respectively based on these studies six important geographical variables related to precipitation were selected all these variables except distance from the sea were obtained from the digital elevation model dem the dem data with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the ministry of environment 3 methodology the overall procedures of this research are indicated in fig 2 geographical variables were derived from dem and observed rainfall data were collected then heavy rainfall events were selected according to the observed rainfall and accumulated rainfall from radar was calculated by the m p then the observed data were divided into two sections for training and validation of the anfis pso model as an input for the model and testing data as a target for measuring the accuracy of the model the anfis model was also used for evaluation as a reference to compare with the results of the anfi pso model after creating the model evaluation of the model performance and analysis of the effectiveness of geographical variables on radar rainfall adjustment were conducted the model created by anfis and anfis pso was built and separately optimized for each heavy rainfall event and the inputs of the model were the six geographic variables and accumulated radar rainfall data in training rain gauge stations after building the optimized model the inputs which included six geographic variables and radar rainfall data of the entire study area in each grid with a resolution of 1 1 km were entered into the model to adjust the radar rainfall for each grid 3 1 concept of the hybrid anfis pso algorithm fis designs a procedure with input output fuzzy sets that are created by if then rules armaghani et al 2015 fuzzy rules are defined based on the experience and knowledge of experts and have the ability to quantify vague knowledge and reasoning proceedings eqs 2 and 3 show the takagi and sugeno tks fuzzy rules one popular type of fuzzy rules the vague knowledge x and y is quantified using mf and the quantified values are used to estimate the contribution w i of each output the output f i of each rule is estimated with parameters for output p i q i r i the final output f is estimated with the output and its contribution the gaussian mf function was used to indicate the degree of belonging of set members for the application of fuzzy rules the shape of the mf and parameters for output should be decided based on expert knowledge based on this process vague knowledge can be utilized quantitatively to estimate target variables despite the advantages of the fuzzy method the main limitation of fuzzy systems is that they are highly dependent on expert decisions and there is no standard procedure for converting vague knowledge into a fuzzy rule that causes high uncertainty in predicting output 2 r u l e 1 i f x i s a 1 a n d y i s b 1 t h e n f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 3 r u l e 2 i f x i s a 2 a n d y i s b 2 t h e n f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 4 f w 1 f 1 w 2 f 2 w 1 w 2 therefore to overcome these limitations it is necessary to choose methods for tuning the mf to improve the performance of the model output liu et al 2013 the anfis model is a multilayer feed forward network that is able to systematically create the mf achieving the best values of these coefficients is one of the key points in the anfis training process in general the structure of the anfis consists of five layers which is shown schematically jang 1993 in fig 3 the iteration is continued in five layers of the anfis to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy rules and find the best shape of the mf kluska 2009 awan and bae 2016 therefore during the anfis process a strong structure is constructed based on a dataset without the need for expertise about available data fig 3 shows a simplification for two input variables with two clusters while the proposed technique uses six geographical variables and the radar rainfall values as inputs in the first layer the crisp values of the input dataset are fuzzified using gaussian mfs for example output i 1 is the output of the ith node of layer 1 x or y is input node i and ai or bi 2 is the label associated with this node therefore output i 1 is the membership grade of fuzzy set a1 a2 b1 b2 5 output i 1 μ ai x i 1 2 6 output i 1 μ b i 2 y i 3 4 gaussian function as a mf μ a i can be measured as 7 μ a i x exp 1 2 x c i σ i 2 where x and y are the inputs of ith nodes and μ ai x and μ b i 2 y are mfs σ i c i are the standard deviation of gaussian distribution and the coefficients conditioning factors respectively the second layer measures the quantity of the firing strengths of the rules 8 output i 2 w i μ ai x μ bi y i 1 2 where w i is the firing strength of a rule for the ith node the third layer uses a set of fixed nodes to normalize the strength of all the rules 9 output i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 the fourth layer computes the required entry by using a linear equation for the final layer and can be described as 10 output i 4 w i f i w i p i n q i y r i i 1 2 where w i denotes the ith normalized firing strength and p i q i and r i are the set of components referred to as consequent components the fifth layer is the final layer of anfis and in this layer all of the output values of the fourth layer are gathered and indicate the final result of anfis 11 output i 5 i 1 2 w i f i i 1 2 w j f i w 1 w 2 training and updating the model parameters are the important parts of the anfis training of the anfis is usually based on gradient descent at times the results of gradient descent may be captured in a local minimum due to the dependence on the initial values of the parameters liu et al 2013 shahnazar et al 2017 one of the common techniques for avoiding these problems is the alternation of gradient descent with other optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso recent studies have shown that the performance of the anfis is greatly improved by combination with pso seydi ghomsheh et al 2007 liu et al 2013 azad et al 2019 samanataray and sahoo 2021 the pso algorithm developed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 is a metaheuristic algorithm that has powerful outcomes in the optimization of nonlinear issues and has relatively low calculation cost instant convergence and admissible results in several study fields razavi termeh et al 2018 in the pso algorithm there is a swarm of particles moving in the n dimensional space and each particle is adjusted based on the particle experience and its best neighbor experience gordan et al 2016 particle location and velocity are two main features of pso x i j and v i j indicate the location and velocity of the ith particle at the jth iteration respectively in each iteration the location and velocity are updated using eqs 12 and 13 and the best location p i j 1 of each particle is updated by comparing the existing best location p i j and updated location x i j 1 in eq 14 the best global location g i j 1 is selected in the best locations of each particle in eq 15 these iterations are continued until the global location demonstrates a desirable performance because this method is based on a number of particles the local minima are rarely selected as output 12 v i j 1 ω â v i j c 1 d 1 p i j x i j c 2 d 2 g i j x i j 13 x i j 1 x i j

weights and coefficients were adopted in the pso algorithm d 1 and d 2 are random values between 0 1 and ns represents the number of particles h is the fitness function that calculates the closeness of the locations of particles and the optimum solution 3 2 design of the weather radar adjustment method based on anfis pso in this section the design and configuration of the anfis pso model is shown according to the input and output data for this purpose three types of data including geographical variables accumulated radar rainfall and accumulated observed rainfall data for the whole duration of each event were considered for the input of the model accumulated radar rainfall data and geographical variables were used to obtain adjusted radar rainfall for the whole study area observational data were used as target data for training the model and data from all observed stations were randomly divided 80 of the data were used for training and validation and 20 were used for testing in terms of the training validation and testing subsets the training dataset was used to fine tune the anfis and anfis pso by adjusting the parameter values of the fuzzy rules the validation dataset was used to obtain optimal parameters and determine the stopping point for model training by avoiding overfitting or underfitting of the model for the training dataset finally the testing dataset was used to evaluate the performances of the m p anfis and anfis pso furthermore one of the ideal methods to address the limitations of small datasets is k fold cross validation which plays the role of standardization for estimating the performance of the model lee et al 2020 wong and yeh 2020 yadav and shukla 2016 although this type of stratified random sampling increases the computation time very strong performance is achieved wei et al 2021 in this study k was set to 4 therefore in each step one subdata fold is considered to be the validation data 20 of the whole dataset while the other k 1 subdata folds are entered into the model for training 60 of the whole dataset in the design of the anfis pso model fuzzy c means fcm clustering as a popular fuzzy clustering algorithm kisi et al 2018 was applied to generate the initial mf the fcm algorithm can affect the number of clusters and thus the number of generated rules in this study to achieve optimal clustering and create a basic fuzzy system the fcm algorithm available in the matlab software was used for this purpose there are two fcm parameters that are needed to find the optimal value the number of clusters and the degree of fuzzy overlap partition matrix u to calculate the optimum number of clusters the elbow method which is very popular was applied for the elbow method an appropriate cluster was selected based on the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned center distortion furthermore to adjust the fuzzy overlap in fcm clustering the data points with maximum membership values must be found fuzzy overlap shows the number of fuzzy cluster boundaries to quantify the degree of fuzzy overlap the average of the maximum membership values across all data points was calculated after the calculation of the optimal number of clusters and matrix u the fcm algorithm was utilized so that the objective function reached the minimum threshold by updating the centers of each cluster additionally a gaussian distribution was selected for the shape of the mf because they prepare the most adequate choice of membership functions in the measurements in this procedure the parameters c σ of the gaussian membership function which determine the shape of the mf are adjusted by the anfis and anfis pso algorithms finally the most efficient form of mf is created to elaborate the effect of input variables on the adjusted rainfall data in this study to correctly compare the performance of the optimization algorithms and select the error norms one objective function root mean squared error was used in both the anfis and pso optimization algorithms to minimize the error function i e the error rate between the adjusted data and the observed data from the rain gauge stations 3 3 sensitivity analysis of geographical variables for radar rainfall adjustment the anfis pso model is formed based on data training so it can provide significant information such as the behavior of geographical variables and the contribution of these variables to radar rainfall adjustment in this study an attempt is made to provide an approach that identifies the relationships of geographical variables to the adjustment of radar qpe to investigate how much anfis pso involved the impact of geographical variables on the adjustment of radar rainfall the correlation coefficient cc between the geographical variables and the amount of rainfall estimated by the m p and anfis pso models were calculated these data were extracted for the entire study area in grids with a resolution of 1 km to avoid distracting from the main results the pixels that were estimated to have zero rainfall after adjustments were made were not used in the calculations regarding the calculation of the ccs of the curvatures due to the existence of negative and positive ranges in these variables the data were divided into two parts positive and negative data this separation helps to determine the degree of positive or negative correlation with the type of curvature and how correlation changes with changes in the shape of the surface this section examines how the correlation between adjusted rainfall and geographical data increased after adjustment additionally to determine the output sensitivity based on each geographical variable the change in adjusted rainfall based on the change in each geographical variable was analyzed the changes in the values of geographical variables lead to changes in the adjusted rainfall by using this method we can quantify the impact of each variable in adjusting radar rainfall to avoid disturbing the interdependency of geographical variables the target variable was changed from its range and the rest of the variables were held constant middle of their range values to compare the sensitivity of adjusted radar rainfall based on geographical variables between all events sensitivity was normalized using eq 16 16 sensitivityratio m a x r adj i m i n r adj i m a x r adj all 100 where m a x r adj i and m i n r adj i are the maximum and minimum amounts of adjusted rainfall values based on changes in the ith geographical variable mm for each event m a x r adj all is the maximum amount of adjusted rainfall value in that event mm 3 4 performance measures one of the most important parts of performing each model is evaluation of the model the results of m p anfis and anfis pso at the test gauges were compared with observation data the evaluation is carried out using three metrics as shown in eqs 17 19 the correlation coefficient r mean absolute percentage error mape and root mean squared error rmse were utilized 17 r x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 18 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 19 mape 1 n i 1 n x i y i x i 100 where n is the number of samples x i are the observed values y i are the estimated values and x i are the mean of the observed values 4 results 4 1 construction of the anfis and anfis pso models in this section the performance results based on the implementation of the radar rainfall adjustment model are shown the description of the characteristics and final fine tuned parameters of anfis and anfis pso are shown in table 2 as observed from table 2 the number of optimum clusters is between 5 and 7 after the number of clusters exceeds this range the distortion did not change significantly with an increasing number of clusters additionally as the number of clusters increased the results of the models showed that the best performance was achieved using 5 7 clusters according to the number of clusters a value of 1 5 was considered for the u matrix parameter therefore the average maximum values of the members ranged from 0 81 to 0 90 the average maximum membership value provides a quantitative description of the overlap with higher values indicating less fuzzy overlap fig 4 shows the rate of convergence curves based on the objective function for the training testing and validation datasets based on 1000 iterations for three type 1 events using the anfis pso model iterations were stopped to prevent under and overfitting of the selected models based on the values of the validation dataset the value of the objective function for the validation dataset was fixed and the error rate was at a minimum training iterations were stopped if the rate of change of the error for the validation data did not exceed 0 1 and this value should not start increasing compared to the previous 10 iterations for this reason the stop point for the kwk dataset fig 4a was chosen to be approximately 340 iterations for the gdk data fig 4b approximately 250 iterations and for the psn data fig 4c approximately 300 iterations due to the large difference in the spatial distribution of precipitation data the error rate of the validation data is very noisy at the first steps table 3 shows the performance of the anfis and anfis pso models based on the training and validation datasets the results show that while the nature of the rainfall data is very scattered and noisy the behavior and error of the test and validation datasets are similar and the model has reached an optimum calibration level according to the implementation of the models the performance of the anfis and anfis pso models for the two types of training and validation datasets is shown in table 3 4 2 spatial analysis of radar heavy rainfall after adjustment in this section the spatial distributions of accumulated rainfall data by the m p and anfis pso are compared with the observed rainfall data at the testing station to validate the spatial distribution of the adjusted rainfall data fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of accumulated radar rainfall data using the m p and anfis pso in type 1 events short duration at three radar stations the colors in the figures show the rainfall amounts estimated by the m p and anfis pso the positions and sizes of the red circles indicate the location and amount of observed rainfall at the testing station respectively therefore circles with a larger diameter should be located in dark blue or brown areas where heavy rainfall has occurred and stations with a smaller diameter should be located in light colored areas as the spatial distribution of rainfall shows in fig 5 the largest amount of rainfall for type 1 events occurred north of kwk east of gdk and at the center of psn in the spatial patterns of the m p most of the large circles were located in light colored areas but in the spatial patterns of anfis pso most of the large circles were located in dark blue areas the largest amount of observed rainfall at the testing station in the dark blue regions was 150 mm 205 mm and 76 mm respectively while the amount of rainfall estimated by the m p was 44 mm 20 mm and 27 mm respectively anfis pso was able to adjust these amounts to 136 mm 162 mm and 84 mm respectively which are much closer to the observed rainfall data the rainfall distribution by the m p underestimates the rainfall range especially the heavy rainfall range so it is difficult to distinguish rainfall between regions with low and high rainfall however anfis pso accurately adjusts the amount of rainfall other types of events have similar conditions and the anfis pso adjustment method could create a precise spatial distribution of rainfall that corresponds to the observed rainfall of the test station 4 3 quantitative analysis of radar heavy rainfall after adjustment in this section the amount of rainfall by anfis pso compared to the m p was quantitatively analyzed using scatter plots and statistics fig 6 shows a scatter plot in which the x axis is the observed accumulative rainfall at the test gauge stations and the y axis is the estimated accumulative rainfall as fig 6 shows the m p blue points underestimates the amount of rainfall at all stations and cannot achieve accurate rainfall estimates under heavy rainfall conditions especially in type 3 events which have large amounts of rainfall the rainfall estimated by the m p showed a larger error than in other cases in other words the m p is inefficient for heavy rainfall in contract adjustment by anfis pso green points can significantly modify these calculations and the adjusted rainfall data are close to the gauge observation data to compare the performance of models depending on the rainfall range test stations were divided into three categories based on the rank of observed rainfall amounts by dotted lines as shown in fig 6 as the results show one z r relation cannot account for the whole region and the coefficients of the z r relation will be different for each region at low rainfall stations the m p method shows an acceptable performance but with an increasing amount of rainfall this performance is severely weakened and the error rate increases the average mape for stations with less rainfall is 50 that for medium rainfall stations is 64 and that for stations with high rainfall is 68 however this value for the anfis pso model is 49 for the first category 20 for the second category and 15 for the third category which indicates that the performance of the anfis pso in heavy rainfall is more efficient than in low rainfall table 4 shows the statistical performances of the m p anfis and anfis pso a comparison of the results between the m p and anfis pso showed that the anfis pso method could noticeably reduce errors in the qpe therefore based on the average rmse the improvement percentages of the anfis pso in types 1 2 and 3 were approximately 60 71 and 71 respectively additionally in most events the amount of r increased after adjusting the radar qpe a comparison of the results between anfis and anfis pso showed that anfis pso has a better performance than anfis in other words the optimization process used in anfis pso is effective therefore the anfis pso model can be considered a premise adjustment method for heavy rainfall and a sophisticated method due to its better performance than anfis 4 4 sensitivity of geographical variables to radar rainfall in this subsection the effect of geographical variables on the adjustment of radar rainfall was analyzed by the cc and sensitivity ratio there are two types of ccs the cc between the geographical variables and rainfall estimated from the m p and the other is the cc between the geographical variables and rainfall from anfis pso the increasing amount of cc between the geographical variables and rainfall after weather radar adjustment indicates the contribution of geographical variables to the adjustment additionally the sensitivity ratio was calculated to investigate the effect of each geographical variable separately the sensitivity ratio shows how each geographical variable can be effective in adjusting radar rainfall therefore any geographical variable that has a higher sensitivity ratio based on table 4 indicates that it is more effective in adjusting radar rainfall table 5 shows the inaverage absolute cc the inaverage absolute ccs of the slope aspect elevation and distance from the sea variables increased by 0 04 0 03 0 11 and 0 05 respectively after radar rainfall adjustment this increase for negative and positive plan curvatures of 0 02 and 0 08 respectively and profile curvatures of 0 06 and 0 02 respectively therefore all the average cc values of anfis pso were greater than those of the m p these increases in the ccs indicate that the contributions of geographical variables were improved for radar rainfall adjustment among the geographical variables elevation has the highest cc with the amount of rainfall distance from the sea was the next geographical variable that was effective in adjusting radar rainfall the slope aspect plan and profile curvature variables have low ccs and did not show noticeable changes in the cc after adjusting the radar qpe the value of the sensitivity ratio is shown in table 5 this sensitivity percentage represents the percentage of change in adjusted rainfall based on the change in each geographical variable from minimum to maximum the results of the sensitivity ratio are very similar to the results of the cc as a result the output of the model has the highest sensitivity rate to elevation which is 28 7 the distance from the sea at 12 0 is the second most effective variable adjusted rainfall has 6 0 9 0 sensitivity to the slope aspect plan and profile curvature variables and these amounts can also be useful in distinguishing between different conditions therefore consideration of these variables leads to a more accurate adjustment of the radar qpe additionally the results of table 5 show that with increasing rainfall duration the sensitivity of adjusted rainfall to geographic variables increases and shows that geographic variables are more effective in adjusting radar qpe for type 3 events than for type 1 events fig 7 illustrates the changes in the adjusted radar qpe anfis pso output based on changes in the geographical variables in the gdk in the type 1 event based on this figure the adjusted rainfall has a positive relationship with elevation and it is more sensitive to changes in elevation after 400 m additionally adjusted rainfall has a positive relationship with slope especially between 15 and 20 as well as a plan curvature between 2 and 5 the profile curvature is sensitive to adjusted rainfall near zero the effects of aspect and distance from the sea are relatively low and nonsignificant therefore the sensitivity shows nearly a horizontal line without any special changes the sensitivity analysis of other events also showed that although the behavior of radar adjustment based on geographical variables was different in some specific areas the overall trend was similar for example this trend was always positive and had the highest sensitivity analysis value for the variable of elevation and in most cases it was the lowest value for the aspect variable this result demonstrates a relationship between geographical variables and adjusted radar rainfall and the relationship was extracted based on training from data it is possible to explore the range of geographical variables that are effective for radar rainfall adjustment in the area of interest and it is possible to quantitatively present the sensitivity of each variable therefore the anfis pso methodology proposed in this study is not only effective for radar rainfall adjustment considering regional characteristics such as the effective range of geographical variables to rainfall but can also provide meaningful information for understanding the causal links between geographical variables and radar rainfall 5 discussion this study first proposed a method to adjust radar rainfall by considering 6 geographical variables with anfis pso and improved the performance of radar rainfall in particular the spatial distribution and amount of heavy rainfall were captured in the results well and the contribution of geographical variables was clearly represented by correlations and sensitivities therefore it can be concluded that the anfis pso is a promising approach for radar rainfall adjustment and understanding the causal link between geographical variables and rainfall estimates pso algorithm was applied for improving performance of anfis and reducing probability of being stuck in local minimum and preventing overfitting according to the values mentioned in tables 3 and 4 the pso optimization algorithm was able to show better performance than the backpropagation optimization algorithm used in anfis this study shows that a hybrid computing methodology incorporating the features of the anfis architecture and pso algorithms improved the performance of the model in adjusting radar rainfall in the process of anfis pso the relationship between geographical variables and radar rainfall was extracted for a better understanding this result was compared with the results of previous literature for the sensitivity elevation and distance from the sea showed the highest sensitivity and other variables showed less sensitivity in previous studies rainfall estimates also showed high sensitivity to elevation and distance from the sea but slope aspect and curvature were less effective terms for rainfall than elevation and distance rim 2010 um et al 2010 meseguer ruiz et al 2019 in addition the results showed that with increasing rainfall duration in type 3 events the effect of the variable on adjusted radar rainfall increased especially for elevation and distance from the sea which is consistent with um et al 2011 additionally the results of this study showed that elevation and slope are positively correlated with the amount of rainfall in most events and these results are consistent with the literature um et al 2010 2011 the distance from the sea showed positive and negative relationships depending on events as mentioned by rim 2010 aspect does not have a significant relationship with rainfall perhaps because of the rotation of wind in basins as suggested by lee et al 2015 all different aspects are affected by rainfall and it is not possible to distinguish the probability of rainfall in a particular aspect because of the evaluation of limited events in this study and the lack of literature regarding the effect of curvature on rainfall a detailed explanation of the meteorological mechanisms of curvature variables can be very difficult and is accompanied by uncertainties however according to studies on curvature the results regarding the effect of curvature on rainfall meseguer ruiz et al 2019 encourage us to consider these variables therefore it may be suggested that the mechanism of the variable of curvature can affect the amount of rainfall recorded in each region by changing the wind direction in most of the studies rainfall is considered vertical while the change in rainfall distribution near the surface especially in mountainous areas is due to the effect of wind direction and speed bradley et al 1997 investigated the effect of wind flow on barriers and showed that under certain conditions increased precipitation can occur on the leeward side of the range additionally some studies have shown that wind may produce significant horizontal rainfall in addition to the vertical component measured by rain gauges orlandini and lamberti 2000 additionally the curvature by affecting the amount of air humidity and changing the speed of air mass ascent may have an effect on the amount of rainfall recorded the results of this study show that positive curvature values laterally convex at plan curvature and upwardly concave at profile curvature have the highest probability rather than negative values laterally concave at plan curvature and upwardly convex at profile curvature and the amount of precipitation reduces around zero linear surface in both types of curvature therefore the higher absolute values of the curvature have a greater impact on rainfall the obtained results of this study show consistency with the previous literature this result reveals that the model can appropriately consider relationships between geographical variables and precipitation without any additional studies to analyze those relationships additionally quantitative and reliable behavioral patterns for each variable can be extracted to understand the causal links between input and output therefore this model is a promising measure not only to adjust rainfall but also to analyze the relationship between input and output despite the advantages of this model there are limitations to be improved upon in the future first more comprehensive validation is needed the anfis pso models were constructed by each event even though the model showed an acceptable performance for testing stations the model was not validated for independent events with the training dataset validation with independent events is important since the study area is affected by various types of rainfall events such as typhoons and asian monsoons such comprehensive validation must be verified with a large number of events therefore it is necessary to study radar adjustments based on anfis pso in the future through additional data acquisition and model improvement by considering various types of rainfall events the second limitation is the type of model output which is the accumulated rainfall this limitation undermines the advantages of radar rainfall which have a high temporal resolution most applications of radar rainfall utilize time series data rather than accumulated data therefore the output of this model has limitations in the context of the demand for this type of use because the proposed model showed an acceptable performance for accumulated rainfall it is expected to be applicable to estimating rainfall time series in the future the model will be expanded to simulate rainfall time series although the anfis pso method has been used in other fields of study attention to the unique characteristics of the region the type of input data in the spatial distribution of precipitation that has high dispersion the advantages of the fuzzy system and the characteristics of anfis pso in this method have led to the successful implementation of a new approach in the field of weather radar adjustment because this study is the first application of anfis pso to the radar adjustment field there are the above limitations to consider therefore there is large potential for this approach to be expanded to the whole field of radar adjustment 6 conclusion in this study a powerful data driven model named anfis pso and a geographical variable based radar rainfall adjustment method were proposed and the effectiveness of the model was proven for this purpose the performance of anfis pso in radar rainfall adjustment was calculated and the sensitivity was analyzed using nine heavy rainfall events this study validated the significant performance of anfis pso for radar adjustment with geographical variables and discovered the possibility of using the model for analyzing geographical variables with rainfall the results of the spatial distribution and statistical comparison of rainfall showed that the use of the anfis pso method in adjusting radar rainfall leads to an accurate estimate of the amount of heavy rainfall at any point the results of the sensitivity analysis also make it possible to identify and extract the relationship between geographical variables and rainfall depending on the effective range the sensitivity result extracted from the data can suggest a meaningful range of each geographical variable on rainfall therefore this model can be directly utilized to better understand the relationship between geographical variables and adjust weather rainfall data this study is the first to use the anfis based method in this field and consider the effect of geographical variables on heavy rainfall events therefore due to the ability of this method to consider the effect of geographic variables in radar adjustment this method can be utilized in areas such as mountainous regions that are highly affected by spatial variables credit authorship contribution statement alireza oliaye conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

2480,to adjust heavy radar rainfall a novel approach based on combining adaptive network based fuzzy inference system and particle swarm optimization anfis pso and six geographical variables was proposed this study is the first to adjust radar rainfall using anfis pso and it has the advantages of a fuzzy inference system for quantifying the contribution of related factors to phenomena and artificial neural networks in a data driven approach six geographic variables including slope aspect elevation distance from the sea plan curvature and profile curvature were utilized to adjust the radar rainfall at three south korean stations the adjusted rainfall captured well the location and heavy rainfall amount for comparison with the marshall palmer based rainfall m p the adjusted rainfall also showed an improved mean absolute percentage error of approximately 70 and correlation value of approximately 12 compared to the m p the sensitivity results of geographical variables showed that adjusted rainfall has a high sensitivity ratio to elevation and distance from the sea with values of 28 7 and 12 0 respectively while other variables showed 6 9 sensitivity ratios since most sensitivity and relationship results are consistent with previous studies the data driven results were reasonable this study contributes to the radar rainfall adjustment field by analyzing the causal link between rainfall and geographic variables due to the ability of this method to consider the effect of geographic variables in radar adjustment it can be utilized in mountainous areas that are highly affected by spatial variables keywords weather radar adjustment heavy rainfall geographical variables anfis pso data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction providing spatial quantitative precipitation estimation qpe of heavy rainfall is a vital part of hydrological modeling due to the spatial variability in rainfall point measurements such as using gauge stations are not able to provide exact rainfall information in all areas king et al 2013 foehn et al 2018 calculation of weather radar precipitation estimation potentially provides continuous high resolution large coverage data giangrande and ryzhkov 2008 kim et al 2018 tsai et al 2018 derin et al 2019 hu et al 2019 however there are two main sources of error in radar qpes including errors in the measurement of reflectivity hubbert et al 2009 park et al 2009 nikahd et al 2016 marra and morin 2018 and errors from attempts to convert this reflectivity to the precipitation rate hasan et al 2014 cecinati et al 2017 sivasubramaniam et al 2018 wijayarathne et al 2020 kim et al 2021 nanding and rico ramirez 2021 in particular geographical factors such as topography and distance from the sea directly or indirectly lead to different precipitation formation conditions marra et al 2021 and drop size distribution das and maitra 2018 which require considering different conditions in the reflectivity rainfall rate z r relationship kim et al 2021 furthermore geographical factors cause disturbances in reflectivity measurements harrison et al 2000 germann et al 2006 picciotti et al 2020 therefore geographic variables can greatly affect both types of errors various adjustment methods to gain accurate radar qpes have been examined in many studies berenguer et al 2006 velasco forero et al 2009 anagnostou et al 2018 bližňák et al 2018 ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 silver et al 2019 2020 yang et al 2020 nanding and rico ramirez 2021 typically the adjustment of radar qpes using the relationship between observed rainfall amount and radar qpes is an accepted process in most studies berndt et al 2014 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2016 hu et al 2019 nanding and rico ramirez 2021 yoon et al 2012 however these methods have limitations in adjusting the qpes due to a lack of consideration of geographical factors this limitation leads to low accuracy when representing heavy or local convective storms with large spatial variability goodrich et al 1995 morin et al 2005 silver et al 2020 to solve this problem and achieve better performance in radar qpe adjustment it is recommended to consider the effect of geographical variables such as topographic variables and distance from the sea on precipitation silver et al 2020 wang et al 2020 numerous studies have confirmed the relationship and effects of geographical variables on rainfall accordingly five variables affecting rainfall including elevation guan et al 2005 jin et al 2016 bhuiyan et al 2020 slope johansson and chen 2003 ragab et al 2003 aspect pourghasemi and rossi 2019 distance from the sea makarieva et al 2009 and curvature ninyerola et al 2000 meseguer ruiz et al 2019 have been reported it should be mentioned that to further investigate the features of curvature this variable was divided into plan curvature and profile curvature parts in this study despite the effectiveness of geographical variables on rainfall there are few studies that quantified the relationship between radar rainfall and geographical variables and it is also difficult to find radar rainfall adjustment studies using these variables morin and gabella 2007 applied weight regression wr and multiple weight regression wmr to utilize the effect of auxiliary variables in radar qpe adjustment these methods operate poorly when the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is nonlinear other techniques used to consider the effect of auxiliary variables include geostatistical methods that are represented as kriging interpolation despite their acceptable performance there are limitations associated with these methods the kriging method was conducted with model estimated variograms rather than empirical variograms since the models fit the variogram using parameters based on normality when input data are not adequate to extract parameters or are not normally distributed many uncertainties occur ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 yoon and bae 2013 recently machine learning methods such as neural network based methods that have the ability to create strong and accurate nonlinear relationships of input and output variables have been performed to consider the effect of geographical variables on adjusted radar qpes chen et al 2011 yu et al 2017 in addition a fuzzy inference system has been used to adjust radar data with geographical variables silver et al 2020 and is known to be one of the best solutions to quantify the effect of related factors on phenomena sen 2009 to consider the effect of these factors a fuzzy inference system fis can be implemented to adopt a membership function mf kluska 2009 since the mf determines the contribution of input to output variables with various nonlinear functions it is powerful for quantifying the effectiveness of vague input on output and provides flexibility to fis that is not available in other methods the most critical part of fis is the determination of mf but there is no systematic approach to determining the shape and threshold of mf medsker 1995 therefore the mf is commonly determined based on the expert s decision with an empirical experiment since there is not enough experimental data to support mf for most regions and the expert s decision is only dependent on experience there is a high degree of uncertainty and error when using the fis therefore to overcome this limitation an adaptive fuzzy inference system anfis has been applied in many fields shu and ouarda 2008 yeom and kwak 2019 babanezhad et al 2020 anfis is a hybrid framework that is obtained by combining the concepts of fis and artificial neural networks anns anfis combines the advantages of anns to find nonlinear relationships between input and output without expert knowledge and the advantages of fis to use mf polykretis et al 2019 it performs better than either of the two individual methods shu and ouarda 2008 in addition the combination of anfis with particle swarm optimization pso leads to an improved optimization performance of anfis and due to this advantage it is widely applied in hydrological fields azad et al 2019 shahabi et al 2021 anfis pso is a promising approach for radar rainfall adjustment with geographical variables for the abovementioned reasons but thus far to the best of our knowledge no study in the radar rainfall adjustment field based on anfis pso has been conducted this study pursues two main objectives design a new approach of weather radar adjustment for heavy rainfall events by using the anfis pso algorithm to achieve accurate qpe in each grid and investigate the effect of geographical variables on the weather radar adjustment model 2 study area and data preprocessing 2 1 study area in this research three radar stations with different geographical conditions were considered in south korea the kwanaksan kwk study area is located in the northwest the average elevation is 217 m and the highest elevation is 1485 m above sea level the gwangdeoksan gdk is located in the north and most of this area is mountainous with an average elevation of 361 m and a maximum elevation of 1728 m both sides of this study area are connected to the sea the third radar is gudeoksan psn which is located in the southeast and is affected by sea conditions the average and maximum elevations in this area are 230 and 1925 m respectively the location of the radars study area and distribution of ground gauge stations indicated by the green color are shown in fig 1 in the study area of the kwk gdk and psn radar stations 155 130 and 78 gauge stations were selected to adjust the radar qpe respectively 2 2 data collection and preprocessing according to the definition of heavy rainfall by swain et al 2018 nine events were selected among the periods that showed the highest amounts of rainfall in each year rainfall events of type 1 type 2 and type 3 were assigned these assignments represent heavy rainfall in several consecutive 10 minute hour and day time steps without stop respectively and heavy rainfall is recorded during these events for 3 years 2018 2019 and 2020 the reason for considering these types of rainfall is that the analysis of geographical variables is affected by the duration of rainfall and by selecting events with different durations especially type 3 events the effect of geographic variables on the adjustment of radar for rainfall events of different durations can be evaluated therefore type 3 rainfall events have the longest duration of rainfall and type 1 events have the shortest duration of rainfall the observed rainfall data from the automatic weather station aws were gathered from the korea meteorological administration kma then the accumulative rainfall amount for each event was calculated as shown in table 1 because the cumulative rainfall distribution is different at different stations for each event it is not possible to report the amount of rainfall for all stations for each event for this reason the minimum and maximum accumulated rainfall values recorded at the rain gauge stations are presented in table 1 the quality controlled radar data for selected events were collected from the kma in this study radar data including nine plan position indicators ppis ranging from 0 4 to 15 were used ppi is composed of 360 bins that correspond to 360 azimuths from 0 5 to 359 5 the complete volume of radar data is presented every 5 min the radar beamwidth is 1 with a 1 km bin length which affects the radar range by approximately 240 km however based on studies of the quality of radar rainfall in the korean peninsula the quality of radar data is only acceptable until 120 km yoon et al 2012 therefore the radar reflectivity data were extracted to obtain constant altitude ppi cappi at an elevation of 1 5 km as the best altitude by using the bilinear interpolation method based on mohr and vaughan 1979 in this study to convert radar reflectivity z to precipitation r the marshall palmer m p equation which is widely applied in south korea yoo et al 2016 kim et al 2021 is used as indicated in eq 1 1 z 200 r 1 6 o r r z 200 1 1 6 based on studies conducted in these regions elevation has been introduced as an important parameter for the amount of precipitation um et al 2010 2011 yoon et al 2015 the aspect variable is affected by the direction of the wind and the aspects that oppose the direction of the wind are more likely to receive rainfall according to the characteristics of monsoon precipitation at this time this rainfall is from the south and southwest directions lee et al 2015 qian et al 2002 the effects of slope on precipitation are positive and usually considered to the effects of slope on the speed of the air mass horizontal wind and cooling of the air mass the distance from the sea reflects the effect of sea conditions on rainfall and based on a study in south korea by rim 2010 there is an inverse relationship between precipitation and distance from the sea except in july to date no studies have been conducted on the relationship between the type of curvature and precipitation in south korea but these variables can reflect the effect of orography in each region meseguer ruiz et al 2019 the positive negative and zero values of curvature indicate that the surface is convex concave and linear at that cell respectively based on these studies six important geographical variables related to precipitation were selected all these variables except distance from the sea were obtained from the digital elevation model dem the dem data with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the ministry of environment 3 methodology the overall procedures of this research are indicated in fig 2 geographical variables were derived from dem and observed rainfall data were collected then heavy rainfall events were selected according to the observed rainfall and accumulated rainfall from radar was calculated by the m p then the observed data were divided into two sections for training and validation of the anfis pso model as an input for the model and testing data as a target for measuring the accuracy of the model the anfis model was also used for evaluation as a reference to compare with the results of the anfi pso model after creating the model evaluation of the model performance and analysis of the effectiveness of geographical variables on radar rainfall adjustment were conducted the model created by anfis and anfis pso was built and separately optimized for each heavy rainfall event and the inputs of the model were the six geographic variables and accumulated radar rainfall data in training rain gauge stations after building the optimized model the inputs which included six geographic variables and radar rainfall data of the entire study area in each grid with a resolution of 1 1 km were entered into the model to adjust the radar rainfall for each grid 3 1 concept of the hybrid anfis pso algorithm fis designs a procedure with input output fuzzy sets that are created by if then rules armaghani et al 2015 fuzzy rules are defined based on the experience and knowledge of experts and have the ability to quantify vague knowledge and reasoning proceedings eqs 2 and 3 show the takagi and sugeno tks fuzzy rules one popular type of fuzzy rules the vague knowledge x and y is quantified using mf and the quantified values are used to estimate the contribution w i of each output the output f i of each rule is estimated with parameters for output p i q i r i the final output f is estimated with the output and its contribution the gaussian mf function was used to indicate the degree of belonging of set members for the application of fuzzy rules the shape of the mf and parameters for output should be decided based on expert knowledge based on this process vague knowledge can be utilized quantitatively to estimate target variables despite the advantages of the fuzzy method the main limitation of fuzzy systems is that they are highly dependent on expert decisions and there is no standard procedure for converting vague knowledge into a fuzzy rule that causes high uncertainty in predicting output 2 r u l e 1 i f x i s a 1 a n d y i s b 1 t h e n f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 3 r u l e 2 i f x i s a 2 a n d y i s b 2 t h e n f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 4 f w 1 f 1 w 2 f 2 w 1 w 2 therefore to overcome these limitations it is necessary to choose methods for tuning the mf to improve the performance of the model output liu et al 2013 the anfis model is a multilayer feed forward network that is able to systematically create the mf achieving the best values of these coefficients is one of the key points in the anfis training process in general the structure of the anfis consists of five layers which is shown schematically jang 1993 in fig 3 the iteration is continued in five layers of the anfis to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy rules and find the best shape of the mf kluska 2009 awan and bae 2016 therefore during the anfis process a strong structure is constructed based on a dataset without the need for expertise about available data fig 3 shows a simplification for two input variables with two clusters while the proposed technique uses six geographical variables and the radar rainfall values as inputs in the first layer the crisp values of the input dataset are fuzzified using gaussian mfs for example output i 1 is the output of the ith node of layer 1 x or y is input node i and ai or bi 2 is the label associated with this node therefore output i 1 is the membership grade of fuzzy set a1 a2 b1 b2 5 output i 1 μ ai x i 1 2 6 output i 1 μ b i 2 y i 3 4 gaussian function as a mf μ a i can be measured as 7 μ a i x exp 1 2 x c i σ i 2 where x and y are the inputs of ith nodes and μ ai x and μ b i 2 y are mfs σ i c i are the standard deviation of gaussian distribution and the coefficients conditioning factors respectively the second layer measures the quantity of the firing strengths of the rules 8 output i 2 w i μ ai x μ bi y i 1 2 where w i is the firing strength of a rule for the ith node the third layer uses a set of fixed nodes to normalize the strength of all the rules 9 output i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 the fourth layer computes the required entry by using a linear equation for the final layer and can be described as 10 output i 4 w i f i w i p i n q i y r i i 1 2 where w i denotes the ith normalized firing strength and p i q i and r i are the set of components referred to as consequent components the fifth layer is the final layer of anfis and in this layer all of the output values of the fourth layer are gathered and indicate the final result of anfis 11 output i 5 i 1 2 w i f i i 1 2 w j f i w 1 w 2 training and updating the model parameters are the important parts of the anfis training of the anfis is usually based on gradient descent at times the results of gradient descent may be captured in a local minimum due to the dependence on the initial values of the parameters liu et al 2013 shahnazar et al 2017 one of the common techniques for avoiding these problems is the alternation of gradient descent with other optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso recent studies have shown that the performance of the anfis is greatly improved by combination with pso seydi ghomsheh et al 2007 liu et al 2013 azad et al 2019 samanataray and sahoo 2021 the pso algorithm developed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 is a metaheuristic algorithm that has powerful outcomes in the optimization of nonlinear issues and has relatively low calculation cost instant convergence and admissible results in several study fields razavi termeh et al 2018 in the pso algorithm there is a swarm of particles moving in the n dimensional space and each particle is adjusted based on the particle experience and its best neighbor experience gordan et al 2016 particle location and velocity are two main features of pso x i j and v i j indicate the location and velocity of the ith particle at the jth iteration respectively in each iteration the location and velocity are updated using eqs 12 and 13 and the best location p i j 1 of each particle is updated by comparing the existing best location p i j and updated location x i j 1 in eq 14 the best global location g i j 1 is selected in the best locations of each particle in eq 15 these iterations are continued until the global location demonstrates a desirable performance because this method is based on a number of particles the local minima are rarely selected as output 12 v i j 1 ω â v i j c 1 d 1 p i j x i j c 2 d 2 g i j x i j 13 x i j 1 x i j

weights and coefficients were adopted in the pso algorithm d 1 and d 2 are random values between 0 1 and ns represents the number of particles h is the fitness function that calculates the closeness of the locations of particles and the optimum solution 3 2 design of the weather radar adjustment method based on anfis pso in this section the design and configuration of the anfis pso model is shown according to the input and output data for this purpose three types of data including geographical variables accumulated radar rainfall and accumulated observed rainfall data for the whole duration of each event were considered for the input of the model accumulated radar rainfall data and geographical variables were used to obtain adjusted radar rainfall for the whole study area observational data were used as target data for training the model and data from all observed stations were randomly divided 80 of the data were used for training and validation and 20 were used for testing in terms of the training validation and testing subsets the training dataset was used to fine tune the anfis and anfis pso by adjusting the parameter values of the fuzzy rules the validation dataset was used to obtain optimal parameters and determine the stopping point for model training by avoiding overfitting or underfitting of the model for the training dataset finally the testing dataset was used to evaluate the performances of the m p anfis and anfis pso furthermore one of the ideal methods to address the limitations of small datasets is k fold cross validation which plays the role of standardization for estimating the performance of the model lee et al 2020 wong and yeh 2020 yadav and shukla 2016 although this type of stratified random sampling increases the computation time very strong performance is achieved wei et al 2021 in this study k was set to 4 therefore in each step one subdata fold is considered to be the validation data 20 of the whole dataset while the other k 1 subdata folds are entered into the model for training 60 of the whole dataset in the design of the anfis pso model fuzzy c means fcm clustering as a popular fuzzy clustering algorithm kisi et al 2018 was applied to generate the initial mf the fcm algorithm can affect the number of clusters and thus the number of generated rules in this study to achieve optimal clustering and create a basic fuzzy system the fcm algorithm available in the matlab software was used for this purpose there are two fcm parameters that are needed to find the optimal value the number of clusters and the degree of fuzzy overlap partition matrix u to calculate the optimum number of clusters the elbow method which is very popular was applied for the elbow method an appropriate cluster was selected based on the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned center distortion furthermore to adjust the fuzzy overlap in fcm clustering the data points with maximum membership values must be found fuzzy overlap shows the number of fuzzy cluster boundaries to quantify the degree of fuzzy overlap the average of the maximum membership values across all data points was calculated after the calculation of the optimal number of clusters and matrix u the fcm algorithm was utilized so that the objective function reached the minimum threshold by updating the centers of each cluster additionally a gaussian distribution was selected for the shape of the mf because they prepare the most adequate choice of membership functions in the measurements in this procedure the parameters c σ of the gaussian membership function which determine the shape of the mf are adjusted by the anfis and anfis pso algorithms finally the most efficient form of mf is created to elaborate the effect of input variables on the adjusted rainfall data in this study to correctly compare the performance of the optimization algorithms and select the error norms one objective function root mean squared error was used in both the anfis and pso optimization algorithms to minimize the error function i e the error rate between the adjusted data and the observed data from the rain gauge stations 3 3 sensitivity analysis of geographical variables for radar rainfall adjustment the anfis pso model is formed based on data training so it can provide significant information such as the behavior of geographical variables and the contribution of these variables to radar rainfall adjustment in this study an attempt is made to provide an approach that identifies the relationships of geographical variables to the adjustment of radar qpe to investigate how much anfis pso involved the impact of geographical variables on the adjustment of radar rainfall the correlation coefficient cc between the geographical variables and the amount of rainfall estimated by the m p and anfis pso models were calculated these data were extracted for the entire study area in grids with a resolution of 1 km to avoid distracting from the main results the pixels that were estimated to have zero rainfall after adjustments were made were not used in the calculations regarding the calculation of the ccs of the curvatures due to the existence of negative and positive ranges in these variables the data were divided into two parts positive and negative data this separation helps to determine the degree of positive or negative correlation with the type of curvature and how correlation changes with changes in the shape of the surface this section examines how the correlation between adjusted rainfall and geographical data increased after adjustment additionally to determine the output sensitivity based on each geographical variable the change in adjusted rainfall based on the change in each geographical variable was analyzed the changes in the values of geographical variables lead to changes in the adjusted rainfall by using this method we can quantify the impact of each variable in adjusting radar rainfall to avoid disturbing the interdependency of geographical variables the target variable was changed from its range and the rest of the variables were held constant middle of their range values to compare the sensitivity of adjusted radar rainfall based on geographical variables between all events sensitivity was normalized using eq 16 16 sensitivityratio m a x r adj i m i n r adj i m a x r adj all 100 where m a x r adj i and m i n r adj i are the maximum and minimum amounts of adjusted rainfall values based on changes in the ith geographical variable mm for each event m a x r adj all is the maximum amount of adjusted rainfall value in that event mm 3 4 performance measures one of the most important parts of performing each model is evaluation of the model the results of m p anfis and anfis pso at the test gauges were compared with observation data the evaluation is carried out using three metrics as shown in eqs 17 19 the correlation coefficient r mean absolute percentage error mape and root mean squared error rmse were utilized 17 r x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 18 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 19 mape 1 n i 1 n x i y i x i 100 where n is the number of samples x i are the observed values y i are the estimated values and x i are the mean of the observed values 4 results 4 1 construction of the anfis and anfis pso models in this section the performance results based on the implementation of the radar rainfall adjustment model are shown the description of the characteristics and final fine tuned parameters of anfis and anfis pso are shown in table 2 as observed from table 2 the number of optimum clusters is between 5 and 7 after the number of clusters exceeds this range the distortion did not change significantly with an increasing number of clusters additionally as the number of clusters increased the results of the models showed that the best performance was achieved using 5 7 clusters according to the number of clusters a value of 1 5 was considered for the u matrix parameter therefore the average maximum values of the members ranged from 0 81 to 0 90 the average maximum membership value provides a quantitative description of the overlap with higher values indicating less fuzzy overlap fig 4 shows the rate of convergence curves based on the objective function for the training testing and validation datasets based on 1000 iterations for three type 1 events using the anfis pso model iterations were stopped to prevent under and overfitting of the selected models based on the values of the validation dataset the value of the objective function for the validation dataset was fixed and the error rate was at a minimum training iterations were stopped if the rate of change of the error for the validation data did not exceed 0 1 and this value should not start increasing compared to the previous 10 iterations for this reason the stop point for the kwk dataset fig 4a was chosen to be approximately 340 iterations for the gdk data fig 4b approximately 250 iterations and for the psn data fig 4c approximately 300 iterations due to the large difference in the spatial distribution of precipitation data the error rate of the validation data is very noisy at the first steps table 3 shows the performance of the anfis and anfis pso models based on the training and validation datasets the results show that while the nature of the rainfall data is very scattered and noisy the behavior and error of the test and validation datasets are similar and the model has reached an optimum calibration level according to the implementation of the models the performance of the anfis and anfis pso models for the two types of training and validation datasets is shown in table 3 4 2 spatial analysis of radar heavy rainfall after adjustment in this section the spatial distributions of accumulated rainfall data by the m p and anfis pso are compared with the observed rainfall data at the testing station to validate the spatial distribution of the adjusted rainfall data fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of accumulated radar rainfall data using the m p and anfis pso in type 1 events short duration at three radar stations the colors in the figures show the rainfall amounts estimated by the m p and anfis pso the positions and sizes of the red circles indicate the location and amount of observed rainfall at the testing station respectively therefore circles with a larger diameter should be located in dark blue or brown areas where heavy rainfall has occurred and stations with a smaller diameter should be located in light colored areas as the spatial distribution of rainfall shows in fig 5 the largest amount of rainfall for type 1 events occurred north of kwk east of gdk and at the center of psn in the spatial patterns of the m p most of the large circles were located in light colored areas but in the spatial patterns of anfis pso most of the large circles were located in dark blue areas the largest amount of observed rainfall at the testing station in the dark blue regions was 150 mm 205 mm and 76 mm respectively while the amount of rainfall estimated by the m p was 44 mm 20 mm and 27 mm respectively anfis pso was able to adjust these amounts to 136 mm 162 mm and 84 mm respectively which are much closer to the observed rainfall data the rainfall distribution by the m p underestimates the rainfall range especially the heavy rainfall range so it is difficult to distinguish rainfall between regions with low and high rainfall however anfis pso accurately adjusts the amount of rainfall other types of events have similar conditions and the anfis pso adjustment method could create a precise spatial distribution of rainfall that corresponds to the observed rainfall of the test station 4 3 quantitative analysis of radar heavy rainfall after adjustment in this section the amount of rainfall by anfis pso compared to the m p was quantitatively analyzed using scatter plots and statistics fig 6 shows a scatter plot in which the x axis is the observed accumulative rainfall at the test gauge stations and the y axis is the estimated accumulative rainfall as fig 6 shows the m p blue points underestimates the amount of rainfall at all stations and cannot achieve accurate rainfall estimates under heavy rainfall conditions especially in type 3 events which have large amounts of rainfall the rainfall estimated by the m p showed a larger error than in other cases in other words the m p is inefficient for heavy rainfall in contract adjustment by anfis pso green points can significantly modify these calculations and the adjusted rainfall data are close to the gauge observation data to compare the performance of models depending on the rainfall range test stations were divided into three categories based on the rank of observed rainfall amounts by dotted lines as shown in fig 6 as the results show one z r relation cannot account for the whole region and the coefficients of the z r relation will be different for each region at low rainfall stations the m p method shows an acceptable performance but with an increasing amount of rainfall this performance is severely weakened and the error rate increases the average mape for stations with less rainfall is 50 that for medium rainfall stations is 64 and that for stations with high rainfall is 68 however this value for the anfis pso model is 49 for the first category 20 for the second category and 15 for the third category which indicates that the performance of the anfis pso in heavy rainfall is more efficient than in low rainfall table 4 shows the statistical performances of the m p anfis and anfis pso a comparison of the results between the m p and anfis pso showed that the anfis pso method could noticeably reduce errors in the qpe therefore based on the average rmse the improvement percentages of the anfis pso in types 1 2 and 3 were approximately 60 71 and 71 respectively additionally in most events the amount of r increased after adjusting the radar qpe a comparison of the results between anfis and anfis pso showed that anfis pso has a better performance than anfis in other words the optimization process used in anfis pso is effective therefore the anfis pso model can be considered a premise adjustment method for heavy rainfall and a sophisticated method due to its better performance than anfis 4 4 sensitivity of geographical variables to radar rainfall in this subsection the effect of geographical variables on the adjustment of radar rainfall was analyzed by the cc and sensitivity ratio there are two types of ccs the cc between the geographical variables and rainfall estimated from the m p and the other is the cc between the geographical variables and rainfall from anfis pso the increasing amount of cc between the geographical variables and rainfall after weather radar adjustment indicates the contribution of geographical variables to the adjustment additionally the sensitivity ratio was calculated to investigate the effect of each geographical variable separately the sensitivity ratio shows how each geographical variable can be effective in adjusting radar rainfall therefore any geographical variable that has a higher sensitivity ratio based on table 4 indicates that it is more effective in adjusting radar rainfall table 5 shows the inaverage absolute cc the inaverage absolute ccs of the slope aspect elevation and distance from the sea variables increased by 0 04 0 03 0 11 and 0 05 respectively after radar rainfall adjustment this increase for negative and positive plan curvatures of 0 02 and 0 08 respectively and profile curvatures of 0 06 and 0 02 respectively therefore all the average cc values of anfis pso were greater than those of the m p these increases in the ccs indicate that the contributions of geographical variables were improved for radar rainfall adjustment among the geographical variables elevation has the highest cc with the amount of rainfall distance from the sea was the next geographical variable that was effective in adjusting radar rainfall the slope aspect plan and profile curvature variables have low ccs and did not show noticeable changes in the cc after adjusting the radar qpe the value of the sensitivity ratio is shown in table 5 this sensitivity percentage represents the percentage of change in adjusted rainfall based on the change in each geographical variable from minimum to maximum the results of the sensitivity ratio are very similar to the results of the cc as a result the output of the model has the highest sensitivity rate to elevation which is 28 7 the distance from the sea at 12 0 is the second most effective variable adjusted rainfall has 6 0 9 0 sensitivity to the slope aspect plan and profile curvature variables and these amounts can also be useful in distinguishing between different conditions therefore consideration of these variables leads to a more accurate adjustment of the radar qpe additionally the results of table 5 show that with increasing rainfall duration the sensitivity of adjusted rainfall to geographic variables increases and shows that geographic variables are more effective in adjusting radar qpe for type 3 events than for type 1 events fig 7 illustrates the changes in the adjusted radar qpe anfis pso output based on changes in the geographical variables in the gdk in the type 1 event based on this figure the adjusted rainfall has a positive relationship with elevation and it is more sensitive to changes in elevation after 400 m additionally adjusted rainfall has a positive relationship with slope especially between 15 and 20 as well as a plan curvature between 2 and 5 the profile curvature is sensitive to adjusted rainfall near zero the effects of aspect and distance from the sea are relatively low and nonsignificant therefore the sensitivity shows nearly a horizontal line without any special changes the sensitivity analysis of other events also showed that although the behavior of radar adjustment based on geographical variables was different in some specific areas the overall trend was similar for example this trend was always positive and had the highest sensitivity analysis value for the variable of elevation and in most cases it was the lowest value for the aspect variable this result demonstrates a relationship between geographical variables and adjusted radar rainfall and the relationship was extracted based on training from data it is possible to explore the range of geographical variables that are effective for radar rainfall adjustment in the area of interest and it is possible to quantitatively present the sensitivity of each variable therefore the anfis pso methodology proposed in this study is not only effective for radar rainfall adjustment considering regional characteristics such as the effective range of geographical variables to rainfall but can also provide meaningful information for understanding the causal links between geographical variables and radar rainfall 5 discussion this study first proposed a method to adjust radar rainfall by considering 6 geographical variables with anfis pso and improved the performance of radar rainfall in particular the spatial distribution and amount of heavy rainfall were captured in the results well and the contribution of geographical variables was clearly represented by correlations and sensitivities therefore it can be concluded that the anfis pso is a promising approach for radar rainfall adjustment and understanding the causal link between geographical variables and rainfall estimates pso algorithm was applied for improving performance of anfis and reducing probability of being stuck in local minimum and preventing overfitting according to the values mentioned in tables 3 and 4 the pso optimization algorithm was able to show better performance than the backpropagation optimization algorithm used in anfis this study shows that a hybrid computing methodology incorporating the features of the anfis architecture and pso algorithms improved the performance of the model in adjusting radar rainfall in the process of anfis pso the relationship between geographical variables and radar rainfall was extracted for a better understanding this result was compared with the results of previous literature for the sensitivity elevation and distance from the sea showed the highest sensitivity and other variables showed less sensitivity in previous studies rainfall estimates also showed high sensitivity to elevation and distance from the sea but slope aspect and curvature were less effective terms for rainfall than elevation and distance rim 2010 um et al 2010 meseguer ruiz et al 2019 in addition the results showed that with increasing rainfall duration in type 3 events the effect of the variable on adjusted radar rainfall increased especially for elevation and distance from the sea which is consistent with um et al 2011 additionally the results of this study showed that elevation and slope are positively correlated with the amount of rainfall in most events and these results are consistent with the literature um et al 2010 2011 the distance from the sea showed positive and negative relationships depending on events as mentioned by rim 2010 aspect does not have a significant relationship with rainfall perhaps because of the rotation of wind in basins as suggested by lee et al 2015 all different aspects are affected by rainfall and it is not possible to distinguish the probability of rainfall in a particular aspect because of the evaluation of limited events in this study and the lack of literature regarding the effect of curvature on rainfall a detailed explanation of the meteorological mechanisms of curvature variables can be very difficult and is accompanied by uncertainties however according to studies on curvature the results regarding the effect of curvature on rainfall meseguer ruiz et al 2019 encourage us to consider these variables therefore it may be suggested that the mechanism of the variable of curvature can affect the amount of rainfall recorded in each region by changing the wind direction in most of the studies rainfall is considered vertical while the change in rainfall distribution near the surface especially in mountainous areas is due to the effect of wind direction and speed bradley et al 1997 investigated the effect of wind flow on barriers and showed that under certain conditions increased precipitation can occur on the leeward side of the range additionally some studies have shown that wind may produce significant horizontal rainfall in addition to the vertical component measured by rain gauges orlandini and lamberti 2000 additionally the curvature by affecting the amount of air humidity and changing the speed of air mass ascent may have an effect on the amount of rainfall recorded the results of this study show that positive curvature values laterally convex at plan curvature and upwardly concave at profile curvature have the highest probability rather than negative values laterally concave at plan curvature and upwardly convex at profile curvature and the amount of precipitation reduces around zero linear surface in both types of curvature therefore the higher absolute values of the curvature have a greater impact on rainfall the obtained results of this study show consistency with the previous literature this result reveals that the model can appropriately consider relationships between geographical variables and precipitation without any additional studies to analyze those relationships additionally quantitative and reliable behavioral patterns for each variable can be extracted to understand the causal links between input and output therefore this model is a promising measure not only to adjust rainfall but also to analyze the relationship between input and output despite the advantages of this model there are limitations to be improved upon in the future first more comprehensive validation is needed the anfis pso models were constructed by each event even though the model showed an acceptable performance for testing stations the model was not validated for independent events with the training dataset validation with independent events is important since the study area is affected by various types of rainfall events such as typhoons and asian monsoons such comprehensive validation must be verified with a large number of events therefore it is necessary to study radar adjustments based on anfis pso in the future through additional data acquisition and model improvement by considering various types of rainfall events the second limitation is the type of model output which is the accumulated rainfall this limitation undermines the advantages of radar rainfall which have a high temporal resolution most applications of radar rainfall utilize time series data rather than accumulated data therefore the output of this model has limitations in the context of the demand for this type of use because the proposed model showed an acceptable performance for accumulated rainfall it is expected to be applicable to estimating rainfall time series in the future the model will be expanded to simulate rainfall time series although the anfis pso method has been used in other fields of study attention to the unique characteristics of the region the type of input data in the spatial distribution of precipitation that has high dispersion the advantages of the fuzzy system and the characteristics of anfis pso in this method have led to the successful implementation of a new approach in the field of weather radar adjustment because this study is the first application of anfis pso to the radar adjustment field there are the above limitations to consider therefore there is large potential for this approach to be expanded to the whole field of radar adjustment 6 conclusion in this study a powerful data driven model named anfis pso and a geographical variable based radar rainfall adjustment method were proposed and the effectiveness of the model was proven for this purpose the performance of anfis pso in radar rainfall adjustment was calculated and the sensitivity was analyzed using nine heavy rainfall events this study validated the significant performance of anfis pso for radar adjustment with geographical variables and discovered the possibility of using the model for analyzing geographical variables with rainfall the results of the spatial distribution and statistical comparison of rainfall showed that the use of the anfis pso method in adjusting radar rainfall leads to an accurate estimate of the amount of heavy rainfall at any point the results of the sensitivity analysis also make it possible to identify and extract the relationship between geographical variables and rainfall depending on the effective range the sensitivity result extracted from the data can suggest a meaningful range of each geographical variable on rainfall therefore this model can be directly utilized to better understand the relationship between geographical variables and adjust weather rainfall data this study is the first to use the anfis based method in this field and consider the effect of geographical variables on heavy rainfall events therefore due to the ability of this method to consider the effect of geographic variables in radar adjustment this method can be utilized in areas such as mountainous regions that are highly affected by spatial variables credit authorship contribution statement alireza oliaye conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

2481,the land ocean aquatic continuum is affected notably by damming yet the effects of changing dissolved organic carbon doc and optical properties in the reservoir zone of dammed rivers on the downstream waterbodies remain unclear this was studied in the minjiang river se china in the normal wet and dry seasons using the measurements of doc absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission matrices parallel factor analysis eems parafac the doc and absorption spectral slope s 275 295 increased while the absorption coefficient a 280 and doc specific uv absorbance suva254 decreased in the surface water of the reservoir this indicated removals of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom and potential additions of autochthonous constituents with lower aromaticity and molecular weight the discharge of more humified doc from the middle and deep outlets of the reservoir was evident in the adjacent downstream station in the wet season the doc and optical indices were generally stable in the downstream river zone in the normal and dry seasons suggesting that these signals from the reservoir could persist downstream in contrast the downstream doc and cdom showed evident additions in the wet season which might be related to enhanced inputs from the surrounding soils and residential areas in the rainy and hot summer the absorption coefficient and humic like components correlated strongly with salinity in the estuarine zone indicating they were mainly conservative in the estuary of this study this suggested that the refractory doc from the reservoir and river zones could pass the estuary and contribute to the carbon storage in the coastal ocean in contrast the protein like components did not correlate significantly with salinity indicating more active modifications of labile constituents in the estuary overall our results have implications for assessing the effects of damming on doc and optical properties across the land ocean aquatic continuum keywords dissolved organic matter reservoir river estuary absorption spectroscopy eems parafac data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the land ocean aquatic continuum from freshwater to the coastal ocean is a critical linkage between the biogeochemical cycle and ecosystem of land and ocean this continuum is not only a pathway for the export of large amounts of water sediments nutrients organic matter and pollutants but also an active reactor for processing materials through a series of physical chemical and biological processes dai 2021 regnier et al 2022 the land ocean continuum is increasingly perturbed by the dam building and hydropower facility operation resulting in the shift of the upstream waterbodies from free flow river paths to reservoirs humborg et al 1997 grill et al 2019 over 100 billion tons of sediments are estimated to settle down before the dams worldwide resulting in the deposition of associated carbon and nutrients syvitski et al 2005 dethier et al 2022 the increasing water residence time and the lowering sediment concentration are favorable for algal production and even blooms in the reservoir zone of the dammed rivers hong et al 2012 thus it is important to assess the effects of damming in the land ocean continuum which represents an important type of human activity that changes the land ocean material flux dissolved organic matter dom contains a large pool of dissolved organic carbon doc and is ubiquitously present in natural environments and water wastewater treatment plants which plays important role in aquatic biogeochemistry ecosystem functioning and water safety ishii and boyer 2012 shi et al 2021 the fluvial export of doc is an important component in the terrestrial and marine carbon flux while the photo and microbial degradation of doc into co2 affects the water air co2 flux battin et al 2008 cory et al 2014 in particular the transport and transformation of dom and associated doc in the river estuary coastal continuum can be also disturbed by the damming the algal production in the surface water of the reservoir zone may introduce fresh and generally biologically labile autochthonous constituents e g protein like materials to the doc pool hong et al 2012 in contrast the microbial activities in the middle and deep waters of the reservoir may transform labile constituents to refractory dom and it is hypothesized that these refractory dom can be transported downstream and contribute to carbon storage in the coastal ocean wang et al 2021 qu et al 2022 however there is limited evidence to date for this hypothesis which warrants testing with a systematic investigation spanning from the reservoir zone to the downstream waters in particular the content of bulk dom can be assessed with the doc concentration and the absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission matrices parallel factor analysis eems parafac are the most widely used techniques that can track the chromophoric dom cdom and different fluorescent components coble 2007 fellman et al 2010 ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2013 wünsch et al 2019 they also provide a series of optical indices for the aromaticity molecular weight humification degree and source of dom zsolnay et al 1999 weishaar et al 2003 helms et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 massicotte et

river estuary continuum the minjiang river is the largest subtropical river in se china which has a long term freshwater discharge of 57 6 billion m3 year 1 that ranks 3rd in all chinese rivers https www mwr gov cn the hydrology and biogeochemistry of minjiang river are strongly affected by the damming in the middle stream that forms a 100 km reservoir zone the shuikou reservoir wang et al 2020 our previous study showed increasing particulate organic matter due to fish farming and algal growth in the reservoir zone wang et al 2020 a recent study on the vertical distribution of dom revealed the production of refractory dom in the middle and deep shuikou reservoir qu et al 2022 however less is known about the horizontal changes of doc and optical properties in the reservoir and whether such changes can persist till the downstream waters therefore this study aims to 1 examine the horizontal variations of doc and optical properties in the reservoir zone under the coupled influences of the dam and seasonal hydrological change and 2 assess the influences on doc and optical properties in the downstream river and estuarine zone based on the stability versus changes during the downstream flowing and estuarine mixing the results would have implications for a better understanding of the effects of damming and hydropower facility operation on the doc and optical properties in the land ocean aquatic continuum 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection surface water samples were collected from 18 stations a1 a18 in the minjiang river in april july and december 2018 fig 1

star a meter 2 2 doc and optical measurements the concentration of doc and optical properties of dom were measured following the methods described previously yang et al 2017 zhuang et al 2021 briefly the doc was measured using the high temperature catalytic oxidation method with a shimadzu toc l analyzer after acidification and oxygen purging to remove dissolved inorganic carbon the absorption spectra of cdom were determined with a techcomp 1780 uv vis spectrometer by scanning the absorbance over 240 800 nm with milli q water as the blank the measured absorbance values were baseline corrected by subtracting the mean absorbance at 700 800 nm and the absorption coefficient at 280 nm a 280 was used to indicate the level of cdom it is noteworthy that the a 280 correlated strongly with the absorption coefficients at 254 and 355 nm in this study a 254 1 24 a 280 0 77 r 0 999 a 355 0 44 a 280 1 00 r 0 988 the doc specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and the spectral slope

were scanned for the dom filtrates with a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer yang et al 2017 zhuang et al 2021 the wavelengths of excitation ex and emission em were 240 450 and 280 600 nm respectively each eem was corrected for inner filter effects based on the absorbance data over 240 600 nm for each sample kothawala et al 2013 then the fluorescence response of blank milli q water was subtracted from the eems of dom samples all 69 eems in this study were modeled using parallel factor analysis parafac in matlab 7 0 with the domfluor toolbox 1 7 stedmon and bro 2008 three eems for the a17 station in the meihua fishing harbor in all months were identified as outliers and were excluded from the subsequent modeling following the procedure of stedmon and bro 2008 the split half validation was used for determining the number of parafac components and the fluorescence intensity f max was used as the index for the level of each component two classical fluorescence indices humification index hix and biological index bix were also calculated for indicating the humic content and biological aquatic bacterial contribution respectively zsolnay et al 1999 huguet et al 2009

caused by the adsorption to particles and the subsequent sinking and or the photochemical degradation bleaching the settle down of particles was supported by the general decrease of total suspended matter tsm downstream in the surface reservoir of this study wang et al 2020 which was consistent with the observations for dammed rivers globally syvitski et al 2005 dethier et al 2022 photo degradation is another process that has been proven to effectively remove cdom spencer et al 2009 and the related chromophoric molecules identified with the ft icr ms harir et al 2022 photo degradation was favored by the decreasing tsm and thus increasing light availability in the reservoir in contrast the increasing level of bulk doc and the decoupling between doc and a 280 could be attributed to the addition of autochthonous constituents from aquatic sources such as phytoplankton and macrophytes e g eichhorniacrassipes that were found to be abundant in the field investigation these changes in the dom quantity indices were accompanied by decreasing suva254 and increasing s 275 295 downstream in the reservoir zone fig 2 this suggested decreases in the aromaticity and average molecular weight of dom in the reservoir due to the potential removal of terrestrial dom with higher aromaticity and average molecular weight weishaar et al 2003 helms et al 2008 the removal processes e g adsorption and photochemical processes could be intensified in the reservoir zone due to the slowing down of water velocity and the increasing water residence time in contrast the freshly produced autochthonous dom generally has lower aromaticity and average molecular weight and the production processes might be enhanced by the increasing light availability due to the settling down of particles and the eutrophication due to inputs of nutrients from the surrounding zones and the fish farming wang et al 2020 these results are consistent with previous studies with optical measurements zhang et al 2009 hong et al 2012 and recent studies with ft icr ms he et al 2022 wen et al 2022 it is noteworthy that the horizontal changes of dom in the surface water are different from that in the middle and deep waters where the photo degradation and algal production are both limited by light and microbial transformation becomes a dominant process although we did not measure the vertical changes of dom in this study recent studies reveal the microbial consumption of labile dom constituents and the production of more humified and refractory dom below the surface of the reservoir wang et al 2021 qu et al 2022 in addition the pca showed lower pc2 values in december than in other months fig 6b d which were related to lower protein like c2 and c4 and indicated lower autochthonous production probably due to lower temperature and less fish farming activity in winter wang et al 2020 the seasonal change of hydrological regimes is another important factor affecting the dom quantity and quality in aquatic environments which is of particular interest in se china which has clear wet summer and dry winter under the influences of east asian monsoon and summer rainstorms hong et al 2012 generally the dom in the minjiang river was characterized by significantly higher doc a 280 humic like components c1 and c3 and hix in july than in april and december figs 2 4 and 5 these changes were also supported by the elevated pc1 values in july in the pca results fig 6c these results are consistent with previous studies that show elevated doc concentration and export due to the enhanced flushing of terrestrial humic substances from the upper soil layers in the wet season and during the rainstorm events fellman et al 2009 pang et al 2020 yang et al 2015 zhuang and yang 2018 in particular the seasonal variability of hydrology is in part modulated by the hydropower operation the flood retention for decreasing the peak flow in the rainy summer would increase the residence time and biogeochemical processing of dom within the reservoir in contrast the flood discharging would increase the export dom to the downstream river and coastal environments pang et al 2020 it should be noted that the annual freshwater discharge of the minjiang river monitored at sites downstream of the reservoir was 34 4 billion m3 in 2018 which was only 60 of the long term freshwater discharge https www mwr gov cn in a such dry year of 2018 the runoffs from the watershed during precipitation events were more likely to be retained in the reservoir for later hydropower operation this was favorable for more processing of terrestrial humic dom and the production of autochthonous constituents in the reservoir zone this was supported by the decreasing a 280 and suva254 while increasing doc and s 275 295 downstream in the reservoir in the rainy summer fig 2 therefore the coupled effects of hydrology and dam are important in the reservoir type river that is different from the freely flowing natural rivers 4 2 implications for doc and optical properties in the downstream river and estuary changes during the transport and the underlying factors the modified dom within the reservoir would be transported downstream with implications for the biogeochemistry and ecosystem of the receiving waterbodies it is reported recently that the microbes below the surface of the reservoir preferentially consume labile dom constituents and produce more humified and refractory dom wang et al 2021 qu et al 2022 the downstream effect was evident in the july investigation in this study when the doc and s 275 295 decreased while a 280 suva254 and hix increased from the a6 station in the reservoir to the adjacent downstream a7 station figs 2 and 5 these results could be attributed to the downstream export of the modified dom through the outlets at the middle to bottom depths yan et al 2021 furthermore the influences of dom from the reservoir on the downstream environments are largely dependent on the stability versus the further modification during the downstream transport the doc and optical indices were generally stable in april and december in the river zone of this study which suggested that they were not modified notably during these months and the signals from the reservoir might be kept until the estuary in contrast doc a 280 and c1 c4 increased to higher values in the river zone a8 a12 than those at a7 in july such addition of doc cdom and fluorescent components in july might result from the intensified leaching and runoff from surrounding soils in the rainy season and the increased wastewater discharge from the residential areas in the hot summer the influence of wastewater in july was most evident at a10 which showed the highest doc and c1 c4 due to the discharge from an urban river in fuzhou city finally the dynamic estuarine zone represents another filter of the doc and optical signals before reaching the coastal ocean kowalczuk et al 2009 guo et al 2014 generally the a 280 humic like c1 and c3 hix and pc1 were lower while s 275 295 was higher in the estuary than in the reservoir and river zones table 1 fig 6 the strong correlations of a 280 and humic like components c1 and c3 with salinity suggested that they were dominated by conservative physical mixing figs 2 and 4 recent studies showed that the cdom and humic like fluorescence are mainly linked to the oxygen rich and unsaturated compounds identified with ft icr ms which are generally resistant to microbial degradation herzsprung et al 2012 stubbins et al 2014 he et al 2022 thus our results suggested that the refractory dom that was produced and exported from the reservoir could contribute to the carbon storage in the receiving waterbodies pang et al 2020 in contrast the insignificant correlations of protein like c2 and c4 with salinity indicated active processing since they could be produced from phytoplankton macrophytes added from the anthropogenic pollution and removed by microbial degradation fig 4 these results are consistent with the molecular level analysis that reveals the production of peptide and sugar like compounds in the eutrophic waters he et al 2022 and the subsequent degradation and transformations to other compounds wen et al 2022 thus our results indicated that the signals of these labile components from the reservoir were likely subject to more evident modification in the estuary the conservative mixing of refractory dom and the active processing of labile dom together resulted in the moderate correlation between the bulk doc and salinity fig 2 overall our results suggested that the influences of hydropower facility operation on the downstream aquatic environments were dependent on a series of factors including the hydrological seasonality the inputs from the surrounding zones e g soils and wastewater autochthonous production and the estuarine filtering 5 conclusions the doc increased while the cdom level decreased with weaker changes in c1 c4 downstream in the surface reservoir the doc cdom and c1 c4 in the downstream river zone were generally stable in the normal and dry seasons but increased in the wet season the doc correlated moderately while cdom and humic like c1 and c3 correlated strongly and the labile protein like c2 and c4 did not correlate with salinity in the estuarine zone these results indicated the removals of cdom and production of autochthonous dom in the surface reservoir the inputs from surrounding areas to the river zone in the wet season and the different behaviors of c1 c4 in the estuary overall the discharge of dom from the reservoir in the wet season would be coupled with further additions in the downstream river zone and the filtering in the estuary allowing the humic constituents finally contribute to the carbon storage in the coastal sea in the normal and dry season the impoundment in the reservoir together with weakened terrestrial flushing in the downstream river zone might limit the export of dom across the reservoir river estuary continuum the applications of more detailed analysis e g ft icr ms and isotopic analysis in the future will provide valuable insights into the responses of dom to damming at the molecular and isotopic levels credit authorship contribution statement wan e zhuang conceptualization writing original draft

2481,the land ocean aquatic continuum is affected notably by damming yet the effects of changing dissolved organic carbon doc and optical properties in the reservoir zone of dammed rivers on the downstream waterbodies remain unclear this was studied in the minjiang river se china in the normal wet and dry seasons using the measurements of doc absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission matrices parallel factor analysis eems parafac the doc and absorption spectral slope s 275 295 increased while the absorption coefficient a 280 and doc specific uv absorbance suva254 decreased in the surface water of the reservoir this indicated removals of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom and potential additions of autochthonous constituents with lower aromaticity and molecular weight the discharge of more humified doc from the middle and deep outlets of the reservoir was evident in the adjacent downstream station in the wet season the doc and optical indices were generally stable in the downstream river zone in the normal and dry seasons suggesting that these signals from the reservoir could persist downstream in contrast the downstream doc and cdom showed evident additions in the wet season which might be related to enhanced inputs from the surrounding soils and residential areas in the rainy and hot summer the absorption coefficient and humic like components correlated strongly with salinity in the estuarine zone indicating they were mainly conservative in the estuary of this study this suggested that the refractory doc from the reservoir and river zones could pass the estuary and contribute to the carbon storage in the coastal ocean in contrast the protein like components did not correlate significantly with salinity indicating more active modifications of labile constituents in the estuary overall our results have implications for assessing the effects of damming on doc and optical properties across the land ocean aquatic continuum keywords dissolved organic matter reservoir river estuary absorption spectroscopy eems parafac data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the land ocean aquatic continuum from freshwater to the coastal ocean is a critical linkage between the biogeochemical cycle and ecosystem of land and ocean this continuum is not only a pathway for the export of large amounts of water sediments nutrients organic matter and pollutants but also an active reactor for processing materials through a series of physical chemical and biological processes dai 2021 regnier et al 2022 the land ocean continuum is increasingly perturbed by the dam building and hydropower facility operation resulting in the shift of the upstream waterbodies from free flow river paths to reservoirs humborg et al 1997 grill et al 2019 over 100 billion tons of sediments are estimated to settle down before the dams worldwide resulting in the deposition of associated carbon and nutrients syvitski et al 2005 dethier et al 2022 the increasing water residence time and the lowering sediment concentration are favorable for algal production and even blooms in the reservoir zone of the dammed rivers hong et al 2012 thus it is important to assess the effects of damming in the land ocean continuum which represents an important type of human activity that changes the land ocean material flux dissolved organic matter dom contains a large pool of dissolved organic carbon doc and is ubiquitously present in natural environments and water wastewater treatment plants which plays important role in aquatic biogeochemistry ecosystem functioning and water safety ishii and boyer 2012 shi et al 2021 the fluvial export of doc is an important component in the terrestrial and marine carbon flux while the photo and microbial degradation of doc into co2 affects the water air co2 flux battin et al 2008 cory et al 2014 in particular the transport and transformation of dom and associated doc in the river estuary coastal continuum can be also disturbed by the damming the algal production in the surface water of the reservoir zone may introduce fresh and generally biologically labile autochthonous constituents e g protein like materials to the doc pool hong et al 2012 in contrast the microbial activities in the middle and deep waters of the reservoir may transform labile constituents to refractory dom and it is hypothesized that these refractory dom can be transported downstream and contribute to carbon storage in the coastal ocean wang et al 2021 qu et al 2022 however there is limited evidence to date for this hypothesis which warrants testing with a systematic investigation spanning from the reservoir zone to the downstream waters in particular the content of bulk dom can be assessed with the doc concentration and the absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission matrices parallel factor analysis eems parafac are the most widely used techniques that can track the chromophoric dom cdom and different fluorescent components coble 2007 fellman et al 2010 ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2013 wünsch et al 2019 they also provide a series of optical indices for the aromaticity molecular weight humification degree and source of dom zsolnay et al 1999 weishaar et al 2003 helms et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 massicotte et al 2017 shi et al 2021 although the optical measurements could not provide direct information at the molecular level recent studies have shown the linkage between optical indices and other advanced characterization e g fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and stable isotope analysis herzsprung et al 2012 stubbins et al 2014 he et al 2022 harir et al 2022 wen et al 2022 thus the applications of doc and optical measurements could provide valuable information on the bulk dom cdom fluorescent components and optical indices based dom composition in the reservoir river estuary continuum the minjiang river is the largest subtropical river in se china which has a long term freshwater discharge of 57 6 billion m3 year 1 that ranks 3rd in all chinese rivers https www mwr gov cn the hydrology and biogeochemistry of minjiang river are strongly affected by the damming in the middle stream that forms a 100 km reservoir zone the shuikou reservoir wang et al 2020 our previous study showed increasing particulate organic matter due to fish farming and algal growth in the reservoir zone wang et al 2020 a recent study on the vertical distribution of dom revealed the production of refractory dom in the middle and deep shuikou reservoir qu et al 2022 however less is known about the horizontal changes of doc and optical properties in the reservoir and whether such changes can persist till the downstream waters therefore this study aims to 1 examine the horizontal variations of doc and optical properties in the reservoir zone under the coupled influences of the dam and seasonal hydrological change and 2 assess the influences on doc and optical properties in the downstream river and estuarine zone based on the stability versus changes during the downstream flowing and estuarine mixing the results would have implications for a better understanding of the effects of damming and hydropower facility operation on the doc and optical properties in the land ocean aquatic continuum 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection surface water samples were collected from 18 stations a1 a18 in the minjiang river in april july and december 2018 fig 1 a corresponding to the normal wet and dry seasons with a monthly precipitation of 56 162 and 27 mm respectively fig 1c the sampling locations covered the reservoir zone upstream the shuikou hydropower station a1 a6 the downstream river zone a7 a12 and the estuarine zone a13 a18 the water samples were filtered through pre combusted at 450 c for 3 h gf f filters the filtrates were stored frozen and in dark before doc measurements and were stored cold 4 c and in dark for absorption and fluorescence measurements within 2 3 days salinity was measured in situ using a handled thermo scientific orion star a meter 2 2 doc and optical measurements the concentration of doc and optical properties of dom were measured following the methods described previously yang et al 2017 zhuang et al 2021 briefly the doc was measured using the high temperature catalytic oxidation method with a shimadzu toc l analyzer after acidification and oxygen purging to remove dissolved inorganic carbon the absorption spectra of cdom were determined with a techcomp 1780 uv vis spectrometer by scanning the absorbance over 240 800 nm with milli q water as the blank the measured absorbance values were baseline corrected by subtracting the mean absorbance at 700 800 nm and the absorption coefficient at 280 nm a 280 was used to indicate the level of cdom it is noteworthy that the a 280 correlated strongly with the absorption coefficients at 254 and 355 nm in this study a 254 1 24 a 280 0 77 r 0 999 a 355 0 44 a 280 1 00 r 0 988 the doc specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and the spectral slope over 275 295 nm s 275 295 was also calculated as indices for the aromaticity and average molecular weight of dom weishaar et al 2003 helms et al 2008 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were scanned for the dom filtrates with a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer yang et al 2017 zhuang et al 2021 the wavelengths of excitation ex and emission em were 240 450 and 280 600 nm respectively each eem was corrected for inner filter effects based on the absorbance data over 240 600 nm for each sample kothawala et al 2013 then the fluorescence response of blank milli q water was subtracted from the eems of dom samples all 69 eems in this study were modeled using parallel factor analysis parafac in matlab 7 0 with the domfluor toolbox 1 7 stedmon and bro 2008 three eems for the a17 station in the meihua fishing harbor in all months were identified as outliers and were excluded from the subsequent modeling following the procedure of stedmon and bro 2008 the split half validation was used for determining the number of parafac components and the fluorescence intensity f max was used as the index for the level of each component two classical fluorescence indices humification index hix and biological index bix were also calculated for indicating the humic content and biological aquatic bacterial contribution respectively zsolnay et al 1999 huguet et al 2009 the pearson correlation analysis paired samples t test for comparing the results of different months independent samples t test for comparing the results of different zones and principal component

the eems in the minjiang river using parafac fig 3 which were comparable with those found in previous studies in the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 c1 displayed two ex maxima at 245 and 315 nm and one em maximum at 441 nm it is similar to a humic like component previously identified to be mainly from terrestrial sources c1 in stedmon et al 2011 c1 in murphy et al 2013 c2 showed ex em maxima at 240 285 353 nm which resembled the tryptophan like component c6 in kowalczuk et al 2009 c5 in yamashita et al 2011 c3 had ex em maxima at 260 395 487 nm similar to another terrestrial humic like component at the longest em wavelength c3 in guéguen et al 2014 c3 in smith et al 2021 c4 had ex em maxima 275 314 nm resembling a tyrosine like component c7 in graeber et al 2012 c1 in du et al 2021

seasonal hydrological change on doc and optical properties the damming and hydropower facility operation is an important human activity that drives notable changes in hydrology and aquatic biogeochemistry syvitski et al 2005 grill et al 2019 dethier et al 2022 wang et al 2021 qu et al 2022 in this study doc generally increased while a 280 decreased downstream from a1 to a6 in the reservoir zone fig 2 although the spatial variations in the reservoir were less evident for fluorescence indices c1 c4 hix and bix figs 4 and 5 the removal of cdom in surface waters was probably caused by the adsorption to particles and the subsequent sinking and or the photochemical degradation bleaching the settle down of particles was supported by the general decrease of total suspended matter tsm downstream in the surface reservoir of this study wang et al 2020 which was consistent with the observations for dammed rivers globally syvitski et al 2005 dethier et al 2022 photo

degradation was favored by the decreasing tsm and thus increasing light availability in the reservoir in contrast the increasing level of bulk doc and the decoupling between doc and a 280 could be attributed to the addition of autochthonous constituents from aquatic sources such as phytoplankton and macrophytes e g eichhorniacrassipes that were found to be abundant in the field investigation these changes in the dom quantity indices were accompanied by decreasing suva254 and increasing s 275 295 downstream in the reservoir zone fig 2 this suggested decreases in the aromaticity and average

and the eutrophication due to inputs of nutrients from the surrounding zones and the fish farming wang et al 2020 these results are consistent with previous studies with optical measurements zhang et

qu et al 2022 in addition the pca showed lower pc2 values in december than in other months fig 6b d which were related to lower protein like c2 and c4 and indicated lower autochthonous production probably due to lower temperature and less fish farming activity in winter wang et al 2020 the seasonal change of hydrological regimes is another important factor affecting the dom quantity and

mainly linked to the oxygen rich and unsaturated compounds identified with ft icr ms which are generally resistant to microbial degradation herzsprung et al 2012 stubbins et al 2014 he et al 2022 thus our results suggested that the refractory dom that was produced and exported from the reservoir could contribute to the carbon storage in the receiving waterbodies pang et al 2020 in contrast the insignificant correlations of protein like c2 and c4 with salinity indicated active processing since they could be produced from phytoplankton macrophytes added from the anthropogenic pollution and removed by microbial degradation fig 4 these results are consistent with the molecular level analysis that reveals the production of peptide and sugar like compounds in the eutrophic waters he et al 2022 and the subsequent degradation and transformations to other compounds wen et al 2022 thus our results indicated that the signals of these labile components from the reservoir were likely subject to more evident modification in the estuary the conservative mixing of refractory dom and the active processing of labile dom together resulted in the moderate correlation between the bulk doc and salinity fig 2 overall our results suggested that the influences of hydropower facility operation on the downstream aquatic environments were dependent on a series of factors including the hydrological seasonality the inputs from the surrounding zones e g soils and wastewater autochthonous production and the estuarine filtering 5 conclusions the doc increased while the cdom level decreased with weaker changes in c1 c4 downstream in the surface reservoir the doc cdom and c1 c4 in the downstream river zone were generally stable in the normal and dry seasons but increased in the wet season the doc correlated moderately while cdom and humic like c1 and c3 correlated strongly and the labile protein like c2 and c4 did not correlate with salinity in the estuarine zone these results indicated the removals of cdom and production of autochthonous dom in the surface reservoir the inputs from surrounding areas to the river zone in the wet season and the different behaviors of c1 c4 in the estuary overall the discharge of dom from the reservoir in the wet season would be coupled with further additions in the downstream river zone and the filtering in the estuary allowing the humic constituents finally contribute to the carbon storage in the coastal sea in the normal and dry season the impoundment in the reservoir together with weakened terrestrial flushing in the downstream river zone might limit the export of dom across the reservoir river estuary continuum the applications of more detailed analysis e g ft icr ms and isotopic analysis in the future will provide valuable insights into the responses of dom to damming at the molecular and isotopic levels credit authorship contribution statement wan e zhuang conceptualization writing original draft

2482,the large scale forest conservation and restoration programs fcrps implemented in china have energetically promoted carbon sequestration and water consumption of terrestrial ecosystems however the impact of fcrps on the coupling between them that is ecosystem water use efficiency ewue remains unknown using the mann kendall test and the theil sen s slope estimator we analyzed the ewue trends of the fcrp induced forest recovery zones ffrzs in the pre and post intensification phases of the programs then the random quadrat comparison method was employed to compare the ewue of ffrzs and that of their adjacent non recovery zones nrzs we also performed partial correlation analysis and contribution analysis to investigate the response of ewue to fcrp induced forest recovery our study showed that the proportion of ffrzs presenting a significant increasing trend in ewue expanded from 19 1 for the pre intensification phase of fcrps to 35 7 for the post intensification phase the ewue of the ffrzs was significantly higher than that of their neighboring nrzs in arid and semi arid regions whereas there was no significant difference between them in humid and semi humid regions ewue was positively correlated with fcrp induced tree cover in 74 6 of the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps the average contribution of fcrp induced forest recovery to ewue change was 4 94 10 3 gc mm 1 a 1 in the ffrzs accounting for 39 1 of the total ewue variation we concluded that ewue was significantly enhanced by the implementation of fcrps in china however the ewue increase could not be sustained by forest restoration in arid and semi arid regions our study highlights that the implementation of fcrps should pay more attention to the tradeoff between carbon sequestration and water consumption of ecosystems and be tailored to local conditions keywords water use efficiency ecological restoration forest policy afforestation forest management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china has been committed to achieving carbon emissions peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060 as one of the key actions china has implemented several large scale forest conservation and restoration programs fcrps in the past decades such as the grain for green program and the natural forest conservation program to enhance forest carbon sinks and promote carbon neutral sustainable development wu et al 2019 these ambitious forest policies remarkably contributed to land surface greening and biomass carbon booming in china tong et al 2018 zhao et al 2022 on the other hand the forest conservation and restoration interventions imposed heavy burden on regional water resources especially in arid and semiarid areas deng et al 2020 zhao et al 2021b the water and carbon cycles of ecosystems are closely interacted so that water depletion will challenge the sustainability of their carbon sink service tong et al 2020 however it remains unclear how the implementation of fcrps impacts the coupling between water and carbon cycles of ecosystems ecosystem water use efficiency ewue commonly defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp to evapotranspiration et is one of the key functional properties of ecosystem and quantifies the tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss cheng et al 2017 previous studies showed that both gpp and et in china increased simultaneously under the implementation of fcrps over the past years chen et al 2021 ge et al 2020 during 2001 2018 china s total gpp increased at a rate of 49 1 53 1 tgc a 2 approximately 44 52 of which was attributed to human activities chen et al 2021 besides vegetation greening in china contributed to an annual et trend of 0 25 mm a 1 from 1982 to 2014 bai et al 2020 however the spatiotemporal patterns of ewue change have not been clearly presented especially in the targeted areas of fcrps ewue involves the processes of carbon sequestration and evapotranspiration and thus is affected by multiple factors hu et al 2008 niu et al 2011 yu et al 2008 previous study revealed that the variations of ewue were driven by temperature precipitation solar radiation vapor pressure deficit co2 concentration canopy density revegetation etc cao et al 2020 cheng et al 2017 li et al 2018 tian et al 2022 moreover the drivers of ecosystem carbon uptake and water loss are interacted and the degree to which these factors influence ewue varies spatiotemporally cao et al 2020 wang et al 2020 although the response of ewue to biotic and climatic factors was investigated by many studies their findings were often inconsistent or even contrary for example zhu et al 2015 found that ewue increased with rising temperature and precipitation in china whereas sun et al 2018 drew an exactly opposite conclusion furthermore there remains a knowledge gap of the contribution of sustainability interventions such as forest conservation and restoration to the ewue variation of china xue et al 2022 found that the human induced leaf area index laih could explain approximately one third of the ewue variation in china but it was unclear whether the laih increase was contributed by the implementation of sustainability interventions in addition it remains unknown whether the response of ewue to fcrp induced forest recovery varies under different moisture conditions in this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of ewue change in the fcrp induced forest recovery zones ffrzs of china on the basis of the random quadrat comparison method we compared the ewue of the ffrzs and that of their neighboring non recovery zones nrzs we also quantified the impact of fcrps to the ewue change using partial correlation analysis and contribution analysis we aimed at addressing two questions does ewue respond to fcrp induced forest recovery identically in arid and semi arid regions and in humid and semi humid regions to what extent does the implementation of fcrps contribute to the ewue variation in the ffrzs of china answering these questions would deepen our understanding of the carbon and water cycles of ecosystem under the implementation of forest sustainability policies it would also facilitate the proper planning and management of large scale fcrps in the context of global aridification berdugo et al 2020 feng et al 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 gpp and et datasets the vegetation gpp dataset for china from 1982 to 2015 was obtained from zheng et al 2020 the dataset was generated by a revised light use efficiency model at an 8 day temporal and approximately 5600 m spatial resolution the annual gpp was calculated by summation of 45 8 day gpp values and a 5 or 6 day gpp value in a year zhao et al 2005 zheng et al 2020 the annual et dataset for china from 1982 to 2015 with a spatial resolution of approximately 5600 m was provided by niu et al 2020 then the ewue layers for china from 1982 to 2015 were generated as the ratio of gpp over et that was ewue gpp et 2 1 2 climate data the climate data for china used in this study include annual mean temperature amt annual total precipitation atp annual mean solar radiation amr and annual mean vapor pressure deficit amv from 1999 to 2015 the amt and atp time series were derived from the monthly data produced by peng et al 2019 with a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km the amr and amv layers were generated using the terraclimate monthly data at an approximately 4 km spatial resolution abatzoglou et al 2018 all the climate data were resampled to adhere to the spatial resolution of ewue layers 2 1 3 fcrp induced tree cover time series the fcrp induced tree cover tcp time series from 1999 to 2015 was produced by zhao et al 2022 using the phenology based residual trend analysis method the yearly maps at an approximately 5600 m spatial resolution represented the tree cover component due only to the implementation of fcrps after removing the climatic constituent the areas with a significant increasing trend in tcp during 1999 2015 were defined as the ffrzs fig 1 the areas with no tcp increasing trend during the period were outlined as the nrzs fig 1 2 1 4 china s eco geographical zonation map the vector data of china s eco geographical zonation was downloaded from the data center for resource and environment institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn data aspx dataid 125 on the basis of eco geographical zonation map we derived the dividing line between the arid and semi arid regions and the humid and semi humid regions of china fig 1 2 2 ewue trend analysis based on the cumulative coverage area of the large scale fcrps implemented in china and the two segment piecewise regression method zhao et al 2022 divided the study period 1982 2015 into two phases namely the pre intensification phase of fcrps 1982 1998 and the post intensification phase of fcrps 1999 2015 the cumulative coverage area of the fcrps grew gradually from 1 44 106 ha to 3 52 107 ha during the pre intensification phase while it boomed from 4 38 107 ha to 2 43 108 ha during the post intensification phase zhao et al 2022 we used the mann kendall test to detect the ewue trends during the pre and post intensification phases of fcrps on a per pixel basis mann 1945 pixels with significant ewue trends at the 95 confidence level were identified in the ffrzs during the two stages then we used the theil sen s slope estimator to calculate the magnitudes of ewue trends for these pixels sen 1968 the theil sen s slope is calculated as the median of the slope determined by all pairs of sample points excluding points with equal time coordinates marchetto et al 2013 the theil sen s slope estimator is insensitive to outliers and thus more accurate than simple least squares especially for skewed and heteroskedastic data 2 3 random quadrat comparison method based on the map of the ffrzs we randomly sampled 307 quadrats 5 5 pixels in size across mainland china in order to reduce spatial autocorrelation the distance of any two quadrats was set to no 60 km that was twice the length of quadrat side zhao et al 2019 of the 25 pixels in each quadrat at least one pixel was distributed in the ffrzs and one as a minimum in the nrzs the distribution patterns of the 307 random quadrats were illustrated in fig 1 of which 69 quadrats were spread in arid and semi arid regions and 238 in humid and semi humid regions the ewue mean and trend magnitude during the pre and post intensification phases of fcrps were calculated for the ffrzs and nrzs of each quadrat then we performed wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the ewue mean and trend magnitude of the ffrzs and their neighboring nrzs since the two categories of pixels being compared were within a quadrat the impacts of other affecting factors such as climate co2 concentration and vegetation type on ewue were equilibrated to a large degree 2 4 partial correlation analysis to detect the response of ewue to fcrp induced forest recovery in the post intensification phase of fcrps we performed a pixel based partial correlation analysis between ewue and tcp after statistically controlling the impacts of climate drivers amt atp amr and amv pixels with significant partial correlations between ewue and tcp r 0 553 or r 0 553 were identified at the 95 confidence level 2 5 contribution analysis in order to quantify the effect of each driving factor including the implementation of fcrps on ewue changes we employed the pixel based contribution analysis based on partial derivatives in this study roderick et al 2007 the method has been widely used to estimate the contributions of various drivers on vegetation or hydrology dynamics qu et al 2020 yang and yang 2012 zhang et al 2016 the contribution analysis can be formulated in the following expression slop e ewue c c lim a t e c fcrp u f e w u e a m t a m t t e w u e a t p a t p t e w u e a m r a m r t e w u e a m v a m v t e w u e t c p t c p t u f where slope ewue is the inter annual change rate of ewue c c lim a t e represents the contribution of climate change to the inter annual ewue variation which is approximately equal to the sum of contributions from temperature precipitation solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit c fcrp represents the contribution of fcrps specifically the variation of tcp to the inter annual ewue change uf represents the contribution of other secondary factors to the inter annual ewue variation e w u e a m t is the linear regression slope between ewue and amt a m t t is the inter annual change rate of amt the contribution of amt change to the inter annual ewue variation can be calculated as e w u e a m t a m t t the contributions of atp amr amv and tcp were estimated in the same manner the contribution analysis was used under the assumption that the contributing factors amt atp amr amv and tcp were independent or weakly correlated meng and mo 2012 you et al 2013 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of ewue trend in the ffrzs approximately 19 1 of the ffrzs presented a significant increasing trend in ewue during the pre intensification phase of fcrps mainly spread in local regions such as northern heilongjiang southwestern liaoning northern hebei etc fig 2 a during the post intensification phase of fcrps the ffrzs with a significant increasing trend in ewue were expanded and accounted for 35 7 largely distributed in northeast china the loess plateau and southwest china fig 2b the area and distribution of the ffrzs showing a significant decreasing trend in ewue did not change for the pre and post intensification phases of fcrps accounting for 2 1 and primarily in southwest china fig 2 3 2 differences of ewue mean and trend magnitude between the ffrzs and nrzs wilcoxon signed rank tests demonstrated that there existed no significant ewue mean difference between the ffrzs and their neighboring nrzs either in arid and semi arid regions or in humid and semi humid regions during the pre intensification phase of fcrps arid and semi arid regions v 1182 p 0 235 humid and semi humid regions v 13440 p 0 943 fig 3 during the post intensification phase of fcrps the ewue mean of the ffrzs was significantly higher than that of their neighboring nrzs in arid and semi arid regions v 1352 p 0 009 fig 3 however there was no significant ewue mean difference between the ffrzs and their neighboring nrzs in humid and semi humid regions v 14746 p 0 229 fig 3 during the pre intensification phase of fcrps the ewue trend magnitude of the ffrzs was not significantly different from that of their neighboring nrzs either in arid and semi arid regions or in humid and semi humid regions arid and semi arid regions v 1290 p 0 054 humid and semi humid regions v 14542 p 0 315 fig 4 however the ewue trend magnitude of the ffrzs was significantly higher than that of their neighboring nrzs both in arid and semi arid regions and in humid and semi humid regions during the post intensification phase of fcrps arid and semi arid regions v 1426 p 0 002 humid and semi humid regions v 17016 p 0 001 the medians of the four groups of ewue trend magnitudes were all positive fig 4 3 3 partial correlation of ewue with tcp during the post intensification phase of fcrps ewue was positively correlated with tcp in 74 6 of the ffrzs after statistically controlling the effects of amt atp amr and amv pixels with a significant positive partial correlation between ewue and tcp p 0 05 accounted for 13 3 of the ffrzs primarily spread in the northern part of inner mongolia the loess plateau and southwest china fig 5 table 1 in 21 9 of the ffrzs ewue was negatively correlated with tcp of which the partial correlation was significant for 1 of the ffrzs p 0 05 3 4 the contribution of tcp to the inter annual variation of ewue in the post intensification phase of fcrps the average contribution of tcp to the ewue change over the entire ffrzs was 4 94 10 3 gc mm 1 a 1 accounting for 39 1 of the total ewue variation 1 26 10 2 gc mm 1 a 1 tcp made a positive contribution to ewue change in 73 3 of the ffrzs mainly distributed in the loess plateau southwest china and northeast china the areas where tcp made a negative contribution accounted for 23 2 of the ffrzs and are primarily spread in the southeast coastal provinces central sichuan and southern shaanxi fig 6 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 ewue change in the ffrzs during the pre intensification phase of fcrps the ffrzs presenting a significant ewue increasing trend were largely distributed in the targeted regions of the three north shelterbelt development program a large scale afforestation program initiated in 1978 zhao et al 2022 our studies revealed that the ffrzs showing a significant increasing trend in ewue nearly doubled during the post intensification phase of fcrps moreover the regions with a high magnitude of the ewue increasing trend were primarily spread in the targeted areas of key fcrps such as the three north region the loess plateau and the karst region in southwest china zhao et al 2021a these indicated that ewue was enhanced by the implementation of fcrps which was consistent with previous studies conducted on a local scale guo et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 in contrast the areas presenting a significant decreasing trend in ewue and their distributions remained unchanged in the pre and post intensification phases of fcrps further analyses showed that the ewue increase in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps was generally resulted from the synergistic effect of gpp rise and et decrease and was probably dominated by the latter to detect the cause of the ewue increase we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of annual gpp and et changes in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps the results of which were illustrated in fig s1 and fig s2 respectively the annual gpp increased significantly in the loess plateau and northeast china during the post intensification phase of fcrps which was in line with wang et al 2018 and hu et al 2018 the area showing a significant increasing trend in annual gpp accounted for 18 3 of the ffrzs fig s1 it was noteworthy that approximately 51 7 of the ffrzs including northeast china the loess plateau and southwest china showed a significant decreasing trend in annual et during the post intensification phase of fcrps fig s2 therefore the large scale et decrease probably had more effect on the ewue increase than the gpp rise in the ffrzs during the period in fact the impacts of fcrps on the hydrological cycles have been contentious liu et al 2016 feng et al 2016 found revegetation in the loess plateau had caused et to increase by 4 3 1 7 mm a 2 during 2000 2010 li et al 2018 considered that the positive effect of vegetation change on annual et was weak however forest recovery could reduce soil evaporation by declining the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground beer et al 2009 on a large scale the et variation was dominated by climate and water availability rather than by fcrp induced forest recovery li et al 2017 li et al 2018 meng et al 2020 in addition the large scale et decreasing trend in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps might partly originate from the characters of the et product used in this study we acquired the et dataset terrestrial evapotranspiration dataset across china 1982 2017 produced by ma et al 2019 in the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center https data tpdc ac cn en data b6d9f525 5b76 48b0 82db bb2963465cac then we analyzed the et trend in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps with the same method the results showed that the et generally presented a significant decreasing trend in the ffrzs across china fig s12 however the area showing a significant et decreasing trend narrowed remarkably in northeast and southwest china compared with fig s2 b 4 2 ewue of the ffrzs and their neighboring nrzs our study showed that the ewue of the ffrzs was higher than that of their neighboring nrzs in arid and semi arid regions after the intensification of fcrps which were nearly equal before this is probably because planted forests transpire more deep water for carbon assimilation than the original grassland ecosystem or agroecosystem and thus promote ewue in arid and semi arid regions deng et al 2021 however there was no significant ewue difference between the ffrzs and nrzs in humid and semi humid regions perhaps because the fcrp induced forest recovery caused a simultaneous growth in gpp and et the comparison of the ewue trend magnitudes revealed that the ewue of the ffrzs increased more rapidly than that of their neighboring nrzs after the intensification of fcrps which changed identically before with the random quadrat comparison method that tried to equalize other potential drivers of ewue our study confirmed that the fcrp induced forest recovery could promote ewue in china especially in arid and semi arid regions however afforestation in arid and semi arid regions could only achieve a short term ewue increase the deficient soil moisture limits the growth of planted trees which eventually became dwarf trees in many places cao et al 2011a the stunted little old man trees could not function efficiently in carbon sequestration which challenged the longevity of gpp increase cao et al 2011a tong et al 2020 cao et al 2020 predicted that ewue on the loess plateau would stop increasing and start falling in the near future owing to the growth saturation of plantations and the negative effects of climate even worse afforestation in arid and semi arid regions where the inherent water use efficiency of the natural ecosystems was low might introduce potential environmental risks gao et al 2014 4 3 responses of ewue to the variations of tcp and other drivers our study showed that the areas with a significant positive partial correlation between ewue and tcp were over five times larger than that with a significant negative partial correlation besides the areas tcp made a positive contribution to ewue change were three times larger than that tcp made a negative contribution the results of partial correlation and contribution analysis both indicated that forest gains owning to the implementation of fcrps drove ewue increase spatially the areas where tcp made a positive contribution to ewue variation were consistent with the areas with a significant positive partial correlation between them both distributed in the loess plateau southwest china and northeast china implying the results deriving from the two methods were robust partial correlation analyses between ewue and amt atp amr then amv demonstrated that the impacts of these climatic factors on forest ewue change were spatially varied figs s3 s6 for example forest ewue was significantly and positively correlated with amt in the heat deficient regions such as southeastern qinghai province and northeastern china fig s3 pixels with a significant positive partial correlation between ewue and atp were primarily distributed in the semi arid regions of northern china moreover the contributions of these climate drivers as well as other secondary factors to the inter annual ewue change were illustrated in figs s7 11 compared with the contribution magnitude of tcp 4 94 10 3 gc mm 1 a 1 the impact of individual climatic factor to the ewue variation was relatively mild during the post intensification phase of fcrps the average contributions of amt atp amr and amv to the ewue change over the entire ffrzs were 5 00 10 4 gc mm 1 a 1 2 73 10 3 gc mm 1 a 1 9 59 10 4 gc mm 1 a 1 and 5 01 10 4 gc mm 1 a 1 respectively 4 4 guiding the proper implementation of fcrps with the ewue indicator afforestation in arid and semi arid regions is risky without considering the tradeoff between carbon sequestration and water consumption wang and cao 2011 previous studies highlighted the implementation of fcrps must be tailored to local conditions and provided several recommendations cao et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 however it is challenging to judge whether the plantations adapt themselves well to local environments and accomplish a series of key physiological processes at the ecosystem level cao et al 2011b through long term interactions with the local environment native vegetations generally possess suitable water use efficiency that sustains persistent carbon fixation by comparing the ewue values of planted and native vegetations the growth status of plantations will be promptly obtained therefore ewue can be taken as a key indicator for monitoring the fitness of plantations to local environment and guiding the proper implementation of fcrps specifically assisting the selection of appropriate species for afforestation in arid and semi arid regions the water requirement of the candidate species for restoration interventions should be no more than that of the dominant species of native vegetation to sustain long term carbon sink service cao et al 2011b in this study we controlled the impacts of four climate drivers namely amt atp amr and amv when performing the partial correlation analysis between ewue and tcp in fact apart from these climate drivers the ewue change was affected by more variables such as co2 concentration keenan et al 2013 due to the unavailability of interpolated data for these variables with fine resolution we did not include them in the partial correlation analyses which might bring in some uncertainties to our knowledge the latest gridded co2 concentration product covering the study period 1999 2015 had a horizontal resolution of 1 1 much lower than the resolution of these climate variables and thus not suitable for the analyses on the national scale cheng et al 2022 however the overall effects of these factors including co2 concentration on the inter annual ewue variation had been illustrated by the contribution analysis fig s11 in the future further studies on the natural and anthropogenic drivers of ewue change are urgently needed to promote carbon neutrality and address water scarcity 5 conclusions on the basis of long term remote sensing data we analyzed the response of ewue to the implementation of fcrps in china we found that the area showing a significant ewue increasing trend in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps was nearly twice larger than that during the pre intensification phase owning to the implementation of fcrps the ewue of the ffrzs increased more rapidly than that of their adjacent nrzs both in arid and semi arid regions and in humid and semi humid regions moreover afforestation in arid and semi arid regions had resulted in higher ewue in the ffrzs compared with their neighboring nrzs however the implementation of fcrps had no significant influence on ewue mean in humid and semi humid regions given the tradeoff between carbon sequestration and water consumption in forest growth the ewue increase of the ffrzs in arid and semi arid regions will not be sustained for a long time in general ewue was positively correlated with fcrp induced forest recovery over the ffrzs approximately 39 1 of the total ewue variation was contributed by the implementation of fcrps much greater than the contributions of climate drivers the study highlights that the implementation of fcrps should take the interaction between water and carbon cycles of ecosystem into account and be tailored to local conditions especially in arid and semi arid regions we suggest using the ewue indicator to monitor the fitness of plantations to local environment and guide the proper implementation of fcrps credit authorship contribution statement haiwei zhao

that both gpp and et in china increased simultaneously under the implementation of fcrps over the past years chen et al 2021 ge et al 2020 during 2001 2018 china s total gpp increased at a rate of 49 1 53 1 tgc a 2 approximately 44 52 of which was attributed to human activities chen et al 2021 besides vegetation greening in china contributed to an annual et trend of 0 25 mm a 1 from 1982 to 2014 bai et al 2020 however the spatiotemporal patterns of ewue change have not been clearly presented especially in the targeted areas of fcrps ewue involves the processes of carbon sequestration and evapotranspiration and thus is affected by multiple factors hu et al 2008 niu et al 2011 yu et al 2008 previous study revealed that the variations of ewue were driven by temperature precipitation solar radiation vapor pressure deficit co2 concentration canopy density revegetation etc cao et al 2020 cheng et al 2017 li et al 2018 tian et al 2022 moreover the drivers of ecosystem carbon uptake and water loss are interacted and the degree to which these factors influence ewue varies spatiotemporally cao et al 2020 wang et al 2020 although the response of ewue to biotic and climatic factors was investigated by many studies their findings were often inconsistent or even contrary for example zhu et al 2015 found that ewue increased with rising temperature and precipitation in china whereas sun et al 2018 drew an exactly opposite conclusion furthermore there remains a knowledge gap of the contribution of sustainability interventions such as forest conservation and restoration to the ewue variation of china xue et al 2022 found that the human induced leaf area index laih could explain approximately one third of the ewue variation in china but it was unclear whether the laih increase was contributed by the implementation of sustainability interventions in addition it remains unknown whether the response of ewue to fcrp induced forest recovery varies under different moisture conditions in this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of ewue change in the fcrp induced forest recovery zones ffrzs of china on the basis of the random quadrat comparison method we compared the ewue of the ffrzs and that of their neighboring non recovery zones nrzs we also quantified the impact of fcrps to the ewue change using partial correlation analysis and contribution analysis we aimed at addressing two questions does ewue respond to fcrp induced forest recovery identically in arid and semi arid regions and in humid and semi humid regions to what extent does the implementation of fcrps contribute to the ewue variation in the ffrzs of china answering these questions would deepen our understanding of the carbon and water cycles of ecosystem under the implementation of forest sustainability policies it would also facilitate the proper planning and management of large scale fcrps in the context of global aridification berdugo et al 2020 feng et al 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 gpp and et datasets the vegetation gpp dataset for china from 1982 to 2015 was obtained from zheng et al 2020 the dataset was generated by a revised light use efficiency model at an 8 day temporal and approximately 5600 m spatial resolution the annual gpp was calculated by summation of 45 8 day gpp values and a 5 or 6 day gpp value in a year zhao et al 2005 zheng et al 2020 the annual et dataset for china from 1982 to 2015 with a spatial resolution of approximately 5600 m was provided by niu et al 2020 then the ewue layers for china from 1982 to 2015 were generated as the ratio of gpp over et that was ewue gpp et 2 1 2 climate data the climate data for china used in this study include annual mean temperature amt annual total precipitation atp annual mean solar radiation amr and annual mean vapor pressure deficit amv from 1999 to 2015 the amt and atp time series were derived from the monthly data produced by peng et al 2019 with a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km the amr and amv layers were generated using the terraclimate monthly data at an approximately 4 km spatial resolution abatzoglou et al 2018 all the climate data were resampled to adhere to the spatial resolution of ewue layers 2 1 3 fcrp induced tree cover time series the fcrp induced tree cover tcp time series from 1999 to 2015 was produced by zhao et al 2022 using the phenology based residual trend analysis method the yearly maps at an approximately 5600 m spatial resolution represented the tree cover component due only to the implementation of fcrps after removing the climatic constituent the areas with a significant increasing trend in tcp during 1999 2015 were defined as the ffrzs fig 1 the areas with no tcp increasing trend during the period were outlined as the nrzs fig 1 2 1 4 china s eco geographical zonation map the vector data of china s eco geographical zonation was downloaded from the data center for resource and environment institute of geographical sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn data aspx dataid 125 on the basis of eco geographical zonation map we derived the dividing line between the arid and semi arid regions and the humid and semi humid regions of china fig 1 2 2 ewue trend analysis based on the cumulative coverage area of the large scale fcrps implemented in china and the two segment piecewise regression method zhao et al 2022 divided the study period 1982 2015 into two phases namely the pre intensification phase of fcrps 1982 1998 and the post intensification phase of fcrps 1999 2015 the cumulative coverage area of the fcrps grew gradually from 1 44 106 ha to 3 52 107 ha during the pre intensification phase while it boomed from 4 38 107 ha to 2 43 108 ha during the post intensification phase zhao et al 2022 we used the mann kendall test to detect the ewue trends during the pre and post intensification phases of fcrps on a per pixel basis mann 1945 pixels with significant ewue trends at the 95 confidence level were identified in the ffrzs during the two stages then we used the theil sen s slope estimator to calculate the magnitudes of ewue trends for these pixels sen 1968 the theil sen s slope is calculated as the median of the slope determined by all pairs of sample points excluding points with equal time coordinates marchetto et al 2013 the theil sen s slope estimator is insensitive to outliers and thus more accurate than simple least squares especially for skewed and heteroskedastic data 2 3 random quadrat comparison method based on the map of the ffrzs we randomly sampled 307 quadrats 5 5 pixels in size across mainland china in order to reduce spatial autocorrelation the distance of any two quadrats was set to no 60 km that was twice the length of quadrat side zhao et al 2019 of the 25 pixels in each quadrat at least one pixel was distributed in the ffrzs and one as a minimum in the nrzs the distribution patterns of the 307 random quadrats were illustrated in fig 1 of which 69 quadrats were spread in arid and semi arid regions and 238 in humid and semi humid regions the ewue mean and trend magnitude during the pre and post intensification phases of fcrps were calculated for the ffrzs and nrzs of each quadrat then we performed wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the ewue mean and trend magnitude of the ffrzs and their neighboring nrzs since the two categories of pixels being compared were within a quadrat the impacts of other affecting factors such as climate co2 concentration and vegetation type on ewue were equilibrated to a large degree 2 4 partial correlation analysis to detect the response of ewue to fcrp induced forest recovery in the post intensification phase of fcrps we performed a pixel based partial correlation analysis between ewue and tcp after statistically controlling the impacts of climate drivers amt atp amr and amv pixels with significant partial correlations between ewue and tcp r 0 553 or r 0 553 were identified at the 95 confidence level 2 5 contribution analysis in order to quantify the effect of each driving factor including the implementation of fcrps on ewue changes we employed the pixel based contribution analysis based on partial derivatives in this study roderick et al 2007 the method has been widely used to estimate the contributions of various drivers on vegetation or hydrology dynamics qu et al 2020 yang and yang 2012 zhang et al 2016 the contribution analysis can be formulated in the following expression slop e

variation can be calculated as e w u e a m t a m t t the contributions of atp amr amv and tcp were estimated in the same manner the contribution analysis was used under the assumption that the contributing factors amt atp amr amv and tcp were independent or weakly correlated meng and mo 2012 you et al 2013 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of ewue trend in the ffrzs approximately 19 1 of the ffrzs presented a significant increasing trend in ewue during the pre intensification phase of fcrps mainly spread in local regions such as northern heilongjiang southwestern liaoning northern hebei etc fig 2 a during the post intensification phase of fcrps the ffrzs with a significant increasing trend in ewue were expanded and accounted for 35 7 largely distributed in northeast china the loess plateau and southwest china fig 2b the area and distribution of the ffrzs showing a significant decreasing trend in ewue did not change for the pre and post intensification phases of fcrps accounting for 2 1 and primarily in southwest china fig 2 3 2 differences of ewue mean and trend magnitude between the ffrzs and nrzs wilcoxon signed rank tests demonstrated that there existed no significant ewue mean difference between the ffrzs and their neighboring nrzs either in arid and semi arid regions or in humid and semi humid regions during the pre intensification phase of fcrps arid and semi arid regions v 1182 p 0 235 humid and semi humid regions v 13440 p 0 943 fig 3 during the post intensification phase of fcrps the ewue mean of the ffrzs was significantly higher than that of their neighboring nrzs in arid and semi arid regions v 1352 p 0 009 fig 3 however there was no significant ewue mean difference between the ffrzs and their neighboring nrzs in humid and semi humid regions v 14746 p 0 229 fig 3 during the pre intensification phase of fcrps the ewue trend magnitude of the ffrzs was not significantly different from that of their neighboring nrzs either in arid and semi arid regions or in humid and semi humid regions arid and semi arid regions v 1290 p 0 054 humid and semi humid regions v 14542 p 0 315 fig 4 however the ewue trend magnitude of the ffrzs was significantly higher than that of their neighboring nrzs both in arid and semi arid regions and in humid and semi humid regions during the post intensification phase of fcrps arid and semi arid regions v 1426 p 0 002 humid and semi humid regions v 17016 p 0 001 the medians of the four groups of ewue trend magnitudes were all positive fig 4 3 3 partial correlation of ewue with tcp during the post intensification phase of fcrps ewue was positively correlated with tcp in 74 6 of the ffrzs after statistically controlling the effects of amt atp amr and amv pixels with a significant positive partial correlation between ewue and tcp p 0 05 accounted for 13 3 of the ffrzs primarily spread in the northern part of inner mongolia the loess plateau and southwest china fig 5 table 1 in 21 9 of the ffrzs ewue was negatively correlated with tcp of which the partial correlation was significant for 1 of the ffrzs p 0 05 3 4 the contribution of tcp to the inter annual variation of ewue in the post intensification phase of fcrps the average contribution of tcp to the ewue change over the entire ffrzs was 4 94 10 3 gc mm 1 a 1 accounting for 39 1 of the total ewue variation 1 26 10 2 gc mm 1 a 1 tcp made a positive contribution to ewue change in 73 3 of the ffrzs mainly distributed in the loess plateau southwest china and northeast china the areas where tcp made a negative contribution accounted for 23 2 of the ffrzs and are primarily spread in the southeast coastal provinces central sichuan and southern shaanxi fig 6 table 2 4 discussion 4 1 ewue change in the ffrzs during the pre intensification phase of fcrps the ffrzs presenting a significant ewue increasing trend were largely distributed in the targeted regions of the three north shelterbelt development program a large scale afforestation program initiated in 1978 zhao et al 2022 our studies revealed that the ffrzs showing a significant increasing trend in ewue nearly doubled during the post intensification phase of fcrps moreover the regions with a high magnitude of the ewue increasing trend were primarily spread in the targeted areas of key fcrps such as the three north region the loess plateau and the karst region in southwest china zhao et al 2021a these indicated that ewue was enhanced by the implementation of fcrps which was consistent with previous studies conducted on a local scale guo et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 in contrast the areas presenting a significant decreasing trend in ewue and their distributions remained unchanged in the pre and post intensification phases of fcrps further analyses showed that the ewue increase in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps was generally resulted from the synergistic effect of gpp rise and et decrease and was probably dominated by the latter to detect the cause of the ewue increase we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of annual gpp and et changes in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps the results of which were illustrated in fig s1 and fig s2 respectively the annual gpp increased significantly in the loess plateau and northeast china during the post intensification phase of fcrps which was in line with wang et al 2018 and hu et al 2018 the area showing a significant increasing trend in annual gpp accounted for 18 3 of the ffrzs fig s1 it was noteworthy that approximately 51 7 of the ffrzs including northeast china the loess plateau and southwest china showed a significant decreasing trend in annual et during the post intensification phase of fcrps fig s2 therefore the large scale et decrease probably had more effect on the ewue increase than the gpp rise in the ffrzs during the period in fact the impacts of fcrps on the hydrological cycles have been contentious liu et al 2016 feng et al 2016 found revegetation in the loess plateau had caused et to increase by 4 3 1 7 mm a 2 during 2000 2010 li et al 2018 considered that the positive effect of vegetation change on annual et was weak however forest recovery could reduce soil evaporation by declining the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground beer et al 2009 on a large scale the et variation was dominated by climate and water availability rather than by fcrp induced forest recovery li et al 2017 li et al 2018 meng et al 2020 in addition the large scale et decreasing trend in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps might partly originate from the characters of the et product used in this study we acquired the et dataset terrestrial evapotranspiration dataset across china 1982 2017 produced by ma et al 2019 in the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center https data tpdc ac cn en data b6d9f525 5b76 48b0 82db bb2963465cac then we analyzed the et trend in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps with the same method the results showed that the et generally presented a significant decreasing trend in the ffrzs across china fig s12 however the area showing a significant et decreasing trend narrowed remarkably in northeast and southwest china compared with fig s2 b 4 2 ewue of the ffrzs and their neighboring nrzs our study showed that the ewue of the ffrzs was higher than that of their neighboring nrzs in arid and semi arid regions after the intensification of fcrps which were nearly equal before this is probably because planted forests transpire more deep water for carbon assimilation than the original grassland ecosystem or agroecosystem and thus promote ewue in arid and semi arid regions deng et al 2021 however there was no significant ewue difference between the ffrzs and nrzs in humid and semi humid regions perhaps because the fcrp induced forest recovery caused a simultaneous growth in gpp and et the comparison of the ewue trend magnitudes revealed that the ewue of the ffrzs increased more rapidly than that of their neighboring nrzs after the intensification of fcrps which changed identically before with the random quadrat comparison method that tried to equalize other potential drivers of ewue our study confirmed that the fcrp induced forest recovery could promote ewue in china especially in arid and semi arid regions however afforestation in arid and semi arid regions could only achieve a short term ewue increase the deficient soil moisture limits the growth of planted trees which eventually became dwarf trees in many places cao et al 2011a the stunted little old man trees could not function efficiently in carbon sequestration which challenged the longevity of gpp increase cao et al 2011a tong et al 2020 cao et al 2020 predicted that ewue on the loess plateau would stop increasing and start falling in the near future owing to the growth saturation of plantations and the negative effects of climate even worse afforestation in arid and semi arid regions where the inherent water use efficiency of the natural ecosystems was low might introduce potential environmental risks gao et al 2014 4 3 responses of ewue to the variations of tcp and other drivers our study showed that the areas with a significant positive partial correlation between ewue and tcp were over five times larger than that with a significant negative partial correlation besides the areas tcp made a positive contribution to ewue change were three times larger than that tcp made a negative contribution the results of partial correlation and contribution analysis both indicated that forest gains owning to the implementation of fcrps drove ewue increase spatially the areas where tcp made a positive contribution to ewue variation were consistent with the areas with a significant positive partial correlation between them both distributed in the loess plateau southwest china and northeast china implying the results deriving from the two methods were robust partial correlation analyses between ewue and amt atp amr then amv demonstrated that the impacts of these climatic factors on forest ewue change were spatially varied figs s3 s6 for example forest ewue was significantly and positively correlated with amt in the heat deficient regions such as southeastern qinghai province and northeastern china fig s3 pixels with a significant positive partial correlation between ewue and atp were primarily distributed in the semi arid regions of northern china moreover the contributions of these climate drivers as well as other secondary factors to the inter annual ewue change were illustrated in figs s7 11 compared with the contribution magnitude of tcp 4 94 10 3 gc mm 1 a 1 the impact of individual climatic factor to the ewue variation was relatively mild during the post intensification phase of fcrps the average contributions of amt atp amr and amv to the ewue change over the entire ffrzs were 5 00 10 4 gc mm 1 a 1 2 73 10 3 gc mm 1 a 1 9 59 10 4 gc mm 1 a 1 and 5 01 10 4 gc mm 1 a 1 respectively 4 4 guiding the proper implementation of fcrps with the ewue indicator afforestation in arid and semi arid regions is risky without considering the tradeoff between carbon sequestration and water consumption wang and cao 2011 previous studies highlighted the implementation of fcrps must be tailored to local conditions and provided several recommendations cao et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 however it is challenging to judge whether the plantations adapt themselves well to local environments and accomplish a series of key physiological processes at the ecosystem level cao et al 2011b through long term interactions with the local environment native vegetations generally possess suitable water use efficiency that sustains persistent carbon fixation by comparing the ewue values of planted and native vegetations the growth status of plantations will be promptly obtained therefore ewue can be taken as a key indicator for monitoring the fitness of plantations to local environment and guiding the proper implementation of fcrps specifically assisting the selection of appropriate species for afforestation in arid and semi arid regions the water requirement of the candidate species for restoration interventions should be no more than that of the dominant species of native vegetation to sustain long term carbon sink service cao et al 2011b in this study we controlled the impacts of four climate drivers namely amt atp amr and amv when performing the partial correlation analysis between ewue and tcp in fact apart from these climate drivers the ewue change was affected by more variables such as co2 concentration keenan et al 2013 due to the unavailability of interpolated data for these variables with fine resolution we did not include them in the partial correlation analyses which might bring in some uncertainties to our knowledge the latest gridded co2 concentration product covering the study period 1999 2015 had a horizontal resolution of 1 1 much lower than the resolution of these climate variables and thus not suitable for the analyses on the national scale cheng et al 2022 however the overall effects of these factors including co2 concentration on the inter annual ewue variation had been illustrated by the contribution analysis fig s11 in the future further studies on the natural and anthropogenic drivers of ewue change are urgently needed to promote carbon neutrality and address water scarcity 5 conclusions on the basis of long term remote sensing data we analyzed the response of ewue to the implementation of fcrps in china we found that the area showing a significant ewue increasing trend in the ffrzs during the post intensification phase of fcrps was nearly twice larger than that during the pre intensification phase owning to the implementation of fcrps the ewue of the ffrzs increased more rapidly than that of their adjacent nrzs both in arid and semi arid regions and in humid and semi humid regions moreover afforestation in arid and semi arid regions had resulted in higher ewue in the ffrzs compared with their neighboring nrzs however the implementation of fcrps had no significant influence on ewue mean in humid and semi humid regions given the tradeoff between carbon sequestration and water consumption in forest growth the ewue increase of the ffrzs in arid and semi arid regions will not be sustained for a long time in general ewue was positively correlated with fcrp induced forest recovery over the ffrzs approximately 39 1 of the total ewue variation was contributed by the implementation of fcrps much greater than the contributions of climate drivers the study highlights that the implementation of fcrps should take the interaction between water and carbon cycles of ecosystem into account and be tailored to local conditions especially in arid and semi arid regions we suggest using the ewue indicator to monitor the fitness of plantations to local environment and guide the proper implementation of fcrps credit authorship contribution statement haiwei zhao

2483,approximately 100 million tons of phosphogypsum were stockpiled onto marsh soils of the tinto river estuary huelva sw spain this study focuses on the hydraulic response of the phosphogypsum stack to the different weathering agents as well as on the hydrochemical behavior of highly acidic and polluted effluents from its leaching during different hydrological conditions to address these issues a ctd diver was installed in a bore hole within a phosphogypsum stack profile which recorded the variations in the water table of the stack and edge outflows samples were collected around the perimeter of the stack during four sampling periods in different seasons during dry periods the water table of the stack remains almost static and is controlled only by the tide oscillations however during rainy events this water level rapidly increases up to 20 cm and subsequently decreases defining peaks that coincide with the rainfalls having a hydraulic connection to the sea and groundwater flow in conduits the phosphogypsum stack behaves as an anthropogenic karstic coastal aquifer regarding the hydrochemical behavior of the edge outflows the concentrations of most pollutants e g po4 al as cd or u showed a slight decrease from the dry warm to the rainy period these leachates releases high concentrations of contaminants to the estuary e g po4 as and u average values of 5000 6 9 and 3 0 t yr respectively the results obtained in this study could contribute to the development of effective treatment systems for leachates from phosphogypsum stack of huelva and to minimize their impact on the surrounding estuarine environment keywords phosphogypsum stack anthropic aquifer highly polluted leachates ría de huelva estuary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the growing industrial activity during the last five decades to satisfy the needs of an increasingly developed and globalized world population has resulted in a significant growth of industrialized zones around the world in this sense the increasing industrialization of estuaries around major shipping routes promotes environmental concerns due to these areas are particularly sensitive to metal pollution the ría de huelva estuary formed by the confluence of the odiel and tinto rivers sw spain is a clear example of extensive development and industrialization in this case part of the industrial activity has been focused on the manufacture of phosphoric acid h3po4 for the production of phosphate fertilizers as a result an unwanted by product commonly known as phosphogypsum mainly gypsum caso4 2h2o is generated by the chemical digestion of phosphate rock i e fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f with sulfuric acid h2so4 phosphogypsum frequently contains impurities such as metal loids e g as and cd and radionuclides from the decay series of 238u i e u ra and rn macías et al 2017 rutherford et al 1994 consequently these toxic impurities limit the commercial usage of phosphogypsum in fact only around 15 of the phosphogypsum produced worldwide is recycled mainly for the production of buildings materials cánovas et al 2018 with respect to the remaining 85 it is transported as an aqueous slurry along with a residual fraction of the reagents i e sulfuric acid and products i e phosphoric and hydrofluoric acids from the manufacturing process and then stored in stacks without any type of previous treatment on large flat areas close to the phosphate fertilizer industries tayibi et al 2009 most phosphogypsum wastes are stockpiled in coastal areas or directly dumped into the sea e g el samad et al 2014 el zrelli et al 2016 pérez lópez et al 2016 sanders et al 2013 and hence these wastes are usually exposed to strong weathering processes such as leaching by rainwater and or seawater macías et al 2017 zielinski et al 2011 the phosphate fertilizer industry located in the ría de huelva estuary has been generating and dumping phosphogypsum for almost 40 years over a huge stack approx 100 million tons of wastes stockpiled on around 12 km2 of surface near the city of huelva the waste was deposited directly onto the marsh soils of the tinto river estuary with no barrier or liner to avoid infiltration the presence of acidic solutions trapped in the pores of the phosphogypsum makes the stack to behave similarly to an unconfined aquifer with highly polluting groundwater pérez lópez et al 2011 when groundwater reaches the below waste filled marsh level these solutions flow laterally until emerging at the edges of the pile and forming superficial leakages known as edge outflows pérez lópez et al 2015 2016 as a result the phosphogypsum stack is a continuous source of pollution into the estuary due to the release of large volumes of acid effluents i e around 335 000 m3 yr with high concentrations of dissolved pollutants such as po4 f fe al zn cr cu as sb and u among others pérez lópez et al 2016 previous studies reported that the edge outflows have a geochemical fingerprint that indicates a predominantly estuarine origin papaslioti et al 2018 pérez lópez et al 2016 the findings proposed that the intertidal estuarine water accesses to the phosphogypsum stack possibly through the secondary tidal channels that are currently covered by the pile washing the waste in depth and returning to the estuary in the form of edge outflows we cannot rule out that a part of this water may be recirculated and previously exposed to the stockpiles nevertheless this multiple leaching process must be negligible due to the continuous renewal of water in the estuary because of tidal cycles although geochemical connection between the estuary and the phosphogypsum stack has been previously shown the hydraulic response of the stack to estuarine fluctuations as well as the influence of other possible weathering agents such as rainwater remains unclear to bridge this gap in knowledge the main objectives of this work are to assess 1 the temporal hydrological response of the water table at the waste pile against possible weathering agents as well as 2 the possible seasonal influence on the hydrochemistry of the edge outflows and therefore on the discharge of pollutants to the estuary to our knowledge the studies carried out so far to characterize the pollution from edge outflows are based on single sampling campaigns papaslioti et al 2018 pérez lópez et al 2016 while the present study has analyzed the hydrochemistry of the leachates that emerge from the phosphogypsum stack during several sampling campaigns under different hydrological conditions the information obtained in this study could be useful for the optimization of future remediation systems for acid and contaminated discharges from phosphogypsum stacks mainly in coastal areas worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the huelva phosphogypsum stack is located in the tidal prism of the ría de huelva estuary which ranges between 37 and 82 million m3 along a tidal half cycle 6 h grande et al 2000 since 1968 when the industrial activity began until its cessation in 2010 approximately 3 million tons of phosphogypsum were produced each year from 1968 to 1997 the phosphogypsum was transported and deposited on four disposal areas using seawater which was later discharged after waste decantation to the estuary without any type of treatment however in 1997 a legislative change forced the fertilizer company to present a new waste management project to avoid any direct discharge into the estuary ospar 2002 2007 according to the new management policy from 1997 to 2010 the waste was stored in a large pyramidal pile on a single zone already used previously in addition the transport and decantation of the phosphogypsum was carried out through a closed loop system of freshwater known as process water instead of the old open circuit system of seawater used until then the process water was stored in shallow ponds on the stack in order to promote evaporation as a measure to reduce its volume at present the phosphogypsum stack is comprised of four different disposal modules while zones 1 and 4 are already considered as restored zones 2 and 3 are currently pending restoration in the near future the previous restoration consisted in covering the bare phosphogypsum with a soil cover zone 1 4 5 km2 of area and 2 3 m of average thickness is covered by a 25 cm thick layer of natural soil with vegetation while zone 4 3 0 km2 and 8 m has a more complex cover that consists of several layers 1 m of construction debris 2 m of inert industrial wastes and 30 50 cm of vegetable soil in ascending order on the other hand in the unrestored zones 2 2 7 km2 and up to 30 m in height and 3 1 8 km2 and 8 12 m the phosphogypsum is directly exposed to weathering conditions both zones still contain surface ponds with process water characterized by extreme acidity and contaminant load due to its continuous use in the closed circuit system and to the evaporation to which it is subjected despite restoration measures the four disposal modules currently show numerous edge outflows along their perimeters that continuously discharge pollutants to the ría de huelva estuary pérez lópez et al 2016 in addition it is also strongly affected by the historical mining in the iberian pyrite belt ipb as a consequence estuarine waters show high dissolved metals concentrations e g zn al as cu and pb average values of 90 µg l 60 µg l 48 µg l 30 µg l and 1 5 µg l respectively hierro et al 2014 other evidence of that contamination is the high concentrations of some metals observed in the estuary sediments i e 1000 mg kg of zn 824 mg kg of cu and 789 mg kg of pb among others borrego et al 2013 which are between 9 and 25 times higher than values analyzed in sediments from non affected estuaries e g the piedras river one borrego et al 2013 2 2 sampling the perimeter of the four zones of the phosphogypsum stack was inspected in order to collect edge outflow waters during four sampling campaigns in different seasons fig 1 a may june 2014 and 2015 warm dry periods november 2014 rainy period and june 2016 beginning of warm dry period after rainy events the accumulated rainfall for 2016 i e 628 mm was higher than the annual average in the study site i e around 500 mm while 2014 and 2015 years the rainfall values were close to or below the annual mean value i e 534 and 359 mm respectively in this same sense the rainfall accumulated between may and june 2017 was around 116 mm this value was one and two orders of magnitude higher than those recorded for those same months in 2014 and 2015 i e 19 and 1 mm respectively during the different sampling campaigns a total of 215 edge leachate samples were collected from 95 different discharge points some of the phosphogypsum leachate discharge points could not be collected during some of the sampling campaigns due to the existence of a diffuse groundwater flow that sometimes masks the punctual discharges and hinders the exact location of the edge outflows in this sense no samples were taken just after rainy events due to an increase in the diffuse flow leaving a gap of at least 10 days for safety issues the ph redox potential orp and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field using a portable multiparametric crison mm 40 equipment measured orp was referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode eh as proposed by nordstrom and wilde 1998 rainfall and temperature data from a meteorological station at 1 km from phosphogypsum stack were provided by the regional environmental authorities and the spanish meteorological service for the continuous control of the water table variations in the stack a ctd diver was installed in a bore hole of 4 5 m of depth within a phosphogypsum profile in the zone 3 around 8 m of waste thickness and a barodiver was used to compensate measurements with atmospheric pressure the installed sensors were manufactured by schlumberger accuracy for pressure 0 1 in the moment of installation the water table was found at 2 67 m beneath the surface and the ctd diver was submerged about 18 cm so results will be also corrected with respect to the immersion depth the measurement period comprised from february 22nd to june 28th 2016 with a sampling frequency of 10 min sea level variation measurements during the same period were also obtained from a buoy at 500 m from phosphogypsum stack belonging to the spanish wave coastal network for a better understanding of the study area localization of all sampling points can be seen by google earthtm using the keyhole markup language kml file available as electronic supplement 2 3 chemical analyses edge outflow samples were filtered through 0 45 µm membrane filters and divided into two aliquots one unacidified for anion and ammonia determination and another acidified with hno3 to ph less than 1 for major and trace element analysis all liquid samples were stored in high density polyethylene bottles previously washed with hcl 10 for 24 h and subsequently rinsed with milli q water 18 2 mω millipore and stored in sterile plastic bags to prevent contamination as long as possible the float method was used to estimate the flow rate at the sampling points of edge outflows concentrations of anions br cl and f and ammonia in all the unacidified samples were determined by

performed in the laboratories of the university of huelva three laboratory standards i e qcstd 27 icp ms qc1 1 and icp ms qc2 1 prepared with concentrations within the range of the samples were analyzed with every 10 samples to check for accuracy these laboratory control materials were prepared from the certified reference material nist 1640 nist usa furthermore dilutions were performed to ensure that the concentration of the samples was within the concentration range of the standards blank solutions with the same acid matrix as the samples were also included in each sequence of analyzes standard curve the average measurement error was less than 5 a statistical analysis was performed using the statistical package a principal component analysis pca of the results was performed to analyze the relationships among the different variables and seasonal patterns of edge outflows chemical composition the pca is based on a reduction in the number of variables in a multivariate dataset conserving as much variance as possible in the dataset the spearman s correlation matrix was used because some variables did not show a normal distribution davis 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological response to weathering the daily evolution of rainfall and temperature in the study area from 2014 to 2016 fig 1a shows a cyclic pattern characteristic of semi arid mediterranean climate with a rainy season in winter and a dry warm season in summer the annual average rainfall during this time series was 510 mm and most rain events were short but intense downpours between october and april during the hydraulic monitoring period the accumulated rainfall was 220 mm and the events had a direct response in the water table of the phosphogypsum stack fig 1b the water table was quite stable during the study period but increased up to 20 cm during the rainy events fig 1c shows in detail the relation between some rainy episodes and water table level in the stacks indicating that the response of the system is immediate i e without delay between the rainfall and water table increases just after rain episodes around half the height increased by the water table is immediately recovered defining peaks that coincide with the rainfalls the water table recovers more slowly its original state during a period of 5 15 days depending on the intensity of the rains in periods with absence of rains the water table shows low variability during most of the time 2 cm however when zooming in small cyclical oscillations can be observed within these stability periods these piezometric oscillations seem to be influenced by the tidal fluctuations as observed from the data recorded by the buoy belonging to the spanish wave coastal network fig 1d the data of the buoy provided clear information on the semidiurnal character of the tidal oscillations i e two high tides and two low tides are recorded alternately each day which is consistent with the tidal regime of the study area borrego et al 1995 the piezometric oscillations show maximum and minimum amplitudes that match the tidal cycles with a certain delay nevertheless the second daily low tide often appears to be masked in the water table variation which could be due to its lower amplitude in relation to the first one moreover the monitoring was carried out in a rainy period where there may be a higher contribution of fluvial flood events that also masks the piezometric tidal oscillations 3 2 hydrochemical characterization during the four sampling campaigns i e may june 2014 november 2014 may june 2015 and june 2016 a total of ninety five edge outflow points were identified around the whole perimeter of the phosphogypsum stack fig s1 zone 2 was by far the phosphogypsum disposal area where more discharging points were found i e 51 edge leachates samples 2 1 to 2 51 followed by zone 3 with 28 samples 3 1 to 3 28 and zone 4 with 15 samples 4 1 to 4 15 however a large part of the perimeter of zone 4 could not be sampled since a fence restricts the access therefore the total number of edge outflows emerging from the supposedly restored zone 4 could be even higher than that described in this manuscript finally only one acid leachate was identified in zone 1 however this acidic water sample is the result of the interaction of outcropping phosphogypsum and seawater during rising tide in a tidal channel and is therefore not strictly considered an edge outflow pérez lópez et al 2016 the number of edge outflows found in each zone of the phosphogypsum stack could be directly related to the thickness of waste piled up and or the extent of marsh soils covered by the zone on the one hand the higher the height of the waste pile the greater the thickness of the saturated zone and therefore the greater the potential for storing acidic and contaminated interstitial water in this sense the absence of edge outflows in zone 1 is likely due to the low thickness of phosphogypsum which determines that the whole profile of weathering corresponds to unsaturated zone i e there is not a large stock of water in the deep pores that can subsequently emerge at the edges of the stack pérez lópez et al 2016 on the other hand the larger the disposal area the greater the number of secondary tidal channels covered by the stockpiled waste fig 2 and therefore the greater the hydraulic connection between the estuary and the zone which could explain a greater number of edge outflows the average flow found during the warm dry periods was 0 2 l s with rates commonly comprised between 0 1 and 1 5 l s these values were only slightly higher during the rainy period 0 1 2 0 l s average of 0 4 l s these slight differences in the flow measured between the different periods studied could be because sampling was not carried out strictly during the rainy events leaving a time lapse of at least 10 days for security reasons as stated before therefore taking into account the hydraulic response of the stack the flows found during the rainy period were probably measured during a period of the water table recession after rainfall events where the water table state of the stack was close to the pre rainfalls conditions phosphogypsum edge outflows are characterized by high acidity and ec values as well as by containing high concentrations of potentially toxic metal loids tables s1 s4 with respect to zone 1 the sample resulting of the interaction of phosphogypsum and seawater displayed a lower acidity and pollutant concentration than the edge outflows released from the other disposal areas of the stack with values oscillating between samplings depending clearly on the degree of tidal influence table s1 the edge outflows of zone 2 showed the highest acidity and pollutant concentrations irrespective of the sampling period thus these acid leachates displayed high concentrations of pollutants such as po4 f al zn and as average values of the four sampling ranging between 16 444 and 32 633 mg l 696 943 mg l 75 120 mg l 33 44 mg l and 16 20 mg l respectively and to a lesser extent of cu cd cr ni sb and u figs 3 and 4 on the other hand the edge outflows emerging from zone 3 showed both slightly lower ph values and higher pollutant concentrations than those found in the zone 4 reaching values up to 2 to 3 times higher for po4 and metal loids such as al cu cr ni cd as and u tables s3 and s4 on the contrary the leachates of zone 4 showed average concentrations of so4 and fe higher than the rest of the edge leachates fig 3 the dissolved concentrations of the main contaminants i e fe al zn as cu cd cr and ni in the edge outflows emerging from the phosphogypsum stacks were between 1 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than those measured in solutions resulting from leaching experiments where phosphogypsum waste samples were reacted with distilled water and organic solvents average values of 3 01 and 1 40 mg l for al 0 65 0 34 mg l for zn 0 37 0 19 mg l for as 0 25 0 01 mg l for fe 0 10 0 01 for cu ni cd and cu macías et al 2017 this important difference in the contaminant concentrations is probably due to the short period of interaction time of the phosphogypsum wastes with the extracting solutions i e 18 and 24 h for the leaching experiment with the organic solvent and with distilled water respectively and the solid liquid ratio which is noticeably higher 1 20 and 1 10 in the case of the leaching tests 3 3 restoration measures influence on the edge outflows hydrochemistry the dissimilarities observed in the concentration of pollutants of the edge leachates between the different zones of the stack could be due to a combination of several factors such as the dumping history of phosphogypsum in each of the disposal areas the morphodynamic domain of the estuary in which each zone is located and the preliminary restoration actions to which some zones have been subjected papaslioti et al 2018 pérez lópez et al 2016 2018 thus the higher concentrations of pollutants observed in leachates from zone 2 than those from zones 3 and 4 would be closely related to the dumping history in this zone since zone 2 is the only disposal area in which phosphogypsum was transported from the industry using the recirculated and evaporated process water with the closed loop system installed after 1997 see section 2 1 on the other hand the vegetation cover spread in zone 4 as a restoration measure could explain the lower concentrations of most pollutants in this zone than in the non restored zones table 1 this is because the topsoil layer could be favoring sulfate reduction processes and therefore the precipitation of metal sulfides which would cause the removal of part of the pollution contained in the pore solutions castillo et al 2012 pérez lópez et al 2018 this hypothesis becomes more relevant when comparing zones 3 and 4 since the phosphogypsum was deposited in a similar way in both zones using an open circuit system with seawater but zone 4 has undergone further restoration moreover the zone 3 is currently naked and exposed to weathering with a large surface pond storing process water the contribution of the process water infiltration to the composition of the edge leachates that emerge in this zone of the stack although minimal around 9 calculated using stable isotopes papaslioti et al 2018 could also explain the slightly higher concentrations observed in the leachates collected in zone 3 with respect to zone 4 table 1 on the other hand a higher fluvial influence in the edge leachates of zone 4 could explain the highest average concentrations of so4 and fe measured compared to those found in the other zones according to papaslioti et al 2018 zone 4 of the phosphogypsum stack is closer to the fluvial domain and hence the composition of the leachates that emerge in this zone is more influenced by the tinto river around 80 87 determined by stable isotope analysis which is highly affected by acid mine drainage amd i e acidic and sulfate and iron rich waters from the leaching of abandoned mining wastes mainly from the riotinto mines cánovas et al 2021 nieto et al 2013 the influence of the different end members on the hydrochemistry of edge outflows can be seen in fig 5 a where the results of the pca for variables and samples are shown both factors i e f1 and f2 explain 68 of variance and seem to be related to the different origin of pollutants in the outflows as can be seen three different groups of elements can be identified i those related to seawater including na cl mg k br or so4 ii those related to the acidic waters of the tinto river such as fe sb pb cu zn or as and iii those related to phosphogypsum wastewaters such as f cr u po4 nh4 and other trace metals however it is not surprising that some elements e g as or zn are common between the different groups taking into account that the edge outflows originate from the leaching of the phosphogypsum stack with water of estuarine origin thus the closeness of each sample to the different end members i e seawater process water and tinto river water would define the level of influence of each end member in these samples fig 5b 3 4 seasonal variability of the edge outflows hydrochemistry as mentioned above the huelva phosphogypsum stack behaves as an anthropic aquifer with numerous springs releasing large amounts of pollutants to the ría de huelva estuary these edge outflows showed low hydrochemical variability under the different hydrological conditions studied i e warm dry period rainy period and beginning of warm dry period after rainy events figs 3 and 4 however small fluctuations can be observed during the different scenarios thus the lowest ph values measured in the leachates from zones 2 and 3 occurred in the warm dry periods i e may june 2014 and 2015 average of 1 83 1 98 and 1 90 2 12 respectively while the highest values were measured in the rainy period average ph values of 2 17 and 2 31 respectively and beginning of warm dry period after rainy events average ph values of 2 04 and 2 18 respectively on the other hand the ph values of the leachates from zone 4 remained almost constant during the different seasons with average values between 2 21 and 2 27 the restoration measures implemented in this area likely minimize the infiltration of rainwater regarding the seasonal variability in the concentrations of pollutants these can be broadly classified into two groups according to their behavior during the different hydrological conditions on the one hand a group that includes most contaminants e g po4 f al zn cr ni as cd sb or u whose dissolved concentrations decrease during the rainy period i e november 2014 as a result of a dilution effect due to the recharge of rainwater figs 3 and 4 on the other hand a group that comprises pollutants such as so4 and fe which suffered an increase in the concentrations measured during the rainy period compared to the values analyzed in the leachates collected during the previous warm dry period i e may june 2014 fig 3 this increase in concentration of so4 and fe observed during the rainy season is due to the increasing concentration of these dissolved pollutants in the tinto river as a consequence of the washout of sulfate evaporitic salts which are formed along the riverbanks and mine sites mainly during the summer months and between rainfall events during warm dry springs cánovas et al 2021 olías et al 2006 the dissolution of these minerals together with the sweeping of sulfide oxidation products from mine sites lead to increasing metal concentrations in river waters entering the estuary as mentioned above there is a hydraulic connection between the estuary and the stack and therefore it seems reasonable to think that certain variations in the hydrochemistry of the estuarine water could be reflected in the chemical composition of the discharges from the phosphogypsum stack in order to study the significance of seasonal hydrochemical variations of edge outflows a statistical test was performed on samples collected during the rainy and dry seasons as variables did not exhibit a normal distribution the non parametric test of wilcoxon was selected applying both the signed test and the wilcoxon signed rank test the signed test compares the number of exceeding cases between populations without considering the magnitude of these differences while the wilcoxon signed rank test considers this magnitude table s5 as a result a spatial pattern was observed considering the seasonal differences noticed between the dry and rainy periods the closer to the river the higher statistical differences in variables were recorded for instance the zone 4 the closer to the tinto river exhibited significant statistical differences for as ni co u sb cd fe so4 zn al ca and po4 between both periods only some metals such as cr pb and cu together with f cl and ph showed similar distributions in both periods in the case of zone 3 located downstream to the ocean statistically significant differences were only observed for ph fe so4 sb al and ca while po4 showed only significant differences in the signed test the zone 2 the farther area from the river excluding zone 1 with only one sample exhibited the lower number of variables displaying statistically significant differences for ph al ca so4 and fe although in the latter two variables these differences were only observed in the signed test these results supports previous findings about the control exerted on the hydrochemical spatial variations of edge outflows by the closeness to the tinto river and its variability along the year in addition the phosphogypsum stack contaminates the surrounding system causing disturbances in the estuary and the aquatic biota for this reason a continuous monitoring is highly recommended to evaluate if these disturbances are temporary or permanent 4 environmental implications according to the hydrological response of the phosphogypsum stack it can be considered as an anthropogenic aquifer with a similar hydrogeological behavior than coastal karstic aquifers in fact karstic features are widely recognized in phosphogypsum stacks worldwide lottermoser 2010 arfib and charlier 2016 proposed a hydrological conceptual model for coastal karst aquifers divided into three reservoirs deep slow and fast which could be adjusted to the results observed in the current study see fig 1 the deep reservoir would be characterized by brackish water with low variations of discharge this reservoir would represent the storage function of the aquifer with a long residence time strongly affected by saline intrusion under these circumstances the water level shows a low variability most of the time only controlled by tidal oscillations in these prevailing conditions waters may move by diffuse slow flow through the primary porous matrix which could supply the spring during low flow period on the other hand both the slow and the fast reservoirs would be characterized by freshwater input the slow reservoir would represent the storage and the recession after rainfall events whereas the fast reservoir would be characterized by a rapid infiltration and transfer through the aquifer during rainy events under these circumstances the water quickly enters and emerges from the stack likely through large karst channels caused by gypsum dissolution regarding the hydrochemical behavior of leachates from the phophogypsum stack it is worth highlighting the low variability although statistically significant in some cases showed by these highly acidic and polluted waters under different hydrological conditions however it is of critical importance to sample in safe conditions the stack immediately after intense rainfall events when a rapid discharge is observed and sharper hydrochemical differences would be expected thus the results reported in this study have positive implications in the design of potential effective remediation treatments since notable fluctuations in flow rates and pollutant load can cause operational problems in the treatment systems the findings obtained allow calculating the pollutant load that finally reaches the ría de huelva estuary with some reliability given the observed chemically homogeneous response throughout the system thus an overall approach has been performed to calculate the metal loads released by the stack in each sampling period to obtain the values in each sampling the average concentrations of all the sampling points and the bulk discharge have been used considering all the edge outflows located around the perimeter of the phosphogypsum stack a bulk discharge of acid leachates of around 500 000 m3 yr has been estimated however these results may be underestimated due to the existence of diffuse edge outflows that are difficult to measure these leachates release enormous amounts of pollutants to the estuary e g po4 f fe zn as u cu cd and ni average values of 5000 t yr 300 t yr 76 t yr 11 t yr 6 9 t yr 3 0 t yr 1 7 t yr 1 1 t yr and 1 0 t yr respectively table 2 nevertheless this estuarine environment is also affected by the odiel and tinto rivers and their acidic and metal rich waters due to amd discharges from abandoned mining districts in the iberian pyrite belt ipb nieto et al 2013 in this sense table 2 also shows the average pollutant loads contributed by both rivers in the periods 1995 2003 olías et al 2006 and 2004 2006 nieto et al 2013 the results reported by these authors indicate a high variability in the average pollutant load transported by the odiel and tinto rivers associated to hydrological variations between periods comparing both sources of contamination i e phosphogypsum leachates and amd affected tinto and odiel rivers the phosphogypsum stack would be responsible for an average contribution of 16 85 of as 9 27 of cd 3 16 of ni 1 4 of fe and 0 3 2 of zn of the total discharge reaching the estuary in addition as mentioned above an important industrial complex is located in the ría de huelva estuary different industrial activities developed in this complex can also discharge metal rich effluents directly into the estuary pérez lópez et al 2011 in this sense these authors calculated the average pollutant load from the huelva industrial complex between 2003 and 2006 no current data available this value was much lower than that contributed by the tinto and odiel rivers exhibiting values of one to two orders of magnitude lower for most of the pollutants table 2 however pérez lópez et al 2011 did not contemplate in the study the contribution of pollutants to the estuary from the phosphogypsum stack as a pollution source also of industrial origin the capacity of contamination of the phosphogypsum pile is more significant taking into account that its extension is three orders of magnitude lower than the area of the fluvial basins i e around 3979 km2 in addition some of the pollutants e g po4 f and u discharged into the estuary from the phosphogypsum stack are negligible in the mine waters for these reasons the treatment of effluents from the phosphogypsum stack is essential to minimize the pollution that reaches the ría de huelva estuary in this sense the application of passive dispersed alkaline substrate das technology for highly acidic and contaminated phosphogypsum leachates has shown to be highly effective in reducing the pollutant load and acidity millán becerro et al 2020 2022 5 conclusions the results obtained in this study clearly indicate that the huelva phosphogypsum stack behaves as an anthropic aquifer with karstic features this aquifer shows two feeding ways a continuous recharge of estuarine water in the deep zone of the stack where phosphogypsum and marsh soil are directly in contact and a punctual recharge by rainwater that infiltrates through the surface of the phosphogypsum stack and circulates through dissolution conduits thus the water table of this aquifer is controlled mainly by tidal fluctuations showing low variability most of the time 2 cm however the water table of the stack rapidly increased up to 20 cm during the rainy events studied just after rainfall events around half of the height increased by the water table is instantly recovered while pre rainfalls conditions are reached within a period between 5 and 15 days depending on rainfall intensity edge outflows sampled around the whole perimeter of the phosphogypsum pile show generally low hydrochemical variability under different hydrological conditions however small variations in pollutant concentrations have been observed during the different periods the mechanisms responsible for such variations are on the one hand a dilution by rainwater recharge during the rainy period which cause a slight decrease in concentration of most dissolved contaminants e g po4 f al zn cr ni as cd sb or u observed in the edge outflows and on the other hand the dissolution of the sulfate evaporitic salts precipitated during the summer along the banks of the tinto river and mine sites which cause an increase in the dissolved concentration of so4 and fe in the river water and subsequently in the leachates released from the phosphogypsum stack during the rainy season the stack releases high concentrations of pollutants such as po4 f and u average values of 5000 t yr 300 t yr and 3 0 t yr respectively which are only found in phosphogypsum leachates in addition between 16 and 85 and 9 27 of the total content of as and cd respectively that reach the ría de huelva estuary come from the phosphogypsum stack credit authorship contribution statement ricardo millán becerro

2483,approximately 100 million tons of phosphogypsum were stockpiled onto marsh soils of the tinto river estuary huelva sw spain this study focuses on the hydraulic response of the phosphogypsum stack to the different weathering agents as well as on the hydrochemical behavior of highly acidic and polluted effluents from its leaching during different hydrological conditions to address these issues a ctd diver was installed in a bore hole within a phosphogypsum stack profile which recorded the variations in the water table of the stack and edge outflows samples were collected around the perimeter of the stack during four sampling periods in different seasons during dry periods the water table of the stack remains almost static and is controlled only by the tide oscillations however during rainy events this water level rapidly increases up to 20 cm and subsequently decreases defining peaks that coincide with the rainfalls having a hydraulic connection to the sea and groundwater flow in

surrounding estuarine environment keywords phosphogypsum stack anthropic aquifer highly polluted leachates ría de huelva estuary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the growing industrial activity during the last five decades to satisfy the needs of an increasingly developed and globalized world population has resulted in a significant growth of industrialized zones around the world in this sense the increasing industrialization of estuaries around major shipping routes promotes environmental concerns due to these areas are particularly sensitive to metal pollution the ría de huelva estuary formed by the confluence of the odiel and tinto rivers sw spain is a clear example of extensive development and industrialization in this case part of the industrial activity has been focused on the manufacture of phosphoric acid h3po4 for the production of phosphate fertilizers as a result an unwanted by product commonly known as phosphogypsum mainly gypsum caso4 2h2o is generated by the chemical digestion of phosphate rock i e fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f with sulfuric acid h2so4 phosphogypsum frequently contains impurities such as metal loids e g as and cd and radionuclides from the decay series of 238u i e u ra and rn macías et al 2017 rutherford et al 1994 consequently these toxic impurities limit the commercial usage of phosphogypsum in fact only around 15 of the phosphogypsum produced worldwide is recycled mainly for the production of buildings materials cánovas et al 2018 with respect to the remaining 85 it is transported as an aqueous slurry along with a residual fraction of the reagents i e sulfuric acid and products i e phosphoric and hydrofluoric acids from the manufacturing process and then stored in stacks without any type of previous treatment on large flat areas close to the phosphate fertilizer industries tayibi et al 2009 most phosphogypsum wastes are stockpiled in coastal areas or directly dumped into the sea e g el samad et al 2014 el zrelli et al 2016 pérez lópez et al 2016 sanders et al 2013 and hence these wastes are usually exposed to strong weathering processes such as leaching by rainwater and or seawater macías et al 2017 zielinski et al 2011 the phosphate fertilizer industry located in the ría de huelva estuary has been generating and dumping phosphogypsum for almost 40 years over a huge stack approx 100 million tons of wastes stockpiled on around 12 km2 of surface near the city of huelva the waste was deposited directly onto the marsh soils of the tinto river estuary with no barrier or liner to avoid infiltration the presence of acidic solutions trapped in the pores of the phosphogypsum makes the stack to behave similarly to an unconfined aquifer with highly polluting groundwater pérez lópez et al 2011 when groundwater reaches the below waste filled marsh level these solutions flow laterally until emerging at the edges of the pile and forming superficial leakages known as edge outflows pérez lópez et al 2015 2016 as a result the phosphogypsum stack is a continuous source of pollution into the estuary due to the release of large volumes of acid effluents i e around 335 000 m3 yr with high concentrations of dissolved pollutants such as po4 f fe al zn cr cu as sb and u among others pérez lópez et al 2016 previous studies reported that the edge outflows have a geochemical fingerprint that indicates a predominantly estuarine origin papaslioti et al 2018 pérez lópez et al 2016 the findings proposed that the intertidal estuarine water accesses to the phosphogypsum stack possibly through the secondary tidal channels that are currently covered by the pile washing the waste in depth and returning to the estuary in the form of edge outflows we cannot rule out that a part of this water may be recirculated and previously exposed to the stockpiles nevertheless this multiple leaching process must be negligible due to the continuous renewal of water in the estuary because of tidal cycles although geochemical connection between the estuary and the phosphogypsum stack has been previously shown the hydraulic response of the stack to estuarine fluctuations as well as the influence of other possible weathering agents such as rainwater remains unclear to bridge this gap in knowledge the main objectives of this work are to assess 1 the temporal hydrological response of the water table at the waste pile against possible weathering agents as well as 2 the possible seasonal influence on the hydrochemistry of the edge outflows and therefore on the discharge of pollutants to the estuary to our knowledge the studies carried out so far to characterize the pollution from edge outflows are based on single sampling campaigns papaslioti et al 2018 pérez lópez et al 2016 while the present study has analyzed the hydrochemistry of the leachates that emerge from the phosphogypsum stack during several sampling campaigns under different hydrological conditions the information obtained in this study could be useful for the optimization of future remediation systems for acid and contaminated discharges from phosphogypsum stacks mainly in coastal areas worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the huelva phosphogypsum stack is located in the tidal prism of the ría de huelva estuary which ranges between 37 and 82 million m3 along a tidal half cycle 6 h grande et al 2000 since 1968 when the industrial activity began until its cessation in 2010 approximately 3 million tons of phosphogypsum were produced each year from 1968 to 1997 the phosphogypsum was transported and deposited on four disposal areas using seawater which was later discharged after waste decantation to the estuary without any type of treatment however in 1997 a legislative change forced the fertilizer company to present a new waste management project to avoid any direct discharge into the estuary ospar 2002 2007 according to the new management policy from 1997 to 2010 the waste was stored in a large pyramidal pile on a single zone already used previously in addition the transport and decantation of the phosphogypsum was carried out through a closed loop system of freshwater known as process water instead of the old open circuit system of seawater used until then the process water was stored in shallow ponds on the stack in order to promote evaporation as a measure to reduce its volume at present the phosphogypsum stack is comprised of four different disposal modules while zones 1 and 4 are already considered as restored zones 2 and 3 are currently pending restoration in the near future the previous restoration consisted in covering the bare phosphogypsum with a soil cover zone 1 4 5 km2 of area and 2 3 m of average thickness is covered by a 25 cm thick layer of natural soil with vegetation while zone 4 3 0 km2 and 8 m has a more complex cover that consists of several layers 1 m of construction debris 2 m of inert industrial wastes and 30 50 cm of vegetable soil in ascending order on the other hand in the unrestored zones 2 2 7 km2 and up to 30 m in height and 3 1 8 km2 and 8 12 m the phosphogypsum is directly exposed to weathering conditions both zones still contain surface ponds with process water characterized by extreme acidity and contaminant load due to its continuous use in the closed circuit system and to the evaporation to which it is subjected despite restoration measures the four disposal modules currently show numerous edge outflows along their perimeters that continuously discharge pollutants to the ría de huelva estuary pérez lópez et al 2016 in addition it is also strongly affected by the historical mining in the iberian pyrite belt ipb as a consequence estuarine waters show high dissolved metals concentrations e g zn al as cu and pb average values of 90 µg l 60 µg l 48 µg l 30 µg l and 1 5 µg l respectively hierro et al 2014 other evidence of that contamination is the high concentrations of some metals observed in the estuary sediments i e 1000 mg kg of zn 824 mg kg of cu and 789 mg kg of pb among others borrego et al 2013 which are between 9 and 25 times higher than values analyzed in sediments from non affected estuaries e g the piedras river one borrego et al 2013 2 2 sampling the perimeter of the four zones of the phosphogypsum stack was inspected in order to collect edge outflow waters during four sampling campaigns in different seasons fig 1 a may june 2014 and 2015 warm dry periods november 2014 rainy period and june 2016 beginning of warm dry period after rainy events the accumulated rainfall for 2016 i e 628 mm was higher than the annual average in the study site i e around 500 mm while 2014 and 2015 years the rainfall values were close to or below the annual mean value i e 534 and 359 mm respectively in this same sense the rainfall accumulated between may and june 2017 was around 116 mm this value was one and two orders of magnitude higher than those recorded for those same months in 2014 and 2015 i e 19 and 1 mm respectively during the different sampling campaigns a total of 215 edge leachate samples were collected from 95 different discharge points some of the phosphogypsum leachate discharge points could not be collected during some of the sampling campaigns due to the existence of a diffuse groundwater flow that sometimes masks the punctual discharges and hinders the exact location of the edge outflows in this sense no samples were taken just after rainy events due to an increase in the diffuse flow leaving a gap of at least 10 days for safety issues the ph redox potential orp and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field using a portable multiparametric crison mm 40 equipment measured orp was referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode eh as proposed by nordstrom and wilde 1998 rainfall and temperature data from a meteorological station at 1 km from phosphogypsum stack were provided by the regional environmental authorities and the spanish meteorological service for the continuous control of the water table variations in the stack a ctd diver was installed in a bore hole of 4 5 m of depth within a phosphogypsum profile in the zone 3 around 8 m of waste thickness and a barodiver was used to compensate measurements with atmospheric pressure the installed sensors were manufactured by schlumberger accuracy for pressure 0 1 in the moment of installation the water table was found at 2 67 m beneath the surface and the ctd diver was submerged about 18 cm so results will be also corrected with respect to the immersion depth the measurement period comprised from february 22nd to june 28th 2016 with a sampling frequency of 10 min sea level variation measurements during the same period were also obtained from a buoy at 500 m from phosphogypsum stack belonging to the spanish wave coastal network for a better understanding of the study area localization of all sampling points can be seen by google earthtm using the keyhole markup language kml file available as electronic supplement 2 3 chemical analyses edge outflow samples were filtered through 0 45 µm membrane filters and divided into two aliquots one unacidified for anion and ammonia determination and another acidified with hno3 to ph less than 1 for major and trace element analysis all liquid samples were stored in high density polyethylene bottles previously washed with hcl 10 for 24 h and subsequently rinsed with milli q water 18 2 mω millipore and stored in sterile plastic bags to prevent contamination as long as possible the float method was used to estimate the flow rate at the sampling points of edge outflows concentrations of anions br cl and f and ammonia in all the unacidified samples were determined by

performed in the laboratories of the university of huelva three laboratory standards i e qcstd 27 icp ms qc1 1 and icp ms qc2 1 prepared with concentrations within the range of the samples were analyzed with every 10 samples to check for accuracy these laboratory control materials were prepared from the certified reference material nist 1640 nist usa furthermore dilutions were performed to ensure that the concentration of the samples was within the concentration range of the standards blank solutions with the same acid matrix as the samples were also included in each sequence of analyzes standard curve the average measurement error was less than 5 a statistical analysis was performed using the statistical package a principal component analysis pca of the results was performed to analyze the relationships among the different variables and seasonal patterns of edge outflows chemical composition the pca is based on a reduction in the number of variables in a multivariate dataset conserving as much variance as possible in the dataset the spearman s correlation matrix was used because some variables did not show a normal distribution davis 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological response to weathering the daily evolution of rainfall and temperature in the study area from 2014 to 2016 fig 1a shows a cyclic pattern characteristic of semi arid mediterranean climate with a rainy season in winter and a dry warm season in summer the annual average rainfall during this time series was 510 mm and most rain events were short but intense downpours between october and april during the hydraulic monitoring period the accumulated rainfall was 220 mm and the events had a direct response in the water table of the phosphogypsum stack fig 1b the water table was quite stable during the study period but increased up to 20 cm during the rainy events fig 1c shows in detail the relation between some rainy episodes and water table level in the stacks indicating that the response of the system is immediate i e without delay between the rainfall and water table increases just after rain episodes around half the height increased by the water table is immediately recovered defining peaks that coincide with the rainfalls the water table recovers more slowly its original state during a period of 5 15 days depending on the intensity of the rains in periods with absence of rains the water table shows low variability during most of the time 2 cm however when zooming in small cyclical oscillations can be observed within these stability periods these piezometric oscillations seem to be influenced by the tidal fluctuations as observed from the data recorded by the buoy belonging to the spanish wave coastal network fig 1d the data of the buoy provided clear information on the semidiurnal character of the tidal oscillations i e two high tides and two low tides are recorded alternately each day which is consistent with the tidal regime of the study area borrego et al 1995 the piezometric oscillations show maximum and minimum amplitudes that match the tidal cycles with a certain delay nevertheless the second daily low tide often appears to be masked in the water table variation which could be due to its lower amplitude in relation to the first one moreover the monitoring was carried out in a rainy period where there may be a higher contribution of fluvial flood events that also masks the piezometric tidal oscillations 3 2 hydrochemical characterization during the four sampling campaigns i e may june 2014 november 2014 may june 2015 and june 2016 a total of ninety five edge outflow points were identified around the whole perimeter of the phosphogypsum stack fig s1 zone 2 was by far the phosphogypsum disposal area where more discharging points were found i e 51 edge leachates samples 2 1 to 2 51 followed by zone 3 with 28 samples 3 1 to 3 28 and zone 4 with 15 samples 4 1 to 4 15 however a large part of the perimeter of zone 4 could not be sampled since a fence restricts the access therefore the total number of edge outflows emerging from the supposedly restored zone 4 could be even higher than that described in this manuscript finally only one acid leachate was identified in zone 1 however this acidic water sample is the result of the interaction of outcropping phosphogypsum and seawater during rising tide in a tidal channel and is therefore not strictly considered an edge outflow pérez lópez et al 2016 the number of edge outflows found in each zone of the phosphogypsum stack could be directly related to the thickness of waste piled up and or the extent of marsh soils covered by the zone on the one hand the higher the height of the waste pile the greater the thickness of the saturated zone and therefore the greater the potential for storing acidic and contaminated interstitial water in this sense the absence of edge outflows in zone 1 is likely due to the low thickness of phosphogypsum which determines that the whole profile of weathering corresponds to unsaturated zone i e there is not a large stock of water in the deep pores that can subsequently emerge at the edges of the stack pérez lópez et al 2016 on the other hand the larger the disposal area the greater the number of secondary tidal channels covered by the stockpiled waste fig 2 and therefore the greater the hydraulic connection between the estuary and the zone which could explain a greater number of edge outflows the average flow found during the warm dry periods was 0 2 l s with rates commonly comprised between 0 1 and 1 5 l s these values were only slightly higher during the rainy period 0 1 2 0 l s average of 0 4 l s these slight differences in the flow measured between the different periods studied could be because sampling was not carried out strictly during the rainy events leaving a time lapse of at least 10 days for security reasons as stated before therefore taking into account the hydraulic response of the stack the flows found during the rainy period were probably measured during a period of the water table recession after rainfall events where the water table state of the stack was close to the pre rainfalls conditions phosphogypsum edge outflows are characterized by high acidity and ec values as well as by containing high concentrations of potentially toxic metal loids tables s1 s4 with respect to zone 1 the sample resulting of the interaction of phosphogypsum and seawater displayed a lower acidity and pollutant concentration than the edge outflows released from the other disposal areas of the stack with values oscillating between samplings depending clearly on the degree of tidal influence table s1 the edge outflows of zone 2 showed the highest acidity and pollutant concentrations irrespective of the sampling period thus these acid leachates displayed high concentrations of pollutants such as po4 f al zn and as average values of the four sampling ranging between 16 444 and 32 633 mg l 696 943 mg l 75 120 mg l 33 44 mg l and 16 20 mg l respectively and to a lesser extent of cu cd cr ni sb and u figs 3 and 4 on the other hand the edge outflows emerging from zone 3 showed both slightly lower ph values and higher pollutant concentrations than those found in the zone 4 reaching values up to 2 to 3 times higher for po4 and metal loids such as al cu cr ni cd as and u tables s3 and s4 on the contrary the leachates of zone 4 showed average concentrations of so4 and fe higher than the rest of the edge leachates fig 3 the dissolved concentrations of the main contaminants i e fe al zn as cu cd cr and ni in the edge outflows emerging from the phosphogypsum stacks were between 1 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than those measured in solutions resulting from leaching experiments where phosphogypsum waste samples were reacted with distilled water and organic solvents average values of 3 01 and 1 40 mg l for al 0 65 0 34 mg l for zn 0 37 0 19 mg l for as 0 25 0 01 mg l for fe 0 10 0 01 for cu ni cd and cu macías et al 2017 this important difference in the contaminant concentrations is probably due to the short period of interaction time of the phosphogypsum wastes with the extracting solutions i e 18 and 24 h for the leaching experiment with the organic solvent and with distilled water respectively and the solid liquid ratio which is noticeably higher 1 20 and 1 10 in the case of the leaching tests 3 3 restoration measures influence on the edge outflows hydrochemistry the dissimilarities observed in the concentration of pollutants of the edge leachates between the different zones of the stack could be due to a combination of several factors such as the dumping history of phosphogypsum in each of the disposal areas the morphodynamic domain of the estuary in which each zone is located and the preliminary restoration actions to which some zones have been subjected papaslioti et al 2018 pérez lópez et al 2016 2018 thus the higher concentrations of pollutants observed in leachates from zone 2 than those from zones 3 and 4 would be closely related to the dumping history in this zone since zone 2 is the only disposal area in which phosphogypsum was transported from the industry using the recirculated and evaporated process water with the closed loop system installed after 1997 see section 2 1 on the other hand the vegetation cover spread in zone 4 as a restoration measure could explain the lower concentrations of most pollutants in this zone than in the non restored zones table 1 this is because the topsoil layer could be favoring sulfate reduction processes and therefore the precipitation of metal sulfides which would cause the removal of part of the pollution contained in the pore solutions castillo et al 2012 pérez lópez et al 2018 this hypothesis becomes more relevant when comparing zones 3 and 4 since the phosphogypsum was deposited in a similar way in both zones using an open circuit system with seawater but zone 4 has undergone further restoration moreover the zone 3 is currently naked and exposed to weathering with a large surface pond storing process water the contribution of the process water infiltration to the composition of the edge leachates that emerge in this zone of the stack although minimal around 9 calculated using stable isotopes papaslioti et al 2018 could also explain the slightly higher concentrations observed in the leachates collected in zone 3 with respect to zone 4 table 1 on the other hand a higher fluvial influence in the edge leachates of zone 4 could explain the highest average concentrations of so4 and fe measured compared to those found in the other zones according to papaslioti et al 2018 zone 4 of the phosphogypsum stack is closer to the fluvial domain and hence the composition of the leachates that emerge in this zone is more influenced by the tinto river around 80 87 determined by stable isotope analysis which is highly affected by acid mine drainage amd i e acidic and sulfate and iron rich waters from the leaching of abandoned mining wastes mainly from the riotinto mines cánovas et al 2021 nieto et al 2013 the influence of the different end members on the hydrochemistry of edge outflows can be seen in fig 5 a where the results of the pca for variables and samples are shown both factors i e f1 and f2 explain 68 of variance and seem to be related to the different origin of pollutants in the outflows as can be seen three different groups of elements can be identified i those related to seawater including na cl mg k br or so4 ii those related to the acidic waters of the tinto river such as fe sb pb cu zn or as and iii those related to phosphogypsum wastewaters such as f cr u po4 nh4 and other trace metals however it is not surprising that some elements e g as or zn are common between the different groups taking into account that the edge outflows originate from the leaching of the phosphogypsum stack with water of estuarine origin thus the closeness of each sample to the different end members i e seawater process water and tinto river water would define the level of influence of each end member in these samples fig 5b 3 4 seasonal variability of the edge outflows hydrochemistry as mentioned above the huelva phosphogypsum stack behaves as an anthropic aquifer with numerous springs releasing large amounts of pollutants to the ría de huelva estuary these edge outflows showed low hydrochemical variability under the different hydrological conditions studied i e warm dry period rainy period and beginning of warm dry period after rainy events figs 3 and 4 however small fluctuations can be observed during the different scenarios thus the lowest ph values measured in the leachates from zones 2 and 3 occurred in the warm dry periods i e may june 2014 and 2015 average of 1 83 1 98 and 1 90 2 12 respectively while the highest values were measured in the rainy period average ph values of 2 17 and 2 31 respectively and beginning of warm dry period after rainy events average ph values of 2 04 and 2 18 respectively on the other hand the ph values of the leachates from zone 4 remained almost constant during the different seasons with average values between 2 21 and 2 27 the restoration measures implemented in this area likely minimize the infiltration of rainwater regarding the seasonal variability in the concentrations of pollutants these can be broadly classified into two groups according to their behavior during the different hydrological conditions on the one hand a group that includes most contaminants e g po4 f al zn cr ni as cd sb or u whose dissolved concentrations decrease during the rainy period i e november 2014 as a result of a dilution effect due to the recharge of rainwater figs 3 and 4 on the other hand a group that comprises pollutants such as so4 and fe which suffered an increase in the concentrations measured during the rainy period compared to the values analyzed in the leachates collected during the previous warm dry period i e may june 2014 fig 3 this increase in concentration of so4 and fe observed during the rainy season is due to the increasing concentration of these dissolved pollutants in the tinto river as a consequence of the washout of sulfate evaporitic salts which are formed along the riverbanks and mine sites mainly during the summer months and between rainfall events during warm dry springs cánovas et al 2021 olías et al 2006 the dissolution of these minerals together with the sweeping of sulfide oxidation products from mine sites lead to increasing metal concentrations in river waters entering the estuary as mentioned above there is a hydraulic connection between the estuary and the stack and therefore it seems reasonable to think that certain variations in the hydrochemistry of the estuarine water could be reflected in the chemical composition of the discharges from the phosphogypsum stack in order to study the significance of seasonal hydrochemical variations of edge outflows a statistical test was performed on samples collected during the rainy and dry seasons as variables did not exhibit a normal distribution the non parametric test of wilcoxon was selected applying both the signed test and the wilcoxon signed rank test the signed test compares the number of exceeding cases between populations without considering the magnitude of these differences while the wilcoxon signed rank test considers this magnitude table s5 as a result a spatial pattern was observed considering the seasonal differences noticed between the dry and rainy periods the closer to the river the higher statistical differences in variables were recorded for instance the zone 4 the closer to the tinto river exhibited significant statistical differences for as ni co u sb cd fe so4 zn al ca and po4 between both periods only some metals such as cr pb and cu together with f cl and ph showed similar distributions in both periods in the case of zone 3 located downstream to the ocean statistically significant differences were only observed for ph fe so4 sb al and ca while po4 showed only significant differences in the signed test the zone 2 the farther area from the river excluding zone 1 with only one sample exhibited the lower number of variables displaying statistically significant differences for ph al ca so4 and fe although in the latter two variables these differences were only observed in the signed test these results supports previous findings about the control exerted on the hydrochemical spatial variations of edge outflows by the closeness to the tinto river and its variability along the year in addition the phosphogypsum stack contaminates the surrounding system causing disturbances in the estuary and the aquatic biota for this reason a continuous monitoring is highly recommended to evaluate if these disturbances are temporary or permanent 4 environmental implications according to the hydrological response of the phosphogypsum stack it can be considered as an anthropogenic aquifer with a similar hydrogeological behavior than coastal karstic aquifers in fact karstic features are widely recognized in phosphogypsum stacks worldwide lottermoser 2010 arfib and charlier 2016 proposed a hydrological conceptual model for coastal karst aquifers divided into three reservoirs deep slow and fast which could be adjusted to the results observed in the current study see fig 1 the deep reservoir would be characterized by brackish water with low variations of discharge this reservoir would represent the storage function of the aquifer with a long residence time strongly affected by saline intrusion under these circumstances the water level shows a low variability most of the time only controlled by tidal oscillations in these prevailing conditions waters may move by diffuse slow flow through the primary porous matrix which could supply the spring during low flow period on the other hand both the slow and the fast reservoirs would be characterized by freshwater input the slow reservoir would represent the storage and the recession after rainfall events whereas the fast reservoir would be characterized by a rapid infiltration and transfer through the aquifer during rainy events under these circumstances the water quickly enters and emerges from the stack likely through large karst channels caused by gypsum dissolution regarding the hydrochemical behavior of leachates from the phophogypsum stack it is worth highlighting the low variability although statistically significant in some cases showed by these highly acidic and polluted waters under different hydrological conditions however it is of critical importance to sample in safe conditions the stack immediately after intense rainfall events when a rapid discharge is observed and sharper hydrochemical differences would be expected thus the results reported in this study have positive implications in the design of potential effective remediation treatments since notable fluctuations in flow rates and pollutant load can cause operational problems in the treatment systems the findings obtained allow calculating the pollutant load that finally reaches the ría de huelva estuary with some reliability given the observed chemically homogeneous response throughout the system thus an overall approach has been performed to calculate the metal loads released by the stack in each sampling period to obtain the values in each sampling the average concentrations of all the sampling points and the bulk discharge have been used considering all the edge outflows located around the perimeter of the phosphogypsum stack a bulk discharge of acid leachates of around 500 000 m3 yr has been estimated however these results may be underestimated due to the existence of diffuse edge outflows that are difficult to measure these leachates release enormous amounts of pollutants to the estuary e g po4 f fe zn as u cu cd and ni average values of 5000 t yr 300 t yr 76 t yr 11 t yr 6 9 t yr 3 0 t yr 1 7 t yr 1 1 t yr and 1 0 t yr respectively table 2 nevertheless this estuarine environment is also affected by the odiel and tinto rivers and their acidic and metal rich waters due to amd discharges from abandoned mining districts in the iberian pyrite belt ipb nieto et al 2013 in this sense table 2 also shows the average pollutant loads contributed by both rivers in the periods 1995 2003 olías et al 2006 and 2004 2006 nieto et al 2013 the results reported by these authors indicate a high variability in the average pollutant load transported by the odiel and tinto rivers associated to hydrological variations between periods comparing both sources of contamination i e phosphogypsum leachates and amd affected tinto and odiel rivers the phosphogypsum stack would be responsible for an average contribution of 16 85 of as 9 27 of cd 3 16 of ni 1 4 of fe and 0 3 2 of zn of the total discharge reaching the estuary in addition as mentioned above an important industrial complex is located in the ría de huelva estuary different industrial activities developed in this complex can also discharge metal rich effluents directly into the estuary pérez lópez et al 2011 in this sense these authors calculated the average pollutant load from the huelva industrial complex between 2003 and 2006 no current data available this value was much lower than that contributed by the tinto and odiel rivers exhibiting values of one to two orders of magnitude lower for most of the pollutants table 2 however pérez lópez et al 2011 did not contemplate in the study the contribution of pollutants to the estuary from the phosphogypsum stack as a pollution source also of industrial origin the capacity of contamination of the phosphogypsum pile is more significant taking into account that its extension is three orders of magnitude lower than the area of the fluvial basins i e around 3979 km2 in addition some of the pollutants e g po4 f and u discharged into the estuary from the phosphogypsum stack are negligible in the mine waters for these reasons the treatment of effluents from the phosphogypsum stack is essential to minimize the pollution that reaches the ría de huelva estuary in this sense the application of passive dispersed alkaline substrate das technology for highly acidic and contaminated phosphogypsum leachates has shown to be highly effective in reducing the pollutant load and acidity millán becerro et al 2020 2022 5 conclusions the results obtained in this study clearly indicate that the huelva phosphogypsum stack behaves as an anthropic aquifer with karstic features this aquifer shows two feeding ways a continuous recharge of estuarine water in the deep zone of the stack where phosphogypsum and marsh soil are directly in contact and a punctual recharge by rainwater that infiltrates through the surface of the phosphogypsum stack and circulates through dissolution conduits thus the water table of this aquifer is controlled mainly by tidal fluctuations showing low variability most of the time 2 cm however the water table of the stack rapidly increased up to 20 cm during the rainy events studied just after rainfall events around half of the height increased by the water table is instantly recovered while pre rainfalls conditions are reached within a period between 5 and 15 days depending on rainfall intensity edge outflows sampled around the whole perimeter of the phosphogypsum pile show generally low hydrochemical variability under different hydrological conditions however small variations in pollutant concentrations have been observed during the different periods the mechanisms responsible for such variations are on the one hand a dilution by rainwater recharge during the rainy period which cause a slight decrease in concentration of most dissolved contaminants e g po4 f al zn cr ni as cd sb or u observed in the edge outflows and on the other hand the dissolution of the sulfate evaporitic salts precipitated during the summer along the banks of the tinto river and mine sites which cause an increase in the dissolved concentration of so4 and fe in the river water and subsequently in the leachates released from the phosphogypsum stack during the rainy season the stack releases high concentrations of pollutants such as po4 f and u average values of 5000 t yr 300 t yr and 3 0 t yr respectively which are only found in phosphogypsum leachates in addition between 16 and 85 and 9 27 of the total content of as and cd respectively that reach the ría de huelva estuary come from the phosphogypsum stack credit authorship contribution statement ricardo millán becerro

2484,snowmelt from the tibetan plateau tp is the water source of many major asian rivers with significant importance for regional water supply and ecosystem services the spatiotemporal variations of snow cover on the tp and its response to climate change at different altitudes are still unclear because of the lack of in situ observations on the western tp and limitations of optical remote sensing due to clouds using a daily passive microwave remote sensing snow depth dataset from 1979 to 2020 across the tp this study investigates the spatiotemporal variations of snow depth and snow phenology as well as their responses to climate change the results showed that during the past 40 years the maximum snow depth sdmax and the snow cover duration days scd on the tp decreased significantly at a rate of 0 6 cm decade and 2 9 d decade respectively the snow cover starting date scs was delayed at a rate of 1 1 d decade whereas the snow cover melt date scm advanced at a rate of 1 1 d decade the decrease of scd was driven by the advance of scm which was caused by the decrease of sdmax whereas the decrease of sdmax was driven by the increase in snow accumulation season temperature ta the tp showed significant elevation dependent warming edw 0 04 decade 1 km 1 and elevation dependent decrease of sdmax 0 12 cm decade 1 km 1 and scd 4 1 d decade 1 km 1 the edw explains the elevation dependent decrease of sdmax r 0 72 p 0 05 and scd r 0 83 p 0 05 it is expected that the negative feedback effect of sdmax and scd on edw may further exacerbate the edw of the tp and the earlier snowmelt due to the continuous decrease of snow depth may increase the frequency of droughts and floods our findings support the enhancement of edw on the tp depletion of solid reservoirs and intensification of the regional water crisis in a warmer future keywords snow depth snow phenology elevation dependent warming climate change passive microwave remote sensing tibetan plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction over the past four decades the world has experienced rapid warming with significant seasonal differences there is an asymmetric trend that the warming of the non growing season is significantly higher than that of the growing season and this phenomenon is more obvious at high latitudes and altitudes liu and chen

more significant in future climate scenarios hayhoe et al 2007 stocker et al 2014 usgcrp 2017 latif et al 2019 sanders demott et al 2020 the direct effect of winter warming is the decrease of snow

the past few decades dye 2002 peng et al 2013 chen et al 2015b allchin and déry 2017 chen et al 2021 however the response of snow cover to global warming will be complicated by increased precipitation due to increasing temperatures especially at high latitudes and altitudes wang et al 2022 in addition to temperature and precipitation altitude is also an indispensable factor affecting snow distribution and change redpath et al 2019 wang et al 2022 generally the higher the altitude the lower the temperature and the more conducive to the generation and maintenance of snow cover elevation dependent warming edw in which the rate of warming increases with elevation may increase the threat to life sustaining solid reservoirs in high altitude mountains guo et al 2021 previous studies have reported the widespread existence of edw around the world liu et al 2009 pepin et al 2015 cai et al 2017 yan et al 2016 palazzi et al 2017 li et al 2019 gao et al 2021 dahlstedt 2021 but the existence of edw on the tibetan plateau tp is still controversial some studies suggest that the warming rate increases with an elevation below 5000 m on the tp whereas it may not increase further at higher elevations li et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 but other studies have found no edw you et al 2010 guo and wang 2012 guo et al 2021 explained the reasons for the divergence of result and believed that the existence of edw on the tp has changed over time there was no edw for 1961 2005 when regional warming was weak you et al 2010 but as time went on and regional warming intensified the edw became more prominent previous studies have revealed the edw over the tp palazzi et al 2017 li et al 2019 you et al 2019 li et al 2020a you et al 2020a dahlstedt 2021 niu et al 2021 but whether the change of snow cover over the tp is elevation dependent is not clear whether snow cover change has an obvious response to edw is likewise unknown known as the third pole of the world the tibetan plateau tp is the most extensive high altitude area in the world with rich snow resources and high topography 254 223 104 km2 and 8000 m the warming rate is faster and more intense than that of the world s average keyimu et al 2021 showing certain forward looking feedback on global climate change liu and chen 2000 liu et al 2009 guo and wang 2012 pepin et al 2015 as the water tower of asia the tp plays a crucial role in shaping the hydrometeorological characteristics of several major rivers in the asian continent and the changes in the cryosphere and hydrosphere on the tp caused by climate change directly affect the lives of billions of people liu et al 2009 therefore studying the response of snow cover on the tp to climate warming is of great significance not only for diagnostic analysis of asian regional and global climate change but also for formulating regional strategies for climate change and water resources management on the tp chen et al 2015a bibi et al 2018 earlier studies conducted site observations to reveal the response of snow cover to climate change peng et al 2010 you et al 2011 guo et al 2021 however most of the climate stations are located in the middle and eastern tp on the snow covered mountains especially in the western tp there are only a few climate stations therefore the regional representativeness of observed data is limited which cannot fully reflect the dynamic change of snow cover over the entire tp yang et al 2010 yang et al 2019a you et al 2020b the rapid development of geographic information systems and remote sensing technologies has provided unprecedented opportunities for the study of areas lacking observational data qin et al 2006 sheffield et al 2018 optical remote sensing snow products such as modis snow data have great potential in monitoring snow change in complex terrain areas you et al 2020b and have been widely used to examine snow distribution and seasonal variation on the tp pu et al 2007 wang and xie 2009 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018b however its period is short only since 2000 besides snow cover and clouds have similar reflectance spectrum characteristics which makes snow cover monitoring by optical remote sensing greatly affected by the weather dariane et al 2017 huang et al 2018 in addition the lack of snow depth detection methods also limits the application of optical remote sensing snow products dai et al 2017 passive microwave remote sensing based on the microwave spectral gradient method provides a potential method for monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of snow depth and snow cover under cloudy conditions chang et al 1987 kelly et al 2003 pulliainen 2006 che et al 2008 vander jagt et al 2013 wang et al 2013 che et al 2016 passive microwave snow depth data provides daily snow depth data for nearly 40 years which has been successfully applied in snow climatology snow hydrology and other fields qin et al 2006 wan et al 2014 huang et al 2016 yang et al 2019b to explore the spatiotemporal variations and driving mechanisms of snow depth and snow phenology in the latest and longest time series on the tp under the background of rapid climate change we had these objectives 1 to calculate the annual snow phenology using the daily passive microwave snow depth data from 1979 to 2020 and analyze its spatiotemporal trends and driving factors 2 to examine the altitudinal difference of snow phenology response to climate change 3 to explore how the tp snow depth responds to elevation dependent warming from the perspective of remote sensing this is the first study to describe the elevation dependent response of snow depth and snow phenology to climate change across the tp using passive microwave snow depth data the results will enrich the understanding of snow phenology over the tp and contribute to the better management of regional water resources 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the tibetan plateau tp is the highest and largest

zhang et al 2014 the terrain of the tp is extremely complex with the general characteristics of low in the southeast and high in the northwest fig 1 a under the influence of altitude and the indian monsoon the tp climate presents a hydrothermal gradient from southeast to northwest fig 1b c chen et al 2015a the tp is warm and rainy in summer cold and relatively dry in winter and snow cover mainly occurs from september to the following february fig 1d the meltwater of the tp is the origin of many of asian rivers such as the brahmaputra ganges indus mekong yangtze and yellow immerzeel et al 2010

and total precipitation pm in snow melt season on the tp were calculated according to the definition of snow accumulation season and snowmelt season in section 3 1 2 2 3 other data the digital

characteristics of snow cover on the tp pu et al 2007 wang and xie 2009 we defined the snow hydrological year from the previous year 1 september to the current year 31 august for example snow phenology in 1980 is derived from data from 1september 1979 to 31 august 1980 we defined the snow accumulation season from previous year 1 september to the current year february 28 or 29 and the snow melting season from current year 1 march to 31 august chen et al 2018 maximum snow depth is the record of the maximum snow depth record in the snow accumulation season the snow depth 0 cm is taken as the standard to determine the snow cover day which reaches the standard is marked as 1 otherwise it is 0 then according to the algorithm proposed by wang and xie 2009 the snow cover duration days scd the snow cover start date scs and the snow cover melt date scm in each hydrological year are calculated pixel by pixel the algorithm assumes that snow cover the ground continuously from falling to melting ignoring the influence of instantaneous snowfall 1 scd i 1 n s i 2 scs f d 1 scd bfd 3 scm f d 2 scd afd here n represents the number of days included in a hydrological year si is the occurrence of snow cover with values 1 for snow pixel and 0 for non snow pixel fd1 and fd2 is a fixed date the snow cover over the tp accumulates in autumn and melts in spring therefore fd1 is set as december 1st and fd2 is set as march 1st in eqs 2 and 3 scdafd is the scd after fd2 and scdbfd is the scd before fd1 pu et al 2007 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2018b 3 2 trend analysis the sen slope method was used to calculate the time series trends of each snow cover parameter scs scm scd sdmax mean temperature ta and total precipitation pa in snow accumulation season mean temperature tm and total precipitation pm in snow melt season the significance of trends was tested by mann kendall m k test a nonparametric method of monotonic trends that has been successfully used to detect trends in time series wang et al 2008 li et al 2011 3 3 contributions of scs and scm to scd to explore the contribution of scs and scm to scd using eq 4 we converted the scs scm and scd into standardized z score series over the tp during the period 1980 2020 4 z x i μ σ 5 scd a s c s b s c m c here μ is the mean of scs scm and scd over the tp during the period 1980 2020 and the σ are the standard deviations of scs scm and scd by regressing the z scores of scd against the z scores of scs and scm the contributions of scs and scm to scd anomalies can be derived from the regression coefficients the regression coefficients a and b in eq 5 were defined as the sensitivity of scd to scs and scd to scm in addition we performed an f test to reflect the level of significance between the relationships 3 4 sensitivity analysis of snow phenology based on the previous climate attribution analysis of snow phenology peng et al 2013 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2019b chen et al 2021 we assumed that the interannual variation of scs and sdmax was mainly driven by the mean temperature ta and total precipitation pa during the snow accumulation season and scm was mainly determined by the mean temperature tm during the melt season and maximum snow depth sdmax then the following three linear regression equations were established 6 scs a t a b p a c 7 sdmax d t a e p a f 8 scm g t m h s d m a x i the regression coefficients a and b in eq 6 were defined as the sensitivity of scs to ta and scs to pa similarly the regression coefficients d and e in eq 7 were defined as the sensitivity of sdmax to ta and sdmax to pa and the regression coefficients g and h in eq 8 were defined as the sensitivity of scm to tm and scm to sdmax c f and i were the residual errors in addition we performed an f test to reflect the level of significance between the relationships finally we compared the absolute values of standardized regression coefficients of each equation variable took the variable with the largest absolute value of coefficient as the relatively important variable and analyzed the relative importance of each factor action on the pixel scale 4 results 4 1 spatial distribution of snow phenology on the tibetan plateau the spatial distribution pattern of scs scm scd and sdmax on the tp from 1980 to 2020 are shown in fig 2 among them 7 of pixels with scs earlier than 275 days i e early september were mainly distributed in high altitude mountain areas such as the karakoram himalaya and altyn mountains however the spatial pattern of scm was contrary to that of scs and snow melted later in high altitude mountain areas in addition the early scs corresponded to the late scm making scd long in the above areas a total of 38 of scs pixels 320 days i e mid to late october were distributed in the qaidam montane desert zone hiid1 the eastern part of the tp the qangtang high cold steppe zone hic2 the southern tibet montane shrub steppe zone hiic2 and the southern qinghai high cold meadow steppe zone hic1 the scm was early in the above areas 75 d making the scd short in the above regions 20 50 d the high sdmax value region 20 cm was mainly distributed in the golog nagqu high cold shrub meadow zone hib1 and the western sichuan eastern tibet montane coniferous forest zone hiiab1 it was found that the maximum snow depth region is not in the region with the highest altitude because in addition to the spatial pattern difference caused by altitude difference different combinations of temperature and precipitation form different snow depth patterns thus different phenological patterns of snow cover were formed for example the high temperature low precipitation combination of hiid1 in the northern part of the tp corresponds to low snow depth late scs early scm short scd and the high temperature high precipitation combination of hiic2 in the southern part of the tp corresponds to low snow depth late scs early scm short scd the high temperature high precipitation combination of hiiab1 in the southeastern tp corresponds to the high snow depth early scs late scm long scd 4 2 spatiotemporal changes of snow phenology on the tibetan plateau fig 3 shows the changing trend of snow depth and snow phenology pixel by pixel in the past 41 years and the snow parameters showed significant spatial differences in the west of tp scs was significantly delayed 18 5 p 0 05 and scm was significantly advanced 21 p 0 05 resulting in a significant short scd 15 p 0 05 while in the east of tp scs was significantly advanced 16 p 0 05 and scm was significantly delayed 16 6 p 0 05 resulting in a significant long scd 17 2 p 0 05 sdmax increased significantly in the northeastern part of the tp 2 1 p 0 05 and decreased significantly in the western and southern tp 32 p 0 05 the mean scs scm scd and sdmax across the tp 1980 2020 were the 309 2 3 7th days of the hydrological year doy i e 5 november 102 3 8 5th doy i e 12 april 124 5 14 1 days and 6 28 1 66 cm in the past 40 years scd decreased at a rate of 2 9 d decade p 0 07 scs was significantly delayed at a rate of 1 1 d decade p 0 05 scm showed a non significant advancing trend at a rate of 1 1 d decade p 0 11 and sdmax decreased significantly at 0 06 cm y 1 p 0 05 fig 4 4 3 spatiotemporal variations of temperature and precipitation on the tibetan plateau the interannual trends of temperature and precipitation over the tp 1980 2020 are shown in fig 5 e and f ta and tm showed a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 001 the increasing rate of ta 0 026 y 1 was higher than that of tm 0 025 y 1 and pm showed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 0 484 mm y 1 p 0 05 however pa had no significant trend p 0 1 from the perspective of space the warming trend of ta in the west was higher than that in the eastern tp and the warming extent of ta gradually increased from east to west fig 5a the spatial pattern of tm warming in the northwest was higher than that in the southeast and the warming extent of tm gradually increased from southeast to northwest fig 5b pa showed a spatial pattern of increase in the northeast and decrease in the southwest fig 5c whereas pm showed a pattern of increase in the middle and decreasing in the north fig 5d 4 4 sensitivity of snow phenology to climate change sensitivity analysis was performed using eqs 6 8 to detect the driving factors of the snow phenology changes over the tp and the results are shown in fig 6 the sensitivity analysis of scs showed that ta played a more important role in scs changes in the western tp mainly in a positive manner 18 6 pixels with significant positive correlation fig 6a c indicating that temperature increase would lead to an scs delay whereas pa played a more important role in scs changes in the eastern tp mainly in a negative fashion 4 8 pixels with significant negative sensitivity fig 6b c indicating that the precipitation increase would lead to scs advance the results of the sdmax sensitivity analysis showed that sdmax was negatively sensitive to ta indicating that the increase of ta would lead to the decrease of sdmax and the pixels with significant negative sensitivity accounted for 55 2 of the whole study area fig 6d sdmax was positively sensitive to pa indicating that the increase of pa will increase the snow depth the significant positive correlation pixels accounted for 43 7 of the whole region whereas the significant negative correlation pixels only accounted for 2 9 mainly distributed in the kunlun mountain plateau fig 6e by comparing the sensitivity coefficients of sdmax to ta and pa we obtained the spatial distribution diagram of the relative importance of ta and pa fig 6f in which the relatively important pixels of pa accounted for 40 3 of the whole research area mainly distributed in the eastern tp the relatively important pixels of ta accounted for 59 6 of the whole study area mainly distributed in the western tp the results of scm sensitivity analysis showed that scm was mainly negatively sensitive to tm 40 7 pixels with significantly negative correlation fig 6g that is temperature rise would lead to scm advance scm was positively sensitive to sdmax 63 0 pixels with significant correlation fig 6h indicating that the snow depth increase would lead to an scm delay the pixels of scm mainly affected by tm accounted for 42 2 of the whole research area and those affected by sdmax accounted for 57 8 compared with sdmax the areas where tm was relatively important to scm were mainly distributed in the western western sichuan eastern tibet montane coniferous forest zone hiiab1 the middle of golog nagqu high cold shrub meadow zone hib1 and the north of kunlun high cold desert zone hid1 whereas in most other areas sdmax was relatively important to scm fig 6i 4 5 contributions of scs and scm to scd the contributions of scs and scm to scd were estimated by their standardized values from 1980 to 2020 fig 7 a and b showed the spatial distribution of sensitivity coefficients of scs and scm by comparing the standard partial regression coefficients of scs and scm of each pixel it was found that the pixels with high scm coefficients accounted for 99 6 at the significant level of 0 05 this means that scd changes on the tp are primarily scm driven it can be seen from the correlation diagram fig 7c d of scd scs and scm across the whole tp that scd and scm had a significant positive correlation p 0 001 for one day that scm was delayed scd was prolonged by 1 4 days scd was negatively correlated with scs but not significantly p 0 1 4 6 vertical difference of snow phenology response to climate change to quantitatively describe the relationship between snow phenology and altitude on the tp the 41 year mean and trends of scs scd and scm during1980 2020 were calculated fig 8 as a function of altitude scs becomes early scm late and scd long as the elevation increases the mean gradients of scd scs and scm with elevation are 3 6 1 1 and 1 8 d 100 m respectively fig 8a fig 8b analyzed the changing trend of scd scm and scs in elevation bins every 500 m on average the elevation bins with pixel numbers 200 were selected for analysis that is 3000 5500 m while the number of pixels in other elevation bins was relatively small and the representation is weak trend analysis showed that scd increased between 3000 m and 4500 m and decreased between 4500 and 5500 m fig 8b the changing trend of scm was similar to that of scd at all altitude gradients whereas that of scs was opposite to that of scd by comparing the absolute value of the trend of scs and scm at each altitude fig 8b it was found that the trend of scm was higher than that of scs the above analysis further confirmed that the change of scm dominated the change of scd on the tp we analyzed the sensitivity of snow phenology to climate change with altitude fig 9 it was found that the sensitivity of sdmax to ta and pa was dependent on altitude sdmax showed a negative feedback effect on ta which increased with the altitude but decreased with the increase of altitude above 5000 m sdmax presented a positive feedback effect on pa which increased with the elevation but decreased with the increase of elevation above 4000 m by comparing the absolute values of the sensitivity coefficient of each elevation gradient it was found that sdmax was more sensitive to ta than pa in the region above 2000 m that is relative to precipitation temperature dominates the change of snow depth at each elevation gradient the sensitivity of scm to sdmax and tm also showed significant elevation dependence scm has a negative feedback effect on tm which decreases with elevation scm had a positive feedback effect on sdmax which increased first and then decreased with elevation comparing the absolute value of sensitivity coefficient scm was more sensitive to sdmax than tm at each elevation gradient which means that snow depth dominated the change of snowmelt period at each elevation gradient the sensitivity of scs to ta and pa was significantly different at different altitude gradients in general temperature dominated scs changes at higher altitudes whereas precipitation dominated scs changes at lower altitudes 4 7 responses of snow depth and snow cover duration days to elevation dependent warming to illustrate the change of snow cover response to climate change with altitude we selected the elevation bins with pixel numbers 200 i e 3000 5500 m and calculated the changing trend of ta pa sdmax and scd over time at five elevation classes 12 time periods generated using a 30 year sliding window fig 10 as can be seen from the fig 10 scd showed an increasing trend below 4500 m and a decreasing trend above 4500 m which is like the trend of pa as can be seen from the linear equation of pa pa is the highest between 3500 m and 4000 m and decreased dramatically above 4500 m while the warming rate of ta does not change much below 4500 m 0 14 0 17 decade 1 but increases significantly above 4500 m 0 26 decade 1 we speculate that the combined effect of ta warming and pa reduction makes scd change at 4500 m ta showed a statistically significant increasing trend on all elevations over time and the higher the elevation was the more severe the warming trend sdmax showed a statistically significant decreasing trend opposite to ta at all elevations in addition the rate of snow depth decrease was faster in the high altitude region which seems to be related to the higher warming rate in the high altitude region to further explain the relationship between the warming trend and the snow depth trend as well as the warming trend and the snow duration trend we calculated the altitudinal profile differences between sdmax scd and ta trends from 1980 to 2020 fig 11 we found that there was a significant elevation dependent warming and elevation dependent reduction of snow depth on the tp specifically for every 500 m increase in average altitude the warming trend of ta increased by 0 02 decade 1 and the decreasing trend of sdmax increased by 0 06 cm decade 1 the elevation dependent warming of air temperature explained the elevation dependent reduction of snow depth r 0 72 p 0 05 however the elevation dependent shrinking phenomenon of scd was only significant in the elevation gradient of 2000 5500 m and the shortening trend of scd increased by 2 05 d decade 1 with each 500 m increase in average elevation in this elevation gradient edw phenomenon of air temperature also explains the elevation dependent shrinking phenomenon of scd r 0 83 p 0 05 considering that the number of pixels in some elevation bins is less and the representation is weak we choose elevation bins with 200 pixels to conduct the analysis again it was found that the elevation dependent warming and the elevation dependent reduction of snow depth were more significant in the range of 3000 to 5500 m for every 500 m increase in average altitude the warming trend of ta increased by 0 04 decade 1 and the decreasing trend of sdmax increased by 1 35 cm decade 1 the correlation between elevation dependent warming and elevation dependent reduction of snow depth was as high as 0 99 p 0 001 and the correlation between elevation dependent warming and elevation dependent reduction of scd was as high as 0 93 p 0 02 in addition we further analyzed the changing trend of ta sdmax and scd in 10 major ecoclimatic zones on the tp in the past 40 years as can be seen from fig 12 ta showed a significant warming trend in all regions except hiic1 fig 12b sdmax showed a significant decreasing trend mainly in hiiab1 hiic2 hic2 and hid1 scd showed a significant increasing trend in hiiab1 hiid2 and hib1 and a significant decreasing trend in hic2 and hid1 combined with fig 1a and fig 12a the elevation of the tp gradually increased from northeast to southwest forming a certain elevation gradient naturally we carried out linear fitting on the trends of ta sdmax and scd with natural altitudinal gradients and again found that with the increase in altitude the warming trend of ta was significantly aggravated and the decreasing trend of sdmax and scd was significantly aggravated in the two highest elevations hic2 hid1 the warming and the reduction of sdmax and scd are very significant according to the changing trend of different ecoclimatic zones with altitude fig 13 there was significant edw in hiiab1 hib1 and hid1 while there was no significant edw in other regions the response of snow cover to edw varies in different ecoclimatic regions as can be seen from table 1 the edw of hiiab1 hib1 hic1 hiic2 and hid1 has a significant negative correlation with the elevation dependent decrease of sdmax and the correlation coefficient ranges from 0 79 to 0 99 these results indicate that the elevation dependent warming of these regions contributes greatly to the reduction of the elevation dependence of snow depth 5 discussion and conclusions snow cover is one of the most sensitive climate factors to global warming in this study the spatiotemporal variations of snow cover including sdmax scs scm and scd over the tibetan plateau tp during 1980 2020 and its response to climate change were analyzed using a daily passive microwave snow depth dataset and the causes of snow cover change were discussed in the past 40 years the snow cover on the tp has changed significantly with a significant decrease in sdmax and scd a significant delay in scs and a non significant advance in scm fig 4 this is consistent with the trend found in previous studies based on meteorological stations and satellite data peng et al 2010 huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 bibi et al 2018 guo et al 2021 the shortening of scd is controlled by the delay of scs and the advance of scm xu et al 2017 we agree with this view and further clarify the relationship between scd changes and scs scm changes we found that scd had a significant positive correlation with scm but not with scs fig 7c d by comparing the absolute value of the sensitivity coefficient of scd to scs and scm fig 7a b and the trends of snow phenology on each elevation gradient fig 8b we further confirmed that scd changes on the tp during 1980 2020 were dominated by scm chen et al 2018 believed that the shortened scd was dominated by scs which may be caused by different study periods our results are similar to those of previous studies in the tianshan mountains in central asia yang et al 2019b and the northern hemisphere peng et al 2013 chen et al 2015b klein et al 2016 chen et al 2021 it can be seen that the dominant factors of seasonal snow cover change may be different for different study periods and areas the changes in temperature and precipitation play a key role in the dynamics of snow phenology over the tp you et al 2020b our study analyzed their relative importance in terms of horizontal space and vertical elevation gradient from the perspective of horizontal space scs and sdmax were more sensitive to ta than pa in the western tp fig 6c f which might be due to the more intense warming in the snow season in the western tp fig 5a due to the positive sensitivity of scs to ta fig 6a and the negative sensitivity of sdmax to ta fig 6d scs in the western tp were significantly delayed fig 3a and sdmax was significantly reduced fig 3d while in the eastern part of the tp scs and sdmax were more sensitive to pa which may be due to the large increase of precipitation during the snow season in the eastern tp fig 5c due to the negative sensitivity of scs to pa fig 6b and the positive sensitivity of sdmax to pa fig 6e scs in the eastern tp significantly advanced fig 3a and sdmax significantly increased fig 3d from the vertical gradient fig 9 sdmax was more sensitive to ta at each elevation gradient whereas scm was more sensitive to sdmax scs was more sensitive to ta at high altitudes which may be related to the higher warming rate at high altitudes scs is more sensitive to pa at low altitudes which may be attributed to abundant precipitation fig 10 in addition we also found that the elevation response of snow phenology to climate sensitivity was not a simple linear relationship for example the sdmax negative feedback to ta first increased with elevation but decreased with elevation above 5000 m this may be because perennial snow cover is mainly distributed in areas above 5000 m where almost constant snow cover and glacier cover effectively limit the rate of warming li et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 trends in snow duration are also expected to feed back into temperature trends peng et al 2013 when snow cover and glaciers decrease the warming rate is amplified zhang et al 2022 thus with the depletion of snow cover and glaciers the tp may experience more significant warming in the future further exacerbating other environmental changes liu et al 2009 bibi et al 2018 you et al 2020b our study found that the spatiotemporal variations of snow phenology were strongly dependent on altitude and scd extended 3 6 days scs advanced 1 1 days and scm delayed 1 8 days for every 100 m elevation increase the tp showed significant elevation dependent warming 0 04 decade 1 km 1 and elevation dependent shrinking of snow depth 0 12 cm decade 1 km 1 fig 11 elevation dependent warming of air temperature explained the elevation dependent shrinking of snow depth r 0 72 p 0 05 and this correlation is higher in 3000 5500 m r 0 99 p 0 001 which is similar to guo et al s 2021 conclusion based on meteorological stations in addition we also found an elevation dependent shrinkage of scd 4 1 d decade 1 km 1 fig 11 within the elevation gradient of 2000 5500 m which could also be explained by elevation dependent warming r 0 83 p 0 05 and this correlation is also higher in 3000 5500 m r 0 93 p 0 02 we found that the warming rate began to reverse above 6000 m the decreasing trend of sdmax reversed at 5500 m and the changing trend of scd also reversed fig 11 we believed that snow depth and snow duration together reversed the elevation warming mode above 6000 m and below this is similar to the edw reversal observed by previous investigations li et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 but it was found that the change point was at 5000 m and the snow duration caused the reversal the difference in results is probably due to differences in the data and resolution used we have also found this reversal and believed that the presence of snow reverses the elevation warming pattern of the tp because snow is more extensive and persistent above the change point the buffering effect of snow prevents the increase of warming with altitude whereas snow depletion leads to the existence of edw below the change point elevation dependent reductions in snow depth and snow duration are expected to further exacerbate the edw of the tp and the edw of tp may be strengthened in a warmer future which may increase the threat to life sustaining solid reservoirs in high altitude mountainous areas guo et al 2021 a passive microwave snow depth dataset provides effective daily snow depth data with long time series for monitoring snow cover changes over the tp from 1980 to 2020 however the rough spatial resolution 25 km of passive microwave remote sensing may lead to the limitation of the retrieved snow depth for example low ground temperature causes the snow depth in the northwest and southeast tp to be overestimated and the snow depth in the shallow snow area and cold desert in the midwest tp to be underestimated dai et al 2017 most of the tp has shallow snow so we calculated the snow phenology on the tp over the last 40 years based on sd 0 cm but the passive microwave sensor was limited by penetration depth which may lead to 0 sd 5 cm has an error we compared the scd calculated based on sd 0 1 2 3 4 5 cm and found that the scd calculated based on different snow depths all showed a decreasing trend from 1980 to 2020 and the scd calculated based on sd 3 cm showed the most significant change from 1980 to 2020 with the largest reduction range and the largest inter annual fluctuation table2 the scd calculated based on sd 0 cm showed the smallest inter annual fluctuation but the decreasing trend was not significant however after removing the 2020 data decreased significantly at the p 0 1 level it can be seen from fig 14 that the scd calculated based on different snow depths are all exceptionally high in 2020 which is due to the higher scd in the karakoram kunlun altun and gangdise mountains in 2020 resulting in a higher scd in the whole region therefore we considered 2020 as an abnormal year and the data of 2020 were not included in the calculation of the scd and scm equations in fig 4 fig 5e showed that the precipitation pa in the snow accumulation season in 2020 is more than that in previous years while mean temperature ta in the snow accumulation season is lower than that in previous years it is speculated that the delay of scm in 2020 may be due to the joint effect of the increase of pa and the decrease of ta while the scm delay resulted in prolonged scd in 2020 in this study we mainly considered the effects of temperature precipitation and altitude on snow depth and snow phenology distribution in addition wind speed and direction slope and aspect also have certain effects on snow distribution for example we found that the maximum snow depth was not found at the highest elevations such as hid1 because wind direction and speed might be important factors affecting the spatial distribution of snow depth at high elevations where no canopy exit troendle and king 1987 woods et al 2006 jost et al 2007 varhola et al 2010 in addition due to the windward leeward effect the slope aspect can also influence snow phenology by altering local solar radiation and moisture conditions as well as the potential accumulation state tong et al 2009 li et al 2020b however considering that the resolution of passive microwave snow depth data used in our study is relatively rough the spatial resolution is about 25 km these factors are not considered in this study these factors should be considered when using finer resolution data in the future changes in snow cover on the tp are a key component of climate change and are critical to many hydrological and biological processes you et al 2020b slatyer et al 2022 tarca et al 2022 for example the thickness and melting of snow will affect the soil water content ultimately affecting vegetation growth molotch et al 2009 maurer and bowling 2014 xu et al 2020 the snow melt date will affect the start time of the vegetation growing season ultimately affect the length of the vegetation growing season and affect the accumulation period of vegetation npp piao et al 2017 wang et al 2018a in recent years the snow line of the tp keeps rising and the perennial snow area is shrinking and beginning to transit to the seasonal snow area huang et al 2017 which may change the distribution pattern of alpine vegetation on the tp gentili et al 2020 the tp has a typical alpine vegetation ecosystem and rich snow resources changes in snow depth and snow phenology will have an important impact on the growth and distribution of alpine vegetation which is a key area for future

2484,snowmelt from the tibetan plateau tp is the water source of many major asian rivers with significant importance for regional water supply and ecosystem services the spatiotemporal variations of snow cover on the tp and its response to climate change at different altitudes are still unclear because of the lack of in situ observations on the western tp and limitations of optical remote sensing due to clouds using a daily passive microwave remote sensing snow depth dataset from 1979 to 2020 across the tp this study investigates the spatiotemporal variations of snow depth and snow phenology as well as their responses to climate change the results showed that during the past 40 years the maximum snow depth sdmax and the snow cover duration days scd on the tp decreased significantly at a rate of 0 6 cm decade and 2 9 d decade respectively the snow cover starting date scs was delayed at a rate of 1 1 d decade whereas the snow cover melt date scm advanced at a rate of 1 1 d decade the decrease of scd was driven by the advance of scm which was caused by the decrease of sdmax whereas the decrease of sdmax was driven by the increase in snow accumulation season temperature ta the tp showed significant elevation dependent warming edw 0 04 decade 1 km 1 and elevation dependent decrease of sdmax 0 12 cm decade 1 km 1 and scd 4 1 d decade 1 km 1 the edw explains the elevation dependent decrease of sdmax r 0 72 p 0 05 and scd r 0 83 p 0 05 it is expected that the negative feedback effect of sdmax and scd on edw may further exacerbate the edw of the tp and the earlier snowmelt due to the continuous decrease of snow depth may increase the frequency of droughts and floods our findings support the enhancement of edw on the tp depletion of solid reservoirs and intensification of the regional water crisis in a warmer future keywords snow depth snow phenology elevation dependent warming climate change passive microwave remote sensing tibetan plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction over the past four decades the world has experienced rapid warming with significant seasonal differences there is an asymmetric trend that the warming of the non growing season is significantly higher than that of the growing season and this phenomenon is more obvious at high latitudes and altitudes liu and chen 2000 chen et al 2003 kang et al 2010 piao et al 2010 stocker et al 2014 suonan et al 2017 bibi et al 2018 krishnan et al 2019 you et al 2020a this seasonal asymmetric warming trend is expected to be more significant in future climate scenarios hayhoe et al 2007 stocker et al 2014 usgcrp 2017 latif et al 2019 sanders demott et al 2020 the direct effect of winter warming is the decrease of snow cover area and snow thickness and the increase in freeze thaw cycles hayhoe et al 2007 choi et al 2010 notaro et al 2014 you et al 2020b snow cover as one of the most sensitive climate elements to global warming plays an important role in the regional and global water cycle as well as the climate system barnett et al 2005 you et al 2020b snow depth and snow phenology snow cover start date snow cover melt date and snow cover duration days are important indicators of snow cover change and show a direct impact on fresh water supply and vegetation growth in the watersheds dominated by snow melt butt 2012 che et al 2016 trishchenko and wang 2018 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b zhang and ma 2018 the snow depth and snow cover duration days have decreased across the northern hemisphere over the past few decades dye 2002 peng et al 2013 chen et al 2015b allchin and déry 2017 chen et al 2021 however the response of snow cover to global warming will be complicated by increased precipitation due to increasing temperatures especially at high latitudes and altitudes wang et al 2022 in addition to temperature and precipitation altitude is also an indispensable factor affecting snow distribution and change redpath et al 2019 wang et al 2022 generally the higher the altitude the lower the temperature and the more conducive to the generation and maintenance of snow cover elevation dependent warming edw in which the rate of warming increases with elevation may increase the threat to life sustaining solid reservoirs in high altitude mountains guo et al 2021 previous studies have reported the widespread existence of edw around the world liu et al 2009 pepin et al 2015 cai et al 2017 yan et al 2016 palazzi et al 2017 li et al 2019 gao et al 2021 dahlstedt 2021 but the existence of edw on the tibetan plateau tp is still controversial some studies suggest that the warming rate increases with an elevation below 5000 m on the tp whereas it may not increase further at higher elevations li et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 but other studies have found no edw you et al 2010 guo and wang 2012 guo et al 2021 explained the reasons for the divergence of result and believed that the existence of edw on the tp has changed over time there was no edw for 1961 2005 when regional warming was weak you et al 2010 but as time went on and regional warming intensified the edw became more prominent previous studies have revealed the edw over the tp palazzi et al 2017 li et al 2019 you et al 2019 li et al 2020a you et al 2020a dahlstedt 2021 niu et al 2021 but whether the change of snow cover over the tp is elevation dependent is not clear whether snow cover change has an obvious response to edw is likewise unknown known as the third pole of the world the tibetan plateau tp is the most extensive high altitude area in the world with rich snow resources and high topography 254 223 104 km2 and 8000 m the warming rate is faster and more intense than that of the world s average keyimu et al 2021 showing certain forward looking feedback on global climate change liu and chen 2000 liu et al 2009 guo and wang 2012 pepin et al 2015 as the water tower of asia the tp plays a crucial role in shaping the hydrometeorological characteristics of several major rivers in the asian continent and the changes in the cryosphere and hydrosphere on the tp caused by climate change directly affect the lives of billions of people liu et al 2009 therefore studying the response of snow cover on the tp to climate warming is of great significance not only for diagnostic analysis of asian regional and global climate change but also for formulating regional strategies for climate change and water resources management on the tp chen et al 2015a bibi et al 2018 earlier studies conducted site observations to reveal the response of snow cover to climate change peng et al 2010 you et al 2011 guo et al 2021 however most of the climate stations are located in the middle and eastern tp on the snow covered mountains especially in the western tp there are only a few climate stations therefore the regional representativeness of observed data is limited which cannot fully reflect the dynamic change of snow cover over the entire tp yang et al 2010 yang et al 2019a you et al 2020b the rapid development of geographic information systems and remote sensing technologies has provided unprecedented opportunities for the study of areas lacking observational data qin et al 2006 sheffield et al 2018 optical remote sensing snow products such as modis snow data have great potential in monitoring snow change in complex terrain areas you et al 2020b and have been widely used to examine snow distribution and seasonal variation on the tp pu et al 2007 wang and xie 2009 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018b however its period is short only since 2000 besides snow cover and clouds have similar reflectance spectrum characteristics which makes snow cover monitoring by optical remote sensing greatly affected by the weather dariane et al 2017 huang et al 2018 in addition the lack of snow depth detection methods also limits the application of optical remote sensing snow products dai et al 2017 passive microwave remote sensing based on the microwave spectral gradient method provides a potential method for monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of snow depth and snow cover under cloudy conditions chang et al 1987 kelly et al 2003 pulliainen 2006 che et al 2008 vander jagt et al 2013 wang et al 2013 che et al 2016 passive microwave snow depth data provides daily snow depth data for nearly 40 years which has been successfully applied in snow climatology snow hydrology and other fields qin et al 2006 wan et al 2014 huang et al 2016 yang et al 2019b to explore the spatiotemporal variations and driving mechanisms of snow depth and snow phenology in the latest and longest time series on the tp under the background of rapid climate change we had these objectives 1 to calculate the annual snow phenology using the daily passive microwave snow depth data from 1979 to 2020 and analyze its spatiotemporal trends and driving factors 2 to examine the altitudinal difference of snow phenology response to climate change 3 to explore how the tp snow depth responds to elevation dependent warming from the perspective of remote sensing this is the first study to describe the elevation dependent response of snow depth and snow phenology to climate change across the tp using passive microwave snow depth data the results will enrich the understanding of snow phenology over the tp and contribute to the better management of regional water resources 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the tibetan plateau tp is the highest and largest plateau in the world with an average elevation of 4000 m kang et al 2010 the tp is located in the middle and lower latitudes of the northern hemisphere 25 59 37 n 39 49 33 n 73 29 56 e 104 40 20 e zhang et al 2014 the terrain of the tp is extremely complex with the general characteristics of low in the southeast and high in the northwest fig 1 a under the influence of altitude and the indian monsoon the tp climate presents a hydrothermal gradient from southeast to northwest fig 1b c chen et al 2015a the tp is warm and rainy in summer cold and relatively dry in winter and snow cover mainly occurs from september to the following february fig 1d the meltwater of the tp is the origin of many of asian rivers such as the brahmaputra ganges indus mekong yangtze and yellow immerzeel et al 2010 yao et al 2012 huang et al 2017 2 2 data source 2 2 1 remote sensing snow depth products the daily passive microwave snow depth dataset was obtained from the national tibetan plateau science data center tpdc https data tpdc ac cn en with a spatial resolution of 25 km che and dai 2015 the dataset was retrieved from the brightness temperature data from the national snow and ice data center nsidc including the scanning multichannel radiometer smmr 1978 1987 special sensor microwave imager ssm i 1987 2007 and special sensor microwave imager sounder ssmi s 2008 2020 first the time consistency of this dataset was improved by cross calibration of the brightness temperatures of different sensors dai et al 2015 then the dataset was generated through a modified chang algorithm which was based on the in situ snow data of china taking the impact of liquid water content in the snow layer surface water body forest cover and observation error into consideration che et al 2008 dai et al 2012 dai et

explore the contribution of temperature and precipitation to snow cover changes over the tp monthly mean temperature and monthly precipitation datasets over the tp from 1979 to 2020 used in this study

downscaling scheme in china based on the global 0 5 climate data published by the climate research unit cru https www cru uea ac uk and the global high resolution climate data published by worldclim https worldclim org these datasets verified by 496 meteorological observation station data peng et al 2019 the dataset was resampled to 25 km using bilinear interpolation to ensure consistent resolution with the snow cover data and then the data were extracted according to the study area finally mean temperature ta and total precipitation pa in snow accumulation season mean temperature tm and total precipitation pm in snow melt season on the tp were calculated according to the definition of snow accumulation season and snowmelt season in section 3 1 2 2 3 other data the digital elevation model dem was obtained from the cgiar consortium for spatial information srtm digital elevation database https www cgiar csi org with a spatial resolution of 250 m and resampling to 25 km vector range data of the tp was obtained from the global change research data publishing and repository https doi org 10 3974 geodb 2014 01 12 v1 zhang et al 2014 vector data of ecological zones were

characteristics of snow cover on the tp pu et al 2007 wang and xie 2009 we defined the snow hydrological year from the previous year 1 september to the current year 31 august for example snow phenology in 1980 is derived from data from 1september 1979 to 31 august 1980 we defined the snow accumulation season from previous year 1 september to the current year february 28 or 29 and the snow melting season from current year 1 march to 31 august chen et al 2018 maximum snow depth is the record of the maximum snow depth record in the snow accumulation season the snow depth 0 cm is taken as the standard to determine the snow cover day which reaches the standard is marked as 1 otherwise it is 0 then according to the algorithm proposed by wang and xie 2009 the snow cover duration days scd the snow cover start date scs and the snow cover melt date scm in each hydrological year are calculated pixel by pixel the algorithm assumes that snow cover the ground continuously from falling to melting ignoring the influence of instantaneous snowfall 1 scd i 1 n s i 2 scs f d 1 scd bfd 3 scm f d 2 scd afd here n represents the number of days included in a hydrological year si is the occurrence of snow cover with values 1 for snow pixel and 0 for non snow pixel fd1 and fd2 is a fixed date the snow cover over the tp accumulates in autumn and melts in spring therefore fd1 is set as december 1st and fd2 is set as march 1st in eqs 2 and 3 scdafd is the scd after fd2 and scdbfd is the scd before fd1 pu et al 2007 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2018b 3 2 trend analysis the sen slope method was used to calculate the time series trends of each snow cover parameter scs scm scd sdmax mean temperature ta and total precipitation pa in snow accumulation season mean temperature tm and total precipitation pm in snow melt season the significance of trends was tested by mann kendall m k test a nonparametric method of monotonic trends that has been successfully used to detect trends in time series wang et al 2008 li et al 2011 3 3 contributions of scs and scm to scd to explore the contribution of scs and scm to scd using eq 4 we converted the scs scm and scd into standardized z score series over the tp during the period 1980 2020 4 z x i μ σ 5 scd a s c s b s c m c here μ is the mean of scs scm and scd over the tp during the period 1980 2020 and the σ are the standard deviations of scs scm and scd by regressing the z scores of scd against the z scores of scs and scm the contributions of scs and scm to scd anomalies can be derived from the regression coefficients the regression coefficients a and b in eq 5 were defined as the sensitivity of scd to scs and scd to scm in addition we performed an f test to reflect the level of significance between the relationships 3 4 sensitivity analysis of snow phenology based on the previous climate attribution analysis of snow phenology peng et al 2013 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2019b chen et al 2021 we assumed that the interannual variation of scs and sdmax was mainly driven by the mean temperature ta and total precipitation pa during the snow accumulation season and scm was mainly determined by the mean temperature tm during the melt season and maximum snow depth sdmax then the following three linear regression equations were established 6 scs a t a b p a c 7 sdmax d t a e p a f 8 scm g t m h s d m a x i the regression coefficients a and b in eq 6 were defined as the sensitivity of scs to ta and scs to pa similarly the regression coefficients d and e in eq 7 were defined as the sensitivity of sdmax to ta and sdmax to pa and the regression coefficients g and h in eq 8 were defined as the sensitivity of scm to tm and scm to sdmax c f and i were the residual errors in addition we performed an f test to reflect the level of significance between the relationships finally we compared the absolute values of standardized regression coefficients of each equation variable took the variable with the largest absolute value of coefficient as the relatively important variable and analyzed the relative importance of each factor action on the pixel scale 4 results 4 1 spatial distribution of snow phenology on the tibetan plateau the spatial distribution pattern of scs scm scd and sdmax on the tp from 1980 to 2020 are shown in fig 2 among them 7 of pixels with scs earlier than 275 days i e early september were mainly distributed in high altitude mountain areas such as the karakoram himalaya and altyn mountains however the spatial pattern of scm was contrary to that of scs and snow melted later in high altitude mountain areas in addition the early scs corresponded to the late scm making scd long in the above areas a total of 38 of scs pixels 320 days i e mid to late october were distributed in the qaidam montane desert zone hiid1 the eastern part of the tp the qangtang high cold steppe zone hic2 the southern tibet montane shrub steppe zone hiic2 and the southern qinghai high cold meadow steppe zone hic1 the scm was early in the above areas 75 d making the scd short in the above regions 20 50 d the high sdmax value region 20 cm was mainly distributed in the golog nagqu high cold shrub meadow zone hib1 and the western sichuan eastern tibet montane coniferous forest zone hiiab1 it was found that the maximum snow depth region is not in the region with the highest altitude because in addition to the spatial pattern difference caused by altitude difference different combinations of temperature and precipitation form different snow depth patterns thus different phenological patterns of snow cover were formed for example the high temperature low precipitation combination of hiid1 in the northern part of the tp corresponds to low snow depth late scs early scm short scd and the high temperature high precipitation combination of hiic2 in the southern part of the tp corresponds to low snow depth late scs early scm short scd the high temperature high precipitation combination of hiiab1 in the southeastern tp corresponds to the high snow depth early scs late scm long scd 4 2 spatiotemporal changes of snow phenology on the tibetan plateau fig 3 shows the changing trend of snow depth and snow phenology pixel by pixel in the past 41 years and the snow parameters showed significant spatial differences in the west of tp scs was significantly delayed 18 5 p 0 05 and scm was significantly advanced 21 p 0 05 resulting in a significant short scd 15 p 0 05 while in the east of tp scs was significantly advanced 16 p 0 05 and scm was significantly delayed 16 6 p 0 05 resulting in a significant long scd 17 2 p 0 05 sdmax increased significantly in the northeastern part of the tp 2 1 p 0 05 and decreased significantly in the western and southern tp 32 p 0 05 the mean scs scm scd and sdmax across the tp 1980 2020 were the 309 2 3 7th days of the hydrological year doy i e 5 november 102 3 8 5th doy i e 12 april 124 5 14 1 days and 6 28 1 66 cm in the past 40 years scd decreased at a rate of 2 9 d decade p 0 07 scs was significantly delayed at a rate of 1 1 d decade p 0 05 scm showed a non significant advancing trend at a rate of 1 1 d decade p 0 11 and sdmax decreased significantly at 0 06 cm y 1 p 0 05 fig 4 4 3 spatiotemporal variations of temperature and precipitation on the tibetan plateau the interannual trends of temperature and precipitation over the tp 1980 2020 are shown in fig 5 e and f ta and tm showed a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 001 the increasing rate of ta 0 026 y 1 was higher than that of tm 0 025 y 1 and pm showed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 0 484 mm y 1 p 0 05 however pa had no significant trend p 0 1 from the perspective of space the warming trend of ta in the west was higher than that in the eastern tp and the warming extent of ta gradually increased from east to west fig 5a the spatial pattern of tm warming in the northwest was higher than that in the southeast and the warming extent of tm gradually increased from southeast to northwest fig 5b pa showed a spatial pattern of increase in the northeast and decrease in the southwest fig 5c whereas pm showed a pattern of increase in the middle and decreasing in the north fig 5d 4 4 sensitivity of snow phenology to climate change sensitivity analysis was performed using eqs 6 8 to detect the driving factors of the snow phenology changes over the tp and the results are shown in fig 6 the sensitivity analysis of scs showed that ta played a more important role in scs changes in the western tp mainly in a positive manner 18 6 pixels with significant positive correlation fig 6a c indicating that temperature increase would lead to an scs delay whereas pa played a more important role in scs changes in the eastern tp mainly in a negative fashion 4 8 pixels with significant negative sensitivity fig 6b c indicating that the precipitation increase would lead to scs advance the results of the sdmax sensitivity analysis showed that sdmax was negatively sensitive to ta indicating that the increase of ta would lead to the decrease of sdmax and the pixels with significant negative sensitivity accounted for 55 2 of the whole study area fig 6d sdmax was positively sensitive to pa indicating that the increase of pa will increase the snow depth the significant positive correlation pixels accounted for 43 7 of the whole region whereas the significant negative correlation pixels only accounted for 2 9 mainly distributed in the kunlun mountain plateau fig 6e by comparing the sensitivity coefficients of sdmax to ta and pa we obtained the spatial distribution diagram of the relative importance of ta and pa fig 6f in which the relatively important pixels of pa accounted for 40 3 of the whole research area mainly distributed in the eastern tp the relatively important pixels of ta accounted for 59 6 of the whole study area mainly distributed in the western tp the results of scm sensitivity analysis showed that scm was mainly negatively sensitive to tm 40 7 pixels with significantly negative correlation fig 6g that is temperature rise would lead to scm advance scm was positively sensitive to sdmax 63 0 pixels with significant correlation fig 6h indicating that the snow depth increase would lead to an scm delay the pixels of scm mainly affected by tm accounted for 42 2 of the whole research area and those affected by sdmax accounted for 57 8 compared with sdmax the areas where tm was relatively important to scm were mainly distributed in the western western sichuan eastern tibet montane coniferous forest zone hiiab1 the middle of golog nagqu high cold shrub meadow zone hib1 and the north of kunlun high cold desert zone hid1 whereas in most other areas sdmax was relatively important to scm fig 6i 4 5 contributions of scs and scm to scd the contributions of scs and scm to scd were estimated by their standardized values from 1980 to 2020 fig 7 a and b showed the spatial distribution of sensitivity coefficients of scs and scm by comparing the standard partial regression coefficients of scs and scm of each pixel it was found that the pixels with high scm coefficients accounted for 99 6 at the significant level of 0 05 this means that scd changes on the tp are primarily scm driven it can be seen from the correlation diagram fig 7c d of scd scs and scm across the whole tp that scd and scm had a significant positive correlation p 0 001 for one day that scm was delayed scd was prolonged by 1 4 days scd was negatively correlated with scs but not significantly p 0 1 4 6 vertical difference of snow phenology response to climate change to quantitatively describe the relationship between snow phenology and altitude on the tp the 41 year mean and trends of scs scd and scm during1980 2020 were calculated fig 8 as a function of altitude scs becomes early scm late and scd long as the elevation increases the mean gradients of scd scs and scm with elevation are 3 6 1 1 and 1 8 d 100 m respectively fig 8a fig 8b analyzed the changing trend of scd scm and scs in elevation bins every 500 m on average the elevation bins with pixel numbers 200 were selected for analysis that is 3000 5500 m while the number of pixels in other elevation bins was relatively small and the representation is weak trend analysis showed that scd increased between 3000 m and 4500 m and decreased between 4500 and 5500 m fig 8b the changing trend of scm was similar to that of scd at all altitude gradients whereas that of scs was opposite to that of scd by comparing the absolute value of the trend of scs and scm at each altitude fig 8b it was found that the trend of scm was higher than that of scs the above analysis further confirmed that the change of scm dominated the change of scd on the tp we analyzed the sensitivity of snow phenology to climate change with altitude fig 9 it was found that the sensitivity of sdmax to ta and pa was dependent on altitude sdmax showed a negative feedback effect on ta which increased with the altitude but decreased with the increase of altitude above 5000 m sdmax presented a positive feedback effect on pa which increased with the elevation but decreased with the increase of elevation above 4000 m by comparing the absolute values of the sensitivity coefficient of each elevation gradient it was found that sdmax was more sensitive to ta than pa in the region above 2000 m that is relative to precipitation temperature dominates the change of snow depth at each elevation gradient the sensitivity of scm to sdmax and tm also showed significant elevation dependence scm has a negative feedback effect on tm which decreases with elevation scm had a positive feedback effect on sdmax which increased first and then decreased with elevation comparing the absolute value of sensitivity coefficient scm was more sensitive to sdmax than tm at each elevation gradient which means that snow depth dominated the change of snowmelt period at each elevation gradient the sensitivity of scs to ta and pa was significantly different at different altitude gradients in general temperature dominated scs changes at higher altitudes whereas precipitation dominated scs changes at lower altitudes 4 7 responses of snow depth and snow cover duration days to elevation dependent warming to illustrate the change of snow cover response to climate change with altitude we selected the elevation bins with pixel numbers 200 i e 3000 5500 m and calculated the changing trend of ta pa sdmax and scd over time at five elevation classes 12 time periods generated using a 30 year sliding window fig 10 as can be seen from the fig 10 scd showed an increasing trend below 4500 m and a decreasing trend above 4500 m which is like the trend of pa as can be seen from the linear equation of pa pa is the highest between 3500 m and 4000 m and decreased dramatically above 4500 m while the warming rate of ta does not change much below 4500 m 0 14 0 17 decade 1 but increases significantly above 4500 m 0 26 decade 1 we speculate that the combined effect of ta warming and pa reduction makes scd change at 4500 m ta showed a statistically significant increasing trend on all elevations over time and the higher the elevation was the more severe the warming trend sdmax showed a statistically significant decreasing trend opposite to ta at all elevations in addition the rate of snow depth decrease was faster in the high altitude region which seems to be related to the higher warming rate in the high altitude region to further explain the relationship between the warming trend and the snow depth trend as well as the warming trend and the snow duration trend we calculated the altitudinal profile differences between sdmax scd and ta trends from 1980 to 2020 fig 11 we found that there was a significant elevation dependent warming and elevation dependent reduction of snow depth on the tp specifically for every 500 m increase in average altitude the warming trend of ta increased by 0 02 decade 1 and the decreasing trend of sdmax increased by 0 06 cm decade 1 the elevation dependent warming of air temperature explained the elevation dependent reduction of snow depth r 0 72 p 0 05 however the elevation dependent shrinking phenomenon of scd was only significant in the elevation gradient of 2000 5500 m and the shortening trend of scd increased by 2 05 d decade 1 with each 500 m increase in average elevation in this elevation gradient edw phenomenon of air temperature also explains the elevation dependent shrinking phenomenon of scd r 0 83 p 0 05 considering that the number of pixels in some elevation bins is less and the representation is weak we choose elevation bins with 200 pixels to conduct the analysis again it was found that the elevation dependent warming and the elevation dependent reduction of snow depth were more significant in the range of 3000 to 5500 m for every 500 m increase in average altitude the warming trend of ta increased by 0 04 decade 1 and the decreasing trend of sdmax increased by 1 35 cm decade 1 the correlation between elevation dependent warming and elevation dependent reduction of snow depth was as high as 0 99 p 0 001 and the correlation between elevation dependent warming and elevation dependent reduction of scd was as high as 0 93 p 0 02 in addition we further analyzed the changing trend of ta sdmax and scd in 10 major ecoclimatic zones on the tp in the past 40 years as can be seen from fig 12 ta showed a significant warming trend in all regions except hiic1 fig 12b sdmax showed a significant decreasing trend mainly in hiiab1 hiic2 hic2 and hid1 scd showed a significant increasing trend in hiiab1 hiid2 and hib1 and a significant decreasing trend in hic2 and hid1 combined with fig 1a and fig 12a the elevation of the tp gradually increased from northeast to southwest forming a certain elevation gradient naturally we carried out linear fitting on the trends of ta sdmax and scd with natural altitudinal gradients and again found that with the increase in altitude the warming trend of ta was significantly aggravated and the decreasing trend of sdmax and scd was significantly aggravated in the two highest elevations hic2 hid1 the warming and the reduction of sdmax and scd are very significant according to the changing trend of different ecoclimatic zones with altitude fig 13 there was significant edw in hiiab1 hib1 and hid1 while there was no significant edw in other regions the response of snow cover to edw varies in different ecoclimatic regions as can be seen from table 1 the edw of hiiab1 hib1 hic1 hiic2 and hid1 has a significant negative correlation with the elevation dependent decrease of sdmax and the correlation coefficient ranges from 0 79 to 0 99 these results indicate that the elevation dependent warming of these regions contributes greatly to the reduction of the elevation dependence of snow depth 5 discussion and conclusions snow cover is one of the most sensitive climate factors to global warming in this study the spatiotemporal variations of snow cover including sdmax scs scm and scd over the tibetan plateau tp during 1980 2020 and its response to climate change were analyzed using a daily passive microwave snow depth dataset and the causes of snow cover change were discussed in the past 40 years the snow cover on the tp has changed significantly with a significant decrease in sdmax and scd a significant delay in scs and a non significant advance in scm fig 4 this is consistent with the trend found in previous studies based on meteorological stations and satellite data peng et al 2010 huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 bibi et al 2018 guo et al 2021 the shortening of scd is controlled by the delay of scs and the advance of scm xu et al 2017 we agree with this view and further clarify the relationship between scd changes and scs scm changes we found that scd had a significant positive correlation with scm but not with scs fig 7c d by comparing the absolute value of the sensitivity coefficient of scd to scs and scm fig 7a b and the trends of snow phenology on each elevation gradient fig 8b we further confirmed that scd changes on the tp during 1980 2020 were dominated by scm chen et al 2018 believed that the shortened scd was dominated by scs which may be caused by different study periods our results are similar to those of previous studies in the tianshan mountains in central asia yang et al 2019b and the northern hemisphere peng et al 2013 chen et al 2015b klein et al 2016 chen et al 2021 it can be seen that the dominant factors of seasonal snow cover change may be different for different study periods and areas the changes in temperature and precipitation play a key role in the dynamics of snow phenology over the tp you et al 2020b our study analyzed their relative importance in terms of horizontal space and vertical elevation gradient from the perspective of horizontal space scs and sdmax were more sensitive to ta than pa in the western tp fig 6c f which might be due to the more intense warming in the snow season in the western tp fig 5a due to the positive sensitivity of scs to ta fig 6a and the negative sensitivity of sdmax to ta fig 6d scs in the western tp were significantly delayed fig 3a and sdmax was significantly reduced fig 3d while in the eastern part of the tp scs and sdmax were more sensitive to pa which may be due to the large increase of precipitation during the snow season in the eastern tp fig 5c due to the negative sensitivity of scs to pa fig 6b and the positive sensitivity of sdmax to pa fig 6e scs in the eastern tp significantly advanced fig 3a and sdmax significantly increased fig 3d from the vertical gradient fig 9 sdmax was more sensitive to ta at each elevation gradient whereas scm was more sensitive to sdmax scs was more sensitive to ta at high altitudes which may be related to the higher warming rate at high altitudes scs is more sensitive to pa at low altitudes which may be attributed to abundant precipitation fig 10 in addition we also found that the elevation response of snow phenology to climate sensitivity was not a simple linear relationship for example the sdmax negative feedback to ta first increased with elevation but decreased with elevation above 5000 m this may be because perennial snow cover is mainly distributed in areas above 5000 m where almost constant snow cover and glacier cover effectively limit the rate of warming li et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 trends in snow duration are also expected to feed back into temperature trends peng et al 2013 when snow cover and glaciers decrease the warming rate is amplified zhang et al 2022 thus with the depletion of snow cover and glaciers the tp may experience more significant warming in the future further exacerbating other environmental changes liu et al 2009 bibi et al 2018 you et al 2020b our study found that the spatiotemporal variations of snow phenology were strongly dependent on altitude and scd extended 3 6 days scs advanced 1 1 days and scm delayed 1 8 days for every 100 m elevation increase the tp showed significant elevation dependent warming 0 04 decade 1 km 1 and elevation dependent shrinking of snow depth 0 12 cm decade 1 km 1 fig 11 elevation dependent warming of air temperature explained the elevation dependent shrinking of snow depth r 0 72 p 0 05 and this correlation is higher in 3000 5500 m r 0 99 p 0 001 which is similar to guo et al s 2021 conclusion based on meteorological stations in addition we also found an elevation dependent shrinkage of scd 4 1 d decade 1 km 1 fig 11 within the elevation gradient of 2000 5500 m which could also be explained by elevation dependent warming r 0 83 p 0 05 and this correlation is also higher in 3000 5500 m r 0 93 p 0 02 we found that the warming rate began to reverse above 6000 m the decreasing trend of sdmax reversed at 5500 m and the changing trend of scd also reversed fig 11 we believed that snow depth and snow duration together reversed the elevation warming mode above 6000 m and below this is similar to the edw reversal observed by previous investigations li et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 but it was found that the change point was at 5000 m and the snow duration caused the reversal the difference in results is probably due to differences in the data and resolution used we have also found this reversal and believed that the presence of snow reverses the elevation warming pattern of the tp because snow is more extensive and persistent above the change point the buffering effect of snow prevents the increase of warming with altitude whereas snow depletion leads to the existence of edw below the change point elevation dependent reductions in snow depth and snow duration are expected to further exacerbate the edw of the tp and the edw of tp may be strengthened in a warmer future which may increase the threat to life sustaining solid reservoirs in high altitude mountainous areas guo et al 2021 a passive microwave snow depth dataset provides effective daily snow depth data with long time series for monitoring snow cover changes over the tp from 1980 to 2020 however the rough spatial resolution 25 km of passive microwave remote sensing may lead to the limitation of the retrieved snow depth for example low ground temperature causes the snow depth in the northwest and southeast tp to be overestimated and the snow depth in the shallow snow area and cold desert in the midwest tp to be underestimated dai et al 2017 most of the tp has shallow snow so we calculated the snow phenology on the tp over the last 40 years based on sd 0 cm but the passive microwave sensor was limited by penetration depth which may lead to 0 sd 5 cm has an error we compared the scd calculated based on sd 0 1 2 3 4 5 cm and found that the scd calculated based on different snow depths all showed a decreasing trend from 1980 to 2020 and the scd calculated based on sd 3 cm showed the most significant change from 1980 to 2020 with the largest reduction range and the largest inter annual fluctuation table2 the scd calculated based on sd 0 cm showed the smallest inter annual fluctuation but the decreasing trend was not significant however after removing the 2020 data decreased significantly at the p 0 1 level it can be seen from fig 14 that the scd calculated based on different snow depths are all exceptionally high in 2020 which is due to the higher scd in the karakoram kunlun altun and gangdise mountains in 2020 resulting in a higher scd in the whole region therefore we considered 2020 as an abnormal year and the data of 2020 were not included in the calculation of the scd and scm equations in fig 4 fig 5e showed that the precipitation pa in the snow accumulation season in 2020 is more than that in previous years while mean temperature ta in the snow accumulation season is lower than that in previous years it is speculated that the delay of scm in 2020 may be due to the joint effect of the increase of pa and the decrease of ta while the scm delay resulted in prolonged scd in 2020 in this study we mainly considered the effects of temperature precipitation and altitude on snow depth and snow phenology distribution in addition wind speed and direction slope and aspect also have certain effects on snow distribution for example we found that the maximum snow depth was not found at the highest elevations such as hid1 because wind direction and speed might be important factors affecting the spatial distribution of snow depth at high elevations where no canopy exit troendle and king 1987 woods et al 2006 jost et al 2007 varhola et al 2010 in addition due to the windward leeward effect the slope aspect can also influence snow phenology by altering local solar radiation and moisture conditions as well as the potential accumulation state tong et al 2009 li et al 2020b however considering that the resolution of passive microwave snow depth data used in our study is relatively rough the spatial resolution is about 25 km these factors are not considered in this study these factors should be considered when using finer resolution data in the future changes in snow cover on the tp are a key component of climate change and are critical to many hydrological and biological processes you et al 2020b slatyer et al 2022 tarca et al 2022 for example the thickness and melting of snow will affect the soil water content ultimately affecting vegetation growth molotch et al 2009 maurer and bowling 2014 xu et al 2020 the snow melt date will affect the start time of the vegetation growing season ultimately affect the length of the vegetation growing season and affect the accumulation period of vegetation npp piao et al 2017 wang et al 2018a in recent years the snow line of the tp keeps rising and the perennial snow area is shrinking and beginning to transit to the seasonal snow area huang et al 2017 which may change the distribution pattern of alpine vegetation on the tp gentili et al 2020 the tp has a typical alpine vegetation ecosystem and rich snow resources changes in snow depth and snow phenology will have an important impact on the growth and distribution of alpine vegetation which is a key area for future
