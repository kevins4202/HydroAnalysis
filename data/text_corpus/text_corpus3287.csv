16435,the extractive membrane bioreactor embr combines an extractive membrane process and bioreactor to treat highly saline recalcitrant organic wastewater in which the organic contaminations diffuse through a semi permeable polydimethysiloxane pdms composite membrane from the feed wastewater to the receiving biomedium during the long term embr operation membrane biofouling is an inevitable phenomenon which is one of the main obstacles impeding its wide applications the excessive biofilm deposited on membrane surface could significantly reduce the organic mass transfer coefficient of composite membranes by more than 40 therefore in this work the silver ag metal organic frameworks mofs were synthesized and immobilized on the pdms surface of nanofibrous composite membranes to mitigate the membrane biofouling the robustness of ag mofs coating on membrane surface was well demonstrated by ultrasonic treatment in addition the silver nanoparticles agnps were coated on the pdms surface of composite membranes for comparison in contrast with the unmodified composite membrane m0 the agnps coated m1 and ag mofs modified m2 composite membranes possessed less hydrophobic and negatively charged surfaces due to the coating layers although the modified membranes exhibited lower phenol mass transfer coefficients k0 s in the aqueous aqueous extractive membrane process due to these additional modification layers both m1 and m2 displayed better long term performance in the 12 days continuous embr operations due to their excellent anti biofouling properties moreover m2 exhibited the most stable embr performance among the composite membranes developed in this work and other reported membranes with a finally stabilized k0 of 33 0 10 7 m s 89 of initial k0 the least amounts of proteins polysaccharides and total suspended solids tss on the surface of tested m2 also demonstrated its outstanding biofouling resistance this excellent anti biofouling performance should be attributed to the stable controlled and long lasting ag release from ag mofs as well as its less hydrophobic and negative charged surface properties which made m2 undergo the k0 s increasing and gradual stabilization stages in the long term embr operations graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords extractive membrane bioreactor metal organic framework biofouling highly saline organic wastewater nanofibrous composite membrane 1 introduction highly saline organic wastewaters are widely produced by various industrial processes such as textile dyeing pharmaceutical leather and petroleum refining industries li et al 2020 in addition to high salinity these wastewaters usually contain various highly toxic recalcitrant organic compounds including phenol and phenolic compounds the direct discharge of these highly saline organic wastewaters could cause serious environmental hazardousness li et al 2018 michal√≠k et al 2018 moussavi et al 2010 ren et al 2018 due to the rapid expansion of industries in recent years the production of high salinity organic wastewaters accounts for 5 of the total wastewater which is still growing at a rate of 2 every year jiang et al 2016 therefore it is of great importance to treat these salty organic wastewaters by an effective and environmentally friendly technology the conventional methods to treat the high salinity organic wastewaters include distillation adsorption and biodegradation busca et al 2008 due to high concentrations of soluble salts and inhibitory conditions it is challenging for microorganisms to directly metabolize the organics in the high salinity organic wastewaters fortunately the extractive membrane bioreactor embr process has been proposed to treat these highly saline and inhibitory wastewaters containing toxic organic components liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b it combines the membrane extractive process with the biodegradation technology ren et al 2020a in this process driven by the organic concentration gradient across the membrane the organic matters in the wastewaters automatically diffuse through a semi permeable extractive membrane into the bioreactor for subsequent biodegradation while other inhibitory compounds includes inorganics and water are retained by the membrane the embr process eliminates the requirements of wastewater pre treatment and operates at room temperature and pressure liao et al 2018b in addition the continuous biodegradation makes the concentration of organic matters in the bioreactor near to zero which effectively maintain the concentration difference across the membrane caicedo et al 2019 wood 2015 however the bottlenecks in embr process impede its large scale applications the first challenge is the low mass transfer coefficient k0 of the commercial extractive membrane the commercial polydimethylsiloxanes pdms rubber tube has been commonly used in embr as the thickness of this silicone rubber tube membrane is greater than 0 2 mm it exhibits the large mass transfer resistance with a k0 around 1 0 10 7 m s in our previous study we have successfully developed highly efficient composite membranes by coating a thin pdms layer on highly porous nanofibrous or hollow fiber substrates huang et al 2020a jin et al 2017 jin et al 2018a liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b loh et al 2016 compared to the commercial silicon rubber the k0 of composite membranes have been increased to be dozens of times higher for instance k0 of the nanofibrous composite membrane developed by electrospraying a thin pdms layer on the nanofibrous substrate has reached around 38 0 10 7 m s in our recent published work huang et al 2020a besides the membrane mass transfer efficiency another critical issue of the embr process is bio fouling on the membrane surface during the long term operation emanuelsson et al 2003 distinctive from the traditional membrane bioreactor mbr processes as the only carbon source for microbial growth and metabolism is the organics diffusing through the membrane microorganisms tend to spontaneously accumulate on the membrane surface to obtain sufficient foods liao et al 2018b the excessive biofilms might adhere to the membrane surface which inevitably increased the membrane mass transfer resistances and reduced the mass transfer coefficients by over 40 60 liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b the effects of membrane surface hydrophilicity and roughness on biofilm formation have been investigated in our pervious works liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b it was found that less biofilms were observed on a smoother pdms surface while the ridges and valleys on the membrane surface could offer a more favourable environment for micro organisms attachment and propagation liao et al 2018b the previous studies also investigated the effects of embr operational conditions on membrane fouling pavasant et al 1996 ren et al 2017 yeo et al 2017 an external installed embr which separated the membrane extraction and biodegradation units has been proposed to avoid the membrane fouling ren et al 2020b however the external installed embr configuration was more complex therefore it is necessary to propose an effective strategy to control membrane fouling in the internal installed embr process nonetheless few studies have been conducted to improve anti biofouling property of the composite membranes by introducing functional anti bacterial materials on the membrane surface it is well known that the silver nanoparticles agnps are effective biocides which are able to kill microorganisms by releasing silver ions so as to achieve the anti microbial effects chen et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 hu et al 2020 ilyas et al 2019 park et al 2021 sackey et al 2021 however as the release rate of silver ions from agnps is too rapid it may lead to the short lifespan of membrane anti fouling abilities additionally since that the inorganic agnps have unsatisfactory compatibility with the organic membrane matrix it could release agnps into water which thus have adverse effects on the membrane long term property huang et al 2020b pejman et al 2020b zirehpour et al 2017 in order to stably release the silver ions and prolong the lifespan of anti fouling effect the agnps have been loaded onto or grafted with various nanomaterials such as silica nanospheres nanozeolite and graphene oxide jun et al 2020 wyszogrodzka et al 2016 in contrast to the inorganic structure of agnps the silver modified metal organic frameworks ag mofs can improve its compatibility with the organic membrane surface moreover it was reported that the ag mofs could slowly release silver ions as fungicides ensuring its long term anti biofouling performance pejman et al 2020a seyedpour et al 2020 furthermore the ag mofs exhibit lower toxicity compared to other nanomaterials huang et al 2020b jun et al 2020 pejman et al 2020a pejman et al 2020b seyedpour et al 2020 seyedpour et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zirehpour et al 2017 therefore the main objectives of this work are i developing excellent anti biofouling and long lasting composite membranes with high mass transfer efficients for embr process ii promoting the attached robustness between the ag mofs and composite membrane surface by improving their interactive force iii optimizing the surface hydrophobicity and charges via ag mofs modification to further enhance the anti biofouling property of the composite membrane iv revealing the anti biofouling mechanisms of ag mofs modified membrane in this regard novel ag mofs particles were synthesized and coated on the pdms surface of the composite membrane which was prepared by electrospraying an ultrathin pdms layer on a nanofibrous substrate in order to compare with ag mofs agnps were reduced onto the membrane surface by chemical modifications the influences of agnps and ag mofs on membrane surface morphologies hydrophobicity and charges were systematically investigated the mass transfer coefficients and biofouling resistance of the control agnps modified and ag mof coated membranes were evaluated in both aqueous aqueous extractive membrane and embr processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of ag mof particles the information of materials and chemicals used in this work is described in the supporting information briefly 0 6 g agno3 was dissolved in 90 ml di water and ultrasonic treated for 15 min meanwhile 1 05 g 2 methylimidazole was dissolved in 90 ml of absolute ethanol which was treated by ultrasonic for 2 min the 2 methylimidazole solution was consequently poured into the agno3 aqueous solution and stirred for 30 min to ensure the complete reaction the mixture was leave to stand for 3 h the supernatant was discarded the remaining suspension was centrifuged for three times and washed with anhydrous ethanol at last the resultant ag mof powders were obtained by drying in a vacuum oven at 60 for 18 h 2 2 preparation and modifications of pdms coated composite membranes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf was dissolved in n n dimethylformamide dmf and acetone at 100 to prepare 8 wt and 3 wt electrospun dope solutions a small amount of lithium chloride licl was added in both solutions to increase their conductivities and improve the electrospun ability the recipes of dope solutions and electrospun operational parameters are summarized in table s1 as shown in fig 1 the 8 wt pvdf dope was electrospun on the non woven fabric to obtain coarse nanofibers while thin nanofibers were developed on the surface of coarse nanofibers by electrospinning the 3 wt pvdf dope to support the pdms layer and minimize its intrusion into substrate huang et al 2020a the substrate was then heat pressed at 155 for 30 min to ensure its integrity and mechanical strength the nanofibrous substrate was pre wetted with a mixed solution of di water and glycerol 1 4 by weight to fill in the substrate pores and reduce the intrusion of pdms in the process of electrospray printing a 30 wt pdms with a monomer and curing agent ratio of 10 1 was electrospray printed on the surface of the pre wetted substrate as reported in our previous work huang et al 2020a after electrospray coating for 40 min the composite membrane was cured for 24 h at 80 to ensure the complete pdms cross linking this pdms coated nanofibrous composite membrane is nominated as m0 in this work the original membrane m0 was then immersed in a dopamine aqueous solution 2 mg ml dopamine hydrochloride 10 mm tris 5 mm cuso4 5h2o and 19 6 mm h2o2 which was vibrated for 1 h to obtain the polydopamine pda activated composite membrane m0 pda after washing the excessive and weakly anchored pda on the membrane surface with di water m0 pda was subsequently placed in a silver nitrate aqueous solution composed of 1 wt agno3 and 0 02 wt ethanol the m0 pda was stick to the bottom of container with membrane sides sealed by tapes to ensure the modification reaction only conduct on membrane surface the ammonia was then dripped into the solution until it became clear after 5 min a 1 wt glucose aqueous solution was added to reduce the silver ions from the silver ammonia solution via a silver mirror reaction the agnps were thus uniformly deposited on the pdms surface of m0 pda the agnps coated membrane was then dried at 100 for 1 hour to obtain the composite membrane m1 in order to achieve the ag mof modified composite membrane the original pdms composite membrane m0 was immersed in a ag mofs dopamine mixed aqueous solution composed of 2 mg ml dopamine hydrochloride 10 mm tris 5 mm cuso4 5h2o 19 6 mm h2o2 0 025 mm mercapto polyethylene glycol with carboxyl group sh peg cooh and 5 wt as prepared ag mofs the membrane was stick to and sealed on the bottom of solution which was then vibrated for 1 h the membrane was token out and dried at 100 for 1 hour which produced the ag mofs modified membrane m2 the characterizations of ag mof as developed control and modified pdms composite membranes are illustrated in the supporting information 2 3 stability of agnps and ag mofs on the composite membrane surface in order to evaluate the stability of agnps and ag mof particles on the surfaces of m1 and m2 at the pdms layer the membrane samples with an area of 2 cm2 were ultrasonic treated in a water bath at 20 hz for 120 min the surface morphologies element distributions and compositions of these membranes after ultrasonic treatment were examined by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem and energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx to demonstrate the robustness of coating particles on the membrane surface 2 4 performance evaluation of as developed composite membranes in the extractive membrane processes using different receiving solutions as shown in fig s1 the phenol mass transfer coefficients k0 s m s of as developed control and modified composite membranes were evaluated in a laboratory scale aqueous aqueous extractive membrane process with an effective membrane area of 22 cm2 the feed solution 1 l was the high salinity organic wastewater consisting of 1 g l phenol and 10 g l nacl the receiving solution was 1 l deionized water the aqueous aqueous membrane extractive membrane process was conducted at room temperature 25 2 c without hydraulic pressure the phenol concentrations of feed and receiving solutions were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv shimadzu both the feed and receiving solutions were circulated through the membrane module at a cross flow rate of 8 3 cm s the mass transfer coefficient k0 m s was calculated by the eq 1 1 k 0 d c r d t v r a c f c r where c f and c r g m3 are the phenol concentrations in the feed and receiving solutions at time t s a m2 is the effective membrane area v r m3 is the volume the salt rejection r of the membranes was calculated by eq 2 2 r 1 c p nacl c f n a c l 100 where c f nacl and c p nacl are the salt concentrations of the feed and receiving solutions the salt flux j s mg m2h of the membrane was calculated by eq 3 3 j s Œ¥ c v r Œ¥ t a where Œ¥c mg l is the change of nacl concentration during time interval Œ¥t h in the receiving solution the long term performance of as developed membranes were evaluated in the extractive membrane bioreactor which used the same setup shown in fig s1 except that the receiving solution was replaced by an activated sludge solution all the values were calculated using the same equations the mass transfer coefficient k0 m s was calculated by the eq 4 4 k 0 d c f d t v f a c f where v f m3 is the feed solution volume the experimental procedures to evaluate the antibacterial activity of all composite membranes and measure the release rate of silver ions from m1 and m2 are elaborated in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ag mof particles fig 2 a illustrates the chemical reaction to prepare the ag mofs particles in this work the x ray diffraction xrd analysis in fig 2b demonstrates that the as developed ag mofs particles had two typical diffraction peaks of ag 111 and ag 200 guo et al 2017 liu et al 2013 pejman et al 2020b zirehpour et al 2017 fig 2c and d show the narrow size distribution of as prepared ag mofs crystals around 3 0 Œºm with a tetrahedral morphology fig 2e presents the edx mapping of silver atoms on the ag mofs particles indicating the successful fabrication of ag mofs 3 2 physio chemical properties of control agnps modified and ag mofs coated composite membranes in order to confirm the successful preparation of modified composite membranes the wide scan and core level spectra on the surfaces of the control pdms coated composite membrane m0 agnps coated composite membrane m1 and ag mofs deposited composite membrane m2 were obtained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps shown in fig 3 as shown in the wide scan spectrum of m0 fig 3a it contains carbon oxygen and silicon peaks which are located at the binding energies of 284 8 c 1 s 532 3 o 1 s and 102 3 ev si 2p respectively gao et al 2015 guo et al 2017 jin et al 2018a the obvious silicon peak could demonstrate the successful pdms coating on the surface of nanofibrous substrate the si 2p core level spectrum of m0 could be resolved into di siloxy ch3 2 si o2 2 and quaternary siloxy si o4 2 groups as shown in fig 3b corresponding to the chemical structures of pdms on the m0 jin et al 2018a as displayed in fig 1 the control pdms coated composite membranes were firstly activated by dopamine the dopamine solution became pink and then deep brown during the formation of polydopamine pda via self polymerization lee et al 2007 a possible reaction pathway of pda self polymerization is shown in fig s2a liao et al 2021 the metal binding property of catechol on the pda layer could induce in situ agnps reduction on the pda activated membrane surface as shown in fig s2b lee et al 2007 in addition the silver ions in the ammoniacal silver solution could be facilely reduced onto the membrane surface via a reduced agent glucose fig s2c liao et al 2013 therefore two additional silver peaks attributed to ag 3d1 2 and ag 3d3 2 can be obviously observed in the wide scan spectrum of m1 as shown in fig 3c guo et al 2017 liu et al 2013 the ag 3d core level spectrum shown in fig 3d could be curved into two peaks at 368 0 ag 3d1 2 and 374 0 ag 3d3 2 ev further demonstrating the agnps deposition on m2 with a zero valent state liao et al 2021 compared to an obvious amount of agnps on the pdms surface of m1 the silver amount on m2 coming from ag mofs was much less as shown in fig 3e and f the weakness of silver peaks should be attributed to the low concentration of ag mofs on the surface of m2 the chemical reaction between ag mofs sh peg cooh and the surface pda layer ensured the stability of the ag mofs particles on the m2 fig s2d the element concentrations on the surfaces of m0 m1 and m2 are summarized in table s2 while silver cannot be detected on m0 the silver amount on the surface of m2 0 17 at was lower than that of m1 1 04 at the surface cross sectional morphologies and element mappings of m0 fig 4 a d m1 fig 4e h and m2 fig 4i l were observed by fesem and edx it can be seen from fig 4a d that m0 had a smooth and homogenous pdms surface composed of silica element it had a pdms surface layer with a thickness around 3 16 0 03 Œºm the agnps could be observed clearly on the m1 surface as shown in fig 4e g the existence and homogenous distribution of silver on the surface of m1 are proved by the edx mapping shown in fig 4g m1 also exhibited a homogenous and defect free pdms selective layer with a thickness of 3 01 0 16 Œºm the ag mofs particles had been successfully attached on the surface of m2 as shown in fig 4i j the ag mofs were well protected and anchored on the pdms surface via the chemical reaction among sh peg cooh pda layer and ag mofs the ag mapping shown in fig 4k confirms that the particles attached on the surface were ag mofs the thickness of pdms layer on m2 surface was around 3 05 0 11 Œºm besides the nanofibrous support layer thickness of all membranes was about 23 67 1 15 Œºm in addition the topologies of as prepared control and modified composite membranes were measured by afm at the tapping mode as shown in fig s3 3d and flat 2d maps are given for each membrane sample with a scan size of 10 Œºm 10 Œºm to obtain sufficient bumps to achieve an accurate test the ra average roughness rrms root mean square roughness and rz maximum height of contour of each composite membrane were obtained as shown in fig 6a the control composite membrane m0 exhibited a smooth surface fig s3a with the lowest ra rrms and rz values which should alleviate the biofilm attachment on the pdms surface due to the deposition of agnps on the pdms surface of m1 the ra rrms and rz values of m1 were increased with a rough topology shown in fig s3b among these three composite membranes the ag mofs deposited membrane showed the highest roughness as these large particles endowed the pdms surface with plentiful ridges the wettability of membrane surface is another critical factor influencing the anti biofouling property of composite membranes fig 5 b illustrates that after the agnps and ag mofs modifications the in air water contact angles were decreased from 118 1 m0 to 106 2 m1 and 96 2 m2 respectively both hydrophilic pda coating layer and agnps on the pdms surface may be the main reasons for the decreasing hydrophobicity of m1 behboudi et al 2018 liao et al 2021 the less hydrophobicity of m2 should be due to functional groups of pda and the ligand material from ag mofs the nitrogen atoms in ag mofs attracted water molecules as hydrogen acceptors and form a hydration layer which could mitigate the deposition of hydrophobic foulants seyedpour et al 2019 besides these coatings have improved the organophilization of as obtained membranes fig 5 c the phenol contact angles of m1 and m2 were reduced from 84 1 m0 to 78 1 m1 and 70 1 m2 respectively it might slightly benefit the phenol removal efficiency of m2 ren et al 2020c in additional the membrane charges could affect the bio fouling behaviours of these membranes due to electrostatic repulsion between micro organisms and membrane surfaces firouzjaei et al 2018 helali et al 2021 thus the zeta potentials on the nascent and modified membrane surfaces in the ph range from 5 to 10 were examined as shown in fig 5 d the modified membranes m1 and m2 exhibited more negative charges than m0 at the embr operational ph condition of 6 9 the zeta potentials of m1 and m2 were between 23 to 30 mv while the m0 displayed a zeta potential around 12 mv the higher negative charges of both m1 and m2 should be related to the deprotonating of carboxyl groups from pda and ag mofs seyedpour et al 2020 seyedpour et al 2019 the negative charges on the modified composite membrane surfaces could result in better anti biofouling properties as the negatively charged bacterial cells are hard to adhere on the membrane surfaces liao et al 2018b therefore although these modified composite membranes have higher surface roughness less hydrophobicity and more negative surface charges might counteract the negative effects from increasing roughness which eventually endow them with better anti biofouling properties seyedpour et al 2020 3 3 robustness of agnps and ag mofs on composite membrane surfaces the stability of the agnps and ag mofs attached on the composite membrane surfaces is of vital importance for their long term performance in embr processes thus the modified composite membranes m1 and m2 were ultrasonic treated for 120 min at 20 khz the surface morphologies and element weight composition of the composite membranes after ultrasonic treatment are shown in fig 6 it was found that a small amount of agnps 0 3 wt was observed on the m1 after ultrasonic treatment while the ag mofs particles could be still firmly anchored on the surface of m2 with a silver composition around 20 2 wt although the shapes and sizes of the cubic ag mofs were altered due to the harsh sonication the bonding between them and membrane surfaces was not affected seyedpour et al 2019 it should be due to the chemical reaction among the ag mofs pda and sh peg cooh the spectra of element weight percentages on the ultrasonic treated composite membranes are shown in fig s4 for more information 3 4 phenol mass transfer coefficients of composite membranes the phenol mass transfer coefficients k0 s and salt rejections of the nascent composite membrane m0 modified composite membranes m1 and m2 were evaluated and shown in fig 7 a m0 exhibited an excellent k0 of 38 7 0 9 10 7 m s which should be attributed to the highly porous substrate and thin pdms selective layer the large porosity of substrates decreases the organic mass transfer resistance meanwhile the thin pdms selective layer prepared by electro spraying enhances the organic mass transfer efficient of phenol due to a less diffusion distance from the feed to the receiving solution huang et al 2020a however after the agnps deposition the k0 of m1 was reduced to 29 2 0 17 10 7 m s which should be due to the additional inorganic agnps layer on the pdms surface in contrast the k0 reduction due to ag mofs modification was much less as demonstrated in fig 7 a m2 could still possess an outstanding k0 of 33 5 0 03 10 7 m s the first reason should be that compared to a great amount of agnps much less ag mof particles were deposited on the pdms surface of m2 which did not impede the phenol diffusion as much as the agnps secondly the porous crystalline mofs are more organic philic as demonstrated in fig 5 c the pdms interact with phenol via the hydrogen bonding between dimethylsiloxane quaternary siloxy groups of pdms and hydroxyl groups of phenol as well as the van der waal force between dimethylsiloxane of pdms and phenyl rings of phenol jin et al 2018b the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen from imidazole rings of ag mof and phenyl rings of phenol and the œÄ œÄ stacking among the imidazole rings of ag mof and phenol rings may promote the phenol transportation jin et al 2018b it could partially counteract the negative effects of the additional coating layer the phenol mass transfer coefficients of m0 m1 and m2 are inserted in fig 7 b to compare with the commercial pdms pdms hollow fiber and flat sheet composite membranes reported in previous literature jin et al 2017 jin et al 2018a jin et al 2018b liao et al 2018b loh et al 2016 ren et al 2018 all these composite membranes displayed sufficient salt rejections above 99 as developed nascent membrane m0 shows a superior extractive efficiency with the highest phenol mass transfer coefficient although the efficiencies of m1 and m2 were reduced after modifications they still possessed k0 s over 30 times higher than the commercial silicon rubber membranes 3 5 anti biofouling performance of composite membranes in long term embr the long term performance of as developed composite membranes m0 m1 and m2 in the embr operation are shown in fig 8 during all the tests periodic samplings from the bioreactors found that the phenol concentrations in the bioreactors were kept as zero which proved that all phenol diffused from the feed side to the bioreactor have been completely digested by the micro organisms the conductivity of bioreactors remained similar as the initial value illustrating the negligible salt flux from feed solutions fig 8 shows the changes of k0 s and normalized k0 s of as developed membranes during the continuous 12 days embr operation helali et al 2020 shamaei et al 2020 according to fig 8 a a rapid k0 decline of m0 can be observed within the first six days which was decreased from 37 0 10 7 m s to 23 0 10 7 m s reducing by 40 it should be due to the rapid accumulation of biofilms on the membrane surface at the pdms surface in the followed six days the k0 of m0 was gradually decreased and stabilized around 21 1 10 7 m s which was 57 of the initial value in contrast with m0 both modified composite membranes m1 and m2 displayed increasing trends of k0 s at the first three days of embr operation as shown in figs 8 b and 8 c it may because that thin active and porous biofilms were accumulated on the pdms surface of these modified membranes at the beginning of embr process these biofilm layers not only conferred negligible organic mass transfer resistance to the membranes but also promptly biodegraded the phenol transported thought the membrane and thus enhanced the effective concentration difference across the membrane liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b nonetheless as the tests proceeded the biofilm accumulated on the surface of m1 became increasing thick and denser which showed negative impacts on membrane performance as shown in fig 8 b the k0 s of m1 were decreased gradually and eventually stabilized around 27 2 10 7 m s which was 86 of the initial value the better anti biofouling property of m1 should be attributed to the agnps coating layer on its surface besides it is worth notice that m2 showed the best biofouling resistance as shown in fig 8 c the k0 s decline of m2 was the least than those of m0 and m1 which still possessed an outstanding k0 of 33 0 10 7 m s 89 of initial k0 it demonstrates the best anti biofouling effect of ag mofs deposition on the membrane surface the underline mechanisms will be detailed elaborated in the next section the reproducibility of these embr operations was proved by repeated experiments shown in fig s5 which show the same trends of all membranes in addition the long term performance of m2 is compared with other composite membranes reported in literature jin et al 2017 liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b loh et al 2016 ren et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 d m2 displayed the most stable performance and best anti biofouling property in the long term embr processes all the other composite membranes exhibited rapid declines of k0 s due to the excessive biofilms attached on the membrane surface membrane autopsies in fig 9 also illustrate that after 12 days of embr tests the least amounts of proteins 0 004 mg cm2 polysaccharides undetectable amount and total suspended solids tss 0 128 mg cm2 were found on the surface of m2 the control composite membrane m0 exhibited 14 times higher proteins and 5 times higher tss amounts than those of m2 moreover fig s6 shows the surface morphologies of tested membranes after removing the suspended unstick biofilms by shaking in di water as shown in figs s6a c the biofilm layer composed of cocci shaped bacteria and extracellular polymeric substance eps could be observed on the m0 surface the biofilm matrix would significantly increase the membrane mass transfer resistance in contrast as shown in fig s6d i the amounts of microorganism colonies and eps on the surfaces of m1 and m2 were less than those on the m0 3 6 anti biofouling mechanisms of composite membranes as shown in fig 10 the accumulation and propagation of biofilms on membrane surfaces during the embr process can be briefly divided into three stages i a thin conditioning film composed of proteins polysaccharides and tss is initially attached on the pdms surface with the assistance of this film a few active microorganisms could accumulate settle and grow on the membrane surface which create an active and loose biofilm layer this active biofilm layer can quickly metabolize organics and effectively maintain the concentration difference of organics across the extractive membrane the extractive efficiencies of the composite membranes such as m1 and m2 could be enhanced in this stage however as the accumulations of excessive biomass on most membranes were too rapid such as m0 the raising of organic mass transfer efficiency cannot be observed ii after the primary colonization the attached bacterial colonies and eps provide a comfortable environment for further bacterial propagation the rapid growth of biofilms developed in this stage can form complex 3d networks resulting in a significant raise of membrane resistance mass transfer coefficients could be decreased by more than 70 liao et al 2018b in this work the reductions of organic mass transfer coefficients at this stage were around 40 of m0 and 30 of m1 iii after the biofilms on the membrane surface became stable and mature the bacterial cells and eps could attach and detach from the membrane surface at the same time in this stable stage the declines of mass transfer coefficients are much slighter than stage ii therefore similar as other reported membranes used in embr process the control composite membrane m0 displayed a rapid decreasing stage ii and stabilization stage iii of k0 s during the long term embr operation figs 8 a and 10 a the stage i was undetectable for m0 which should be due to the rapid biofilm deposition on the membrane surface m1 went through all the three stages as shown in figs 8 b and 10 b although the agnps on the m1 surface released a sufficient amount of silver ions at the first stage agnps were not stable for long term operation which might peel off m1 still experienced the rapid reduction at stage ii which became stable at the stage iii in contrast as shown in figs 8 c and 10 c m2 underwent the distinctive stages i and iii and did not exhibit an obvious stage ii which should be due to the controlled release of silver ions less hydrophobic and negatively charged surface properties the antibacterial features of the pdms composite membranes developed in this work were also examined using e coli and s aureus as shown in fig 11 a the clear inhibition zones could be observed around the silver deposited composite membranes m1 and m2 while no inhibition zone exhibited around m0 the anti bacterial mechanisms of agnps include 1 agnps could directly adhere and penetrate into bacteria cells and finally destroy the live bacteria xie et al 2018 2 ag released by agnps would pass thorough the bacterial cell membranes bond with the mercaptan groups on the cell membranes and eventually inhibit the activity of cellular enzymes wang et al 2021 3 agnps are able to destroy the bacterial enzymes and nucleic acid groups of the cell dna thus impeding the dna replication and cell division making the bacteria unable to metabolize and reproduce normally until death huang et al 2020b 4 ag can activate oxygen in air or water to produce reactive oxygen species hydroxyl and superoxide radicals which can further oxidize and kill bacteria seyedpour et al 2019 in addition to the above anti bacterial mechanisms ag mofs are the repositories of ag silver ions are released more slowly ensuring a long lasting antibacterial activity wyszogrodzka et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the release of silver ions from m2 in 28 days was measure by icp mass spectrometry as shown in fig 11 b the membrane showed a higher silver releasing rate at the first 5 days of monitoring a lower controlled and stable ion release value of 0 01 Œºg cm 2 day 1 was obtained for m2 demonstrating its long term ag releasing ability as a storage chamber in contrast although m1 exhibited a silver releasing rate of 4 7 Œºg cm 2 day 1 at the first day due to a great amount of agnps on the membrane surface it declined rapidly within 10 days as shown in fig s7 in addition to the antibacterial effects of silver ions the nitrogen atoms in the ag mofs can attract water molecules as hydrogen acceptors and form a hydration layer which can reduce the adhesion of pollutants liu et al 2021 wyszogrodzka et al 2016 the pda coating layer and sh peg cooh from the ag mofs modification fig 5 b also promote the formation of hydrogen layer and improved the anti biofouling property of m2 besides the negative charges of ag mofs coated pdms surface fig 5 d could hinder the colonization of negatively charged bacteria on its surface due to electrostatic repulsion zhang et al 2020 4 conclusions this work developed novel agnps and ag mofs modified pdms composite membranes for embr process to treat highly saline organic wastewater the morphologies intrinsic properties and anti biofouling performance in a long term embr process of these membranes were systemically evaluated the surface hydrophobicity on the pdms layers of agnps deposited membrane m1 and ag mofs modified membrane m2 were reduced by the pda pre activated layer as well as the agnps and ag mofs coating layers both m1 and m2 displayed more negative surface charges due to the deprotonation of carboxyl groups from pda and ag mofs the long term embr operations demonstrates that m2 had an excellent anti biofouling property due to the stable controlled and long lasting ag depletion from the ag mofs the best anti biofouling property of m2 should be also attributed by its reduced hydrophobicity and higher negative charges in the future work the dispersion of ag mofs on membrane surface could be further improved by other coating methods such as in situ ag mofs growing on the membrane surface the hydrophobic pdms surface could be modified to be more hydrophilic or even superhydrophilic by coating other novel materials such as nanodiamond particles and star shaped block copolymers islam et al 2021 ismail et al 2021 karami et al 2020 besides various cleaning approaches could be conducted on the membrane surface after the long term embr operation to examine the effects of membrane cleaning on the recovery of organic mass transfer efficiency it is expected that this work can provide a promising method to develop excellent anti biofouling and highly performance

16435,the extractive membrane bioreactor embr combines an extractive membrane process and bioreactor to treat highly saline recalcitrant organic wastewater in which the organic contaminations diffuse through a semi permeable polydimethysiloxane pdms composite membrane from the feed wastewater to the receiving biomedium during the long term embr operation membrane biofouling is an inevitable phenomenon which is one of the main obstacles impeding its wide applications the excessive biofilm deposited on membrane surface could significantly reduce the organic mass transfer coefficient of composite membranes by more than 40 therefore in this work the silver ag metal organic frameworks mofs were synthesized and immobilized on the pdms surface of nanofibrous composite membranes to mitigate the membrane biofouling the robustness of ag mofs coating on membrane surface was well demonstrated by ultrasonic treatment in addition the silver nanoparticles agnps were coated on the pdms surface of composite membranes for comparison in contrast with the unmodified composite membrane m0 the agnps coated m1 and ag mofs modified m2 composite membranes possessed less hydrophobic and negatively charged surfaces due to the coating layers although the modified membranes exhibited lower phenol mass transfer coefficients k0 s in the aqueous aqueous extractive membrane process due to these additional modification layers both m1 and m2 displayed better long term performance in the 12 days continuous embr operations due to their excellent anti biofouling properties moreover m2 exhibited the most stable embr performance among the composite membranes developed in this work and other reported membranes with a finally stabilized k0 of 33 0 10 7 m s 89 of initial k0 the least amounts of proteins polysaccharides and total suspended solids tss on the surface of tested m2 also demonstrated its outstanding biofouling resistance this excellent anti biofouling performance should be attributed to the stable controlled and long lasting ag release from ag mofs as well as its less hydrophobic and negative charged surface properties which made m2 undergo the k0 s increasing and gradual stabilization stages in the long term embr operations graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords extractive membrane bioreactor metal organic framework biofouling highly saline organic wastewater nanofibrous composite membrane 1 introduction highly saline organic wastewaters are widely produced by various industrial processes such as textile dyeing pharmaceutical leather and petroleum refining industries li et al 2020 in addition to high salinity these wastewaters usually contain various highly toxic recalcitrant organic compounds including phenol and phenolic compounds the direct discharge of these highly saline organic wastewaters could cause serious environmental hazardousness li et al 2018 michal√≠k et al 2018 moussavi et al 2010 ren et al 2018 due to the rapid expansion of industries in recent years the production of high salinity organic wastewaters accounts for 5 of the total wastewater which is still growing at a rate of 2 every year jiang et al 2016 therefore it is of great importance to treat these salty organic wastewaters by an effective and environmentally friendly technology the conventional methods to treat the high salinity organic wastewaters include distillation adsorption and biodegradation busca et al 2008 due to high concentrations of soluble salts and inhibitory conditions it is challenging for microorganisms to directly metabolize the organics in the high salinity organic wastewaters fortunately the extractive membrane bioreactor embr process has been proposed to treat these highly saline and inhibitory wastewaters containing toxic organic components liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b it combines the membrane extractive process with the biodegradation technology ren et al 2020a in this process driven by the organic concentration gradient across the membrane the organic matters in the wastewaters automatically diffuse through a semi permeable extractive membrane into the bioreactor for subsequent biodegradation while other inhibitory compounds includes inorganics and water are retained by the membrane the embr process eliminates the requirements of wastewater pre treatment and operates at room temperature and pressure liao et al 2018b in addition the continuous biodegradation makes the concentration of organic matters in the bioreactor near to zero which effectively maintain the concentration difference across the membrane caicedo et al 2019 wood 2015 however the bottlenecks in embr process impede its large scale applications the first challenge is the low mass transfer coefficient k0 of the commercial extractive membrane the commercial polydimethylsiloxanes pdms rubber tube has been commonly used in embr as the thickness of this silicone rubber tube membrane is greater than 0 2 mm it exhibits the large mass transfer resistance with a k0 around 1 0 10 7 m s in our previous study we have successfully developed highly efficient composite membranes by coating a thin pdms layer on highly porous nanofibrous or hollow fiber substrates huang et al 2020a jin et al 2017 jin et al 2018a liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b loh et al 2016 compared to the commercial silicon rubber the k0 of composite membranes have been increased to be dozens of times higher for instance k0 of the nanofibrous composite membrane developed by electrospraying a thin pdms layer on the nanofibrous substrate has reached around 38 0 10 7 m s in our recent published work huang et al 2020a besides the membrane mass transfer efficiency another critical issue of the embr process is bio fouling on the membrane surface during the long term operation emanuelsson et al 2003 distinctive from the traditional membrane bioreactor mbr processes as the only carbon source for microbial growth and metabolism is the organics diffusing through the membrane microorganisms tend to spontaneously accumulate on the membrane surface to obtain sufficient foods liao et al 2018b the excessive biofilms might adhere to the membrane surface which inevitably increased the membrane mass transfer resistances and reduced the mass transfer coefficients by over 40 60 liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b the effects of membrane surface hydrophilicity and roughness on biofilm formation have been investigated in our pervious works liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b it was found that less biofilms were observed on a smoother pdms surface while the ridges and valleys on the membrane surface could offer a more favourable environment for micro organisms attachment and propagation liao et al 2018b the previous studies also investigated the effects of embr operational conditions on membrane fouling pavasant et al 1996 ren et al 2017 yeo et al 2017 an external installed embr which separated the membrane extraction and biodegradation units has been proposed to avoid the membrane fouling ren et al 2020b however the external installed embr configuration was more complex therefore it is necessary to propose an effective strategy to control membrane fouling in the internal installed embr process nonetheless few studies have been conducted to improve anti biofouling property of the composite membranes by introducing functional anti bacterial materials on the membrane surface it is well known that the silver nanoparticles agnps are effective biocides which are able to kill microorganisms by releasing silver ions so as to achieve the anti microbial effects chen et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 hu et al 2020 ilyas et al 2019 park et al 2021 sackey et al 2021 however as the release rate of silver ions from agnps is too rapid it may lead to the short lifespan of membrane anti fouling abilities additionally since that the inorganic agnps have unsatisfactory compatibility with the organic membrane matrix it could release agnps into water which thus have adverse effects on the membrane long term property huang et al 2020b pejman et al 2020b zirehpour et al 2017 in order to stably release the silver ions and prolong the lifespan of anti fouling effect the agnps have been loaded onto or grafted with various nanomaterials such as silica nanospheres nanozeolite and graphene oxide jun et al 2020 wyszogrodzka et al 2016 in contrast to the inorganic structure of agnps the silver modified metal organic frameworks ag mofs can improve its compatibility with the organic membrane surface moreover it was reported that the ag mofs could slowly release silver ions as fungicides ensuring its long term anti biofouling performance pejman et al 2020a seyedpour et al 2020 furthermore the ag mofs exhibit lower toxicity compared to other nanomaterials huang et al 2020b jun et al 2020 pejman et al 2020a pejman et al 2020b seyedpour et al 2020 seyedpour et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zirehpour et al 2017 therefore the main objectives of this work are i developing excellent anti biofouling and long lasting composite membranes with high mass transfer efficients for embr process ii promoting the attached robustness between the ag mofs and composite membrane surface by improving their interactive force iii optimizing the surface hydrophobicity and charges via ag mofs modification to further enhance the anti biofouling property of the composite membrane iv revealing the anti biofouling mechanisms of ag mofs modified membrane in this regard novel ag mofs particles were synthesized and coated on the pdms surface of the composite membrane which was prepared by electrospraying an ultrathin pdms layer on a nanofibrous substrate in order to compare with ag mofs agnps were reduced onto the membrane surface by chemical modifications the influences of agnps and ag mofs on membrane surface morphologies hydrophobicity and charges were systematically investigated the mass transfer coefficients and biofouling resistance of the control agnps modified and ag mof coated membranes were evaluated in both aqueous aqueous extractive membrane and embr processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of ag mof particles the information of materials and chemicals used in this work is described in the supporting information briefly 0 6 g agno3 was dissolved in 90 ml di water and ultrasonic treated for 15 min meanwhile 1 05 g 2 methylimidazole was dissolved in 90 ml of absolute ethanol which was treated by ultrasonic for 2 min the 2 methylimidazole solution was consequently poured into the agno3 aqueous solution and stirred for 30 min to ensure the complete reaction the mixture was leave to stand for 3 h the supernatant was discarded the remaining suspension was centrifuged for three times and washed with anhydrous ethanol at last the resultant ag mof powders were obtained by drying in a vacuum oven at 60 for 18 h 2 2 preparation and modifications of pdms coated composite membranes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf was dissolved in n n dimethylformamide dmf and acetone at 100 to prepare 8 wt and 3 wt electrospun dope solutions a small amount of lithium chloride licl was added in both solutions to increase their conductivities and improve the electrospun ability the recipes of dope solutions and electrospun operational parameters are summarized in table s1 as shown in fig 1 the 8 wt pvdf dope was electrospun on the non woven fabric to obtain coarse nanofibers while thin nanofibers were developed on the surface of coarse nanofibers by electrospinning the 3 wt pvdf dope to support the pdms layer and minimize its intrusion into substrate huang et al 2020a the substrate was then heat pressed at 155 for 30 min to ensure its integrity and mechanical strength the nanofibrous substrate was pre wetted with a mixed solution of di water and glycerol 1 4 by weight to fill in the substrate pores and reduce the intrusion of pdms in the process of electrospray printing a 30 wt pdms with a monomer and curing agent ratio of 10 1 was electrospray printed on the surface of the pre wetted substrate as reported in our previous work huang et al 2020a after electrospray coating for 40 min the composite membrane was cured for 24 h at 80 to ensure the complete pdms cross linking this pdms coated nanofibrous composite membrane is nominated as m0 in this work the original membrane m0 was then immersed in a dopamine aqueous solution 2 mg ml dopamine hydrochloride 10 mm tris 5 mm cuso4 5h2o and 19 6 mm h2o2 which was vibrated for 1 h to obtain the polydopamine pda activated composite membrane m0 pda after washing the excessive and weakly anchored pda on the membrane surface with di water m0 pda was subsequently placed in a silver nitrate aqueous solution composed of 1 wt agno3 and 0 02 wt ethanol the m0 pda was stick to the bottom of container with membrane sides sealed by tapes to ensure the modification reaction only conduct on membrane surface the ammonia was then dripped into the solution until it became clear after 5 min a 1 wt glucose aqueous solution was added to reduce the silver ions from the silver ammonia solution via a silver mirror reaction the agnps were thus uniformly deposited on the pdms surface of m0 pda the agnps coated membrane was then dried at 100 for 1 hour to obtain the composite membrane m1 in order to achieve the ag mof modified composite membrane the original pdms composite membrane m0 was immersed in a ag mofs dopamine mixed aqueous solution composed of 2 mg ml dopamine hydrochloride 10 mm tris 5 mm cuso4 5h2o 19 6 mm h2o2 0 025 mm mercapto polyethylene glycol with carboxyl group sh peg cooh and 5 wt as prepared ag mofs the membrane was stick to and sealed on the bottom of solution which was then vibrated for 1 h the membrane was token out and dried at 100 for 1 hour which produced the ag mofs modified membrane m2 the characterizations of ag mof as developed control and modified pdms composite membranes are illustrated in the supporting information 2 3 stability of agnps and ag mofs on the composite membrane surface in order to evaluate the stability of agnps and ag mof particles on the surfaces of m1 and m2 at the pdms layer the membrane samples with an area of 2 cm2 were ultrasonic treated in a water bath at 20 hz for 120 min the surface morphologies element distributions and compositions of these membranes after ultrasonic treatment were examined by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem and energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx to demonstrate the robustness of coating particles on the membrane surface 2 4 performance evaluation of as developed composite membranes in the extractive membrane processes using different receiving solutions as shown in fig s1 the phenol mass transfer coefficients k0 s m s of as developed control and modified composite membranes were evaluated in a laboratory scale aqueous aqueous extractive membrane process with an effective membrane area of 22 cm2 the feed solution 1 l was the high salinity organic wastewater consisting of 1 g l phenol and 10 g l nacl the receiving solution was 1 l deionized water the aqueous aqueous membrane extractive membrane process was conducted at room temperature 25 2 c without hydraulic pressure the phenol concentrations of feed and receiving solutions were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv shimadzu both the feed and receiving solutions were circulated through the membrane module at a cross flow rate of 8 3 cm s the mass transfer coefficient k0 m s was calculated by the eq 1 1 k 0 d c r d t v r a c f c r where c f and c r g m3 are the phenol concentrations in the feed and receiving solutions at time t s a m2 is the effective membrane area v r m3 is the volume the salt rejection r of the membranes was calculated by eq 2 2 r 1 c p nacl c f n a c l 100 where c f nacl and c p nacl are the salt concentrations of the feed and receiving solutions the salt flux j s mg m2h of the membrane was calculated by eq 3 3 j s Œ¥ c v r Œ¥ t a where Œ¥c mg l is the change of nacl concentration during time interval Œ¥t h in the receiving solution the long term performance of as developed membranes were evaluated in the extractive membrane bioreactor which used the same setup shown in fig s1 except that the receiving solution was replaced by an activated sludge solution all the values were calculated using the same equations the mass transfer coefficient k0 m s was calculated by the eq 4 4 k 0 d c f d t v f a c f where v f m3 is the feed solution volume the experimental procedures to evaluate the antibacterial activity of all composite membranes and measure the release rate of silver ions from m1 and m2 are elaborated in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ag mof particles fig 2 a illustrates the chemical reaction to prepare the ag mofs particles in this work the x ray diffraction xrd analysis in fig 2b demonstrates that the as developed ag mofs particles had two typical diffraction peaks of ag 111 and ag 200 guo et al 2017 liu et al 2013 pejman et al 2020b zirehpour et al 2017 fig 2c and d show the narrow size distribution of as prepared ag mofs crystals around 3 0 Œºm with a tetrahedral morphology fig 2e presents the edx mapping of silver atoms on the ag mofs particles indicating the successful fabrication of ag mofs 3 2 physio chemical properties of control agnps modified and ag mofs coated composite membranes in order to confirm the successful preparation of modified composite membranes the wide scan and core level spectra on the surfaces of the control pdms coated composite membrane m0 agnps coated composite membrane m1 and ag mofs deposited composite membrane m2 were obtained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps shown in fig 3 as shown in the wide scan spectrum of m0 fig 3a it contains carbon oxygen and silicon peaks which are located at the binding energies of 284 8 c 1 s 532 3 o 1 s and 102 3 ev si 2p respectively gao et al 2015 guo et al 2017 jin et al 2018a the obvious silicon peak could demonstrate the successful pdms coating on the surface of nanofibrous substrate the si 2p core level spectrum of m0 could be resolved into di siloxy ch3 2 si o2 2 and quaternary siloxy si o4 2 groups as shown in fig 3b corresponding to the chemical structures of pdms on the m0 jin et al 2018a as displayed in fig 1 the control pdms coated composite membranes were firstly activated by dopamine the dopamine solution became pink and then deep brown during the formation of polydopamine pda via self polymerization lee et al 2007 a possible reaction pathway of pda self polymerization is shown in fig s2a liao et al 2021 the metal binding property of catechol on the pda layer could induce in situ agnps reduction on the pda activated membrane surface as shown in fig s2b lee et al 2007 in addition the silver ions in the ammoniacal silver solution could be facilely reduced onto the membrane surface via a reduced agent glucose fig s2c liao et al 2013 therefore two additional silver peaks attributed to ag 3d1 2 and ag 3d3 2 can be obviously observed in the wide scan spectrum of m1 as shown in fig 3c guo et al 2017 liu et al 2013 the ag 3d core level spectrum shown in fig 3d could be curved into two peaks at 368 0 ag 3d1 2 and 374 0 ag 3d3 2 ev further demonstrating the agnps deposition on m2 with a zero valent state liao et al 2021 compared to an obvious amount of agnps on the pdms surface of m1 the silver amount on m2 coming from ag mofs was much less as shown in fig 3e and f the weakness of silver peaks should be attributed to the low concentration of ag mofs on the surface of m2 the chemical reaction between ag mofs sh peg cooh and the surface pda layer ensured the stability of the ag mofs particles on the m2 fig s2d the element concentrations on the surfaces of m0 m1 and m2 are summarized in table s2 while silver cannot be detected on m0 the silver amount on the surface of m2 0 17 at was lower than that of m1 1 04 at the surface cross sectional morphologies and element mappings of m0 fig 4 a d m1 fig 4e h and m2 fig 4i l were observed by fesem and edx it can be seen from fig 4a d that m0 had a smooth and homogenous pdms surface composed of silica element it had a pdms surface layer with a thickness around 3 16 0 03 Œºm the agnps could be observed clearly on the m1 surface as shown in fig 4e g the existence and homogenous distribution of silver on the surface of m1 are proved by the edx mapping shown in fig 4g m1 also exhibited a homogenous and defect free pdms selective layer with a thickness of 3 01 0 16 Œºm the ag mofs particles had been successfully attached on the surface of m2 as shown in fig 4i j the ag mofs were well protected and anchored on the pdms surface via the chemical reaction among sh peg cooh pda layer and ag mofs the ag mapping shown in fig 4k confirms that the particles attached on the surface were ag mofs the thickness of pdms layer on m2 surface was around 3 05 0 11 Œºm besides the nanofibrous support layer thickness of all membranes was about 23 67 1 15 Œºm in addition the topologies of as prepared control and modified composite membranes were measured by afm at the tapping mode as shown in fig s3 3d and flat 2d maps are given for each membrane sample with a scan size of 10 Œºm 10 Œºm to obtain sufficient bumps to achieve an accurate test the ra average roughness rrms root mean square roughness and rz maximum height of contour of each composite membrane were obtained as shown in fig 6a the control composite membrane m0 exhibited a smooth surface fig s3a with the lowest ra rrms and rz values which should alleviate the biofilm attachment on the pdms surface due to the deposition of agnps on the pdms surface of m1 the ra rrms and rz values of m1 were increased with a rough topology shown in fig s3b among these three composite membranes the ag mofs deposited membrane showed the highest roughness as these large particles endowed the pdms surface with plentiful ridges the wettability of membrane surface is another critical factor influencing the anti biofouling property of composite membranes fig 5 b illustrates that after the agnps and ag mofs modifications the in air water contact angles were decreased from 118 1 m0 to 106 2 m1 and 96 2 m2 respectively both hydrophilic pda coating layer and agnps on the pdms surface may be the main reasons for the decreasing hydrophobicity of m1 behboudi et al 2018 liao et al 2021 the less hydrophobicity of m2 should be due to functional groups of pda and the ligand material from ag mofs the nitrogen atoms in ag mofs attracted water molecules as hydrogen acceptors and form a hydration layer which could mitigate the deposition of hydrophobic foulants seyedpour et al 2019 besides these coatings have improved the organophilization of as obtained membranes fig 5 c the phenol contact angles of m1 and m2 were reduced from 84 1 m0 to 78 1 m1 and 70 1 m2 respectively it might slightly benefit the phenol removal efficiency of m2 ren et al 2020c in additional the membrane charges could affect the bio fouling behaviours of these membranes due to electrostatic repulsion between micro organisms and membrane surfaces firouzjaei et al 2018 helali et al 2021 thus the zeta potentials on the nascent and modified membrane surfaces in the ph range from 5 to 10 were examined as shown in fig 5 d the modified membranes m1 and m2 exhibited more negative charges than m0 at the embr operational ph condition of 6 9 the zeta potentials of m1 and m2 were between 23 to 30 mv while the m0 displayed a zeta potential around 12 mv the higher negative charges of both m1 and m2 should be related to the deprotonating of carboxyl groups from pda and ag mofs seyedpour et al 2020 seyedpour et al 2019 the negative charges on the modified composite membrane surfaces could result in better anti biofouling properties as the negatively charged bacterial cells are hard to adhere on the membrane surfaces liao et al 2018b therefore although these modified composite membranes have higher surface roughness less hydrophobicity and more negative surface charges might counteract the negative effects from increasing roughness which eventually endow them with better anti biofouling properties seyedpour et al 2020 3 3 robustness of agnps and ag mofs on composite membrane surfaces the stability of the agnps and ag mofs attached on the composite membrane surfaces is of vital importance for their long term performance in embr processes thus the modified composite membranes m1 and m2 were ultrasonic treated for 120 min at 20 khz the surface morphologies and element weight composition of the composite membranes after ultrasonic treatment are shown in fig 6 it was found that a small amount of agnps 0 3 wt was observed on the m1 after ultrasonic treatment while the ag mofs particles could be still firmly anchored on the surface of m2 with a silver composition around 20 2 wt although the shapes and sizes of the cubic ag mofs were altered due to the harsh sonication the bonding between them and membrane surfaces was not affected seyedpour et al 2019 it should be due to the chemical reaction among the ag mofs pda and sh peg cooh the spectra of element weight percentages on the ultrasonic treated composite membranes are shown in fig s4 for more information 3 4 phenol mass transfer coefficients of composite membranes the phenol mass transfer coefficients k0 s and salt rejections of the nascent composite membrane m0 modified composite membranes m1 and m2 were evaluated and shown in fig 7 a m0 exhibited an excellent k0 of 38 7 0 9 10 7 m s which should be attributed to the highly porous substrate and thin pdms selective layer the large porosity of substrates decreases the organic mass transfer resistance meanwhile the thin pdms selective layer prepared by electro spraying enhances the organic mass transfer efficient of phenol due to a less diffusion distance from the feed to the receiving solution huang et al 2020a however after the agnps deposition the k0 of m1 was reduced to 29 2 0 17 10 7 m s which should be due to the additional inorganic agnps layer on the pdms surface in contrast the k0 reduction due to ag mofs modification was much less as demonstrated in fig 7 a m2 could still possess an outstanding k0 of 33 5 0 03 10 7 m s the first reason should be that compared to a great amount of agnps much less ag mof particles were deposited on the pdms surface of m2 which did not impede the phenol diffusion as much as the agnps secondly the porous crystalline mofs are more organic philic as demonstrated in fig 5 c the pdms interact with phenol via the hydrogen bonding between dimethylsiloxane quaternary siloxy groups of pdms and hydroxyl groups of phenol as well as the van der waal force between dimethylsiloxane of pdms and phenyl rings of phenol jin et al 2018b the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen from imidazole rings of ag mof and phenyl rings of phenol and the œÄ œÄ stacking among the imidazole rings of ag mof and phenol rings may promote the phenol transportation jin et al 2018b it could partially counteract the negative effects of the additional coating layer the phenol mass transfer coefficients of m0 m1 and m2 are inserted in fig 7 b to compare with the commercial pdms pdms hollow fiber and flat sheet composite membranes reported in previous literature jin et al 2017 jin et al 2018a jin et al 2018b liao et al 2018b loh et al 2016 ren et al 2018 all these composite membranes displayed sufficient salt rejections above 99 as developed nascent membrane m0 shows a superior extractive efficiency with the highest phenol mass transfer coefficient although the efficiencies of m1 and m2 were reduced after modifications they still possessed k0 s over 30 times higher than the commercial silicon rubber membranes 3 5 anti biofouling performance of composite membranes in long term embr the long term performance of as developed composite membranes m0 m1 and m2 in the embr operation are shown in fig 8 during all the tests periodic samplings from the bioreactors found that the phenol concentrations in the bioreactors were kept as zero which proved that all phenol diffused from the feed side to the bioreactor have been completely digested by the micro organisms the conductivity of bioreactors remained similar as the initial value illustrating the negligible salt flux from feed solutions fig 8 shows the changes of k0 s and normalized k0 s of as developed membranes during the continuous 12 days embr operation helali et al 2020 shamaei et al 2020 according to fig 8 a a rapid k0 decline of m0 can be observed within the first six days which was decreased from 37 0 10 7 m s to 23 0 10 7 m s reducing by 40 it should be due to the rapid accumulation of biofilms on the membrane surface at the pdms surface in the followed six days the k0 of m0 was gradually decreased and stabilized around 21 1 10 7 m s which was 57 of the initial value in contrast with m0 both modified composite membranes m1 and m2 displayed increasing trends of k0 s at the first three days of embr operation as shown in figs 8 b and 8 c it may because that thin active and porous biofilms were accumulated on the pdms surface of these modified membranes at the beginning of embr process these biofilm layers not only conferred negligible organic mass transfer resistance to the membranes but also promptly biodegraded the phenol transported thought the membrane and thus enhanced the effective concentration difference across the membrane liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b nonetheless as the tests proceeded the biofilm accumulated on the surface of m1 became increasing thick and denser which showed negative impacts on membrane performance as shown in fig 8 b the k0 s of m1 were decreased gradually and eventually stabilized around 27 2 10 7 m s which was 86 of the initial value the better anti biofouling property of m1 should be attributed to the agnps coating layer on its surface besides it is worth notice that m2 showed the best biofouling resistance as shown in fig 8 c the k0 s decline of m2 was the least than those of m0 and m1 which still possessed an outstanding k0 of 33 0 10 7 m s 89 of initial k0 it demonstrates the best anti biofouling effect of ag mofs deposition on the membrane surface the underline mechanisms will be detailed elaborated in the next section the reproducibility of these embr operations was proved by repeated experiments shown in fig s5 which show the same trends of all membranes in addition the long term performance of m2 is compared with other composite membranes reported in literature jin et al 2017 liao et al 2018a liao et al 2018b loh et al 2016 ren et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 d m2 displayed the most stable performance and best anti biofouling property in the long term embr processes all the other composite membranes exhibited rapid declines of k0 s due to the excessive biofilms attached on the membrane surface membrane autopsies in fig 9 also illustrate that after 12 days of embr tests the least amounts of proteins 0 004 mg cm2 polysaccharides undetectable amount and total suspended solids tss 0 128 mg cm2 were found on the surface of m2 the control composite membrane m0 exhibited 14 times higher proteins and 5 times higher tss amounts than those of m2 moreover fig s6 shows the surface morphologies of tested membranes after removing the suspended unstick biofilms by shaking in di water as shown in figs s6a c the biofilm layer composed of cocci shaped bacteria and extracellular polymeric substance eps could be observed on the m0 surface the biofilm matrix would significantly increase the membrane mass transfer resistance in contrast as shown in fig s6d i the amounts of microorganism colonies and eps on the surfaces of m1 and m2 were less than those on the m0 3 6 anti biofouling mechanisms of composite membranes as shown in fig 10 the accumulation and propagation of biofilms on membrane surfaces during the embr process can be briefly divided into three stages i a thin conditioning film composed of proteins polysaccharides and tss is initially attached on the pdms surface with the assistance of this film a few active microorganisms could accumulate settle and grow on the membrane surface which create an active and loose biofilm layer this active biofilm layer can quickly metabolize organics and effectively maintain the concentration difference of organics across the extractive membrane the extractive efficiencies of the composite membranes such as m1 and m2 could be enhanced in this stage however as the accumulations of excessive biomass on most membranes were too rapid such as m0 the raising of organic mass transfer efficiency cannot be observed ii after the primary colonization the attached bacterial colonies and eps provide a comfortable environment for further bacterial propagation the rapid growth of biofilms developed in this stage can form complex 3d networks resulting in a significant raise of membrane resistance mass transfer coefficients could be decreased by more than 70 liao et al 2018b in this work the reductions of organic mass transfer coefficients at this stage were around 40 of m0 and 30 of m1 iii after the biofilms on the membrane surface became stable and mature the bacterial cells and eps could attach and detach from the membrane surface at the same time in this stable stage the declines of mass transfer coefficients are much slighter than stage ii therefore similar as other reported membranes used in embr process the control composite membrane m0 displayed a rapid decreasing stage ii and stabilization stage iii of k0 s during the long term embr operation figs 8 a and 10 a the stage i was undetectable for m0 which should be due to the rapid biofilm deposition on the membrane surface m1 went through all the three stages as shown in figs 8 b and 10 b although the agnps on the m1 surface released a sufficient amount of silver ions at the first stage agnps were not stable for long term operation which might peel off m1 still experienced the rapid reduction at stage ii which became stable at the stage iii in contrast as shown in figs 8 c and 10 c m2 underwent the distinctive stages i and iii and did not exhibit an obvious stage ii which should be due to the controlled release of silver ions less hydrophobic and negatively charged surface properties the antibacterial features of the pdms composite membranes developed in this work were also examined using e coli and s aureus as shown in fig 11 a the clear inhibition zones could be observed around the silver deposited composite membranes m1 and m2 while no inhibition zone exhibited around m0 the anti bacterial mechanisms of agnps include 1 agnps could directly adhere and penetrate into bacteria cells and finally destroy the live bacteria xie et al 2018 2 ag released by agnps would pass thorough the bacterial cell membranes bond with the mercaptan groups on the cell membranes and eventually inhibit the activity of cellular enzymes wang et al 2021 3 agnps are able to destroy the bacterial enzymes and nucleic acid groups of the cell dna thus impeding the dna replication and cell division making the bacteria unable to metabolize and reproduce normally until death huang et al 2020b 4 ag can activate oxygen in air or water to produce reactive oxygen species hydroxyl and superoxide radicals which can further oxidize and kill bacteria seyedpour et al 2019 in addition to the above anti bacterial mechanisms ag mofs are the repositories of ag silver ions are released more slowly ensuring a long lasting antibacterial activity wyszogrodzka et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the release of silver ions from m2 in 28 days was measure by icp mass spectrometry as shown in fig 11 b the membrane showed a higher silver releasing rate at the first 5 days of monitoring a lower controlled and stable ion release value of 0 01 Œºg cm 2 day 1 was obtained for m2 demonstrating its long term ag releasing ability as a storage chamber in contrast although m1 exhibited a silver releasing rate of 4 7 Œºg cm 2 day 1 at the first day due to a great amount of agnps on the membrane surface it declined rapidly within 10 days as shown in fig s7 in addition to the antibacterial effects of silver ions the nitrogen atoms in the ag mofs can attract water molecules as hydrogen acceptors and form a hydration layer which can reduce the adhesion of pollutants liu et al 2021 wyszogrodzka et al 2016 the pda coating layer and sh peg cooh from the ag mofs modification fig 5 b also promote the formation of hydrogen layer and improved the anti biofouling property of m2 besides the negative charges of ag mofs coated pdms surface fig 5 d could hinder the colonization of negatively charged bacteria on its surface due to electrostatic repulsion zhang et al 2020 4 conclusions this work developed novel agnps and ag mofs modified pdms composite membranes for embr process to treat highly saline organic wastewater the morphologies intrinsic properties and anti biofouling performance in a long term embr process of these membranes were systemically evaluated the surface hydrophobicity on the pdms layers of agnps deposited membrane m1 and ag mofs modified membrane m2 were reduced by the pda pre activated layer as well as the agnps and ag mofs coating layers both m1 and m2 displayed more negative surface charges due to the deprotonation of carboxyl groups from pda and ag mofs the long term embr operations demonstrates that m2 had an excellent anti biofouling property due to the stable controlled and long lasting ag depletion from the ag mofs the best anti biofouling property of m2 should be also attributed by its reduced hydrophobicity and higher negative charges in the future work the dispersion of ag mofs on membrane surface could be further improved by other coating methods such as in situ ag mofs growing on the membrane surface the hydrophobic pdms surface could be modified to be more hydrophilic or even superhydrophilic by coating other novel materials such as nanodiamond particles and star shaped block copolymers islam et al 2021 ismail et al 2021 karami et al 2020 besides various cleaning approaches could be conducted on the membrane surface after the long term embr operation to examine the effects of membrane cleaning on the recovery of organic mass transfer efficiency it is expected that this work can provide a promising method to develop excellent anti biofouling and highly performance

16436,granules recovered from a highly reduced anaerobic digester were capable of active nitrogen removal in the absence of exogenous electron donors averaging 0 25 mg mgno3 n gvss d over 546 days of operation electron mass balance indicated that about half the influent nitrate was converted to ammonia via dnra and another half denitrified this capacity was associated with an onion like structure of multiple layers enriched in reduced iron and sulfur and a complex microbial community shown by metagenomic sequencing to consist of multiple physiological groups and associated activities including methanogenesis denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra iron oxidation and reduction and sulfur reduction and oxidation nitrate reduction was supported by both entrained organic material and reduced iron and sulfur species corresponding to 2 13 mg cod gvss d batch incubations showed that approximately 15 of denitrified nitrate was coupled to the oxidation of sulfur derived from both sulfate respiration and granular material enriched in iron sulfide inhibition of sulfate reduction resulted in redirection of electron flow to methanogenesis and in combination with other batch tests showed that these granules supported a complex microbial community in which cryptic redox cycles linked carbon sulfur and iron oxidation with nitrate sulfate iron and carbon dioxide reduction this system shows promise for treatment of nitrate contaminated ground water without addition of an external organic carbon source as well as wastewater treatment in combination with granular sludge elimination leading in a net reduction of solid treatment costs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iron cycle sulfur cycle nitrate removal electron balance metagenomics granule 1 introduction one of the earliest pieces of eu legislation aimed at water quality the european nitrates directive has been in force since 1991 despite this directive increasing nitrate concentrations in water bodies remain a significant challenge for which new methodologies to mitigate severe nitrate pollution are being developed carrey et al 2021 ultimately nitrate pollution enters the groundwater where energy intensive processes such as ion exchange chemical denitrification reverse osmosis electrodialysis and catalytic denitrification are required to remove nitrate in drinking water treatment plants kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 biological denitrification is an attractive alternative for the chemical treatment of drinking water dahab and lee 1988 in addition biological treatments based on autotrophic denitrification or hydrogenotrophic denitrification are demonstrated to be more effective than physicochemical methods rezvani et al 2019 one biological treatment technology the sani process sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated wang et al 2009 is a practical implementation of the sulfur cycle for municipal wastewater treatment a major advantage of the sani process is reduction of sludge production by 60 compared to conventional activated sludge treatment wu et al 2016 although sani is implemented on wastewater the industrial application of sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is also promising for groundwater treatment however sani technology requires a carbon rich environment for sulfate reduction and is less applicable to treating ground water with low carbon content in contrast an autotrophic treatment process such as that combining sulfide driven partial denitrification with anammox spda deng et al 2021 might be an interesting application for the treatment of low carbon sources of drinking water autotrophic iron dependent denitrification aidd is an alternative to sulfur based autotrophic denitrification and has demonstrated nitrogen removal rates in the range of 0 3 kgn m3 d 0 7 kgn m3 d tian et al 2020 wang et al 2020 one bottleneck of aidd is that it requires high amounts of reduced iron as an electron donor for denitrification one electron is donated per iron mole compared to the five electrons required accepted for nitrate reduction to dinitrogen gas although the use of more highly reduced fe0 in zero valent iron zvi technology may be a cost efficient option for the iron dependent nitrate reduction huang et al 1998 nitrate was reported to have a deteriorating impact on performance sun et al 2016 other studies have examined a form of zvi technology that incorporates the iron cycle in anaerobic treatment zhang et al 2020 reducing chemical oxygen demand cod and improving methane production for energy recovery liu et al 2015 although the zvi technology is a promising low cost bioprocess abiotic reaction of iron with nitrate may produce unwanted ammonia instead of nitrogen gas zhu and getting 2012 a combination of reduced sulfur and iron compounds likely enhances the efficiency of nitrate removal by introducing more reducing equivalents fan et al 2017 however together reduced iron and sulfur compounds can form different insoluble iron sulfides rickard and luther 2007 making them less bioavailable berner 1984 has extensively reviewed the reaction products derived from reduced iron and sulfur compounds which include iron sulfide mackinawite greigite ferric magnetic iron sulfide and pyrite zhou et al 2015 pyritization is a process where dissolved iron moon et al is attacked by nucleophilic polysulfide to form pyrite another mechanism of formation is the reaction of ferrous sulfide with h2s which is known as the w√§chtersh√§user reaction rickard and luther 2007 since molecular hydrogen is also formed in this reaction pyrite formation from fes and h2s through microbial redox activities provides energy for lithotrophic growth that is syntrophically coupled to methanogenesis thiel et al 2019 microorganisms promote the formation of these and other products by respiratory reduction of sulfate and iron as observed in the production of biogenic nano particulate iron sulfide through sulfate and fe iii downing and hopwood oxide reductions enhanced by pyruvate as an electron donor zhou et al 2015 a review on the role of microorganisms in the formation of extracellular iron sulfide minerals concluded that iron sulfide is either produced abiotically after sulfate reduction with dissolved metals or after association of iron with the cells which then reacts with sulfide on these surfaces to form sulfide minerals picard et al 2016 additional reducing potential was attributed to granular pyritic material serving as an electron donor for nitrate reduction as previously reported torrent√≥ et al 2011 pu et al 2014 and discussed in a recent review of the isad iron sulfides with autotrophic denitrification bioprocess hu et al 2020 although pyrite is oxidized more slowly than sulfur tong et al 2018 its potential for autotrophic denitrification in biological treatment systems is gaining increasing attention kiskira et al 2017 this study examined the feasibility of using a pyritic granular sludge that actively reduced nitrate without supplemental carbon for the isad process the capacity of these granules to transform internal organic and inorganic material was 1 quantified using direct bulk activity assays 2 mass and energy balances 3 metagenomic analyses and 4 microscopic characterization the zonation layering of granule structure was shown to be associated with competitive and syntrophic interactions sustained by counter diffusive gradients of carbon out of the granule interior and nitrate into the granule from the bulk solution active methanogenesis and dnra in the absence of an external electron donor was associated with entrained organic material providing reductant for dnra localized primarily to the granule core similar to previous research van den berg et al 2015 this is reminiscent of carbon sequestration in marine sediments where interaction of organic material with iron sulfides is intertwined with the preservation of sedimentary organic carbon canfield and farquhar 2012 our analysis of nitrate removal conferred by the biotic and abiotic processes active in a novel granular system provide additional understanding of reactions sustaining the isad process as should assist in implementing this technology for treatment of nitrate contaminated source water with limited organic carbon 2 materials and methods overview of the research granules from an anaerobic digester operated in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb mode were used as a seed sludge for this work the granules had an onion like structure of multiple layers and were enriched in reduced iron and sulfur these granules were then placed from this highly reduced environment into a nitrate rich and organic carbon limited pilot scale reactor system the pilot reactor was operated for 546 days and the average nitrate removal biomass degradation iron accumulation in the granules and development of microbial composition were monitored over time in addition a second 3 5 l lab scale reactor was operated with granules originating from day 546 of operation of first reactor for 270 days under strict anaerobic conditions and these granules were analyzed with sem edx analysis for pyrite and iron sulfide formation furthermore in the second reactor the influence of sulfate concentration and water temperature on the nitrate removal was analyzed as well as the microbial ecology with metagenomics at the end of the experiments was detailed the biomass for the second reactor system was used to conduct batch experiments to define the counter diffusive electron flow from the electron rich core of the granule to the electron deplete outer layer of the granule as well as the diffusion of electron acceptor from the bulk liquid into the granule interior 2 1 full scale anaerobic digester source of biomass anaerobic granules from a full scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasbr in heppenheim germany n 49 38 17 09 e 8 36 27 09 were used as seed sludge for the pilot reactor as part of previous industrial treatment the reactor was periodically fed with ferric iron and sulfate that when reduced by microorganisms supported the formation of iron sulfide surface layers as the granules grew in diameter while in the uasbr these granules received organic carbon compounds as substrate no external organic carbon was supplied in this study but carbon was only internally generated by hydrolysis of particulate internal organic matter these granules were used to investigate microbially mediated redox processes after the granule microbial consortia were transitioned into a reactor with limited organic carbon influent and the addition of electron acceptors in the form of nitrate and sulfate 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 pilot scale reactor a 40 l rotating lab scale reactor was operated with 10 8 l of biomass for 546 days under anoxic conditions without addition of an organic carbon source inflow nitrate concentrations varied between 1 5 and 3 5 mm with an inflow of 1 3 l h nitrate was measured on daily basis in duplicate by using hach cuvette tests in addition iron content of the granules was measured with x ray fluorescence analysis to better understand pyrite and iron sulfide flux in the system iron content in the granule plays a major role in the buildup of pyrite and iron sulfide so the granules were measured to assess whether they lose or accumulate iron in the granule structure over time 2 2 2 lab scale reactor in addition a 3 5 l lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with 300 ml of biomass was operated for 270 days the biomass originated from the pilot scale reactor withdrawn at day 546 of operation and therefore the seed sludge for the lab scale reactor was already accustomed to nitrate the reactor had a direct connection to deionized water and two stock solutions that were diluted and mixed in the reactor stock solution a contained nitrate and sulfate nh4 2so4 34 g kno3 26 g nahco3 50 g and kh2po4 2 8 g in 10 l whereas stock solution b was mainly a base medium with trace element solution kcl 3 5 g mgso4 7h2o 8 8 g 100 ml trace element solution 1 and 100 ml trace element solution 2 in 10 l the composition of the trace element solution is described below an additional pump was installed to fluidize the biomass at a recycling velocity of 7 4 m h a separate pump was installed to provide the outflow of the reactor after the sbr phase at the beginning of the sbr feed phase the reactor was sparged with nitrogen gas to maintain anaerobic conditions the ph was controlled at ph 7 the sbr phases were programmed with lab view software and regulated through remote control by the hardware of national instruments ni the continuously measured parameters including o2 ph and t were gathered and organized in a data set every five seconds the sbr was jacketed to operate the reactor under different temperatures starting from 8 c up to 37 c the inflow nitrate concentration was varied between 1 5 and 5 mm for a period of 270 days additionally two different operations with sulfate 2 6 mm so4 and 0 2 mm so4 were tested to measure the impact on the denitrification rate the liquid samples were measured in duplicate for ammonia nitrite nitrate sulfate and total iron with a spectrophotometer thermo fisher gallerytm and its relevant kits for ammonia ammonia r1 r2 nitrite ton r1 and r2 nitrate ton r1 r2 and r3l sulfate sulphate r1 and total iron iron r1 r2 respectively 2 2 3 batch test experiments sampled biomass was investigated in batch experiments in 244 ml glass serum bottles butyl rubber stoppers with aluminum crimp seals were used to seal the batch bottles 10 ml of biomass granules were added to a liquid volume comprising 81 ml deionized water and 9 ml base medium the base medium consisted of 1 0 l of di water with nahco310 g kcl 0 5 g

of 10 mm was used for the inhibition of methanogenesis to measure the accumulation of acetate and ammonia by hydrolytic activity for the inhibition of the sulfate reducers sodium molybdate was used with final concentration of 2 mm the h2s measurements were performed according to the spectrophotometric determination of h2s in natural waters cline 1969 the fe2 measurements were performed according to the colorimetric ferrozine based assay for quantification of iron riemer et al 2004 prior to all analysis samples were filtered with a filter that had a pore size of 0 45 ¬µm the gas samples were measured using gas chromatography model 8610c sri instrument torrance ca methane and carbon dioxide were separated using a silica gel column sri instrument and quantified using a flame ionization detector equipped with a methanizer and nitrogen carrier gas nitrogen gas oxygen hydrogen and argon were separated using a molecular sieve column sri instruments torrance ca and quantified using a thermal conductivity detector and reduced gas detector with helium carrier gas nitrous oxide was separated using a 182 9 hayesep d column sri instruments and quantified with an electron capture detector with nitrogen carrier gas as previously described moon et al 2020 henry s law was used as a basis for the calculation of the concentration in mols with standards prepared beforehand and calibrations for each measured gas given the complexity of the community and the reaction network the system could not be fully constrained and as a result only the main processes were delineated therefore the general approach was based on batch incubations with and without inhibitors to measure hydrolysis methanogenesis batch set 1 as well as nitrate batch set 2 sulfate batch set 3 and iron reduction batch set 4 every set was made by two duplicates and one blank sample without biomass for the possible abiotic reactions in batch set 1 batch experiments without the addition of an exogenous electron acceptor were performed initially using only fermentative bacteria with methanogenesis inhibited using bes in order to define the hydrolytic activity of the biomass under anaerobic conditions in set 1 ammonia and acetate produced during the fermentation process was used as a proxy for carbon degradation hereafter referred to as hydrolysis the carbon production from hydrolysis was measured and compared using two different approaches the first one was to measure the ammonification rate and the second one was to measure acetate accumulation in the second step methanogenesis was not inhibited measured production of methane and release of ammonia was then used to estimate the ammonia uptake by the methanogenesis process parallel to these two measurements the fermentation and the methanogenesis was calculated using the experiments by henze and mladenovski 1991 in order to predict the reduced fermentation and methanogenesis under anoxic conditions henze measured that fermentation is reduced by 50 when anoxic conditions were applied after measuring the capacity of the hydrolysis and the capacity of the methanogenesis process experiments from batch set 2 were supplemented with nitrate to determine denitrification and dnra capacity by following the nitrate conversion rate to either nitrogen gas or ammonia in batch set 2 nitrate was added to the batch experiments and dnra and denitrification activities were determined by measuring nitrogen gas production experiments with sulfur batch set 3 and iron batch set 4 were conducted in a separate batch set the processes of hydrolysis metagenesis nitrate reduction sulfur reduction and oxidation as well as iron reduction and oxidation were measured and are presented as ¬µeeq micromolar electron

microscopically confocal microscope axioskop 2 mot electron scanning microscopy was performed according to engelhardt 1995 with parameters used provided in the supplementary material table 1 2 4 metagenomics and 16s gene amplicon sequencing during 546 days of operation samples were taken from the pilot reactor for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing method in details explained in the sm to evaluate the development of the methanogens and other chemolithotrophic microorganisms under anoxic conditions and in absence of organic carbon as substrate dna was extracted from three granules triplicate after 270 days operation in the sbr reactor with the qiagen dneasy power biofilm kit qiagen germany and quantified using a nanodrop 2000 thermo fisher scientific wilmington de dna aliquots were sent to bejing genomics institute bgi americas for library preparation and sequencing on an illumina hiseq x ten the three granule sequence libraries produced 49 050 460 49 117 576 and 48 796 712 paired end 150 bp reads read libraries were uploaded to kbase arkin et al 2018 for analysis taxonomic profiles of each granule metagenome library were determined with kaiju at all taxonomic levels using the refseq genomes database for the reference database and a 0 5 low abundance filter and a 10 subsample of each sequence library menzel et al 2016 3 results 3 1 denitrification rates during 546 days of operation of the rotating reactor developed an average continuous nitrate removal rate of 0 25 mgno3 n gvss d std 0 18 mgno3 n gvss d with an average removal efficiency of 32 std 14 during this period a continuously high abundance of methanogens above 30 was observed with 16s gene amplicon sequencing despite no external organic carbon was supplemented to the system biomass degradation in the rotating reactor resulted in 1 49 mg vssdecayed g vss d with deltaproteobacteria rising from 30 to 50 over 546 days supplementary material fig 24 a loss of biomass volume was also observed in the sbr as the initial biomass was 300 ml and reduced to 180 ml over 246 days indicating 1 62 mg vssdecayed g vss d of biomass loss the nitrate removal rate increased to 4 83 mgno3 n gvss d which was higher than the observed 0 25 mgno3 n gvss d for the rotating reactor table 1 exclusion of sulfate from the media resulted in increased nitrate removal suggesting that competition between sulfate reducing bacteria and denitrifiers for reducing equivalents was a driving factor determining nitrate removal rates the nitrate removal rates remained relative low compared to a conventional denitrification systems that typically has rates between 24 and 136 mgno3 n gvss d christensen and harremo√´s 2013 3 2 competition between pyrite iron sulfide formation and methane production next we examined how competition between sulfate reducers and methanogens impacted the electrons distribution in the granule by conducting batch experiments set 3 the ammonification rate of anaerobic granule digestion was 7 14 mmolsn gvssdecayed the corresponding mass of volatile solids was 1 49 mgvssdec gvss d corresponding to a decay rate of 0 00149 1 d the decayed vss converted to mg cod was 2 13 mg cod gvss d or 264 16 ¬µeeq gvss d the degraded organic matter under anoxic nitrate rich conditions resulted in 149 ¬µeeq gvss d whereas the degraded organic matter under sulfate reducing conditions resulted in 128 ¬µeeq gvss d under sulfate reducing conditions 120 out of 128 ¬µeeq gvss d were related to the sulfate reducing process whereas only 7 4 ¬µeeq gvss d attributed to iron reduction the iron sulfide production rate was 86 7 ¬µeeq gvss d whereas diffusion of h2s out of the granule was 41 3 ¬µeeq gvss d fig 1 during iron and sulfur reduction processes in the granule no methane diffusion out of the granule into the liquid phase was detected indicating that iron and sulfate reduction surpassed the methane production formation of fes and fes2 was confirmed with sem edx based on the atomic ratio measurements of the crystals formed fig 2 at conditions where srb were inhibited methane production with 124 6 ¬µeeq gvss d occurred diffusing out of the granule under srb inhibition the pyrite and iron sulfide formation dropped to 17 8 ¬µeeq gvss d furthermore the iron reduction dropped by 50 with 3 8 ¬µeeq gvss d fig 3 3 3 nitrate reduction to nitrogen gas and ammonia in the presence of nitrate denitrifiers outcompeted methanogens and as a result 16 21 ¬µmols nno3 gvss d were reduced the electron mass balance fig 4 showed that 53 or 54 ¬µeeq nno3 gvss d were converted to ammonia via dnra whereas only 47 or 47 ¬µeeq nno3 gvss d were denitrified sulfate was produced at a rate of 0 9 ¬µmols s gvss d which resulted in 7 2 ¬µeeq gvss d based on these calculations it was estimated that 15 of the nitrate removal occurred through sulfur dependent denitrification since no sulfate was added to the system or any other reduced form of sulfur the sulfate oxidation is only related to oxidation of iron sulfide or pyrite due to precipitation of iron iii within the granule no measurement of iron iii was possible a model was developed in which the granule layers were divided in zones each zone was defined by the thermodynamic probability for a certain process to occur depending on electron donor and acceptor availability provision of specific zones is a simplification of the complex structure in the granule the zones were named with letters and numbers the letters c stands for carbon flow 1 for high concentration and 6 for low concentration and n for nitrate flow 1 stand for high concentration and 6 for low concentration our thermodynamic model predicts certain bioprocess per layer but it is likely that in reality bioprocesses maybe be more fluent and distributed across layers an example is for instance dnra that has high affinity to nitrate and requires high concentration of organic carbon which is therefore expected to dominate the core of the granule the ammonia mass balance fig 5 through zones 1 6 revealed that ammonia assimilation occurred in zones 4 and 5 suggesting the activity of other major populations such as iron and sulfur reducers and oxidizers in these zones 3 4 syntrophic iron and sulfur cycle in the interior zones of the granule the hydrolysis activity under anoxic conditions resulted in 149 ¬µeeq gvsstot d electrons that could be donated for other processes it was also determined that 54 ¬µeeq gvsstot d were utilized via dnra leaving 95 ¬µeeq gvsstot d for other nitrate removal processes denitrification or nitrate assimilation whereof 47 ¬µeeq gvsstot d were used for nitrogen gas formation it can be estimated that around 51 48 ¬µeeq out of 95 ¬µeeq of the available electrons were not transferred to nitrogen gas and that the remaining electrons were used for assimilation other forms of nitrogen in the liquid and in the gas phase such as n2o no or no2 were not detected at significant levels due to low growth rates of the anaerobic bacteria the electrons that might end up in biomass assimilation is estimated to be around 10 lier et al 2008 and therefore it is concluded that the remaining electrons generated fes or fes2 precipitates with rate of 32 ¬µeeq gvsstot d the electron equivalent mass balance is visualized in fig 6 3 5 respiration of n s and fe the abundance of microorganisms and their respected metabolic functions were evaluated with metagenomics table 2 highly abundant microorganisms included hydrolytic microorganisms methanogens iron and sulfur reducers as well as iron and sulfur oxidizers on the other hand the heterotrophic denitrifiers were found at very low abundance as expected in an autotropic system the presence of methanogens and methanotrophs indicated that simultaneous methane oxidation and reduction may occur in the granule the iron cycle is represented by microorganisms that can reduce and oxidize iron finally the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria as well as sulfide oxidizing bacteria confirms compacity of a cryptic s cycle 4 discussion 4 1 methanogens remained active over long period of operation the high abundance of the methanogens in the acclimated biomass supplementary material fig 24 implicates methane production in the absence of an externally supplied carbon source the ratio between the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens remained similar to the ratio in the seed sludge that originated from an anaerobic digester lier et al 2008 this implicates that organic matter degradation was the main source of carbon and electrons for methane production deltaproteobacteria that have been reported to be perform dnra van den berg et al 2016 outcompeted the betaproteobacteria supplementary material fig 25 that are well known as denitrifying microorganisms this indicates that the dnra process under low nitrate concentration toward the core of the granule has a competitive advantage due to its high affinity to nitrate and the efficient use of electron acceptor compared to denitrifying heterotrophs jia et al 2020 4 2 fes fes2 formation and its electron source originating from nitrate diffusion and hydrolysis activity we attributed the formation of an iron hydroxide layer to the oxidation of near core iron sulfide layers coupled to nitrate reduction with remaining iron sulfide pyrite layers localized towards the outer core of the granule graphical abstract formation of pyrite plays a major role in keeping the electrons in the system other studies have also reported reductive processes regarding formation of pyrite thiel et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 the main electron donor is expected to be organic carbon originating from degradation of the particulate organic matter in the anaerobic digester community used for seed sludge in this work this sustained a rate of 32 ¬µeeq gvsstot d pyrite and iron sulfide formation fig 6 and a rate of nitrate reduction of 16 21 ¬µmols nno3 gvss d fig 4 whereas in sediments these rates are relatively slower j√∏rgensen et al 2009 although there are studies that report methane as electron donor coupled with fe3 reduction cai et al 2018 ettwig et al 2016 and sulfate reduction milucka et al 2012 we were not able to confirm such reaction in our study methane production was confirmed to be subservient in competition with the iron sulfide production therefore reduction of iron and sulfate coupled with methane as an electron donor can be considered if methane is provided externally to the granule consortium such methane application would be less viable in an engineered system aimed at nitrate reduction in groundwater processes due to limited methane availability and nitrate scavenging by dnra and denitrification towards the core of the granule nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo haroon et al 2013 activity was absent table 2 however sulfate reduction coupled with methane oxidation might have occurred in this work as evidenced in figs 2 and 3 sulfate reduction in combination with a methanotrophs in a low saline environment has been previously reported kurth et al 2019 timmers et al 2015 supporting this interaction as possible mechanism in this study as well and which might explain the high abundance of methanotrophs table 2 4 3 fes fes2 oxidation rates remain an experimental challenge the oxidation of fes2 is a combination of the biotic oxidation of the iron and sulfide and the abiotically driven precipitation of the oxidized iron madigan et al 2012 the complexity of such iron and sulfur cycling makes it difficult to fully elaborate the processes that leads to cycling of electrons dos santos et al 2016 biotic oxidation of iron and sulfate coupled to the reduction of nitrate has been reported in freshwater habitats haaijer et al 2012 and might have contributed to the iron cycling in this study as well as shown in fig 6 iron electrons recycled 5 0 and new 4 0 sulfur electrons recycled 42 0 and new 33 0 chemodenitrification has also been implicated in iron oxidation to reduce nitrite to nitric and nitrous oxide however no nitric oxide was measured in the gas phase which would have been an indicator that iron moon et al was abiotically oxidized with nitrite as electron acceptor kampschreur et al 2011 due to this complexity it is difficult to distinguish if sulfide organic matter or iron served as electron donor for nitrate reduction moreover sulfate diffusing out of the granule cannot be used to estimate the fes fes2 oxidation rate because sulfate in the bulk may be cycled back to sulfide through sulfate reduction using organic carbon 4 4 dnra governing the core supplied ammonia to broad consortium of microorganisms for biomass assimilation and activity the interplay of organic carbon and nitrate availability will govern if dnra prevails over denitrification or verse visa nitrate limiting conditions are expected in the center of the granule due to diffusion limitation under these conditions dnra jia winkler and volcke 2020 will yield more energy per n consumed than denitrification and therefore ammonia accumulation is expected to occur in the core ammonia production rate of 12 83 ¬µmols n gvsstot d was measured whereof 6 81 ¬µmols n gvsstot d occurred through dnra and 6 02 ¬µmols n gvsstot d by ammonification we measured that only 3 46 ¬µmols n gvsstot d 27 diffused out of the granule and the remaining 73 were assimilated in new biomass fig 5 relatively high abundance of n fe s and c cycling microorganisms was confirmed with metagenomics supporting this hypothesis in zones n4 and n5 fig 6 once the iron and sulfur were oxidized by nitrate reduction yielding fe iii and sulfate the newly generated sulfate and iron iii would be immediately reduced in zones c4 and c5 by heterotrophic iron and sulfate reducers fig 6 this interaction is further complicated by the possible limitations of nitrate or organic carbon if nitrate is the limited then iron and sulfate will be reduced which will result in the formation and precipitation of iron sulfide fig 2 if organic carbon is limited sulfide and iron will be oxidized which would result in precipitation of iron hydroxide graphical abstract whereas the sulfate would be soluble and diffuse towards the outer layer of the granule 4 5 possible application in engineered systems nitrate removal was based on the internal degradation of particulate organic matter and the formation of pyrite which both served as an electron donor for nitrate reducers these anaerobic granules that originated from an anaerobic digester may hence serve as a seed sludge for future systems that intent to remove nitrate in systems without external organic carbon supply such as groundwater the system described here produced negligible amounts of biomass while removing 70 mg nitrate l 4 weeks which is comparable to nitrate contaminated groundwater eu commission 2018 this technology may hence be of interest to drinking water treatment the granules remained intact during the whole duration of the study 270 days and showed formation of fes fes2 our study showed that 47 of the nitrate added to the system was transformed to nitrogen gas 21 were transformed to ammonia while the remaining 32 were assimilated in the biomass ammonia maybe removed in a post aeration step hence yielding some nitrate but overall in a net reduction of nitrate since the electron donor is mainly provided by hydrolysis of particulate organic matter in the inner core endogenous respiration is the rate limiting step for conventional denitrification however the advantage of no sludge production as well as granular sludge elimination by hydrolysis offers conditions where this technology occupies are promising niche for instance a process within anaerobic wastewater treatment can be combined with autotrophic nitrate removal without adding external organic carbon but depleting the granules produced by the anaerobic treatment 5 conclusion in this study we investigate the n c s and fe cycling in a stratified onion like granule that removed nitrate under limited electron donor conditions formation of pyrite and its oxidation was observed with edx and metagenomic analysis that confirmed presence of iron and sulfur oxidizing and reducing microorganisms based on electron balance calculations molecular work and batch tests we conclude that the granule has onion like iron sulfide layers that have the function to cycle electrons between the iron reduction and oxidation as well as sulfur reduction and oxidation the batch experiments with equivalent electron balance calculations confirmed that methane was suppressed by iron and sulfate reduction but methanotrophy can be observed once methane is supplied

16436,granules recovered from a highly reduced anaerobic digester were capable of active nitrogen removal in the absence of exogenous electron donors averaging 0 25 mg mgno3 n gvss d over 546 days of operation electron mass balance indicated that about half the influent nitrate was converted to ammonia via dnra and another half denitrified this capacity was associated with an onion like structure of multiple layers enriched in reduced iron and sulfur and a complex microbial community shown by metagenomic sequencing to consist of multiple physiological groups and associated activities including methanogenesis denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra iron oxidation and reduction and sulfur reduction and oxidation nitrate reduction was supported by both entrained organic material and reduced iron and sulfur species corresponding to 2 13 mg cod gvss d batch incubations showed that approximately 15 of denitrified nitrate was coupled to the oxidation of sulfur derived from both sulfate respiration and granular material enriched in iron sulfide inhibition of sulfate reduction resulted in redirection of electron flow to methanogenesis and in combination with other batch tests showed that these granules supported a complex microbial community in which cryptic redox cycles linked carbon sulfur and iron oxidation with nitrate sulfate iron and carbon dioxide reduction this system shows promise for treatment of nitrate contaminated ground water without addition of an external organic carbon source as well as wastewater treatment in combination with granular sludge elimination leading in a net reduction of solid treatment costs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iron cycle sulfur cycle nitrate removal electron balance metagenomics granule 1 introduction one of the earliest pieces of eu legislation aimed at water quality the european nitrates directive has been in force since 1991 despite this directive increasing nitrate concentrations in water bodies remain a significant challenge for which new methodologies to mitigate severe nitrate pollution are being developed carrey et al 2021 ultimately nitrate pollution enters the groundwater where energy intensive processes such as ion exchange chemical denitrification reverse osmosis electrodialysis and catalytic denitrification are required to remove nitrate in drinking water treatment plants kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 biological denitrification is an attractive alternative for the chemical treatment of drinking water dahab and lee 1988 in addition biological treatments based on autotrophic denitrification or hydrogenotrophic denitrification are demonstrated to be more effective than physicochemical methods rezvani et al 2019 one biological treatment technology the sani process sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated wang et al 2009 is a practical implementation of the sulfur cycle for municipal wastewater treatment a major advantage of the sani process is reduction of sludge production by 60 compared to conventional activated sludge treatment wu et al 2016 although sani is implemented on wastewater the industrial application of sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is also promising for groundwater treatment however sani technology requires a carbon rich environment for sulfate reduction and is less applicable to treating ground water with low carbon content in contrast an autotrophic treatment process such as that combining sulfide driven partial denitrification with anammox spda deng et al 2021 might be an interesting application for the treatment of low carbon sources of drinking water autotrophic iron dependent denitrification aidd is an alternative to sulfur based autotrophic denitrification and has demonstrated nitrogen removal rates in the range of 0 3 kgn m3 d 0 7 kgn m3 d tian et al 2020 wang et al 2020 one bottleneck of aidd is that it requires high amounts of reduced iron as an electron donor for denitrification one electron is donated per iron mole compared to the five electrons required accepted for nitrate reduction to dinitrogen gas although the use of more highly reduced fe0 in zero valent iron zvi technology may be a cost efficient option for the iron dependent nitrate reduction huang et al 1998 nitrate was reported to have a deteriorating impact on performance sun et al 2016 other studies have examined a form of zvi technology that incorporates the iron cycle in anaerobic treatment zhang et al 2020 reducing chemical oxygen demand cod and improving methane production for energy recovery liu et al 2015 although the zvi technology is a promising low cost bioprocess abiotic reaction of iron with nitrate may produce unwanted ammonia instead of nitrogen gas zhu and getting 2012 a combination of reduced sulfur and iron compounds likely enhances the efficiency of nitrate removal by introducing more reducing equivalents fan et al 2017 however together reduced iron and sulfur compounds can form different insoluble iron sulfides rickard and luther 2007 making them less bioavailable berner 1984 has extensively reviewed the reaction products derived from reduced iron and sulfur compounds which include iron sulfide mackinawite greigite ferric magnetic iron sulfide and pyrite zhou et al 2015 pyritization is a process where dissolved iron moon et al is attacked by nucleophilic polysulfide to form pyrite another mechanism of formation is the reaction of ferrous sulfide with h2s which is known as the w√§chtersh√§user reaction rickard and luther 2007 since molecular hydrogen is also formed in this reaction pyrite formation from fes and h2s through microbial redox activities provides energy for lithotrophic growth that is syntrophically coupled to methanogenesis thiel et al 2019 microorganisms promote the formation of these and other products by respiratory reduction of sulfate and iron as observed in the production of biogenic nano particulate iron sulfide through sulfate and fe iii downing and hopwood oxide reductions enhanced by pyruvate as an electron donor zhou et al 2015 a review on the role of microorganisms in the formation of extracellular iron sulfide minerals concluded that iron sulfide is either produced abiotically after sulfate reduction with dissolved metals or after association of iron with the cells which then reacts with sulfide on these surfaces to form sulfide minerals picard et al 2016 additional reducing potential was attributed to granular pyritic material serving as an electron donor for nitrate reduction as previously reported torrent√≥ et al 2011 pu et al 2014 and discussed in a recent review of the isad iron sulfides with autotrophic denitrification bioprocess hu et al 2020 although pyrite is oxidized more slowly than sulfur tong et al 2018 its potential for autotrophic denitrification in biological treatment systems is gaining increasing attention kiskira et al 2017 this study examined the feasibility of using a pyritic granular sludge that actively reduced nitrate without supplemental carbon for the isad process the capacity of these granules to transform internal organic and inorganic material was 1 quantified using direct bulk activity assays 2 mass and energy balances 3 metagenomic analyses and 4 microscopic characterization the zonation layering of granule structure was shown to be associated with competitive and syntrophic interactions sustained by counter diffusive gradients of carbon out of the granule interior and nitrate into the granule from the bulk solution active methanogenesis and dnra in the absence of an external electron donor was associated with entrained organic material providing reductant for dnra localized primarily to the granule core similar to previous research van den berg et al 2015 this is reminiscent of carbon sequestration in marine sediments where interaction of organic material with iron sulfides is intertwined with the preservation of sedimentary organic carbon canfield and farquhar 2012 our analysis of nitrate removal conferred by the biotic and abiotic processes active in a novel granular system provide additional understanding of reactions sustaining the isad process as should assist in implementing this technology for treatment of nitrate contaminated source water with limited organic carbon 2 materials and methods overview of the research granules from an anaerobic digester operated in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb mode were used as a seed sludge for this work the granules had an onion like structure of multiple layers and were enriched in reduced iron and sulfur these granules were then placed from this highly reduced environment into a nitrate rich and organic carbon limited pilot scale reactor system the pilot reactor was operated for 546 days and the average nitrate removal biomass degradation iron accumulation in the granules and development of microbial composition were monitored over time in addition a second 3 5 l lab scale reactor was operated with granules originating from day 546 of operation of first reactor for 270 days under strict anaerobic conditions and these granules were analyzed with sem edx analysis for pyrite and iron sulfide formation furthermore in the second reactor the influence of sulfate concentration and water temperature on the nitrate removal was analyzed as well as the microbial ecology with metagenomics at the end of the experiments was detailed the biomass for the second reactor system was used to conduct batch experiments to define the counter diffusive electron flow from the electron rich core of the granule to the electron deplete outer layer of the granule as well as the diffusion of electron acceptor from the bulk liquid into the granule interior 2 1 full scale anaerobic digester source of biomass anaerobic granules from a full scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasbr in heppenheim germany n 49 38 17 09 e 8 36 27 09 were used as seed sludge for the pilot reactor as part of previous industrial treatment the reactor was periodically fed with ferric iron and sulfate that when reduced by microorganisms supported the formation of iron sulfide surface layers as the granules grew in diameter while in the uasbr these granules received organic carbon compounds as substrate no external organic carbon was supplied in this study but carbon was only internally generated by hydrolysis of particulate internal organic matter these granules were used to investigate microbially mediated redox processes after the granule microbial consortia were transitioned into a reactor with limited organic carbon influent and the addition of electron acceptors in the form of nitrate and sulfate 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 pilot scale reactor a 40 l rotating lab scale reactor was operated with 10 8 l of biomass for 546 days under anoxic conditions without addition of an organic carbon source inflow nitrate concentrations varied between 1 5 and 3 5 mm with an inflow of 1 3 l h nitrate was measured on daily basis in duplicate by using hach cuvette tests in addition iron content of the granules was measured with x ray fluorescence analysis to better understand pyrite and iron sulfide flux in the system iron content in the granule plays a major role in the buildup of pyrite and iron sulfide so the granules were measured to assess whether they lose or accumulate iron in the granule structure over time 2 2 2 lab scale reactor in addition a 3 5 l lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with 300 ml of biomass was operated for 270 days the biomass originated from the pilot scale reactor withdrawn at day 546 of operation and therefore the seed sludge for the lab scale reactor was already accustomed to nitrate the reactor had a direct connection to deionized water and two stock solutions that were diluted and mixed in the reactor stock solution a contained nitrate and sulfate nh4 2so4 34 g kno3 26 g nahco3 50 g and kh2po4 2 8 g in 10 l whereas stock solution b was mainly a base medium with trace element solution kcl 3 5 g mgso4 7h2o 8 8 g 100 ml trace element solution 1 and 100 ml trace element solution 2 in 10 l the composition of the trace element solution is described below an additional pump was installed to fluidize the biomass at a recycling velocity of 7 4 m h a separate pump was installed to provide the outflow of the reactor after the sbr phase at the beginning of the sbr feed phase the reactor was sparged with nitrogen gas to maintain anaerobic conditions the ph was controlled at ph 7 the sbr phases were programmed with lab view software and regulated through remote control by the hardware of national instruments ni the continuously measured parameters including o2 ph and t were gathered and organized in a data set every five seconds the sbr was jacketed to operate the reactor under different temperatures starting from 8 c up to 37 c the inflow nitrate concentration was varied between 1 5 and 5 mm for a period of 270 days additionally two different operations with sulfate 2 6 mm so4 and 0 2 mm so4 were tested to measure the impact on the denitrification rate the liquid samples were measured in duplicate for ammonia nitrite nitrate sulfate and total iron with a spectrophotometer thermo fisher gallerytm and its relevant kits for ammonia ammonia r1 r2 nitrite ton r1 and r2 nitrate ton r1 r2 and r3l sulfate sulphate r1 and total iron iron r1 r2 respectively 2 2 3 batch test experiments sampled biomass was investigated in batch experiments in 244 ml glass serum bottles butyl rubber stoppers with aluminum crimp seals were used to seal the

with final concentration of 2 mm the h2s measurements were performed according to the spectrophotometric determination of h2s in natural waters cline 1969 the fe2 measurements were performed according to the colorimetric ferrozine based assay for quantification of iron riemer et al 2004 prior to all analysis samples were filtered with a filter that had a pore size of 0 45 ¬µm the gas samples were measured using gas chromatography model 8610c sri instrument torrance ca methane and carbon dioxide were separated using a silica gel column sri instrument and quantified using a flame ionization detector equipped with a methanizer and nitrogen carrier gas nitrogen gas oxygen hydrogen and argon were separated using a molecular sieve column sri instruments torrance ca and quantified using a thermal conductivity detector and reduced gas detector with helium carrier gas nitrous oxide was separated using a 182 9 hayesep d column sri instruments and quantified with an electron capture detector with nitrogen carrier gas as previously described moon et al 2020 henry s law was used as a basis for the calculation of the concentration in mols with standards prepared beforehand and calibrations for each measured gas given the complexity of the community and the reaction network the system could not be fully constrained and as a result only the main processes were delineated therefore the general approach was based on batch incubations with and without inhibitors to measure hydrolysis methanogenesis batch set 1 as well as nitrate batch set 2 sulfate batch set 3 and iron reduction batch set 4 every set was made by two duplicates and one blank sample without biomass for the possible abiotic reactions in batch set 1 batch experiments without the addition of an exogenous electron acceptor were performed initially using only fermentative bacteria with methanogenesis inhibited using bes in order to define the hydrolytic activity of the biomass under anaerobic conditions in set 1 ammonia and acetate produced during the fermentation process was used as a proxy for carbon degradation hereafter referred to as hydrolysis the carbon production from hydrolysis was measured and compared using two different approaches the first one was to measure the ammonification rate and the second one was to measure acetate accumulation in the second step methanogenesis was not inhibited measured production of methane and release of ammonia was then used to estimate the ammonia uptake by the methanogenesis process parallel to these two measurements the fermentation and the methanogenesis was calculated using the experiments by henze and mladenovski 1991 in order to predict the reduced fermentation and methanogenesis under anoxic conditions henze measured that fermentation is reduced by 50 when anoxic conditions were applied after measuring the capacity of the hydrolysis and the capacity of the methanogenesis process experiments from batch set 2 were supplemented with nitrate to determine denitrification and dnra capacity by following the nitrate conversion rate to either nitrogen gas or ammonia in batch set 2 nitrate was added to the batch experiments and dnra and denitrification activities were determined by measuring nitrogen gas production experiments with sulfur batch set 3 and iron batch set 4 were conducted in a separate batch set the processes of hydrolysis metagenesis nitrate reduction sulfur reduction and oxidation as well as iron reduction and oxidation were measured and are presented as ¬µeeq micromolar electron

metagenomics and 16s gene amplicon sequencing during 546 days of operation samples were taken from the pilot reactor for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing method in details explained in the sm to evaluate the development of the methanogens and other chemolithotrophic microorganisms under anoxic conditions and in absence of organic carbon as substrate dna was extracted from three granules triplicate after 270 days operation in the sbr reactor with the qiagen dneasy power biofilm kit qiagen germany and quantified using a nanodrop 2000 thermo fisher scientific wilmington de dna aliquots were sent to bejing genomics institute bgi americas for library preparation and sequencing on an illumina hiseq x ten the three granule sequence libraries produced 49 050 460 49 117 576 and 48 796 712 paired end 150 bp reads read libraries were uploaded to kbase arkin et al 2018 for analysis taxonomic profiles of each granule metagenome library were determined with kaiju at all taxonomic levels using the refseq genomes database for the reference database and a 0 5 low abundance filter and a 10 subsample of each sequence library menzel et al 2016 3 results 3 1 denitrification rates during 546 days of operation of the rotating reactor developed an average continuous nitrate removal rate of 0 25 mgno3 n gvss d std 0 18 mgno3 n gvss d with an average removal efficiency of 32 std 14 during this period a continuously high abundance of methanogens above 30 was observed with 16s gene amplicon sequencing despite no external organic carbon was supplemented to the system biomass degradation in the rotating reactor resulted in 1 49 mg vssdecayed g vss d with deltaproteobacteria rising from 30 to 50 over 546 days supplementary material fig 24 a loss of biomass volume was also observed in the sbr as the initial biomass was 300 ml and reduced to 180 ml over 246 days indicating 1 62 mg vssdecayed g vss d of biomass loss the nitrate removal rate increased to 4 83 mgno3 n gvss d which was higher than the observed 0 25 mgno3 n gvss d for the rotating reactor table 1 exclusion of sulfate from the media resulted in increased nitrate removal suggesting that competition between sulfate reducing bacteria and denitrifiers for reducing equivalents was a driving factor determining nitrate removal rates the nitrate removal rates remained relative low compared to a conventional denitrification systems that typically has rates between 24 and 136 mgno3 n gvss d christensen and harremo√´s 2013 3 2 competition between pyrite iron sulfide formation and methane production next we examined how competition between sulfate reducers and methanogens impacted the electrons distribution in the granule by conducting batch experiments set 3 the ammonification rate of anaerobic granule digestion was 7 14 mmolsn gvssdecayed the corresponding mass of volatile solids was 1 49 mgvssdec gvss d corresponding to a decay rate of 0 00149 1 d the decayed vss converted to mg cod was 2 13 mg cod gvss d or 264 16 ¬µeeq gvss d the degraded organic matter under anoxic nitrate rich conditions resulted in 149 ¬µeeq gvss d whereas the degraded organic matter under sulfate reducing conditions resulted in 128 ¬µeeq gvss d under sulfate reducing conditions 120 out of 128 ¬µeeq gvss d were related to the sulfate reducing process whereas only 7 4 ¬µeeq gvss d attributed to iron reduction the iron sulfide production rate was 86 7 ¬µeeq gvss d whereas diffusion of h2s out of the granule was 41 3 ¬µeeq gvss d fig 1 during iron and sulfur reduction processes in the granule no methane diffusion out of the granule into the liquid phase was detected indicating that iron and sulfate reduction surpassed the methane production formation of fes and fes2 was confirmed with sem edx based on the atomic ratio measurements of the crystals formed fig 2 at conditions where srb were inhibited methane production with 124 6 ¬µeeq gvss d occurred diffusing out of the granule under srb inhibition the pyrite and iron sulfide formation dropped to 17 8 ¬µeeq gvss d furthermore the iron reduction dropped by 50 with 3 8 ¬µeeq gvss d fig 3 3 3 nitrate reduction to nitrogen gas and ammonia in the presence of nitrate denitrifiers outcompeted methanogens and as a result 16 21 ¬µmols nno3 gvss d were reduced the electron mass balance fig 4 showed that 53 or 54 ¬µeeq nno3 gvss d were converted to ammonia via dnra whereas only 47 or 47 ¬µeeq nno3 gvss d were denitrified sulfate was produced at a rate of 0 9 ¬µmols s gvss d which resulted in 7 2 ¬µeeq gvss d based on these calculations it was estimated that 15 of the nitrate removal occurred through sulfur dependent denitrification since no sulfate was added to the system or any other reduced form of sulfur the sulfate oxidation is only related to oxidation of iron sulfide or pyrite due to precipitation of iron iii within the granule no measurement of iron iii was possible a model was developed in which the granule layers were divided in zones each zone was defined by the thermodynamic probability for a certain process to occur depending on electron donor and acceptor availability provision of specific zones is a simplification of the complex structure in the granule the zones were named with letters and numbers the letters c stands for carbon flow 1 for high concentration and 6 for low concentration and n for nitrate flow 1 stand for high concentration and 6 for low concentration our thermodynamic model predicts certain bioprocess per layer but it is likely that in reality bioprocesses maybe be more fluent and distributed across layers an example is for instance dnra that has high affinity to nitrate and requires high concentration of organic carbon which is therefore expected to dominate the core of the granule the ammonia mass balance fig 5 through zones 1 6 revealed that ammonia assimilation occurred in zones 4 and 5 suggesting the activity of other major populations such as iron and sulfur reducers and oxidizers in these zones 3 4 syntrophic iron and sulfur cycle in the interior zones of the granule the hydrolysis activity under anoxic conditions resulted in 149 ¬µeeq gvsstot d electrons that could be donated for other processes it was also determined that 54 ¬µeeq gvsstot d were utilized via dnra leaving 95 ¬µeeq gvsstot d for other nitrate removal processes denitrification or nitrate assimilation whereof 47 ¬µeeq gvsstot d were used for nitrogen gas formation it can be estimated that around 51 48 ¬µeeq out of 95 ¬µeeq of the available electrons were not transferred to nitrogen gas and that the remaining electrons were used for assimilation other forms of nitrogen in the liquid and in the gas phase such as n2o no or no2 were not detected at significant levels due to low growth rates of the anaerobic bacteria the electrons that might end up in biomass assimilation is estimated to be around 10 lier et al 2008 and therefore it is concluded that the remaining electrons generated fes or fes2 precipitates with rate of 32 ¬µeeq gvsstot d the electron equivalent mass balance is visualized in fig 6 3 5 respiration of n s and fe the abundance of microorganisms and their respected metabolic functions were evaluated with metagenomics table 2 highly abundant microorganisms included hydrolytic microorganisms methanogens iron and sulfur reducers as well as iron and sulfur oxidizers on the other hand the heterotrophic denitrifiers were found at very low abundance as expected in an autotropic system the presence of methanogens and methanotrophs indicated that simultaneous methane oxidation and reduction may occur in the granule the iron cycle is represented by microorganisms that can reduce and oxidize iron finally the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria as well as sulfide oxidizing bacteria confirms compacity of a cryptic s cycle 4 discussion 4 1 methanogens remained active over long period of operation the high abundance of the methanogens in the acclimated biomass supplementary material fig 24 implicates methane production in the absence of an externally supplied carbon source the ratio between the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens remained similar to the ratio in the seed sludge that originated from an anaerobic digester lier et al 2008 this implicates that organic matter degradation was the main source of carbon and electrons for methane production deltaproteobacteria that have been reported to be perform dnra van den berg et al 2016 outcompeted the betaproteobacteria supplementary material fig 25 that are well known as denitrifying microorganisms this indicates that the dnra process under low nitrate concentration toward the core of the granule has a competitive advantage due to its high affinity to nitrate and the efficient use of electron acceptor compared to denitrifying heterotrophs jia et al 2020 4 2 fes fes2 formation and its electron source originating from nitrate diffusion and hydrolysis activity we attributed the formation of an iron hydroxide layer to the oxidation of near core iron sulfide layers coupled to nitrate reduction with remaining iron sulfide pyrite layers localized towards the outer core of the granule graphical abstract formation of pyrite plays a major role in keeping the electrons in the system other studies have also reported reductive processes regarding formation of pyrite thiel et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 the main electron donor is expected to be organic carbon originating from degradation of the particulate organic matter in the anaerobic digester community used for seed sludge in this work this sustained a rate of 32 ¬µeeq gvsstot d pyrite and iron sulfide formation fig 6 and a rate of nitrate reduction of 16 21 ¬µmols nno3 gvss d fig 4 whereas in sediments these rates are relatively slower j√∏rgensen et al 2009 although there are studies that report methane as electron donor coupled with fe3 reduction cai et al 2018 ettwig et al 2016 and sulfate reduction milucka et al 2012 we were not able to confirm such reaction in our study methane production was confirmed to be subservient in competition with the iron sulfide production therefore reduction of iron and sulfate coupled with methane as an electron donor can be considered if methane is provided externally to the granule consortium such methane application would be less viable in an engineered system aimed at nitrate reduction in groundwater processes due to limited methane availability and nitrate scavenging by dnra and denitrification towards the core of the granule nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo haroon et al 2013 activity was absent table 2 however sulfate reduction coupled with methane oxidation might have occurred in this work as evidenced in figs 2 and 3 sulfate reduction in combination with a methanotrophs in a low saline environment has been previously reported kurth et al 2019 timmers et al 2015 supporting this interaction as possible mechanism in this study as well and which might explain the high abundance of methanotrophs table 2 4 3 fes fes2 oxidation rates remain an experimental challenge the oxidation of fes2 is a combination of the biotic oxidation of the iron and sulfide and the abiotically driven precipitation of the oxidized iron madigan et al 2012 the complexity of such iron and sulfur cycling makes it difficult to fully elaborate the processes that leads to cycling of electrons dos santos et al 2016 biotic oxidation of iron and sulfate coupled to the reduction of nitrate has been reported in freshwater habitats haaijer et al 2012 and might have contributed to the iron cycling in this study as well as shown in fig 6 iron electrons recycled 5 0 and new 4 0 sulfur electrons recycled 42 0 and new 33 0 chemodenitrification has also been implicated in iron oxidation to reduce nitrite to nitric and nitrous oxide however no nitric oxide was measured in the gas phase which would have been an indicator that iron moon et al was abiotically oxidized with nitrite as electron acceptor kampschreur et al 2011 due to this complexity it is difficult to distinguish if sulfide organic matter or iron served as electron donor for nitrate reduction moreover sulfate diffusing out of the granule cannot be used to estimate the fes fes2 oxidation rate because sulfate in the bulk may be cycled back to sulfide through sulfate reduction using organic carbon 4 4 dnra governing the core supplied ammonia to broad consortium of microorganisms for biomass assimilation and activity the interplay of organic carbon and nitrate availability will govern if dnra prevails over denitrification or verse visa nitrate limiting conditions are expected in the center of the granule due to diffusion limitation under these conditions dnra jia winkler and volcke 2020 will yield more energy per n consumed than denitrification and therefore ammonia accumulation is expected to occur in the core ammonia production rate of 12 83 ¬µmols n gvsstot d was measured whereof 6 81 ¬µmols n gvsstot d occurred through dnra and 6 02 ¬µmols n gvsstot d by ammonification we measured that only 3 46 ¬µmols n gvsstot d 27 diffused out of the granule and the remaining 73 were assimilated in new biomass fig 5 relatively high abundance of n fe s and c cycling microorganisms was confirmed with metagenomics supporting this hypothesis in zones n4 and n5 fig 6 once the iron and sulfur were oxidized by nitrate reduction yielding fe iii and sulfate the newly generated sulfate and iron iii would be immediately reduced in zones c4 and c5 by heterotrophic iron and sulfate reducers fig 6 this interaction is further complicated by the possible limitations of nitrate or organic carbon if nitrate is the limited then iron and sulfate will be reduced which will result in the formation and precipitation of iron sulfide fig 2 if organic carbon is limited sulfide and iron will be oxidized which would result in precipitation of iron hydroxide graphical abstract whereas the sulfate would be soluble and diffuse towards the outer layer of the granule 4 5 possible application in engineered systems nitrate removal was based on the internal degradation of particulate organic matter and the formation of pyrite which both served as an electron donor for nitrate reducers these anaerobic granules that originated from an anaerobic digester may hence serve as a seed sludge for future systems that intent to remove nitrate in systems without external organic carbon supply such as groundwater the system described here produced negligible amounts of biomass while removing 70 mg nitrate l 4 weeks which is comparable to nitrate contaminated groundwater eu commission 2018 this technology may hence be of interest to drinking water treatment the granules remained intact during the whole duration of the study 270 days and showed formation of fes fes2 our study showed that 47 of the nitrate added to the system was transformed to nitrogen gas 21 were transformed to ammonia while the remaining 32 were assimilated in the biomass ammonia maybe removed in a post aeration step hence yielding some nitrate but overall in a net reduction of nitrate since the electron donor is mainly provided by hydrolysis of particulate organic matter in the inner core endogenous respiration is the rate limiting step for conventional denitrification however the advantage of no sludge production as well as granular sludge elimination by hydrolysis offers conditions where this technology occupies are promising niche for instance a process within anaerobic wastewater treatment can be combined with autotrophic nitrate removal without adding external organic carbon but depleting the granules produced by the anaerobic treatment 5 conclusion in this study we investigate the n c s and fe cycling in a stratified onion like granule that removed nitrate under limited electron donor conditions formation of pyrite and its oxidation was observed with edx and metagenomic analysis that confirmed presence of iron and sulfur oxidizing and reducing microorganisms based on electron balance calculations molecular work and batch tests we conclude that the granule has onion like iron sulfide layers that have the function to cycle electrons between the iron reduction and oxidation as well as sulfur reduction and oxidation the batch experiments with equivalent electron balance calculations confirmed that methane was suppressed by iron and sulfate reduction but methanotrophy can be observed once methane is supplied

16437,nutrients exported from forest litterfall significantly contribute to the global cycling of elements and the water quality in watersheds simulating the watershed discharge load is challenging because of the combined effects of the decomposing litterfall and topographic heterogeneity we quantified the contribution of diffuse nutrient export from forest litterfall in a low temperature watershed using artificial rainfall experiments and watershed territorial modeling with remote sensing data and therefore the critical spatial factors and corresponding nutrient export dynamics were identified rainfall intensity and terrain slope were found to be the key factors for nutrient export under different litterfall decomposition conditions based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data and field observations the temporal patterns of litterfall biomass of two types of dominant forests broad leaved and mixed were interpreted the spatial patterns of total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp exports from watershed litterfall were simulated by coupling the observed discharge parameters under artificial rainfall conditions and watershed surface flow modeling with the hydrological characteristics of the forested areas the average watershed toc tn and tp loads exported from the litterfall were approximately 58 22 7 89 and 0 37 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively the exported loads of toc tn and tp varied with the forest types and the loads from the litterfall of deciduous broad leaved forest were found to be 50 70 of loads from the litterfall of mixed forest a comparison with similar studies worldwide also indicated that low temperature decreased the litterfall decomposition rate and diffuse nutrient export this study indicated that litterfall nutrients were a key contributor to watershed water pollution and their spatial discharge trend varied intensively with the terrestrial conditions the modified simulation methods were found to accurately assess the cycling of nutrients from the forest litterfall on a watershed scale keywords forest litterfall biomass watershed diffuse pollution modis artificial rainfall nutrient export 1 introduction the nutrients c n and p contained in forest litter are the key components of terrestrial ecosystems and can directly influence the water quality on a watershed scale bratt et al 2017 peng et al 2018 for the forested watershed litterfall load and nutrient content are the main factors that influence nutrient export via rainfall leaching grace 2004 chen et al 2020 the export dynamics by surface flow in low temperature watersheds depict twin summit temporal patterns of accumulation and decomposition of litter during freeze thaw periods hensley et al 2020 wang et al 2020 this nutrient discharge process has been examined in wetlands and tropical pine forests via in situ experiments davis et al 2006 xue et al 2009 to provide insights into the diffuse export of nutrients from forest litter in low temperature watersheds measuring the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient export due to spatial differences in litter is challenging the use of remote sensing data helps to effectively prevent watershed pollution okuda et al 2004 battude et al 2016 wang et al 2019 thus diffuse nutrient export experiments were carried out under diverse scenarios by utilizing a remote sensing data driven model the eco hydrological characteristics of litter in forested watersheds can directly affect the diffuse export of nutrients during rainfall the litter layer reduces soil detachment by mitigating both the kinetic energy and impact of raindrops gabet and dunne 2003 litter delays the infiltration of rain into the soil decreases its degree of saturation putuhena and cordery 1996 and reduces the export of organic c n and p from forests with low surface runoff gomi et al 2008 liu et al 2017 rainfall leaching flushes away soluble organic compounds while releasing nutrients currie et al 1997 wieder et al 2009 this is more prominent during the initial period of litter decomposition because of its accumulated c n and p contents tob√≥n et al 2004 low temperatures in the middle to high latitudes slow the decomposition of forest litter prescott 2010 thereby releasing more nutrients that are stored in the surface layer hence the discharge patterns of forest litter nutrients by surface flow in the rainy period of low temperature watersheds signify bigger loads artificial rainfall experiments have been conducted to study the nutrient export dynamics of forest litter under diverse environmental conditions lu et al 2019 rainfall simulations can help to quantify soil erosion rainfall flow and infiltration processes under controlled conditions sun et al 2016 artificial rainfall experiments compare the nutrient export from litter covered soil with that from uncovered soil to evaluate the effect of litter on nutrient export miyata et al 2009 when the load exported from litter covered soil is larger than the annual fresh litter discharge limits the nutrient content of litter on the ground during previous years is also washed out the nutrient export dynamics can be evaluated by exploring the slope variations litter types and rainfall intensities thereby supporting watershed scale modeling by considering the impact of litter biomass variability on the watershed diffuse exports cao et al 2019 taddeo et al 2019 experimental data can be combined with the distribution of the estimated forest litter biomass the regional or global annual forest litter biomass can be simulated under various climatic conditions by constructing regression models or via interpolation and extrapolation methods that use forest litter data along with climate dependent environmental variables liu et al 2004 compared to the annual average temperature rainfall and geographical factors evapotranspiration has been shown to better explain and predict the forest litter biomass matthews et al 1997 by collating the data from field sampling 576 plots of previous forest litter and local evapotranspiration data a regression model for the annual litter production alp and actual evapotranspiration aet was constructed on a national level shen et al 2017 forests in the low temperature region of the changbai mountains study area are mainly deciduous broad leaved and deciduous needle leaved forests with forest litter falling in the autumn and decomposing during the winter and early spring liu et al 2009 to simulate the monthly biomass in the subsequent year a litter decomposition model needs to be constructed that examines the decomposition over several months the olson model has been improved in recent years and is deemed suitable for describing litter decomposition at low temperature liu et al 2006 it can estimate the average annual decomposition rate of leaf litter using a single exponential function palma et al 1998 most studies till date have mainly focused on the contribution of temperate or tropical forest litterfall in nutrient export liu et al 2017 bratt et al 2017 the hydrological processes of low temperature forests are complex and less understood in this study the contribution of forest litter to the diffuse export of nutrients was estimated and its influencing factors were analyzed by monitoring a standard plot combined with remotely sensed watershed litter biomass data the main objectives of this study were to 1 simulate the spatial export of total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp from watershed forest litter using remotely sensed data 2 analyze the contribution of litter to the diffuse nutrient export by surface runoff with artificial rainfall experiments and 3 identify the potential contribution of litter to the watershed water quality in low temperature environments 2 methods 2 1 study area and forest distribution patterns the tumen river watershed in northeast asia covers an area of 33 168 km2 41 59 47 44 30 42 127 27 43 131 18 33 and flows through china north korea and russia with two thirds of the total watershed area lying within china fig 1 a the dominant soil types in the watershed are haplic luvisols 43 26 and orthic luvisols 17 68 distribution of the specific types of forests in the watershed fig 1b was interpreted using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mcd12q1 product https modis gsfc nasa gov the path and row number of the remote sensing image was h27v06 the land cover images were pretreated in arcgis version 10 2 esri through format transfer coordinate system definition and extraction the land cover was classified according to the international geosphere biosphere program classification system and 12 types of land cover were identified zhang et al 2017a the forest type was predominant covering 71 of the total area deciduous broad leaved forest dbf pinus koraiensis accounted for 85 of the total forest area and mixed forest mf quercus mongolica betula platyphylla accounted for the remaining 15 the watershed slope was calculated by geostatistical analysis using a digital elevation model which was obtained from the chinese geospatial data cloud website http www gscloud cn the slope of the forested area was analyzed in arcgis with the classified dbf and mf distribution data describing the average monthly temperature and rainfall during 1980 2010 were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn seven meteorological stations are located in the watershed all of which experienced low temperatures during autumn winter and spring in the studied duration fig 1c the average monthly precipitation in january february march november and december was 20 mm while most of the precipitation occurred in june july and august analysis of daily precipitation data during 1960 2010 indicated that heavy rain daily precipitation 25 mm generally occurs from april to october with the heaviest rainfall in july or august 2 2 temporal patterns of watershed forest litter dynamics the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi reflects the amount of vegetation growth within an area with a positive ndvi 0 1 representing vegetation cover and higher values indicating abundant biomass ju and masek 2016 by analyzing the monthly ndvi variations information on the leaf mortality and litter production period can be obtained modis is widely used in the study of vegetation dynamics owing to its high temporal resolution data quality and temporal consistency herrmann et al 2005 zhang et al 2017b the mod13q1 data for 2000 2017 with a temporal resolution of 16 d and a spatial resolution of 250 m were selected and pretreated the maximum synthesis method maximum value composite was used to convert the data into monthly periods through grouping of original mod13q1 dataset into 16 d periods using the following formula 1 n d v i i j m a x n d v i i j k 2 n d v i j i 2000 2017 n

month ndviij represents the ndvi data for the j th month in the i th year and ndviijk represents the ndvi data for the i th year the maximum value composite method can also be used to further reduce the interference from clouds and the atmosphere narasimhan and stow 2010 mao et al 2012 the mean and standard deviation of ndvi for the dbf and mf were obtained using computed zonal statistics 2 3 watershed litter biomass assessment with remote sensing data the forest litter biomass was estimated using a modified olson model fig 2 the simulated regional alp alps was estimated by the established regression with the meteorological factors in each raster cell the regression equation for the alps with aet was established as follows shen et al 2017 3 a l p s 61 79 0 557 a e t r 2 0 368 remote sensing is considered to be the most feasible method for estimating the watershed aet li et al 2009 the data from globally used modis aet product mod16a2 was selected for a period 2015 2018 it is an 8 d composite dataset with a 500 m resolution the mod16a2 data was pretreated and a raster calculator was used to extrapolate it into annual average aet the simulated results were reclassified with land cover data through zonal statistics and the alp for each forest type was obtained based on the multiple regression relationships between the alp latitude and altitude the calculated alp alpc was used to validate the alps based on the field measured alp the multiple regression calculation equation was established as follows zhang et al 2008a 4 a l p c 1732 4 28 1877 l a t 0 1938 a l t where lat and alt represent latitude and altitude m respectively the accuracy of the alps was assessed by comparing the alpc values obtained using aet with those obtained via latitude and altitude similarity between the spatial distribution and other characteristics of similar magnitude were assessed the measured alp values from previous studies in or around the tumen river watersheds were used to validate the simulation li et al 2005 zhang et al 2008a liu et al 2009 yuan et al 2010 based on the alpc values the olson model was used to estimate the forest litter biomass using eq 5 olson 1963 the results obtained for the monthly ndvi variation indicated that forest litter was mainly produced in autumn and its load was equal to the alp therefore alp was set to x0 in the olson model the decomposition coefficients for litter in the dbf and mf of the study area were obtained from the field litter decomposition bag method which were set at 0 452 and 0 419 respectively liu 2014 this data was the averaged value of 750 samples over 18 months the litter decomposition time was defined as the period before sampling over which litter biomass remained on the ground the olson model simulation suggests that it takes at least five years for 90 of the forest litter in the study area to decompose making the bottom layer of litter 5 years old therefore the combination of both fresh litter and litter accumulated over the previous 5 years is required to estimate the total litter biomass on the ground as evaluated in eq 6 5 x x 0 e k t where t represents the time taken for litter to decompose k refers to the litter decomposition coefficient and x 0 and x represent the litter mass before and after decomposition g m 2 respectively 6 m a l p i 0 4 e k t i where m represents the watershed litter biomass distribution g m 2 and i represents the year in which the litter began decomposing uncertainties in the simulated litter biomass need to be verified with data from field measurements the quadrat method with spatial field measurement was used to validate the data locations given in fig 1 at each designated site eight small quadrats with different slope canopy closure and ground shrub weed density were selected the fresh forest litter collected from each quadrat 0 5 0 5 m was transported to the laboratory and weighed 2 4 artificial rainfall experiments investigating the dynamics of nutrient loss by surface flow an artificial rainfall device was used to simulate the impact of forest hillslope runoff rectangular plastic boxes were filled with sampled soil and leaf litter the control group contained only layers of soil the plastic boxes were then tilted to simulate slopes holes in the sides of the plastic boxes allowed water to exit as runoff which was collected for analysis fig 3 the experimental parameters for the artificial rainfall were established based on land use cover slope and rainfall patterns in the tumen river watershed table 1 leaf litter of the two typical forests in the area mongolian oak quercus mongolica dbf and korean pine pinus koraiensis mf were used fang et al 2016 he et al 2016 based on the watershed slope pattern analysis experimental slope angles were used as the average slopes dbf 15 mf 12 fig 1b the rainfall in the watershed from april to october was found to cause surface runoff fig 1c the typical small and big rainfall intensities of 30 mm h 1 and 60 mm h 1 were set based on the statistical analysis of historical rainfall events and surface flow monitoring fig 1c surface runoff is not detected in the two types of slope conditions for 30 mm h 1 rainfall litter and soil samples were collected from dbf and mf in april and july respectively fig 1a based on the field investigations of watershed litter biomass in different months the litter in july was set at 37 04 mg cm 2 which was smaller than that set for april 46 75 mg cm 2 because of the longer period of decomposition the forest litter samples contained layers undergoing non destructive initial decomposition with semi decomposed and fully decomposed layers topsoil refers to the uppermost 10 cm of the soil sample the samples were collected with a prefabricated on site sampling set of boards and tray the four experimental scenarios were set using two different soils with forest litter cover conditions in two months which were compared with the two control groups without litter cover each type of forest scenario included an experimental and a control group with different litter cover the two experimental groups were litter covered dbf and mf soils with control groups consisting of dbf and mf soils without a litter layer the artificial rainfall events lasted for 120 min with surface runoff collected at 10 min intervals and stored at 4 c surface runoff volumes were measured using a graduated cylinder the dried litterfall were powdered and digested with h2so4 and hclo4 before measuring the c n and p concentrations toc concentrations were measured using a toc analyzer shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph cpn kyoto japan hollands et al 2021 tn and tp concentrations were determined by the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion method and measured with an automated segmented continuous flow analyzer seal aa3 norderstedt germany all measurements were repeated twice and the average values were used for further analysis fresh undecomposed litter samples were also collected in september and their toc tn and tp contents were measured after digestion these determined the maximum annual nutrient load in the litter and at the beginning of the decomposition based on the measured concentrations and runoff flow the accumulated surface runoff flow and nutrient export were calculated using the following formulas 7 q a v e s l p i 1 12 q i s 8 e a v e s l p i 1 12 c i q i s where qaveslp represents the accumulated surface runoff flow mm q i represents the i th runoff flow at 10 min intervals l s represents the simulated slope area m2 eaveslp represents the accumulated nutrient export mg m 2 c i represents the i th runoff concentration mg l 1 at 10 min intervals and i represents the sampling frequency in the artificial rainfall experiment 2 5 simulation of watershed forest litter nutrient export by surface flow spatial heterogeneity in a slope of a watershed leads to different surface runoff conditions which directly affect the nutrient discharges wang et al 2020 the soil conservation service curve number model was employed to simulate the accumulated runoff flow distribution and obtain the amount of nutrient export from forest litter under different slope patterns under the soil and water assessment tool interface this method is globally used for simulating rainfall runoff zhang et al 2012 ouyang et al 2018b details of the simulating process are given in tables s1 s4 based on the nutrient discharge dynamics under artificial rainfall experiments in various experimental slopes the diffuse export of nutrients from watershed forest litter were simulated by integrating spatial territorial patterns cheng et al 2018 the distribution patterns of watershed nutrient export from forest litterfall were mainly related to the spatial variances in slope surface flow and litterfall properties which were highlighted in the modeling and the rainfall intensity was assumed to be the same based on the above considerations the spatial patterns of nutrient export were modeled using the following equations 9 e q e a v e s l p q a v e s l p 10 e l i t t

patterns of nutrient export in litter covered soil experimental group mg m 2 elitter represents the difference between esoil litter and esoil mg m 2 m and m represent the distribution of litter

contribution of the forest litter to the amount of diffuse nutrients exported from the watershed mg m 2 the values of m for the litterfall sample in april and july were 462 and 370 mg m 2 respectively positive elitter biomass values suggest that the forest litter may increase the amount of nutrient exported from the forest 2 6 statistical analysis after simulating the diffuse nutrient export from forest litter the contributions of the type of forest litterfall slope rainfall intensity and decomposition period were calculated to further quantify the influences of slope rainfall intensity and decomposition period on nutrient discharge the difference in the amount of nutrients exported was compared with the data in scenarios 1 4 one dimensional analysis of variance was conducted to determine the significance of nutrient export under various scenarios using spss 20 0 software spss inc usa the tukey s test at p 0 05 was applied for multiple comparisons wu et al 2015 and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant the geospatial data remote sensing data spatial distribution simulation and spatial analyses were analyzed with arcgis 10 2 esri usa 3 results 3 1 spatial and monthly patterns of watershed litter biomass the spatial distribution of forests in the watershed was analyzed using a series of modis images and the forest litter biomass was simulated using the modified olson model for the impact of latitude and altitude fig 4 a the ndvi of the forest in the investigated watershed increased from march to june and then decreased significantly in september and october fig 4b the temporal ndvi patterns were similar for both types of forest with the decrease in the ndvi indicating leaf fall yellow zone and the initiation of ground litter decomposition in november the validation results indicated a 20 relative error between the simulated and measured litter biomass values the accuracy of the alps table 2 demonstrated the reliability of the distribution interpretation of the watershed alp the dominant dbf had a greater alp value than the mf with a maximum of 388 19 g m 2 a 1 the mf was mainly spread over the southern area and the highest alp value was 313 55 g m 2 a 1 the minimum alp in the two types of forests of the investigated watershed was 244 g m 2 a 1 the monthly ndvi patterns suggested that the fresh litterfall sample collected in april of the subsequent year had been decomposing for 6 months indicating that decomposition had been occurring for 9 months in july the alps decomposition time and decomposition coefficient were thus modeled using the olson tool table 2 based on which a 5 year litterfall accumulation period was simulated it was observed that the average biomass in the dbf can reach 584 62 22 53 g m 2 in april after 3 months of decomposition in july the accumulated biomass decreased to 522 14 20 12 g m 2 which was consistent with the field data 3 2 flow and nutrient export load in surface runoff surface flow and nutrient concentrations were analyzed according to the artificial rainfall intensity and slope conditions fig 5 under a given rainfall intensity the presence of litterfall slightly decreased the flow and the litterfall variation in different month did not directly impact the surface flow fig 5a the experimental groups had higher values of accumulated nutrient export during the 2 h rainfall than the control groups high rainfall intensity was associated to an increased export of the accumulated nutrients in both the groups longer decomposition periods led to an increased discharge of nutrients in the control group whereas little change was observed in the experimental group differences in the statistical analysis indicate that more tn and tp were discharged from the litter in april scenarios 1 and 3 than in july scenarios 2 and 4 more toc was discharged from the litter in july under both sets of rainfall conditions and the ratio of toc tn from dbf decreased from 6 2 in april to 3 5 in july however the ratio of tn tp increased from 42 1 to 57 7 under the same condition these differences indicated that tn decomposed quickly than toc but slower than tp under the same rainfall conditions the difference in the nutrient load discharged from the soil with mf litter was much clearer than that from the soil without litter indicating that mf litter has a larger potential nutrient load which was still noticeable in july after the longer decomposition period the temporal flow patterns and nutrient discharge in the artificial experiments were also analyzed fig s1 compared to the control group the litter covered experimental groups generally showed a lower runoff value 40 75 in the initial 30 min these comparisons highlight the impact of different decomposition periods and rainfall intensities the lowest discharge was observed in april for soil without litterfall indicating that litterfall contributes to nutrient discharge the toc tn and tp concentrations in the runoff showed an overall decreasing trend during the initial rainfall 3 3 spatial distributions of nutrients exported from forest litter the watershed distribution of litterfall nutrient export was analyzed using the discharge dynamics from the artificial rainfall experiments and the spatial distribution patterns of the critical factors slope soil runoff curves land cover and elevation of the watershed fig 6 spatial loss patterns of the litter covered soil in april and july under rainfall intensities of 30 and 60 mm h 1 respectively were compared conditions in which litter was present in july after more than 3 months of decomposition showed the lowest toc export from dbf and lowest tp loads from both types of forest litterfall under 30 mm h 1 under the same rainfall intensity more nutrients were discharged from the litterfall in april than in july except tn thus rainfall intensity was critical for nutrient discharge and heavier rainfall leaching carried more nutrients from the litter enhancing the diffuse export doubling rainfall intensity from 30 mm h 1 to 60 mm h 1 caused more than twice as much discharge to occur the toc load from the dbf litterfall increased almost three times under the heavier rainfall conditions under the same rainfall and decomposition time the type of forests present and the slope may also cause spatial heterogeneity in nutrient export the difference between the results of the experimental and control groups further demonstrated that forest litter is a vital potential source of diffuse export from forests however spatial differences were also observed in the distribution of export over different slopes covered with the same type of forest after highlighting the differences in load distribution for soil with and without forest litter the effect of slope on nutrient discharge was analyzed fig 7 the discharge load patterns were reclassified with the slope conditions which were observed to have a positive effect on the discharges with values increasing from 6 to 30 with increasing slope notably the discharge showed different responses under the two types of forests when the slope ranged from 2 to 17 the toc exports in the two types of forests for same slope condition increased 2 5 times under the increased rainfall intensity which was much bigger than the response rates of the tn and tp 1 3 1 8 fold additionally more tn and tp were exported from the mf litterfall than from the dbf one and were more sensitive to the increase in slope 3 4 impact of temperature on the diffuse export of litter nutrients forest litter decomposition is also sensitive to temperature and is particularly relevant in watersheds experiencing freeze thaw cycles results of the observations in the 18 case studies worldwide were analyzed and visualized using the r tool https cran r project org bin windows rtools scatter distribution was used to demonstrate the impact of temperature and compare it with the results of this study a clear increase was observed in the tn loads discharged with increased watershed temperature from 1 to 25 c fig 8 the highest tn discharge was observed under warm conditions with a 15 fold increase than that in the discharged load in finland under cold conditions meanwhile the toc discharge increased 4 8 fold when the temperature was 6 c but the trend was not as sensitive as tn on the contrary the tp discharge was not particularly sensitive to temperature based on the temporal pattern of daily precipitation in the studied watershed the annual loads of toc tn and tp were calculated and compared the annual average loads of toc and tn discharges were 58 22 and 7 89 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively these values were close to the small values observed under low temperatures however the 0 37 kg ha 1 a 1 load for tp was higher than that observed in other similar studies worldwide 4 discussion 4 1 key factors in the discharge of litter nutrients by surface flow nutrients released from forest litterfall are critical for the cycling and transport of elements in the terrestrial ecosystem sun et al 2016 richardson 2017 the nutrient discharge dynamics are sensitive to diverse factors such as surface roughness overland flow continuity soil particles and infiltration capacity zhang et al 2018 spatial discharge patterns of the nutrients indicate that the distribution patterns of the forest litter biomass are the primary factors for nutrient loss fig 4 the impact of rainfall intensity and decomposition period on the surface runoff flow and nutrient load exported are highlighted by the results of the artificial experiments fig 5 in the study area rainfall mainly occurs during summer when the forest ndvi is at a maximum and leaf growth is abundant the accumulation of litterfall on the ground and the coverage by forest leaves both lead to a decrease in the surface flow of water in such forest watersheds zhou et al 2016 the rainfall intensity was therefore set at 30 or 60 mm h 1 during the experiments as provided by the statistical analysis of the local rainfall the heavier rainfall had a bigger influence on the nutrient concentrations in the runoff fig s2 consistently with results from previous studies tobon et al 2004 results obtained under the two different rainfall intensities indicate that steeper slopes lead to an increase in runoff and nutrient discharge fei et al 2019 the watershed discharge distributions indicate that the impact of the slope was more sensitive when the angle was 15 fig 7 where the hydrological condition was characterized by abundant water that benefitted the nutrient discharge the modified watershed simulation method with the integration of field investigation and artificial experiments indicated that forest litterfall is an important source of nutrient discharge over the entire watershed during rainy periods fig 6 the yearly discharge and export of toc tn and tp loads by surface flow in the studied forests reached 58 22 7 89 and 0 37 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively fig 8 comparison of the nutrient discharge dynamics between the control groups and the experiments further identified that litterfall is a more important source especially for toc and tp than soil in surface runoff under intense rainfall nutrients can also be washed out from the soil particularly the bigger percentage of the soluble tn the export of toc and tp was lower for dbf than mf while more tn was exported in dbf the yearly tn load from forest litter in the intensive forested watershed can reach 1 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 guo et al 2019 which is equivalent to the general load of agricultural diffuse pollution in this region the simulated organic n load from farmland is about three times more than the average load from forest but the discharge load of diffuse forest organic n and tn occupies 79 17 and 31 08 respectively due to the large area percentage wang et al 2020 the ratio of discharge load between toc and tn and tn and tp was 7 4 and 21 3 respectively a higher toc ratio in waterbodies directly affects the microorganism behavior thayanukul et al 2013 which is different from the eutrophication due to overloaded tn tp 4 2 effects of low temperature on diffuse nutrient export the discharge load of the diffuse nutrient export from the forest watershed also suggests the role of temperature wang et al 2020 toc tn and tn tp values of the discharge of litterfall in july was just half of the ratio in april fig 7 the variation in the ratio indicates that the decomposition of organic carbon and nitrogen is more sensitive than that of phosphorus analysis of the global forest litterfall nutrient discharge dynamics indicates that temperature was the key factor in determining the rate of litter decomposition fig 8 the decomposition rates are much lower when the temperature is 10 c zhang et al 2008b trofymow et al 2002 the decomposition rate of litterfall is also a key factor affecting nutrient loss yue et al 2016 and its low rate in freeze thaw areas is the main reason for the relatively small loads the different discharges under the similar temperature conditions are mainly because of the different nutrient content of the leaves and the soil nutrients yang et al 2019 mcgrath et al 1997 as the decomposition time increased by more than three months the nutrient content in the litterfall further decreased litterfall is known to respond more rapidly to rainfall events in the early decomposition process that releases large amounts of nutrients into the surrounding area bantle et al 2014 thus more toc tn and tp were leached out and washed away by surface runoff putten et al 2016 djukic et al 2018 contributing to the diffuse export the results of the olson simulation indicate that complete decomposition of litterfall in this high latitude area takes 5 years the litter decomposes slowly from november to april because of the low temperatures however a small amount of nutrient loss is still expected due to decomposition via freeze thaw cycles pourhassan et al 2016 during the initial period of snowmelt the litterfall has a high water content and vertical infiltration can transport some nutrients into the forest soil when temperature rises the surface flow related to the snowmelt transports these nutrients which represents a portion of the combined load from the decomposition of fresh litterfall and the accumulated litterfall from the previous years into the river wu et al 2018 consequently the nutrients are rapidly released from the forested area and flushed into the waterbody of the watershed under heavy rainfall events davis et al 2006 low temperatures can promote the accumulation of nutrients in litterfall leading to high nutrient loss from the litterfall during the rainy periods the temporal differences in response to the toc tn and tp discharges from litterfall also suggests that tn and tp are more easily released during rainfall than toc differences in the dissolution rates of nutrients are related to the composition of the inorganic ions that are easily dissolved in the water within the leaves schreeg et al 2013 4 3 implications for watershed litterfall discharge simulation and uncertainty analysis the inorganic fraction in the agricultural diffuse pollution is higher than the forest litterfall due to the application of fertilizer but the organic p fraction in forest soil or litterfall discharge can reach 70 80 ryden et al 1974 vaithiyanathan et al 1992 considering biological availability and environmental impact lehtola et al 2002 the higher ratio of organic pollution from forest litterfall delivers more risk to the watershed water safety however regular field monitoring of litterfall biomass in large basins or mountains is still much difficult magiera et al 2017 and remote sensing becomes the main data source for determining the watershed vegetation dynamics the monthly leaf mortalities are used to represent the vegetation status of the entire watershed zhang et al 2016 whitney et al 2018 and its integration in the modified method in this study leads to the monthly litter biomass simulation with olson decomposition process monthly forest litterfall biomass was simulated using modis and the decomposition model these simulations are necessary for the assessment of watershed litterfall nutrient export in a high spatiotemporal resolution jacques et al 2014 wallis et al 2019 the combination of artificial rainfall experiment remote sensing interpretation and the watershed hydrological process model provides a detailed understanding of the watershed litterfall nutrient export nonetheless the proposed method can be applied in a watershed with uniformly distributed vegetation types rainfall intensities and slopes ouyang et al 2018a the forests in the study area were further reclassified into two types dbf and mf and the corresponding nutrient discharge principles under different rainfall and slope conditions improved the simulation accuracy however the watershed discharge assessment for litterfall used in this study also has some uncertainties which mainly originated from the limited field observations and remote sensing data the olsen s litterfall decomposition model is the key to evaluate the potential nutrient discharge load from litterfall which was validated based on the limited sample numbers and had some uncertainties liu et al 2006 integrating field measurement and remote sensing data also contribute to some uncertainties with respect to scale cao et al 2017 the field observations and hydrological model only cover the role of surface flow which transport the discharge nutrients the pathway of the infiltration and subsurface flow were not considered which should cause an underestimation of the watershed discharge load hu et al 2019 therefore the simulated load of the diffuse forest pollution on the watershed waterbody should be smaller than the actual load 5 conclusions simulations of terrestrial element dynamics that use remote sensing data have been widely applied on a watershed scale combining these simulations with observed experimental export parameters aid in the spatial assessment of the diffuse load that is exported from litterfall by surface flow during rainy periods in this study the olson s litterfall biomass regression model was used and the temporal patterns of forest litterfall biomass distribution were simulated via the application of three modis remote sensing datasets land cover evapotranspiration and ndvi results of the artificial rainfall experiments were combined with litterfall biomass distribution data to simulate the spatial distribution of the toc tn and tp loss from forest litterfall the results of four experimental scenarios and two control groups indicated that forest type decomposition period and rainfall intensity were the key factors influencing the diffuse export of nutrients litterfall significantly contributes to nutrient export in watershed waterbody with the surface runoff especially in terms of toc and tp more amount of nutrient loads were exported from litterfall under shorter decomposition periods low temperatures reduced the decomposition activity and extended the initial decomposition period the toc tn and tp which were abundant in the forest litter during the initial decomposition were leached out by heavy rain to become a part of the diffuse forest pollution in the surface runoff the export behaviors of the three elements differed with n and p being more easily released via heavy rainfall leaching owing to their greater solubility credit authorship contribution statement wei ouyang conceptualization

16437,nutrients exported from forest litterfall significantly contribute to the global cycling of elements and the water quality in watersheds simulating the watershed discharge load is challenging because of the combined effects of the decomposing litterfall and topographic heterogeneity we quantified the contribution of diffuse nutrient export from forest litterfall in a low temperature watershed using artificial rainfall experiments and watershed territorial modeling with remote sensing data and therefore the critical spatial factors and corresponding nutrient export dynamics were identified rainfall intensity and terrain slope were found to be the key factors for nutrient export under different litterfall decomposition conditions based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data and field observations the temporal patterns of litterfall biomass of two types of dominant forests broad leaved and mixed were interpreted the spatial patterns of total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp exports from watershed litterfall were simulated by coupling the observed discharge parameters under artificial rainfall conditions and watershed surface flow modeling with the hydrological characteristics of the forested areas the average watershed toc tn and tp loads exported from the litterfall were approximately 58 22 7 89 and 0 37 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively the exported loads of toc tn and tp varied with the forest types and the loads from the litterfall of deciduous broad leaved forest were found to be 50 70 of loads from the litterfall of mixed forest a comparison with similar studies worldwide also indicated that low temperature decreased the litterfall decomposition rate and diffuse nutrient export this study indicated that litterfall nutrients were a key contributor to watershed water pollution and their spatial discharge trend varied intensively with the terrestrial conditions the modified simulation methods were found to accurately assess the cycling of nutrients from the forest litterfall on a watershed scale keywords forest litterfall biomass watershed diffuse pollution modis artificial rainfall nutrient export 1 introduction the nutrients c n and p contained in forest litter are the key components of terrestrial ecosystems and can directly influence the water quality on a watershed scale bratt et al 2017 peng et al 2018 for the forested watershed litterfall load and nutrient content are the main factors that influence nutrient export via rainfall leaching grace 2004 chen et al 2020 the export dynamics by surface flow in low temperature watersheds depict twin summit temporal patterns of accumulation and decomposition of litter during freeze thaw periods hensley et al 2020 wang et al 2020 this nutrient discharge process has been examined in wetlands and tropical pine forests via in situ experiments davis et al 2006 xue et al 2009 to provide insights into the diffuse export of nutrients from forest litter in low temperature watersheds measuring the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient export due to spatial differences in litter is challenging the use of remote sensing data helps to effectively prevent watershed pollution okuda et al 2004 battude et al 2016 wang et al 2019 thus diffuse nutrient export experiments were carried out under diverse scenarios by utilizing a remote sensing data driven model the eco hydrological characteristics of litter in forested watersheds can directly affect the diffuse export of nutrients during rainfall the litter layer reduces soil detachment by mitigating both the kinetic energy and impact of raindrops gabet and dunne 2003 litter delays the infiltration of rain into the soil decreases its degree of saturation putuhena and cordery 1996 and reduces the export of organic c n and p from forests with low surface runoff gomi et al 2008 liu et al 2017 rainfall leaching flushes away soluble organic compounds while releasing nutrients currie et al 1997 wieder et al 2009 this is more prominent during the initial period of litter decomposition because of its accumulated c n and p contents tob√≥n et al 2004 low temperatures in the middle to high latitudes slow the decomposition of forest litter prescott 2010 thereby releasing more nutrients that are stored in the surface layer hence the discharge patterns of forest litter nutrients by surface flow in the rainy period of low temperature watersheds signify bigger loads artificial rainfall experiments have been conducted to study the nutrient export dynamics of forest litter under diverse environmental conditions lu et al 2019 rainfall simulations can help to quantify soil erosion rainfall flow and infiltration processes under controlled conditions sun et al 2016 artificial rainfall experiments compare the nutrient export from litter covered soil with that from uncovered soil to evaluate the effect of litter on nutrient export miyata et al 2009 when the load exported from litter covered soil is larger than the annual fresh litter discharge limits the nutrient content of litter on the ground during previous years is also washed out the nutrient export dynamics can be evaluated by exploring the slope variations litter types and rainfall intensities thereby supporting watershed scale modeling by considering the impact of litter biomass variability on the watershed diffuse exports cao et al 2019 taddeo et al 2019 experimental data can be combined with the distribution of the estimated forest litter biomass the regional or global annual forest litter biomass can be simulated under various climatic conditions by constructing regression models or via interpolation and extrapolation methods that use forest litter data along with climate dependent environmental variables liu et al 2004 compared to the annual average temperature rainfall and geographical factors evapotranspiration has been shown to better explain and predict the forest litter biomass matthews et al 1997 by collating the data from field sampling 576 plots of previous forest litter and local evapotranspiration data a regression model for the annual litter production alp and actual evapotranspiration aet was constructed on a national level shen et al 2017 forests in the low temperature region of the changbai mountains study area are mainly deciduous broad leaved and deciduous needle leaved forests with forest litter falling in the autumn and decomposing during the winter and early spring liu et al 2009 to simulate the monthly biomass in the subsequent year a litter decomposition model needs to be constructed that examines the decomposition over several months the olson model has been improved in recent years and is deemed suitable for describing litter decomposition at low temperature liu et al 2006 it can estimate the average annual decomposition rate of leaf litter using a single exponential function palma et al 1998 most studies till date have mainly focused on the contribution of temperate or tropical forest litterfall in nutrient export liu et al 2017 bratt et al 2017 the hydrological processes of low temperature forests are complex and less understood in this study the contribution of forest litter to the diffuse export of nutrients was estimated and its influencing factors were analyzed by monitoring a standard plot combined with remotely sensed watershed litter biomass data the main objectives of this study were to 1 simulate the spatial export of total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp from watershed forest litter using remotely sensed data 2 analyze the contribution of litter to the diffuse nutrient export by surface runoff with artificial rainfall experiments and 3 identify the potential contribution of litter to the watershed water quality in low temperature environments 2 methods 2 1 study area and forest distribution patterns the tumen river watershed in northeast asia covers an area of 33 168 km2 41 59 47 44 30 42 127 27 43 131 18 33 and flows through china north korea and russia with two thirds of the total watershed area lying within china fig 1 a the dominant soil types in the watershed are haplic luvisols 43 26 and orthic luvisols 17 68 distribution of the specific types of forests in the watershed fig 1b was interpreted using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mcd12q1 product https modis gsfc nasa gov the path and row number of the remote sensing image was h27v06 the land cover images were pretreated in arcgis version 10 2 esri through format transfer coordinate system definition and extraction the land cover was classified according to the international geosphere biosphere program classification system and 12 types of land cover were identified zhang et al 2017a the forest type was predominant covering 71 of the total area deciduous broad leaved forest dbf pinus koraiensis accounted for 85 of the total forest area and mixed forest mf quercus mongolica betula platyphylla accounted for the remaining 15 the watershed slope was calculated by geostatistical analysis using a digital elevation model which was obtained from the chinese geospatial data cloud website http www gscloud cn the slope of the forested area was analyzed in arcgis with the classified dbf and mf distribution data describing the average monthly temperature and rainfall during 1980 2010 were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn seven meteorological stations are located in the watershed all of which experienced low temperatures during autumn winter and spring in the studied duration fig 1c the average monthly precipitation in january february march november and december was 20 mm while most of the precipitation occurred in june july and august analysis of daily precipitation data during 1960 2010 indicated that heavy rain daily precipitation 25 mm generally occurs from april to october with the heaviest rainfall in july or august 2 2 temporal patterns of watershed forest litter dynamics the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi reflects the amount of vegetation growth within an area with a positive ndvi 0 1 representing vegetation cover and higher values indicating abundant biomass ju and masek 2016 by analyzing the monthly ndvi variations information on the leaf mortality and litter production period can be obtained modis is widely used in the study of vegetation dynamics owing to its high temporal resolution data quality and temporal consistency herrmann et al 2005 zhang et al 2017b the mod13q1 data for 2000 2017 with a temporal resolution of 16 d and a spatial resolution of 250 m were selected and pretreated the maximum synthesis method maximum value composite was used to convert the data into monthly periods through grouping of original mod13q1 dataset into 16 d periods using the following formula 1 n d v i i j m a x n d v i i j k 2 n d v i j i 2000 2017 n

month ndviij represents the ndvi data for the j th month in the i th year and ndviijk represents the ndvi data for the i th year the maximum value composite method can also be used to further reduce the interference from clouds and the atmosphere narasimhan and stow 2010 mao et al 2012 the mean and standard deviation of ndvi for the dbf and mf were obtained using computed zonal statistics 2 3 watershed litter biomass assessment with remote sensing data the forest litter biomass was estimated using a modified olson model fig 2 the simulated regional alp alps was estimated by the established regression with the meteorological factors in each raster cell the regression equation for the alps with aet was established as follows shen et al 2017 3 a l p s 61 79 0 557 a e t r 2 0 368 remote sensing is considered to be the most feasible method for estimating the watershed aet li et al 2009 the data from globally used modis aet product mod16a2 was selected for a period 2015 2018 it is an 8 d composite dataset with a 500 m resolution the mod16a2 data was pretreated and a raster calculator was used to extrapolate it into annual average aet the simulated results were reclassified with land cover data through zonal statistics and the alp for each forest type was obtained based on the multiple regression relationships between the alp latitude and altitude the calculated alp alpc was used to validate the alps based on the field measured alp the multiple regression calculation equation was established as follows zhang et al 2008a 4 a l p c 1732 4 28 1877 l a t 0 1938 a l t where lat and alt represent latitude and altitude m respectively the accuracy of the alps was assessed by comparing the alpc values obtained using aet with those obtained via latitude and altitude similarity between the spatial distribution and other characteristics of similar magnitude were assessed the measured alp values from previous studies in or around the tumen river watersheds were used to validate the simulation li et al 2005 zhang et al 2008a liu et al 2009 yuan et al 2010 based on the alpc values the olson model was used to estimate the forest litter biomass using eq 5 olson 1963 the results obtained for the monthly ndvi variation indicated that forest litter was mainly produced in autumn and its load was equal to the alp therefore alp was set to x0 in the olson model the decomposition coefficients for litter in the dbf and mf of the study area were obtained from the field litter decomposition bag method which were set at 0 452 and 0 419 respectively liu 2014 this data was the averaged value of 750 samples over 18 months the litter decomposition time was defined as the period before sampling over which litter biomass remained on the ground the olson model simulation suggests that it takes at least five years for 90 of the forest litter in the study area to decompose making the bottom layer of litter 5 years old therefore the combination of both fresh litter and litter accumulated over the previous 5 years is required to estimate the total litter biomass on the ground as evaluated in eq 6 5 x x 0 e k t where t represents the time taken for litter to decompose k refers to the litter decomposition coefficient and x 0 and x represent the litter mass before and after decomposition g m 2 respectively 6 m a l p i 0 4 e k t i where m represents the watershed litter biomass distribution g m 2 and i represents the year in which the litter began decomposing uncertainties in the simulated litter biomass need to be verified with data from field measurements the quadrat method with spatial field measurement was used to validate the data locations given in fig 1 at each designated site eight small quadrats with different slope canopy closure and ground shrub weed density were selected the fresh forest litter collected from each quadrat 0 5 0 5 m was transported to the laboratory and weighed 2 4 artificial rainfall experiments investigating the dynamics of nutrient loss by surface flow an artificial rainfall device was used to simulate the impact of forest hillslope runoff rectangular plastic boxes were filled with sampled soil and leaf litter the control group contained only layers of soil the plastic boxes were then tilted to simulate slopes holes in the sides of the plastic boxes allowed water to exit as runoff which was collected for analysis fig 3 the experimental parameters for the artificial rainfall were established based on land use cover slope and rainfall patterns in the tumen river watershed table 1 leaf litter of the two typical forests in the area mongolian oak quercus mongolica dbf and korean pine pinus koraiensis mf were used fang et al 2016 he et al 2016 based on the watershed slope pattern analysis experimental slope angles were used as the average slopes dbf 15 mf 12 fig 1b the rainfall in the watershed from april to october was found to cause surface runoff fig 1c the typical small and big rainfall intensities of 30 mm h 1 and 60 mm h 1 were set based on the statistical analysis of historical rainfall events and surface flow monitoring fig 1c surface runoff is not detected in the two types of slope conditions for 30 mm h 1 rainfall litter and soil samples were collected from dbf and mf in april and july respectively fig 1a based on the field investigations of watershed litter biomass in different months the litter in july was set at 37 04 mg cm 2 which was smaller than that set for april 46 75 mg cm 2 because of the longer period of decomposition the forest litter samples contained layers undergoing non destructive initial decomposition with semi decomposed and fully decomposed layers topsoil refers to the uppermost 10 cm of the soil sample the samples were collected with a prefabricated on site sampling set of boards and tray the four experimental scenarios were set using two different soils with forest litter cover conditions in two months which were compared with the two control groups without litter cover each type of forest scenario included an experimental and a control group with different litter cover the two experimental groups were litter covered dbf and mf soils with control groups consisting of dbf and mf soils without a litter layer the artificial rainfall events lasted for 120 min with surface runoff collected at 10 min intervals and stored at 4 c surface runoff volumes were measured using a graduated cylinder the dried litterfall were powdered and digested with h2so4 and hclo4 before measuring the c n and p concentrations toc concentrations were measured using a toc analyzer shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph cpn kyoto japan hollands et al 2021 tn and tp concentrations were determined by the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion method and measured with an automated segmented continuous flow analyzer seal aa3 norderstedt germany all measurements were repeated twice and the average values were used for further analysis fresh undecomposed litter samples were also collected in september and their toc tn and tp contents were measured after digestion these determined the maximum annual nutrient load in the litter and at the beginning of the decomposition based on the measured concentrations and runoff flow the accumulated surface runoff flow and nutrient export were calculated using the following formulas 7 q a v e s l p i 1 12 q i s 8 e a v e s l p i 1 12 c i q i s where qaveslp represents the accumulated surface runoff flow mm q i represents the i th runoff flow at 10 min intervals l s represents the simulated slope area m2 eaveslp represents the accumulated nutrient export mg m 2 c i represents the i th runoff concentration mg l 1 at 10 min intervals and i represents the sampling frequency in the artificial rainfall experiment 2 5 simulation of watershed forest litter nutrient export by surface flow spatial heterogeneity in a slope of a watershed leads to different surface runoff conditions which directly affect the nutrient discharges wang et al 2020 the soil conservation service curve number model was employed to simulate the accumulated runoff flow distribution and obtain the amount of nutrient export from forest litter under different slope patterns under the soil and water assessment tool interface this method is globally used for simulating rainfall runoff zhang et al 2012 ouyang et al 2018b details of the simulating process are given in tables s1 s4 based on the nutrient discharge dynamics under artificial rainfall experiments in various experimental slopes the diffuse export of nutrients from watershed forest litter were simulated by integrating spatial territorial patterns cheng et al 2018 the distribution patterns of watershed nutrient export from forest litterfall were mainly related to the spatial variances in slope surface flow and litterfall properties which were highlighted in the modeling and the rainfall intensity was assumed to be the same based on the above considerations the spatial patterns of nutrient export were modeled using the following equations 9 e q e a v e s l p q a v e s l p 10 e l i t t

patterns of nutrient export in litter covered soil experimental group mg m 2 elitter represents the difference between esoil litter and esoil mg m 2 m and m represent the distribution of litter

contribution of the forest litter to the amount of diffuse nutrients exported from the watershed mg m 2 the values of m for the litterfall sample in april and july were 462 and 370 mg m 2 respectively positive elitter biomass values suggest that the forest litter may increase the amount of nutrient exported from the forest 2 6 statistical analysis after simulating the diffuse nutrient export from forest litter the contributions of the type of forest litterfall slope rainfall intensity and decomposition period were calculated to further quantify the influences of slope rainfall intensity and decomposition period on nutrient discharge the difference in the amount of nutrients exported was compared with the data in scenarios 1 4 one dimensional analysis of variance was conducted to determine the significance of nutrient export under various scenarios using spss 20 0 software spss inc usa the tukey s test at p 0 05 was applied for multiple comparisons wu et al 2015 and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant the geospatial data remote sensing data spatial distribution simulation and spatial analyses were analyzed with arcgis 10 2 esri usa 3 results 3 1 spatial and monthly patterns of watershed litter biomass the spatial distribution of forests in the watershed was analyzed using a series of modis images and the forest litter biomass was simulated using the modified olson model for the impact of latitude and altitude fig 4 a the ndvi of the forest in the investigated watershed increased from march to june and then decreased significantly in september and october fig 4b the temporal ndvi patterns were similar for both types of forest with the decrease in the ndvi indicating leaf fall yellow zone and the initiation of ground litter decomposition in november the validation results indicated a 20 relative error between the simulated and measured litter biomass values the accuracy of the alps table 2 demonstrated the reliability of the distribution interpretation of the watershed alp the dominant dbf had a greater alp value than the mf with a maximum of 388 19 g m 2 a 1 the mf was mainly spread over the southern area and the highest alp value was 313 55 g m 2 a 1 the minimum alp in the two types of forests of the investigated watershed was 244 g m 2 a 1 the monthly ndvi patterns suggested that the fresh litterfall sample collected in april of the subsequent year had been decomposing for 6 months indicating that decomposition had been occurring for 9 months in july the alps decomposition time and decomposition coefficient were thus modeled using the olson tool table 2 based on which a 5 year litterfall accumulation period was simulated it was observed that the average biomass in the dbf can reach 584 62 22 53 g m 2 in april after 3 months of decomposition in july the accumulated biomass decreased to 522 14 20 12 g m 2 which was consistent with the field data 3 2 flow and nutrient export load in surface runoff surface flow and nutrient concentrations were analyzed according to the artificial rainfall intensity and slope conditions fig 5 under a given rainfall intensity the presence of litterfall slightly decreased the flow and the litterfall variation in different month did not directly impact the surface flow fig 5a the experimental groups had higher values of accumulated nutrient export during the 2 h rainfall than the control groups high rainfall intensity was associated to an increased export of the accumulated nutrients in both the groups longer decomposition periods led to an increased discharge of nutrients in the control group whereas little change was observed in the experimental group differences in the statistical analysis indicate that more tn and tp were discharged from the litter in april scenarios 1 and 3 than in july scenarios 2 and 4 more toc was discharged from the litter in july under both sets of rainfall conditions and the ratio of toc tn from dbf decreased from 6 2 in april to 3 5 in july however the ratio of tn tp increased from 42 1 to 57 7 under the same condition these differences indicated that tn decomposed quickly than toc but slower than tp under the same rainfall conditions the difference in the nutrient load discharged from the soil with mf litter was much clearer than that from the soil without litter indicating that mf litter has a larger potential nutrient load which was still noticeable in july after the longer decomposition period the temporal flow patterns and nutrient discharge in the artificial experiments were also analyzed fig s1 compared to the control group the litter covered experimental groups generally showed a lower runoff value 40 75 in the initial 30 min these comparisons highlight the impact of different decomposition periods and rainfall intensities the lowest discharge was observed in april for soil without litterfall indicating that litterfall contributes to nutrient discharge the toc tn and tp concentrations in the runoff showed an overall decreasing trend during the initial rainfall 3 3 spatial distributions of nutrients exported from forest litter the watershed distribution of litterfall nutrient export was analyzed using the discharge dynamics from the artificial rainfall experiments and the spatial distribution patterns of the critical factors slope soil runoff curves land cover and elevation of the watershed fig 6 spatial loss patterns of the litter covered soil in april and july under rainfall intensities of 30 and 60 mm h 1 respectively were compared conditions in which litter was present in july after more than 3 months of decomposition showed the lowest toc export from dbf and lowest tp loads from both types of forest litterfall under 30 mm h 1 under the same rainfall intensity more nutrients were discharged from the litterfall in april than in july except tn thus rainfall intensity was critical for nutrient discharge and heavier rainfall leaching carried more nutrients from the litter enhancing the diffuse export doubling rainfall intensity from 30 mm h 1 to 60 mm h 1 caused more than twice as much discharge to occur the toc load from the dbf litterfall increased almost three times under the heavier rainfall conditions under the same rainfall and decomposition time the type of forests present and the slope may also cause spatial heterogeneity in nutrient export the difference between the results of the experimental and control groups further demonstrated that forest litter is a vital potential source of diffuse export from forests however spatial differences were also observed in the distribution of export over different slopes covered with the same type of forest after highlighting the differences in load distribution for soil with and without forest litter the effect of slope on nutrient discharge was analyzed fig 7 the discharge load patterns were reclassified with the slope conditions which were observed to have a positive effect on the discharges with values increasing from 6 to 30 with increasing slope notably the discharge showed different responses under the two types of forests when the slope ranged from 2 to 17 the toc exports in the two types of forests for same slope condition increased 2 5 times under the increased rainfall intensity which was much bigger than the response rates of the tn and tp 1 3 1 8 fold additionally more tn and tp were exported from the mf litterfall than from the dbf one and were more sensitive to the increase in slope 3 4 impact of temperature on the diffuse export of litter nutrients forest litter decomposition is also sensitive to temperature and is particularly relevant in watersheds experiencing freeze thaw cycles results of the observations in the 18 case studies worldwide were analyzed and visualized using the r tool https cran r project org bin windows rtools scatter distribution was used to demonstrate the impact of temperature and compare it with the results of this study a clear increase was observed in the tn loads discharged with increased watershed temperature from 1 to 25 c fig 8 the highest tn discharge was observed under warm conditions with a 15 fold increase than that in the discharged load in finland under cold conditions meanwhile the toc discharge increased 4 8 fold when the temperature was 6 c but the trend was not as sensitive as tn on the contrary the tp discharge was not particularly sensitive to temperature based on the temporal pattern of daily precipitation in the studied watershed the annual loads of toc tn and tp were calculated and compared the annual average loads of toc and tn discharges were 58 22 and 7 89 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively these values were close to the small values observed under low temperatures however the 0 37 kg ha 1 a 1 load for tp was higher than that observed in other similar studies worldwide 4 discussion 4 1 key factors in the discharge of litter nutrients by surface flow nutrients released from forest litterfall are critical for the cycling and transport of elements in the terrestrial ecosystem sun et al 2016 richardson 2017 the nutrient discharge dynamics are sensitive to diverse factors such as surface roughness overland flow continuity soil particles and infiltration capacity zhang et al 2018 spatial discharge patterns of the nutrients indicate that the distribution patterns of the forest litter biomass are the primary factors for nutrient loss fig 4 the impact of rainfall intensity and decomposition period on the surface runoff flow and nutrient load exported are highlighted by the results of the artificial experiments fig 5 in the study area rainfall mainly occurs during summer when the forest ndvi is at a maximum and leaf growth is abundant the accumulation of litterfall on the ground and the coverage by forest leaves both lead to a decrease in the surface flow of water in such forest watersheds zhou et al 2016 the rainfall intensity was therefore set at 30 or 60 mm h 1 during the experiments as provided by the statistical analysis of the local rainfall the heavier rainfall had a bigger influence on the nutrient concentrations in the runoff fig s2 consistently with results from previous studies tobon et al 2004 results obtained under the two different rainfall intensities indicate that steeper slopes lead to an increase in runoff and nutrient discharge fei et al 2019 the watershed discharge distributions indicate that the impact of the slope was more sensitive when the angle was 15 fig 7 where the hydrological condition was characterized by abundant water that benefitted the nutrient discharge the modified watershed simulation method with the integration of field investigation and artificial experiments indicated that forest litterfall is an important source of nutrient discharge over the entire watershed during rainy periods fig 6 the yearly discharge and export of toc tn and tp loads by surface flow in the studied forests reached 58 22 7 89 and 0 37 kg ha 1 a 1 respectively fig 8 comparison of the nutrient discharge dynamics between the control groups and the experiments further identified that litterfall is a more important source especially for toc and tp than soil in surface runoff under intense rainfall nutrients can also be washed out from the soil particularly the bigger percentage of the soluble tn the export of toc and tp was lower for dbf than mf while more tn was exported in dbf the yearly tn load from forest litter in the intensive forested watershed can reach 1 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 guo et al 2019 which is equivalent to the general load of agricultural diffuse pollution in this region the simulated organic n load from farmland is about three times more than the average load from forest but the discharge load of diffuse forest organic n and tn occupies 79 17 and 31 08 respectively due to the large area percentage wang et al 2020 the ratio of discharge load between toc and tn and tn and tp was 7 4 and 21 3 respectively a higher toc ratio in waterbodies directly affects the microorganism behavior thayanukul et al 2013 which is different from the eutrophication due to overloaded tn tp 4 2 effects of low temperature on diffuse nutrient export the discharge load of the diffuse nutrient export from the forest watershed also suggests the role of temperature wang et al 2020 toc tn and tn tp values of the discharge of litterfall in july was just half of the ratio in april fig 7 the variation in the ratio indicates that the decomposition of organic carbon and nitrogen is more sensitive than that of phosphorus analysis of the global forest litterfall nutrient discharge dynamics indicates that temperature was the key factor in determining the rate of litter decomposition fig 8 the decomposition rates are much lower when the temperature is 10 c zhang et al 2008b trofymow et al 2002 the decomposition rate of litterfall is also a key factor affecting nutrient loss yue et al 2016 and its low rate in freeze thaw areas is the main reason for the relatively small loads the different discharges under the similar temperature conditions are mainly because of the different nutrient content of the leaves and the soil nutrients yang et al 2019 mcgrath et al 1997 as the decomposition time increased by more than three months the nutrient content in the litterfall further decreased litterfall is known to respond more rapidly to rainfall events in the early decomposition process that releases large amounts of nutrients into the surrounding area bantle et al 2014 thus more toc tn and tp were leached out and washed away by surface runoff putten et al 2016 djukic et al 2018 contributing to the diffuse export the results of the olson simulation indicate that complete decomposition of litterfall in this high latitude area takes 5 years the litter decomposes slowly from november to april because of the low temperatures however a small amount of nutrient loss is still expected due to decomposition via freeze thaw cycles pourhassan et al 2016 during the initial period of snowmelt the litterfall has a high water content and vertical infiltration can transport some nutrients into the forest soil when temperature rises the surface flow related to the snowmelt transports these nutrients which represents a portion of the combined load from the decomposition of fresh litterfall and the accumulated litterfall from the previous years into the river wu et al 2018 consequently the nutrients are rapidly released from the forested area and flushed into the waterbody of the watershed under heavy rainfall events davis et al 2006 low temperatures can promote the accumulation of nutrients in litterfall leading to high nutrient loss from the litterfall during the rainy periods the temporal differences in response to the toc tn and tp discharges from litterfall also suggests that tn and tp are more easily released during rainfall than toc differences in the dissolution rates of nutrients are related to the composition of the inorganic ions that are easily dissolved in the water within the leaves schreeg et al 2013 4 3 implications for watershed litterfall discharge simulation and uncertainty analysis the inorganic fraction in the agricultural diffuse pollution is higher than the forest litterfall due to the application of fertilizer but the organic p fraction in forest soil or litterfall discharge can reach 70 80 ryden et al 1974 vaithiyanathan et al 1992 considering biological availability and environmental impact lehtola et al 2002 the higher ratio of organic pollution from forest litterfall delivers more risk to the watershed water safety however regular field monitoring of litterfall biomass in large basins or mountains is still much difficult magiera et al 2017 and remote sensing becomes the main data source for determining the watershed vegetation dynamics the monthly leaf mortalities are used to represent the vegetation status of the entire watershed zhang et al 2016 whitney et al 2018 and its integration in the modified method in this study leads to the monthly litter biomass simulation with olson decomposition process monthly forest litterfall biomass was simulated using modis and the decomposition model these simulations are necessary for the assessment of watershed litterfall nutrient export in a high spatiotemporal resolution jacques et al 2014 wallis et al 2019 the combination of artificial rainfall experiment remote sensing interpretation and the watershed hydrological process model provides a detailed understanding of the watershed litterfall nutrient export nonetheless the proposed method can be applied in a watershed with uniformly distributed vegetation types rainfall intensities and slopes ouyang et al 2018a the forests in the study area were further reclassified into two types dbf and mf and the corresponding nutrient discharge principles under different rainfall and slope conditions improved the simulation accuracy however the watershed discharge assessment for litterfall used in this study also has some uncertainties which mainly originated from the limited field observations and remote sensing data the olsen s litterfall decomposition model is the key to evaluate the potential nutrient discharge load from litterfall which was validated based on the limited sample numbers and had some uncertainties liu et al 2006 integrating field measurement and remote sensing data also contribute to some uncertainties with respect to scale cao et al 2017 the field observations and hydrological model only cover the role of surface flow which transport the discharge nutrients the pathway of the infiltration and subsurface flow were not considered which should cause an underestimation of the watershed discharge load hu et al 2019 therefore the simulated load of the diffuse forest pollution on the watershed waterbody should be smaller than the actual load 5 conclusions simulations of terrestrial element dynamics that use remote sensing data have been widely applied on a watershed scale combining these simulations with observed experimental export parameters aid in the spatial assessment of the diffuse load that is exported from litterfall by surface flow during rainy periods in this study the olson s litterfall biomass regression model was used and the temporal patterns of forest litterfall biomass distribution were simulated via the application of three modis remote sensing datasets land cover evapotranspiration and ndvi results of the artificial rainfall experiments were combined with litterfall biomass distribution data to simulate the spatial distribution of the toc tn and tp loss from forest litterfall the results of four experimental scenarios and two control groups indicated that forest type decomposition period and rainfall intensity were the key factors influencing the diffuse export of nutrients litterfall significantly contributes to nutrient export in watershed waterbody with the surface runoff especially in terms of toc and tp more amount of nutrient loads were exported from litterfall under shorter decomposition periods low temperatures reduced the decomposition activity and extended the initial decomposition period the toc tn and tp which were abundant in the forest litter during the initial decomposition were leached out by heavy rain to become a part of the diffuse forest pollution in the surface runoff the export behaviors of the three elements differed with n and p being more easily released via heavy rainfall leaching owing to their greater solubility credit authorship contribution statement wei ouyang conceptualization

16438,the radical chemistry of so4 is strongly affected by its interaction with chloride in natural waters during which so4 can be converted to ho and reactive chlorine species rcs this study investigated the effects of chloride on gemfibrozil gfrz transformation via the uv peroxydisulfate pds process elucidating the kinetics degradation pathways and solution toxicity the pseudo first order rate constants k of gfrz by uv pds changed slightly from 1 0 10 3 s 1 to 9 3 10 4 s 1 as the chloride content increased from 0 to 10 mm because the increase in ho and rcs levels compensated for the decrease in so4 concentration however the transformation pathways in the presence of chloride changed significantly from the transient absorption spectra we inferred that rcs and so4 attacked gfrz mainly through hydrogen abstraction and or electron transfer while ho interacted with the gfrz aromatic ring by addition hydroxylation carboxylation and cleavage products were enhanced in uv pds cl compared to uv pds through the addition of ho and the cleavage of co bonds by rcs and total organic chlorine tocl was undetectable interestingly the acute toxicity was lowest in uv pds cl with an inhibition percentage of 1 at 30 min the higher inhibition percentages in uv pds 13 and uv alone 53 at 30 min likely resulted from the stronger capacity of ho and rcs to oxidize aldehydes to carboxylic groups and cleave co bonds respectively than that of so4 this study provides a better understanding of contaminant transformation mechanisms under uv pds treatment at chloride levels

materials oh et al 2016 among these approaches the photolysis of pds by uv irradiation uv pds is effective at generating so4 with quantum yields of 1 4 and 1 8 mol es 1 in deoxygenated and oxygen saturated waters respectively eq 1 he et al 2014 wang and wang 2018 the uv pds process was reported to effectively degrade many organic contaminants such as ractopamine salbutamol carbamazepine propranolol naproxen gemfibrozil atenolol venlafaxine sulfamethazine butylated hydroxyanisole and imazalil lau et al 2007 gao et al 2012 hazime et al 2014 lian et al 2017 1 s 2 o 8 2 h ŒΩ 2 s o 4 œÜ 1

target compounds and different conditions for instance the degradation of 2 4 di tert butylphenol was enhanced by 53 with uv pds at 50 mm chloride wang et al 2016 in contrast an inhibitory effect of chloride was reported in other studies on the degradation of asiodoacetic acid atenolol azathioprine and perfluorocarboxylic acid liu et al 2013 qian et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 this discrepancy is probably due to the different reactivities of the target compounds towards reactive chlorine species rcs i e cl and cl2 the presence of chloride can potentially promote the abatement of compounds reactive towards rcs anipsitakis et al 2006 ji et al 2016 wang et al 2016 for compounds with low reactivity towards rcs chloride consumes so4 and thus leads to degradation inhibition besides as chloride increased from 0 to 1000 Œºm the degradation rates of 18 micropollutants decreased by 1 6 93 9 while those of other 5 micropollutants i e primidone gemfibrozil flumequine nalidixic acid and ibuprofen increased by 2 5 33 4 this was due to the conversion of so4 to ho in the presence of chloride while the effect of ionic strength 0 1 mm naclo4 on the degradation kinetics was negligible wang et al 2021 therefore the presence of chloride in the uv pds process can significantly change the radical species and impact the removal efficiency of contaminants the specific roles of the different radicals need to be further clarified the change in radical species in the presence of chloride may alter the transformation products during uv pds treatment due to different reaction mechanisms so4 reacts with compounds containing ketones amine moieties and aromatic rings mainly through electron transfer while in a few cases addition to double bonds and sulfate anion elimination reactions occur wojn√°rovits and tak√°cs 2019 in contrast addition to double bonds or aromatic rings is the predominant mechanism of ho attack and the reactions with saturated hydrocarbons via hydrogen abstraction are relatively slower gligorovski et al 2015 cl can add to aromatic rings to form chlorinated products and it can also react with electron rich compounds via electron transfer or react with phenolic compounds through hydrogen abstraction to generate phenoxy radicals zhang and parker 2018 lei et al 2019 cl2 reacts with compounds bearing phenols alkoxy benzenes and aniline groups mainly through electron transfer lei et al 2019 while it can also react with phenoxy radicals to form chlorinated products vione et al 2005 a previous study reported that dechlorination was the major pathway for p chlorophenol degradation in uv pds while more dichloro or trichloro products were formed in the presence of chloride fang et al 2017 this observation indicates that chloride can change the transformation pathways of organic contaminants in uv pds however investigations on the effect of chloride on product formation based on radical specific mechanisms are still limited chloride may impact the overall toxicity after uv pds treatment due to the alteration of intermediates rcs can react with target compounds and their products to form chlorinated products which are usually more toxic and stable than the original compounds anipsitakis et al 2006 fang et al 2012 2016 2017 for example the toxicity of dichlorinated methyl and n propylparaben towards daphnia magna was 3 9 and 2 8 fold that of the parent compounds terasaki et al 2009 acute toxicity to photobacterium phosphoreum was increased during monochlorophenol degradation by uv pds in the presence of chloride due to increased chlorinated product formation fang et al 2017 therefore toxicity change after uv pds treatment in the presence of chloride needs to be evaluated comprehensively this study aims to investigate the effects of chloride on the degradation of a common contaminant gemfibrozil gfrz during the uv pds process the impacts of chloride on the degradation kinetics of gfrz transformation products and solution toxicity were examined a quantum chemical computational method was employed to assess the proposed gfrz degradation mechanisms and the structures of the resultant intermediates gfrz is one of the most commonly observed lipid regulators in surface waters and wastewaters adams et al 2002 tran et al 2018 and its concentration has been detected at 0 5 4 76 Œºg l

uv pds system at different chloride concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 mm k ho was determined using nb as a ho probe eqs 7 8 which selectively reacts with ho and not so4 and rcs xiang et al 2016 nist 2019 k rcs so4 was determined by the subtraction of k uv and k ho from the overall k eq 9 note that the effect of ionic strength 0 10 mm naclo4 on the degradation of gfrz and nb in the uv pds process was negligible fig s1 also the presence of chloride did not affect the direct uv photolysis of gfrz 7 k nb k nb ho ho ss k uv nb 8 k ho k gfrz ho ho ss 9 k rcs so4 k k uv k ho here k nb represents the pseudo first order rate constant of nb degradation k uv nb represents the degradation rate of nb by direct uv photolysis k nb ho and k gfrz ho represent the second order rate constants of ho reacting with nb k nb ho 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2019 and gfrz k gfrz ho 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2013 respectively ho ss is the steady state concentration of ho which changes linearly with k ho the presence of chloride had a negligible effect on the overall k of gfrz by uv pds while it significantly altered the relative contributions of the reactive species as the chloride concentration increased from 0 to 10 mm the overall k of gfrz degradation changed slightly from 1 0 10 3 s 1 to 9 3 10 4 s 1 k ho exhibited an increase followed by a slight decline with a maximum at 1 mm chloride in general the opposite trend was observed for k rcs so4 specifically k ho increased from 7 8 10 5 s 1 to 7 6 10 4 s 1 as the chloride concentration increased from 0 to 1 mm and then gradually decreased to 4 2 10 4 s 1 at 10 mm chloride conversely k rcs so4 decreased by 92 from 7 6 10 4 s 1 to 5 9 10 5 s 1 as the chloride concentration increased from 0 to 1 mm and then increased to 3 5 10 4 s 1 at 10 mm chloride k uv was 1 6 10 4 s 1 previous studies have reported that 1 mm chloride could convert 90 so4 to cl and further transformed to ho wu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 while chloride at higher concentration 1 mm enhanced the conversion of cl and ho to cl2 wu et al 2019 therefore the concentration of ho increased from 7 8 10 15 m to 7 6 10 14 m as chloride concentration increased from 0 to 1 mm while it decreased slightly to 4 2 10 14 m when chloride further increased to 10 mm resulting in a parabolic curve for k ho as chloride increased from 0 to 1 mm the significant decrease of k rcs so4 was mainly ascribed to the consumption of so4 which could not be compensated by the slightly increased contributions of rcs however as chloride further increased from 1 to 10 mm the formation of cl2 was enhanced the second order rate constant of cl2 with gfrz is 2 75 108 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2019 which is comparable to that of so4 with gfrz at 7 13 108 m 1 s 1 lian et al 2017 this result indicates that the increase of k rcs so4 was primarily ascribed to the significant increase in k cl2 3 2 transient products during gfrz transformation by so4 ho and cl2 to further clarify the reaction mechanisms of gfrz by so4 ho and cl2 the transient absorption spectra of gfrz transformation at 500 ns were recorded by laser flash photolysis fig 2 in the laser gfrz system the broad and noncharacteristic absorption at 600 700 nm can be assigned to the generation of hydrated electrons eaq razavi et al 2009 this observation means that direct uv photolysis of grfz might generate the radical cation of gfrz peak at 450 nm through a photoionization process with electron ejection in the laser pds system so4 also has its maximum absorbance at 450 nm chen et al 2020 however the peak at 450 nm in the laser pds gfrz system was higher than the sum of those in the laser gfrz and laser pds systems indicating that the reaction of gfrz with so4 also formed gfrz radical cations in contrast compared with that in the laser gfrz and laser h2o2 systems the peak at 450 nm in the laser h2o2 gfrz system was similar to that in the laser gfrz system however significant absorption was observed at 330 nm in the laser h2o2 gfrz system which is a characteristic peak of the ho adduct hydroxycyclohexadienyl radicals formed via ho addition to the aromatic ring of gfrz razavi et al 2009 the high absorbance at 340 nm in the laser pds cl system was assigned to cl2 alegre et al 2000 therefore the spectrum in laser pds cl gfrz showed a high absorbance at 330 nm mainly due to the reaction of ho eqs 4 6 with gfrz at ph 7 along with the absorption of cl2 accordingly the higher absorbance at 450 nm in the laser pds cl gfrz system compared to those in the laser gfrz and laser pds cl systems was primarily ascribed to the reaction of gfrz with cl2 which was the predominant radical in the laser pds cl system at 0 5 m chloride text s2 previous studies also reported that the transient intermediates formed through ho addition to aromatic rings and through hydrogen abstraction from aromatic rings peaked at 320 nm and 400 500 nm respectively alegre et al 2000 m√°rtire et al 2001 therefore the above results indicate that ho mainly reacts with gfrz via addition to aromatic rings in contrast the reaction mechanisms of gfrz with so4 and cl2 were electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction both of which generated a transient product with a peak at 450 nm in summary the presence of chloride changed radical species thus changing the transient products during the degradation of gfrz by uv pds the corresponding reaction mechanisms of so4 ho and rcs were different 3 3 effect of chloride on the transformation products in uv pds the transformation products in the uv alone uv h2o2 uv pds and uv pds cl systems were identified by uplc qtof ms the molecular formulas of the products were analysed and are shown in table s1 product structures were identified by ms and ms2 fragmentation and further refined by quantum chemical calculation details shown in text s3 table s2 and figs s2 s4 the products could be categorized into six groups namely hydroxylation groups aldehyde groups carboxylic groups quinone groups aliphatic groups and sulfate containing groups as discussed previously rcs mainly cl2 and ho were the dominant radicals in the uv pds cl system at 10 mm chloride so4 and ho were the predominant radicals in uv pds and uv h2o2 respectively the products formed in the uv pds cl system were similar to those in uv pds except for p137b c8h10o2 table s1 mainly due to the similar reaction mechanisms of cl2 and so4 with gfrz fig 2 p137b was generated in uv pds cl and uv h2o2 but not in uv pds indicating that p137b can only be formed as a result of ho oxidation p151b c8h8o3 p279a c15h20o5 p251 c14h20o4 p345 c15h22o7s p359 c15h20o8s p231 c8h8o6s and p111 ch4o4s were observed in uv pds and uv pds cl but not in uv h2o2 table s1 indicating that these products can be generated only by the attack of so4 or rcs additionally many similar products were observed in all four systems such as p265a b c15h22o4 p263a b c15h20o4 p137a c8h10o2 p123 c7h8o2 p135a b c8h8o2 and p167 c8h8o4 table s1 indicating that uv photolysis plays an important role in gfrz transformation interestingly chlorine containing products were not observed in uv pds cl at 10 mm chloride and total organic chlorine tocl was undetectable data not shown these results further indicate that rcs react with gfrz through electron transfer and or hydrogen abstraction rather than chlorine addition additionally the intermediates generated by the reactions of rcs with gfrz cannot be further converted to tocl which differs from the intermediates formed from dissolved organic matter that can further react with rcs to form tocl lei et al 2021 these results highlight the potential role of rcs in detoxification during the abatement of trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps by so4 aops in the presence of chloride 3 3 1 evolution of major products figs 3 and s5 show the time dependent evolution profiles of major gfrz degradation products in the four systems all products formed in uv alone increased with reaction time while most products showed an initial increase and then a decreasing trend in the uv h2o2 uv pds and uv pds cl systems indicating that these products underwent further transformation by ho so4 or rcs during treatment the products whose concentrations increased monotonically were regarded as the final products and the others were regarded as intermediate products the major final products such as p151b p167 p159 and p111 presented lower molecular weights than the other products while the major intermediate products such as p265a p265b p345 and p263b showed higher molecular weights and contained hydroxyl or sulfate groups this result indicates that the degradation of gfrz preferred to begin with hydroxylation and sulfation and end with bond breakage for the hydroxylation products the maximum intensities of p265a and p265b in uv h2o2 were higher than those in uv pds while the lowest formation was associated with uv pds cl this was because ho was the major radical contributing to gfrz hydroxylation to form p265a and p265b via addition fig 2 and so4 may also have been responsible for the hydroxylation of gfrz hydroxylation products were also reported to be the dominant intermediates during the degradation of gfrz by the uv pms uv pds and uv h2o2 processes zhou et al 2020 the aldehyde product p263b was formed through hydrogen abstraction at one of the methyl side chains and subsequent oxidation by radicals its maximum intensity in uv pds 1 5 105 and uv pds cl 1 4 105 was much higher than that in uv h2o2 1 2 104 indicating that the hydrogen abstraction capacities of so4 and rcs were higher than that of ho fig 2 however the carboxylic product of p279b transformed from p263b had the highest yield in uv h2o2 1 5 104 compared to uv pds 4 6 103 and uv pds cl 1 3 104 indicating that ho has a stronger capacity to oxidize aldehydes to carboxylic compounds than rcs and so4 for the products formed from co bond cleavage of p263b p265a and p279a the maximum yields of p135a p151a p151b and p137a in uv pds cl were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in uv pds and uv h2o2 indicating that the co bond was more susceptible to rcs than so4 and ho such cleavage of the co bond in the side chain has also been widely observed in the degradation of gfrz by ho and clo yurdakal et al 2007 razavi et al 2009 ma et al 2016 kong et al 2018 a demethylation product p251 was observed in uv pds cl and uv pds but was not identified in uv h2o2 indicating that both so4 and rcs can transform gfrz through demethylation while ho plays a minor role in gfrz demethylation a quinone product p135b was much more abundant in uv pds cl 1 8 105 and uv h2o2 2 3 105 than in uv pds 1 3 104 another quinone product p137b was not observed in uv pds this observation was mainly because ho was the predominant radical forming hydroquinone products via addition which were the precursors to quinone products the formation of sulfate containing products p345 p359 p231 and p111 in uv pds and uv pds cl indicates that addition was also an important reaction mechanism of so4 during the gfrz degradation which was consistent with the literatures huang et al 2020 van buren et al 2020 2021 the higher intensity of p345 in uv pds cl compared to uv pds fig 3 was probably due to that rcs abstracted hydrogen from aromatic ring to generate significant carbon centered radicals which further combined with so4 to form organosulfates huang et al 2020 less than 12 of the gfrz was mineralized at 90 gfrz removal by uv pds and uv pds cl fig s6 indicating that many of the products formed during treatment cannot be mineralized by so4 ho and rcs furthermore both the uv pds and uv pds cl processes led to similar degrees of mineralization 3 3 2 degradation pathways based on the comparison of the transient absorption spectra and the products in different systems we observed the radicals performed different roles in gfrz degradation ho has a strong capacity for hydroxylating aromatic rings and leads to rapid oxidation of the aldehyde group to form carboxylic products so4 has a strong capacity to attack methyl groups on aromatic rings via hydrogen abstraction and is also associated with demethylation reactions similarly rcs can attack methyl groups through hydrogen abstraction or demethylation in addition reaction with rcs results in co bond cleavage the general pathways of gfrz degradation in uv pds cl involving hydroxylation demethylation hydrogen abstraction sulfation and co bond cleavage are shown in fig 4 hydroxylation occurred through ho attack or so4 attack on the aromatic ring or chain of the gfrz molecule to form p265a and p265b addition of so4 to aromatic ring of gfrz was also observed to form organosulfate p345 which was further attacked by so4 or rcs via hydrogen abstraction at methyl group to generate p359 hydrogen abstraction by so4 and rcs occurred on the methyl group of the aromatic ring of gfrz to form the aldehyde product p263b which further oxidized to form the hydroxylation product p279a and the carboxylic product p279b a previous study also observed the formation of p265a and p263b via ho addition and hydrogen abstraction respectively in a solar tio2 carbon dot system chen et al 2017 the second step was co bond cleavage on the branched chains of the hydroxylation products p265a b or the aldehyde product p263b which formed benzene compounds p137a p135a and p151a and a chain product p145 the co bond cleavage on the side chains of p359 and p279a was also occurred to generate p231 and p151a respectively moreover p265a demethylated to form p251 and the detached methyl reacted with so4 to form p111 benzene compounds p137a p135a and p151a were further oxidized to generate aldehyde p137b quinone p135b and carboxylic acids p167 and p151b while the chain product p145 was further oxidized to form p159 decarboxylation of p167 resulted in the formation of p123 in addition during uv irradiation gfrz can absorb photons and generate singlet excited state 1gfrz and triplet excited state 3gfrz ma et al 2016 fabbri et al 2017 which were likely to change chain into ring resulting in the formation of p263a the cyclization of gfrz to form p263a was also observed in the uv chlorine and Œ≥ radiation h2o systems razavi et al 2009 kong et al 2018 the yield of p263a in the uv alone system was much higher than that in the other three systems fig 3 indicating the oxidation of p263a by radicals in the other systems the significant formation of p137a p263b and p135a was also observed during gfrz degradation by uv photolysis 3 4 effect of chloride on toxicity the presence of chloride in uv pds increased the concentration of ho and generated rcs thus the quantities of carboxylic hydroxylation and cleavage products such as p279b p137a b p135a and p151a increased during the degradation of gfrz fig 3 however the product species remained the same as those formed in the absence of chloride without the formation of highly toxic chlorinated products fig 5 shows the change in acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri in the uv alone uv pds and uv pds cl systems a higher inhibition percentage represents higher toxicity in the solution it was reported that gfrz has no acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri kong et al 2018 while the toxicity increased during gfrz degradation by treatment with uv alone uv pds and uv pds cl fig 5 the highest increase was associated with uv alone treatment where the inhibition percentage reached 53 at 30 min compared to only 13 and 1 for uv pds and uv pds cl respectively this result indicates that the involvement of radicals decreased the acute toxicity of the solution after uv treatment note that the p263a concentration was much higher in the uv alone process than in the other two processes fig 3 therefore it is reasonable to deduce that p263a was the primary contributor to the increased acute toxicity as reported in previous studies razavi et al 2009 kong et al 2018 the acute toxicity in uv pds cl was negligible compared to that in uv pds probably due to the lower acute toxicity of the products generated from ho and rcs via hydroxylation and co bond cleavage respectively to further evaluate the specific toxicity of the transformation products the ecotoxicity of the specific product was calculated using a toxicity estimation software tool test software text s4 and table s3 the lethal concentration 50 lc50 values of p263a to daphnia magna and fathead minnow were the lowest at 2 79 and 0 61 respectively indicating that p263a shows much higher ecotoxicity than the other products this result further indicates that the highest acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri after uv treatment was induced by p263a furthermore the lower acute toxicity in uv pds cl was likely ascribed to decreased levels of the aldehyde products p263b and p279a fig 2 through oxidation by ho to form carboxylic products or reaction with rcs to cleave the co bond specifically the lc50 values of the aldehyde products of p263b and p279a to daphnia magna fathead minnow were 5 26 2 47 and 2 23 1 12 respectively while those of the carboxylic product of p279b were higher at 38 69 8 13 additionally the products formed by reaction with rcs through co bond cleavage such as p135a p151a b and p137a b especially the chain product of p145 showed much lower ecotoxicity to daphnia magna and fathead minnow table s3 these observations further indicate that chloride can decrease solution toxicity in uv pds during the transformation of gfrz by converting so4 to ho and rcs 4 conclusions this study investigated the radical mechanisms and product formation during the degradation of gfrz by the uv pds process in the presence of different chloride concentrations chloride at 0 10 mm showed negligible effects on the k of gfrz by uv pds which changed slightly from 1 0 10 3 s 1 to 9 3 10 4 s 1 the increase in ho and rcs levels compensated for the decreased contribution of so4 to gfrz degradation chloride enhanced ho formation in the low concentration range 1 mm where so4 and or ho were the primary radicals for gfrz degradation however chloride concentrations higher than 1 mm significantly enhanced the formation of rcs mainly cl2 and slightly inhibited ho formation making rcs and ho the dominant radicals the roles of ho so4 and rcs in product formation during gfrz degradation by uv pds cl were elucidated the mechanisms of gfrz oxidation by so4 and rcs involved hydrogen abstraction and or electron transfer while that by ho involved its addition to aromatic rings both so4 and rcs were involved in the aldehylation and demethylation of gfrz and rcs enhanced co bond cleavage tocl was undetectable in the uv pds cl system in addition the oxidation of aldehydes by ho to form carboxylic products was faster than that by rcs and so4 the acute toxicity of gfrz to vibrio fischeri was negligible after uv pds cl treatment and the inhibition percentage was only 1 much lower than that in the uv pds 13 and uv alone 53 systems at 30 min these inhibition results indicate that the radicals showed a positive effect on reducing the solution toxicity especially due to the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic groups by ho and due to co bond cleavage by rcs uv photolysis of gfrz inevitably occurs in natural environments under solar irradiation significantly increasing acute toxicity however the application of uv pds in the removal of gfrz can substantially decrease acute toxicity indicating the potential of uv pds for treating gfrz contaminated waters although the presence of chloride has a negligible effect on the overall degradation rate of gfrz by uv pds it impacts the transformation products of gfrz and the toxicity of the treated solution since chloride is ubiquitous in natural waters future research is warranted to further explore the effect of chloride during applications of so4 based

16438,the radical chemistry of so4 is strongly affected by its interaction with chloride in natural waters during which so4 can be converted to ho and reactive chlorine species rcs this study investigated the effects of chloride on gemfibrozil gfrz transformation via the uv peroxydisulfate pds process elucidating the kinetics degradation pathways and solution toxicity the pseudo first order rate constants k of gfrz by uv pds changed slightly from 1 0 10 3 s 1 to 9 3 10 4 s 1 as the chloride content increased from 0 to 10 mm because the increase in ho and rcs levels compensated for the decrease in so4 concentration however the transformation pathways in the presence of chloride changed significantly from the transient absorption spectra we inferred that rcs and so4 attacked gfrz mainly through hydrogen abstraction and or electron transfer while ho interacted with the gfrz aromatic ring by addition hydroxylation carboxylation and cleavage products were enhanced in uv pds cl compared to uv pds through the addition of ho and the cleavage of co bonds by rcs and total organic chlorine tocl was undetectable interestingly the acute toxicity was lowest in uv pds cl with an inhibition percentage of 1 at 30 min the higher inhibition percentages in uv pds 13 and uv alone 53 at 30 min likely resulted from the stronger capacity of ho and rcs to oxidize aldehydes to carboxylic groups and cleave co bonds respectively than that of so4 this study provides a better understanding of contaminant transformation mechanisms under uv pds treatment at chloride levels

materials oh et al 2016 among these approaches the photolysis of pds by uv irradiation uv pds is effective at generating so4 with quantum yields of 1 4 and 1 8 mol es 1 in deoxygenated and oxygen saturated waters respectively eq 1 he et al 2014 wang and wang 2018 the uv pds process was reported to effectively degrade many organic contaminants such as ractopamine salbutamol carbamazepine propranolol naproxen gemfibrozil atenolol venlafaxine sulfamethazine butylated hydroxyanisole and imazalil lau et al 2007 gao et al 2012 hazime et al 2014 lian et al 2017 1 s 2 o 8 2 h ŒΩ 2 s o 4 œÜ 1

seawater wang et al 2021 chloride can convert so4 to chlorine atoms cl eq 2 subsequently cl transforms to the dichlorine radical anion cl2 and hydroxyl radical ho via interactions with cl eq 3 grebel

target compounds and different conditions for instance the degradation of 2 4 di tert butylphenol was enhanced by 53 with uv pds at 50 mm chloride wang et al 2016 in contrast an inhibitory effect of chloride was reported in other studies on the degradation of asiodoacetic acid atenolol azathioprine and perfluorocarboxylic acid liu et al 2013 qian et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 this discrepancy is probably due to the different reactivities of the target compounds towards reactive chlorine species rcs i e cl and cl2 the presence of chloride can potentially promote the abatement of compounds reactive towards rcs anipsitakis et al 2006 ji et al 2016 wang et al 2016 for compounds with low reactivity towards rcs chloride consumes so4 and thus leads to degradation inhibition besides as chloride increased from 0 to 1000 Œºm the degradation rates of 18 micropollutants decreased by 1 6 93 9 while those of other 5 micropollutants i e primidone gemfibrozil flumequine nalidixic acid and ibuprofen increased by 2 5 33 4 this was due to the conversion of so4 to ho in the presence of chloride while the effect of ionic strength 0 1 mm naclo4 on the degradation kinetics was negligible wang et al 2021 therefore the presence of chloride in the uv pds process can significantly change the radical species and impact the removal efficiency of contaminants the specific roles of the different radicals need to be further clarified the change in radical species in the presence of chloride may alter the transformation products during uv pds treatment due to different reaction mechanisms so4 reacts with compounds containing ketones amine moieties and aromatic rings mainly through electron transfer while in a few cases addition to double bonds and sulfate anion elimination reactions occur wojn√°rovits and tak√°cs 2019 in contrast addition to double bonds or aromatic rings is the predominant mechanism of ho attack and the reactions with saturated hydrocarbons via hydrogen abstraction are relatively slower gligorovski et al 2015 cl can add to aromatic rings to form chlorinated products and it can also react with electron rich compounds via electron transfer or react with phenolic compounds through hydrogen abstraction to generate phenoxy radicals zhang and parker 2018 lei et al 2019 cl2 reacts with compounds bearing phenols alkoxy benzenes and aniline groups mainly through electron transfer lei et al 2019 while it can also react with phenoxy radicals to form chlorinated products vione et al 2005 a previous study reported that dechlorination was the major pathway for p chlorophenol degradation in uv pds while more dichloro or trichloro products were formed in the presence of chloride fang et al 2017 this observation indicates that chloride can change the transformation pathways of organic contaminants in uv pds however investigations on the effect of chloride on product formation based on radical specific mechanisms are still limited chloride may impact the overall toxicity after uv pds treatment due to the alteration of intermediates rcs can react with target compounds and their products to form chlorinated products which are usually more toxic and stable than the original compounds anipsitakis et al 2006 fang et al 2012 2016 2017 for example the toxicity of dichlorinated methyl and n propylparaben towards daphnia magna was 3 9 and 2 8 fold that of the parent compounds terasaki et al 2009 acute toxicity to photobacterium phosphoreum was increased during monochlorophenol degradation by uv pds in the presence of chloride due to increased chlorinated product formation fang et al 2017 therefore toxicity change after uv pds treatment in the presence of chloride needs to be evaluated comprehensively this study aims to investigate the effects of chloride on the degradation of a common contaminant gemfibrozil gfrz during the uv pds process the impacts of chloride on the degradation kinetics of gfrz transformation products and solution toxicity were examined a quantum chemical computational method was employed to assess the proposed gfrz degradation mechanisms and the structures of the resultant intermediates gfrz is one of the most commonly observed lipid regulators in surface waters and wastewaters adams et al 2002 tran et al 2018 and its concentration has been detected at 0 5 4 76 Œºg l

collected at various time intervals and quenched by ascorbic acid note that the presence of ascorbic acid did not interfere the analysis of gfrz and its products control tests were conducted in a

uv pds system at different chloride concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 mm k ho was determined using nb as a ho probe eqs 7 8 which selectively reacts with ho and not so4 and rcs xiang et al 2016 nist 2019 k rcs so4 was determined by the subtraction of k uv and k ho from the overall k eq 9 note that the effect of ionic strength 0 10 mm naclo4 on the degradation of gfrz and nb in the uv pds process was negligible fig s1 also the presence of chloride did not affect the direct uv photolysis of gfrz 7 k nb k nb ho ho ss k uv nb 8 k ho k gfrz ho ho ss 9 k rcs so4 k k uv k ho here k nb represents the pseudo first order rate constant of nb degradation k uv nb represents the degradation rate of nb by direct uv photolysis k nb ho and k gfrz ho represent the second order rate constants of ho reacting with nb k nb ho 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 nist 2019 and gfrz k gfrz ho 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 wols et al 2013 respectively ho ss is the steady state concentration of ho which changes linearly with k ho the presence of chloride had a negligible effect on the overall k of gfrz by uv pds while it significantly altered the relative contributions of the reactive species as the chloride concentration increased from 0 to 10 mm the overall k of gfrz degradation changed slightly from 1 0 10 3 s 1 to 9 3 10 4 s 1 k ho exhibited an increase followed by a slight decline with a maximum at 1 mm chloride in general the opposite trend was observed for k rcs so4 specifically k ho increased from 7 8 10 5 s 1 to 7 6 10 4 s 1 as the chloride concentration increased from 0 to 1 mm and then gradually decreased to 4 2 10 4 s 1 at 10 mm chloride conversely k rcs so4 decreased by 92 from 7 6 10 4 s 1 to 5 9 10 5 s 1 as the chloride concentration increased from 0 to 1 mm and then increased to 3 5 10 4 s 1 at 10 mm chloride k uv was 1 6 10 4 s 1 previous studies have reported that 1 mm chloride could convert 90 so4 to cl and further transformed to ho wu et al 2019 wang et al 2021 while chloride at higher concentration 1 mm enhanced the conversion of cl and ho to cl2 wu et al 2019 therefore the concentration of ho increased from 7 8 10 15 m to 7 6 10 14 m as chloride concentration increased from 0 to 1 mm while it decreased slightly to 4 2 10 14 m when chloride further increased to 10 mm resulting in a parabolic curve for k ho as chloride increased from 0 to 1 mm the significant decrease of k rcs so4 was mainly ascribed to the consumption of so4 which could not be compensated by the slightly increased contributions of rcs however as chloride further increased from 1 to 10 mm the formation of cl2 was enhanced the second order rate constant of cl2 with gfrz is 2 75 108 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2019 which is comparable to that of so4 with gfrz at 7 13 108 m 1 s 1 lian et al 2017 this result indicates that the increase of k rcs so4 was primarily ascribed to the significant increase in k cl2 3 2 transient products during gfrz transformation by so4 ho and cl2 to further clarify the reaction mechanisms of gfrz by so4 ho and cl2 the transient absorption spectra of gfrz transformation at 500 ns were recorded by laser flash photolysis fig 2 in the laser gfrz system the broad and noncharacteristic absorption at 600 700 nm can be assigned to the generation of hydrated electrons eaq razavi et al 2009 this observation means that direct uv photolysis of grfz might generate the radical cation of gfrz peak at 450 nm through a photoionization process with electron ejection in the laser pds system so4 also has its maximum absorbance at 450 nm chen et al 2020 however the peak at 450 nm in the laser pds gfrz system was higher than the sum of those in the laser gfrz and laser pds systems indicating that the reaction of gfrz with so4 also formed gfrz radical cations in contrast compared with that in the laser gfrz and laser h2o2 systems the peak at 450 nm in the laser h2o2 gfrz system was similar to that in the laser gfrz system however significant absorption was observed at 330 nm in the laser h2o2 gfrz system which is a characteristic peak of the ho adduct hydroxycyclohexadienyl radicals formed via ho addition to the aromatic ring of gfrz razavi et al 2009 the high absorbance at 340 nm in the laser pds cl system was assigned to cl2 alegre et al 2000 therefore the spectrum in laser pds cl gfrz showed a high absorbance at 330 nm mainly due to the reaction of ho eqs 4 6 with gfrz at ph 7 along with the absorption of cl2 accordingly the higher absorbance at 450 nm in the laser pds cl gfrz system compared to those in the laser gfrz and laser pds cl systems was primarily ascribed to the reaction of gfrz with cl2 which was the predominant radical in the laser pds cl system at 0 5 m chloride text s2 previous studies also reported that the transient intermediates formed through ho addition to aromatic rings and through hydrogen abstraction from aromatic rings peaked at 320 nm and 400 500 nm respectively alegre et al 2000 m√°rtire et al 2001 therefore the above results indicate that ho mainly reacts with gfrz via addition to aromatic rings in contrast the reaction mechanisms of gfrz with so4 and cl2 were electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction both of which generated a transient product with a peak at 450 nm in summary the presence of chloride changed radical species thus changing the transient products during the degradation of gfrz by uv pds the corresponding reaction mechanisms of so4 ho and rcs were different 3 3 effect of chloride on the transformation products in uv pds the transformation products in the uv alone uv h2o2 uv pds and uv pds cl systems were identified by uplc qtof ms the molecular formulas of the products were analysed and are shown in table s1 product structures were identified by ms and ms2 fragmentation and further refined by quantum chemical calculation details shown in text s3 table s2 and figs s2 s4 the products could be categorized into six groups namely hydroxylation groups aldehyde groups carboxylic groups quinone groups aliphatic groups and sulfate containing groups as discussed previously rcs mainly cl2 and ho were the dominant radicals in the uv pds cl system at 10 mm chloride so4 and ho were the predominant radicals in uv pds and uv h2o2 respectively the products formed in the uv pds cl system were similar to those in uv pds except for p137b c8h10o2 table s1 mainly due to the similar reaction mechanisms of cl2 and so4 with gfrz fig 2 p137b was generated in uv pds cl and uv h2o2 but not in uv pds indicating that p137b can only be formed as a result of ho oxidation p151b c8h8o3 p279a c15h20o5 p251 c14h20o4 p345 c15h22o7s p359 c15h20o8s p231 c8h8o6s and p111 ch4o4s were observed in uv pds and uv pds cl but not in uv h2o2 table s1 indicating that these products can be generated only by the attack of so4 or rcs additionally many similar products were observed in all four systems such as p265a b c15h22o4 p263a b c15h20o4 p137a c8h10o2 p123 c7h8o2 p135a b c8h8o2 and p167 c8h8o4 table s1 indicating that uv photolysis plays an important role in gfrz transformation interestingly chlorine containing products were not observed in uv pds cl at 10 mm chloride and total organic chlorine tocl was undetectable data not shown these results further indicate that rcs react with gfrz through electron transfer and or hydrogen abstraction rather than chlorine addition additionally the intermediates generated by the reactions of rcs with gfrz cannot be further converted to tocl which differs from the intermediates formed from dissolved organic matter that can further react with rcs to form tocl lei et al 2021 these results highlight the potential role of rcs in detoxification during the abatement of trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps by so4 aops in the presence of chloride 3 3 1 evolution of major products figs 3 and s5 show the time dependent evolution profiles of major gfrz degradation products in the four systems all products formed in uv alone increased with reaction time while most products showed an initial increase and then a decreasing trend in the uv h2o2 uv pds and uv pds cl systems indicating that these products underwent further transformation by ho so4 or rcs during treatment the products whose concentrations increased monotonically were regarded as the final products and the others were regarded as intermediate products the major final products such as p151b p167 p159 and p111 presented lower molecular weights than the other products while the major intermediate products such as p265a p265b p345 and p263b showed higher molecular weights and contained hydroxyl or sulfate groups this result indicates that the degradation of gfrz preferred to begin with hydroxylation and sulfation and end with bond breakage for the hydroxylation products the maximum intensities of p265a and p265b in uv h2o2 were higher than those in uv pds while the lowest formation was associated with uv pds cl this was because ho was the major radical contributing to gfrz hydroxylation to form p265a and p265b via addition fig 2 and so4 may also have been responsible for the hydroxylation of gfrz hydroxylation products were also reported to be the dominant intermediates during the degradation of gfrz by the uv pms uv pds and uv h2o2 processes zhou et al 2020 the aldehyde product p263b was formed through hydrogen abstraction at one of the methyl side chains and subsequent oxidation by radicals its maximum intensity in uv pds 1 5 105 and uv pds cl 1 4 105 was much higher than that in uv h2o2 1 2 104 indicating that the hydrogen abstraction capacities of so4 and rcs were higher than that of ho fig 2 however the carboxylic product of p279b transformed from p263b had the highest yield in uv h2o2 1 5 104 compared to uv pds 4 6 103 and uv pds cl 1 3 104 indicating that ho has a stronger capacity to oxidize aldehydes to carboxylic compounds than rcs and so4 for the products formed from co bond cleavage of p263b p265a and p279a the maximum yields of p135a p151a p151b and p137a in uv pds cl were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in uv pds and uv h2o2 indicating that the co bond was more susceptible to rcs than so4 and ho such cleavage of the co bond in the side chain has also been widely observed in the degradation of gfrz by ho and clo yurdakal et al 2007 razavi et al 2009 ma et al 2016 kong et al 2018 a demethylation product p251 was observed in uv pds cl and uv pds but was not identified in uv h2o2 indicating that both so4 and rcs can transform gfrz through demethylation while ho plays a minor role in gfrz demethylation a quinone product p135b was much more abundant in uv pds cl 1 8 105 and uv h2o2 2 3 105 than in uv pds 1 3 104 another quinone product p137b was not observed in uv pds this observation was mainly because ho was the predominant radical forming hydroquinone products via addition which were the precursors to quinone products the formation of sulfate containing products p345 p359 p231 and p111 in uv pds and uv pds cl indicates that addition was also an important reaction mechanism of so4 during the gfrz degradation which was consistent with the literatures huang et al 2020 van buren et al 2020 2021 the higher intensity of p345 in uv pds cl compared to uv pds fig 3 was probably due to that rcs abstracted hydrogen from aromatic ring to generate significant carbon centered radicals which further combined with so4 to form organosulfates huang et al 2020 less than 12 of the gfrz was mineralized at 90 gfrz removal by uv pds and uv pds cl fig s6 indicating that many of the products formed during treatment cannot be mineralized by so4 ho and rcs furthermore both the uv pds and uv pds cl processes led to similar degrees of mineralization 3 3 2 degradation pathways based on the comparison of the transient absorption spectra and the products in different systems we observed the radicals performed different roles in gfrz degradation ho has a strong capacity for hydroxylating aromatic rings and leads to rapid oxidation of the aldehyde group to form carboxylic products so4 has a strong capacity to attack methyl groups on aromatic rings via hydrogen abstraction and is also associated with demethylation reactions similarly rcs can attack methyl groups through hydrogen abstraction or demethylation in addition reaction with rcs results in co bond cleavage the general pathways of gfrz degradation in uv pds cl involving hydroxylation demethylation hydrogen abstraction sulfation and co bond cleavage are shown in fig 4 hydroxylation occurred through ho attack or so4 attack on the aromatic ring or chain of the gfrz molecule to form p265a and p265b addition of so4 to aromatic ring of gfrz was also observed to form organosulfate p345 which was further attacked by so4 or rcs via hydrogen abstraction at methyl group to generate p359 hydrogen abstraction by so4 and rcs occurred on the methyl group of the aromatic ring of gfrz to form the aldehyde product p263b which further oxidized to form the hydroxylation product p279a and the carboxylic product p279b a previous study also observed the formation of p265a and p263b via ho addition and hydrogen abstraction respectively in a solar tio2 carbon dot system chen et al 2017 the second step was co bond cleavage on the branched chains of the hydroxylation products p265a b or the aldehyde product p263b which formed benzene compounds p137a p135a and p151a and a chain product p145 the co bond cleavage on the side chains of p359 and p279a was also occurred to generate p231 and p151a respectively moreover p265a demethylated to form p251 and the detached methyl reacted with so4 to form p111 benzene compounds p137a p135a and p151a were further oxidized to generate aldehyde p137b quinone p135b and carboxylic acids p167 and p151b while the chain product p145 was further oxidized to form p159 decarboxylation of p167 resulted in the formation of p123 in addition during uv irradiation gfrz can absorb photons and generate singlet excited state 1gfrz and triplet excited state 3gfrz ma et al 2016 fabbri et al 2017 which were likely to change chain into ring resulting in the formation of p263a the cyclization of gfrz to form p263a was also observed in the uv chlorine and Œ≥ radiation h2o systems razavi et al 2009 kong et al 2018 the yield of p263a in the uv alone system was much higher than that in the other three systems fig 3 indicating the oxidation of p263a by radicals in the other systems the significant formation of p137a p263b and p135a was also observed during gfrz degradation by uv photolysis 3 4 effect of chloride on toxicity the presence of chloride in uv pds increased the concentration of ho and generated rcs thus the quantities of carboxylic hydroxylation and cleavage products such as p279b p137a b p135a and p151a increased during the degradation of gfrz fig 3 however the product species remained the same as those formed in the absence of chloride without the formation of highly toxic chlorinated products fig 5 shows the change in acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri in the uv alone uv pds and uv pds cl systems a higher inhibition percentage represents higher toxicity in the solution it was reported that gfrz has no acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri kong et al 2018 while the toxicity increased during gfrz degradation by treatment with uv alone uv pds and uv pds cl fig 5 the highest increase was associated with uv alone treatment where the inhibition percentage reached 53 at 30 min compared to only 13 and 1 for uv pds and uv pds cl respectively this result indicates that the involvement of radicals decreased the acute toxicity of the solution after uv treatment note that the p263a concentration was much higher in the uv alone process than in the other two processes fig 3 therefore it is reasonable to deduce that p263a was the primary contributor to the increased acute toxicity as reported in previous studies razavi et al 2009 kong et al 2018 the acute toxicity in uv pds cl was negligible compared to that in uv pds probably due to the lower acute toxicity of the products generated from ho and rcs via hydroxylation and co bond cleavage respectively to further evaluate the specific toxicity of the transformation products the ecotoxicity of the specific product was calculated using a toxicity estimation software tool test software text s4 and table s3 the lethal concentration 50 lc50 values of p263a to daphnia magna and fathead minnow were the lowest at 2 79 and 0 61 respectively indicating that p263a shows much higher ecotoxicity than the other products this result further indicates that the highest acute toxicity to vibrio fischeri after uv treatment was induced by p263a furthermore the lower acute toxicity in uv pds cl was likely ascribed to decreased levels of the aldehyde products p263b and p279a fig 2 through oxidation by ho to form carboxylic products or reaction with rcs to cleave the co bond specifically the lc50 values of the aldehyde products of p263b and p279a to daphnia magna fathead minnow were 5 26 2 47 and 2 23 1 12 respectively while those of the carboxylic product of p279b were higher at 38 69 8 13 additionally the products formed by reaction with rcs through co bond cleavage such as p135a p151a b and p137a b especially the chain product of p145 showed much lower ecotoxicity to daphnia magna and fathead minnow table s3 these observations further indicate that chloride can decrease solution toxicity in uv pds during the transformation of gfrz by converting so4 to ho and rcs 4 conclusions this study investigated the radical mechanisms and product formation during the degradation of gfrz by the uv pds process in the presence of different chloride concentrations chloride at 0 10 mm showed negligible effects on the k of gfrz by uv pds which changed slightly from 1 0 10 3 s 1 to 9 3 10 4 s 1 the increase in ho and rcs levels compensated for the decreased contribution of so4 to gfrz degradation chloride enhanced ho formation in the low concentration range 1 mm where so4 and or ho were the primary radicals for gfrz degradation however chloride concentrations higher than 1 mm significantly enhanced the formation of rcs mainly cl2 and slightly inhibited ho formation making rcs and ho the dominant radicals the roles of ho so4 and rcs in product formation during gfrz degradation by uv pds cl were elucidated the mechanisms of gfrz oxidation by so4 and rcs involved hydrogen abstraction and or electron transfer while that by ho involved its addition to aromatic rings both so4 and rcs were involved in the aldehylation and demethylation of gfrz and rcs enhanced co bond cleavage tocl was undetectable in the uv pds cl system in addition the oxidation of aldehydes by ho to form carboxylic products was faster than that by rcs and so4 the acute toxicity of gfrz to vibrio fischeri was negligible after uv pds cl treatment and the inhibition percentage was only 1 much lower than that in the uv pds 13 and uv alone 53 systems at 30 min these inhibition results indicate that the radicals showed a positive effect on reducing the solution toxicity especially due to the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic groups by ho and due to co bond cleavage by rcs uv photolysis of gfrz inevitably occurs in natural environments under solar irradiation significantly increasing acute toxicity however the application of uv pds in the removal of gfrz can substantially decrease acute toxicity indicating the potential of uv pds for treating gfrz contaminated waters although the presence of chloride has a negligible effect on the overall degradation rate of gfrz by uv pds it impacts the transformation products of gfrz and the toxicity of the treated solution since chloride is ubiquitous in natural waters future research is warranted to further explore the effect of chloride during applications of so4 based

16439,spread of antibiotic resistant genes args is a global public safety issue and inhibition their transfer is imperative in this study a novel strategy using environmental free radical exposure was developed to inhibit conjugative transfer of args rp4 plasmid in aqueous solutions long time free radical oh 1o2 and o2 exposure significantly suppressed the conjugative transfer frequency of args between escherichia coli e coli strains and oh was more likely to attack arg thereby inhibiting the conjugate transfer frequency compared to 1o2 and o2 compared with the control the conjugative transfer frequency significantly decreased from 4 08 10 5 to 1 2 10 8 after 10 min free radical exposure confirming that the transfer and proliferation of args were well inhibited correspondingly the number of transconjugant significantly decreased by 61 7 after 10 min free radical exposure significant reductions in reactive oxygen species levels ros content and enzyme levels and dna damage induced responses in the donor strains were observed after 10 min free radical exposure concurrently intercellular contact was also weakened via inhibiting the synthesis of polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances moreover the expressions of plasmid transfer genes were down regulated after 10 min exposure due to the shortage of adenosine triphosphate supply this study firstly disclosed the underneath mechanisms for depressing args transfer and dissemination via environmental free radical exposure graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords environmental free radical antibiotic resistance genes conjugative transfer gene expressions 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is one of the major public health challenges around the world because of the risks to both human health and environmental ecosystem pruden et al 2006 jiang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 slipko et al 2019 young et al 2019 antibiotic resistant bacteria arb can be conferred by antibiotic resistance genes args which enable microorganisms to withstand the antibacterial or bactericidal effects of antibiotics woodford and ellington 2007 brigulla and wackernagel 2010 ma et al 2017 ni et al 2020 proliferation of args is driven by vertical and horizontal gene transfers hgt that are closely related to the types of bacteria host and mobilome respectively woodford and ellington 2007 forsberg et al 2014 ma et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2020a hgt is mainly realized within or between cells such as conjugative transfer by mges plasmids integrons and transposons transformation of naked dna and transduction by bacteriophages zhu et al 2017 hu et al 2017 gao et al 2017 among them plasmid mediated conjugation can transfer args between bacterial species and even between bacteria and organisms young et al 2019 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2020b bacterial conjugation promotes the hgt of genetic materials which is accomplished by direct physical intercellular contact through a pilin bridge generated by the donor cells ochman et al 2000 therefore conjugative transfer is particularly important in the dissemination of args in water system besides antibiotics a variety of environmental stimuli such as silver nanoparticles carbon dioxide artificial sweeteners and disinfection by products were also evidenced to promote the proliferation of args in different mechanisms zhang et al 2017 liao et al 2019a lu et al 2020 yu et al 2021 the potential ecological risks caused by args persists if the hrt is not well controlled zhang et al 2019 2020 on the other hand the conjugative transfer of args could be inhibited by some technologies and environmental factors huang et al 2019 reported that the corresponding transconjugant numbers and transfer frequency of args were reduced by free nitrous acid in a dose dependent manner guo et al 2015 found that low levels of ultraviolet chlorine treatment stimulated the conjugative transfer of args while high levels did not exhibit promotion effect by killing the bacteria arising from its strong oxidation capacity these discrepant results indicated that the transfer of args is distinctly dependent on the properties and dosages of external environmental factors and the mechanisms remain unclear environmental free radicals are widely present in various environmental media including soil water and atmospheric environment environmental free radical oxidation has received much attention in arb inactivation and args elimination due to the advantages of high efficiency liao et al 2018 2019b yang et al 2020 previous study demonstrated that free radical oxidation could inactivate multidrug resistance staphylococcus and altered resistance gene expression and enzyme activity park et al 2015 yang et al 2020 and liao et al 2019b reported that free radical oxidation inactivated arb and removed the args these previous studies mainly focused on arb inactivation and args removal performance liao et al 2019b yang et al 2020 but did not pay attention to the conjugative transfer of args under different doses of free radical exposure the dose effect relationship related to transfer mechanisms is still unknown in this study the inhibition mechanisms on conjugative transfer of args by a rp4 plasmid with two different escherichia coli e coli strains were investigated under different dosages of environmental free radical exposure the conjugative transfer frequency of rp4 plasmid was firstly evaluated in terms of free radical exposure time and intensity the conjugative transfer of plasmids and randomly selected transconjugants were subjected to the minimal inhibited concentration mic and gel electrophoresis subsequently conjugative transfer channels in the donor strains including intracellular reactive oxygen species ros dna damage induced response sos cell membrane permeability and expression of conjugate related genes were explored finally transcriptome data and gene expression patterns were performed to reveal the potential mechanisms at molecular levels this is the first study to disclose the underneath mechanisms for inhibiting args transfer and dissemination via different dose environmental free radical exposure 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials e coli dh5a was selected as the donor strain and it was resistant to some antibiotics including ampicillin apr tetracycline tcr and kanamycin kmr e coli etec was selected as the recipient strain and it has a higher streptomycin str resistance 500 mg l 1 these e coli strains were bought from beijing baiou bowei biotechnology co ltd china briefly for the preparation of e coli suspension 10 Œºl of glycerol bacteria 80 c was cultured in 100 ml of sterile lysogeny broth lb medium at 37 c with shaking at 120 rpm until growth approached the logarithmic phase after cultivated to logarithmic phase the ar e coli dh5a strains were obtained by centrifuging the culture at 4000 rpm for 10 min and were resuspended in 500 ml sterile pbs to obtain ar e coli dh5a working solutions 108 cfu ml 1 other chemicals were analytical grade and obtained from shanghai aladdin industrial corporation china unless otherwise stated all chemicals were dissolved in the sterile phosphate buffer pbs 2 2 environmental free radical exposure experiments environmental free radicals were produced through a diaphragm discharge plasma oxidation system as shown in fig s1 the detailed introduction on this reaction system is illustrated in text s1 500 ml of 108 cfu ml 1 e coli solution donor e coli dh5a was treated in a batch experiment the dosage of the free radicals was adjusted through changing the voltage of the reaction system and it was 11 kv unless otherwise stated e coli treatment experiments were performed at the logarithmic phase after the free radical exposure the tetracycline resistance genes tetc and tetw and the inti1 gene in total genomic dna isolated from ar e coli strains were quantified using qpcr the antibiotic resistance prevalence of the donor recipient and transconjugants strains was assessed using a broth microdilution method which was evaluated via the minimum inhibitory concentrations mics the mic values were determined by labeling 96 well sterile microtiter trays with wells containing dilutions of each antibiotic giannakis et al 2018 wang et al 2019a as depicted in text s2 the final concentration ranges of tcr apr kmr and str were 1 256 mg l 1 1 512 mg l 1 1 512 mg l 1 and 1 1024 mg l 1 respectively 2 3 transconjugant identification the determination of transconjugants was conducted according to a previous publication guo et al 2015 the donor e coli dh5a has significant resistance to apr tcr and kmr but was sensitive to str the recipient e coli etec was sensitive to apr tcr and kmr a conjugative transfer model was established and the detailed process is illustrated in text s3 for free radical exposure the donor cells were mixed with the recipient cells e coli etec at a ratio of 1 1 v v total 4 ml for different times 6 24 h the mixture was shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h at 37 c to optimize the conjugative transfer models single factor experiments were conducted to optimize the donor recipient ratios 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 1 7 and mating times 4 6 16 18 and 24 h and the results are shown in fig s2 the conjugative transfer frequency was calculated as follows guo et al 2015 1 conjugative transfer frequency transfromant cells cfu m l 1 total recipient cells cfu m l 1 in addition conjugation experiments were conducted to determine whether free radical exposure could change the content of intracellular ros lu et al 2018 herein 100 mm thiourea as ros scavenger was added to the intergenerational mating system after the free radical exposure treatment 2 4 rna sequencing and bioinformatics analysis after free radical exposure the bacterial colonies before and after the conjugation mating were taken and the strains were harvested by centrifugation and preserved under 80 c biological triplicate rna samples were then submitted to sangon biotech shanghai co ltd for strand specific cdna library construction and illumina paired end sequencing for each gene expression level was measured by feature counts and weighted correlation network analysis wgcna besides differences in rna expressions were analyzed by deseq2 degseq and edger 2 5 other analytical methods the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany was used to examine the formation of short life active species li et al 2021 the sanprep column rapid plasmid micro extraction kit sangon biotech china was used to extract plasmids from selected donors acceptors and transducers following extraction agarose gel electrophoresis was applied to verify the presence of plasmids in each sample ros enzyme assay kit solarbio science technology co ltd china was used to determine ros concentration lu et al 2018 enzymatic assays were conducted to determine catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod activities wang et al 2019b malondialdehyde mda assay kit based on the thiobarbituric acid method was used to examine the lipid peroxidation scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi japan was used to observe the cell integrity these above analyzes are illustrated in text s4 polysaccharide and protein content were determined by phenol sulfuric acid method glucose as a standard and a micro bca protein assay kit beyotime china respectively nakamura et al 2013 zuriaga agust√≠ et al 2013 the bacterial adhesion was quantified according to the protocol of yu et al 2020 text s5 the free radicals were monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany li et al 2021 and the test conditions were as follows microwave frequency 9 825 ghz x band center field 3498 g microwave power 0 5024 mw modulation frequency 1 0 g sweep width 1 g time constant 0 01 ms sweep time 30 0 s and 3 scans the cellular adenosine triphosphate atp was determined by using solarbio atp assay kit solarbio science technology co ltd china yu et al 2020 the zeta potential and hydrodynamic size of suspended cells were measured using a 108 cfu ml 1 zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern uk wilson et al 2001 all experiments were repeated at least three times and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation statistical analysis was carried out using spss software 3 results and discussion 3 1 inhibition of conjugative transfer frequency prior to conjugative transfer free radicals production was explored using epr the typical epr signals of the free radicals are depicted in fig 1 a c obviously oh 1o2 and o2 were detected and their epr intensities decreased in the presence of the args furthermore the relative contents of oh 1o2 and o2 were linear with the applied voltage fig 1d and thus the contents of these free radicals were adjusted by changing the applied voltage in the later experiments resistance genes are commonly associated with mobile genetic elements the mobilome and can be transferred between distantly related bacteria corresponding to different phyla wellington et al 2013 fig 2 a shows the changes in args concentration with the free radical exposure time all args decreased after the free radical exposure with the removal efficiency higher than 90 the args including tetc tetw and integron gene inti1 decreased by 1 3log 2 4log and 4 4log after 10 min free radical exposure at 11 kv p 0 05 respectively these results indicated that the free radical exposure could effectively destroy the args of the donor ar e coli since the numbers of copies deoxynucleotide base and sequences of the genes in the cells were different and ros would attack different sites of the genes thus different removal efficiencies were observed for different genes guo et al 2018 ma et al 2019 in addition the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 from e coli dh5a to e coli etec after the free radical exposure is depicted in fig 2b compared with the control the conjugative transfer frequency increased from 4 08 10 5 to 8 25 10 5 within 2 min free radical exposure while it greatly decreased to 1 2 10 8 after 10 min exposure at 11 kv p 0 05 correspondingly the number of transconjugant significantly decreased by 61 7 after 10 min exposure p 0 05 as shown in fig 2c the transconjugant was considered to be an indicator of successful conjugative transfer of the plasmid from the donor bacteria to the recipient bacteria huang et al 2019 these results demonstrated that appropriate free radical exposure significantly inhibited the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 from donor strains to recipient strains fig 2d depicts the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 at different free radical dosages applied voltages compared with the control the conjugative transfer frequency gradually decreased as the voltage increased after 10 min exposure the conjugative transfer frequency decreased from initial 4 08 10 5 to 7 06 10 6 at 7 kv and it further decreased to 1 42 10 8 at 11 kv p 0 05 usually relatively high bacterial density favors conjugative transfer and the hgt of args qiu et al 2012 su et al 2019 it is obvious that both the donor and recipient e coli concentrations gradually decreased as the free radical exposure time increased fig s3 this disfavored the hgt of args among the donor and recipient bacteria huang et al 2019 reported that free nitrous acid significantly inhibited the binding and transfer of plasmid rp4 by eliminating the initial cell densities of the donor and recipient strains to explore the contributions of oh 1o2 and o2 on conjugate transfer frequency mannitol l histidine l his and superoxide dismutase sod were used as scavengers of oh 1o2 and o2 during the free radical exposure process respectively as shown in fig 2e the conjugate transfer frequency was significantly improved with the addition of these three scavengers p 0 05 the conjugate transfer frequency in the presence of mannitol l his and sod was ranked as sod l his mannitol indicating that oh was more likely to attack args thereby inhibiting the conjugate transfer frequency compared to 1o2 and o2 li et al 2021 found that the free radicals including oh 1o2 and o2 could attack the bacterial structures cell membrane protein and dna by various pathways which probably inhibited the args conjugative transfer frequency in order to further prove the inhibition of conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 randomly selected transconjugants were subjected to the minimal inhibited concentration mic against antibiotics and gel electrophoresis of plasmids giannakis et al 2018 reported that the mic could determine whether the bacteria was still resistant to their corresponding antibiotics after inactivation as shown in table s1 the transconjugant was highly resistant to the four typical antibiotics tcr apr kmr and str with mics of 256 512 512 and 1024 mg l 1 respectively after 10 min free radical exposure the mics of the transconjugant for tcr apr kmr and str all decreased the gel electrophoresis images of plasmids extracted from the donor recipient and transconjugants are shown in fig s4 obviously the donor and all transconjugant strains carried the rp4 plasmid but the recipient strains did not in addition the transconjugants showed a bright band prior to plasma treatment while the bright band became weaker after 10 min free radical exposure this suggested that the plasmid concentration decreased during the free radical exposure process compared with the control group after 10 min free radical exposure there were 1839 differentially transcribed genes and the expression of 1168 genes was significantly down regulated accounting for 63 5 of the total transcribed genes fig 3 a as shown in fig 3b the main gene ontology go enrichment analysis indicated that the down regulated genes mainly involved in the biological processes response to stimulus metabolic process and cellular process cellular components cell part cell and protein containing complex and molecular functions transporter activity catalytic activity and binding these results indicated that the free radical exposure distinctly affected the metabolism of the donor e coli which then affected the sos response membrane permeability intercellular adhesion and energy supply in the cell lu et al 2018 and the conjugative transfer would be regulated by these responses yu et al 2020 3 2 sos responses sos response ros content and enzyme levels is one of the key signals of conjugative transfer which affects the horizontal transfer of args liao et al 2019a excessive accumulation of ros may increase membrane permeability and induce sos response promoting the horizontal transfer of args maiques et al 2006 liao et al 2019a wang et al 2019a antioxidant enzymes sod and cat function to scavenge ros yu et al 2020 antioxidant stress caused by ros is well known to influence the conjugative transfer of args beaber et al 2004 dolezalova and lukes 2015 the antioxidant stress and sos response induced by the free radical exposure are depicted in fig 4 obviously the intracellular ros level and antioxidant enzyme sod and cat activities in the donor e coli strains after 10 min free radical exposure were significantly lower than those of control p 0 05 fig 4a b yu et al 2020 reported that low dose ceo2 nanoparticles inhibited the conjugative transfer via elimination of excessive intracellular ros wang et al 2019 also found that excessive accumulation of ros damaged the cell membrane thus made them more permeable to the transfer of genetic materials and promoted the conjugative transfer furthermore obvious inhibition effects on the conjugative transfer frequency were observed in the presence of ros scavenger thiourea as shown in fig 4c these findings magnified that decreased intracellular ros production indeed inhibited conjugative transfer generally intracellular ros such as oh 1o2 and o2 can regulate intracellular redox homeostasis chen et al 2010 wang et al 2019b and they diffuse via cell wall leading to damages to the cell membrane proteins and dna curtin et al 2002 lu et al 2020 enhanced sos response can induce conjugative transfer via up regulating gene expression for plasmid transfer yu et al 2020 the gene expressions related to ros production and sos response are shown in fig 4d compared with the control group the genes related to ros production oxyr gor sufb sufa sufc sufd and katg and sos response ompn ompl recr reco recn recb reca sula lexa dini dind dinb and dinf of the donor e coli were significantly up regulated after 2 min free radical exposure but down regulated after 10 min exposure before and after the conjugation mating therefore the long time free radical exposure inhibited the conjugative transfer of args partially due to the decreased antioxidant stress and the attenuation of the sos response curtin et al 2002 lu et al 2020 pearson correlation analysis showed that there were significantly positive correlations among the conjugative transfer frequency intracellular ros level and antioxidant enzyme activities of the donor strains fig s5 suggesting that the inhibition of conjugative transfer of args by the free radical exposure was associated with the decreased antioxidant stress in the donor e coli 3 3 cell membrane permeability the bacterial outer membrane was considered as an obstacle for conjugative transfer of args koebnik et al 2000 the cell membrane integrity was examined via sem and mda analysis as shown in fig 5 compared with the control wrinkled and rough morphology appeared after 2 min free radical exposure and the cell member was completely ruptured after 10 min free radical exposure treatment fig 5a c mda was a typical product of cell membrane lipid oxidation and there was a positive correlation between the content of mda and cell destruction ji et al 2018 the mda concentration gradually increased with the free radical exposure treatment fig 5d suggesting that the cell membrane of the donor e coli was destroyed thus leading to inactivation of the donor e coli furthermore the transcription levels of the genes related to the cell membrane yfat yfaq yfaa yiaw yiam yial yiaa yeby yebs yoho and yohc and osmotic stress osmb osme osmy and osmf were all up regulated before and after the conjugation mating after 10 min free radical exposure fig 5e these results demonstrated that the cell membrane permeability of the donor e coli increased as a result of the free radical exposure this should have facilitated arg conjugative transfer however there was a significant negative correlation between the cell membrane permeability of the donor e coli and the conjugative transfer of args fig s5 this might be explained by the significant decreases in the numbers of donor e coli reduced 5 4log and plasmids concentration figs s3 and s4 3 4 intercellular contact active intercellular contact between the donor and recipient strains is one of the prerequisites for conjugative transfer of args extracellular polymeric substances eps composed of proteins polysaccharides dna and lipids were important for adhesion and communication between cells flemming and wingender 2010 more et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 a the ratio of protein to polysaccharide pn ps in the donor e coli cells increased after 2 min free radical exposure and then dramatically decreased after 10 min exposure following similar variation trend of conjugative transfer frequency similarly the adhesion between bacteria also decreased by 57 4 after 10 min exposure p 0 05 fig 6a it was reported that eps compositions significantly affected the cell adhesion by changing the hydrophobicity and cell surface charges tsuneda et al 2003 the findings in this study indicated that the free radical exposure mediated the intercellular interactions by changing the contents of extracellular polysaccharides and proteins in addition eps could function as a barrier for bacteria in response to inactivation joshi et al 2012 thus the reduction of eps caused by the free radical exposure might lead to the destruction of the stress defense system which was evidenced by the distinctly reduced sod and cat activities yu et al 2020 besides ros acted as a secondary signal messenger for transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolism and a low ros level led to a decrease in the amount of eps perry et al 2005 xi et al 2017 han et al 2019 han et al 2019 reported that ros regulated bacterial and algal eps production via activating genes expression involved in metabolic processes the changes in the gene expressions related to membrane protein and polysaccharide export are shown in fig 6b before and after the conjugation mating of the e coli strains the cell membrane proteins related genes secm secf secg seca yajl yajg tate tatd tatb and tata were up regulated after 2 min free radical exposure but down regulated after 10 min exposure the same trends were also observed for the polysaccharide export encoding genes therefore the long time free radical exposure mediated the interactions between cells by reducing the content of extracellular polysaccharides and protein related gene expression the negative charges on the cell surface could cause repulsion between cells and make the intracellular contact difficult yu et al 2020 the zeta potentials and hydrodynamic diameter of the donor e coli cells significantly decreased after 10 min free radical exposure p 0 05 fig 6c d these findings further evidence that the free radical exposure reduced the cell aggregation ability terada et al 2012 to sum up changes in the eps compositions may be a prominent factor influencing cell surface properties in the conjugative transfer model there were significantly positive correlations among the conjugative transfer frequency eps content cell adhesion zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter fig s5 which further proved that the decrease in the intercellular contact induced by the free radical exposure made contributions to the depressed conjugative transfer of args 3 5 energy driving force for conjugative transfer atp can provide energy for conjugative transfer of args and induces the morphogenesis of conjugation machinery yu et al 2020 chen et al 2005 reported that atp energy was needed for conjugative dna transfer the changes in the atp level with the free radical exposure time are depicted in fig 7 a the atp level increased after 2 min free radical exposure which was consistent with the increased conjugative transfer in fig 2b d after 10 min exposure the atp level decreased approximately 70 8 which corresponded to a rapid decrease in the conjugative transfer frequency willis and whitfield 2013 reported that the production of atp and eps were mutually dependent thus the reduction of atp level might inhibit the production of eps fig 7a thereby reducing the resistance of bacteria in addition to its function as an energy currency within the cells atp could also enhance the cell s resistance to environmental stress which was essential for atp biosynthesis and the signal transduction pathway of defense yu et al 2020 nitrite could be produced due to nitrogen ionization and its content increased during the treatment process as shown in fig s6 the no2 could combine with proteins to form complexes which then prevented the degradation of acetone into atp cunningham bussel et al 2013 previous studies also reported that no2 affected the stability of the energy charge and electron transport chains and thus affecting atp production and gene expression komirishetty et al 2017 aryannejad et al 2021 it is worth noting that genes related to atp production atpa atpb and atpf were significantly down regulated before and after the conjugation mating 10 min exposure fig 7b suggesting that the long time free radical exposure reduced the atp production by depressing the expression of the related genes e coli combines aerobic respiratory catabolism with atp synthesis through a proton powered primary generator borisov et al 2011 electron transport chain etc is a system that transfers electrons from nadh or fadh2 to oxygen and it is the main way for intracellular atp production fig 7c zhao et al 2021 reported that etc was composed of transmembrane protein complexes i iv as well as the electron transporters ubiquinone and cytochrome c the complex i nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase was the largest multi subunit enzyme complex in etc which could transfer electrons from nadh to ubiquinone zhao et al 2021 the complex i was also considered to be the main sites of ros production in mitochondria kowaltowski et al 2009 correspondingly the ros level increased after 2 min free radical exposure and then dropped fig 4a complex ii succinate dehydrogenase was a component of etc and it is involved in the metabolic process of cells additionally complex i related genes nuol nuom nuof nuog and nuoh and complex ii related genes sdhd sdhc sdha frdd frdc frdb and frda were down regulated before and after the conjugation mating 10 min free radical exposure fig 7b the expression levels of complex iv related genes transfer electrons to oxygen were also significantly down regulated after 10 min exposure the dysfunction of complexes i ii and iv implied that less electrons and protons were available for etc ultimately leading to low oxygen consumption and atp synthesis in summary change in the atp level induced by the free radical exposure was probably an important factor influencing conjugative transfer there was a significant correlation between atp and conjugative transfer frequency fig s5 further proving that the decrease in atp induced by the free radical exposure affected the energy driving force for conjugative transfer of args 3 6 expression of conjugation genes in rp4 plasmid during the process of conjugative transfer rp4 plasmid undergoes a continuous processes of replication distribution and conjugation and a series of coding genes are used to regulate conjugative transfer qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2019a the global regulator genes kora and korb conjugative transfer transcription regulator genes trba traf and trfap are the genes on the rp4 plasmid that are important for the continuous conjugation process liao et al 2019a yu et al 2020 as shown in fig 8 the expressions of kora korb trba traf and trfap increased after 2 min free radical exposure before and after the conjugation mating however they were down regulated after 10 min exposure these results proved that long time free radical exposure inhibited the conjugation activity of the rp4 plasmid in addition the pilin regulator genes were the first step in the processes of conjugative transfer and pilin bridge could transfer the plasmid from the donor strains to the recipient strains qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2019a chen et al 2005 found that the mating pair formation system was formed by the pilin regulator genes on the rp4 plasmid such as trag before and after the conjugation mating the mrna expression levels of pilin regulator genes trag were up regulated after 2 min free radical exposure and then down regulated after 10 min exposure fig 8 therefore it could be deduced that the long time free radical exposure inhibited the conjugative transfer by inducing decreased expression of the pilin production genes and by altering expression of the conjugative regulators 4 conclusion the potential effects of environmental free radicals on conjugative transfer of args were explored obvious suppression on the conjugative transfer frequency of args between e coli strains was realized after free radicals exposure with appropriate doses free radicals including oh 1o2 and o2 all contributed to the inhibition effects oh was more likely to attack args thereby inhibiting the conjugate transfer frequency compared to 1o2 and o2 analysis on intracellular ros sos response intercellular contact and energy driving force demonstrated that the expression of sos response genes cell membrane permeability repair genes eps related genes atp synthesis genes and conjugation related genes were depressed after long time free radical exposure these changes finally resulted in inhibition of conjugative transfer of args this study disclosed the underneath mechanisms for depressing args transfer via environmental free radical exposure supporting

16439,spread of antibiotic resistant genes args is a global public safety issue and inhibition their transfer is imperative in this study a novel strategy using environmental free radical exposure was developed to inhibit conjugative transfer of args rp4 plasmid in aqueous solutions long time free radical oh 1o2 and o2 exposure significantly suppressed the conjugative transfer frequency of args between escherichia coli e coli strains and oh was more likely to attack arg thereby inhibiting the conjugate transfer frequency compared to 1o2 and o2 compared with the control the conjugative transfer frequency significantly decreased from 4 08 10 5 to 1 2 10 8 after 10 min free radical exposure confirming that the transfer and proliferation of args were well inhibited correspondingly the number of transconjugant significantly decreased by 61 7 after 10 min free radical exposure significant reductions in reactive oxygen species levels ros content and enzyme levels and dna damage induced responses in the donor strains were observed after 10 min free radical exposure concurrently intercellular contact was also weakened via inhibiting the synthesis of polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances moreover the expressions of plasmid transfer genes were down regulated after 10 min exposure due to the shortage of adenosine triphosphate supply this study firstly disclosed the underneath mechanisms for depressing args transfer and dissemination via environmental free radical exposure graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords environmental free radical antibiotic resistance genes conjugative transfer gene expressions 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is one of the major public health challenges around the world because of the risks to both human health and environmental ecosystem pruden et al 2006 jiang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 slipko et al 2019 young et al 2019 antibiotic resistant bacteria arb can be conferred by antibiotic resistance genes args which enable microorganisms to withstand the antibacterial or bactericidal effects of antibiotics woodford and ellington 2007 brigulla and wackernagel 2010 ma et al 2017 ni et al 2020 proliferation of args is driven by vertical and horizontal gene transfers hgt that are closely related to the types of bacteria host and mobilome respectively woodford and ellington 2007 forsberg et al 2014 ma et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2020a hgt is mainly realized within or between cells such as conjugative transfer by mges plasmids integrons and transposons transformation of naked dna and transduction by bacteriophages zhu et al 2017 hu et al 2017 gao et al 2017 among them plasmid mediated conjugation can transfer args between bacterial species and even between bacteria and organisms young et al 2019 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2020b bacterial conjugation promotes the hgt of genetic materials which is accomplished by direct physical intercellular contact through a pilin bridge generated by the donor cells ochman et al 2000 therefore conjugative transfer is particularly important in the dissemination of args in water system besides antibiotics a variety of environmental stimuli such as silver nanoparticles carbon dioxide artificial sweeteners and disinfection by products were also evidenced to promote the proliferation of args in different mechanisms zhang et al 2017 liao et al 2019a lu et al 2020 yu et al 2021 the potential ecological risks caused by args persists if the hrt is not well controlled zhang et al 2019 2020 on the other hand the conjugative transfer of args could be inhibited by some technologies and environmental factors huang et al 2019 reported that the corresponding transconjugant numbers and transfer frequency of args were reduced by free nitrous acid in a dose dependent manner guo et al 2015 found that low levels of ultraviolet chlorine treatment stimulated the conjugative transfer of args while high levels did not exhibit promotion effect by killing the bacteria arising from its strong oxidation capacity these discrepant results indicated that the transfer of args is distinctly dependent on the properties and dosages of external environmental factors and the mechanisms remain unclear environmental free radicals are widely present in various environmental media including soil water and atmospheric environment environmental free radical oxidation has received much attention in arb inactivation and args elimination due to the advantages of high efficiency liao et al 2018 2019b yang et al 2020 previous study demonstrated that free radical oxidation could inactivate multidrug resistance staphylococcus and altered resistance gene expression and enzyme activity park et al 2015 yang et al 2020 and liao et al 2019b reported that free radical oxidation inactivated arb and removed the args these previous studies mainly focused on arb inactivation and args removal performance liao et al 2019b yang et al 2020 but did not pay attention to the conjugative transfer of args under different doses of free radical exposure the dose effect relationship related to transfer mechanisms is still unknown in this study the inhibition mechanisms on conjugative transfer of args by a rp4 plasmid with two different escherichia coli e coli strains were investigated under different dosages of environmental free radical exposure the conjugative transfer frequency of rp4 plasmid was firstly evaluated in terms of free radical exposure time and intensity the conjugative transfer of plasmids and randomly selected transconjugants were subjected to the minimal inhibited concentration mic and gel electrophoresis subsequently conjugative transfer channels in the donor strains including intracellular reactive oxygen species ros dna damage induced response sos cell membrane permeability and expression of conjugate related genes were explored finally transcriptome data and gene expression patterns were performed to reveal the potential mechanisms at molecular levels this is the first study to disclose the underneath mechanisms for inhibiting args transfer and dissemination via different dose environmental free radical exposure 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials e coli dh5a was selected as the donor strain and it was resistant to some antibiotics including ampicillin apr tetracycline tcr and kanamycin kmr e coli etec was selected as the recipient strain and it has a higher streptomycin str resistance 500 mg l 1 these e coli strains were bought from beijing baiou bowei biotechnology co ltd china briefly for the preparation of e coli suspension 10 Œºl of glycerol bacteria 80 c was cultured in 100 ml of sterile lysogeny broth lb medium at 37 c with shaking at 120 rpm until growth approached the logarithmic phase after cultivated to logarithmic phase the ar e coli dh5a strains were obtained by centrifuging the culture at 4000 rpm for 10 min and were resuspended in 500 ml sterile pbs to obtain ar e coli dh5a working solutions 108 cfu ml 1 other chemicals were analytical grade and obtained from shanghai aladdin industrial corporation china unless otherwise stated all chemicals were dissolved in the sterile phosphate buffer pbs 2 2 environmental free radical exposure experiments environmental free radicals were produced through a diaphragm discharge plasma oxidation system as shown in fig s1 the detailed introduction on this reaction system is illustrated in text s1 500 ml of 108 cfu ml 1 e coli solution donor e coli dh5a was treated in a batch experiment the dosage of the free radicals was adjusted through changing the voltage of the reaction system and it was 11 kv unless otherwise stated e coli treatment experiments were performed at the logarithmic phase after the free radical exposure the tetracycline resistance genes tetc and tetw and the inti1 gene in total genomic dna isolated from ar e coli strains were quantified using qpcr the antibiotic resistance prevalence of the donor recipient and transconjugants strains was assessed using a broth microdilution method which was evaluated via the minimum inhibitory concentrations mics the mic values were determined by labeling 96 well sterile microtiter trays with wells containing dilutions of each antibiotic giannakis et al 2018 wang et al 2019a as depicted in text s2 the final concentration ranges of tcr apr kmr and str were 1 256 mg l 1 1 512 mg l 1 1 512 mg l 1 and 1 1024 mg l 1 respectively 2 3 transconjugant identification the determination of transconjugants was conducted according to a previous publication guo et al 2015 the donor e coli dh5a has significant resistance to apr tcr and kmr but was sensitive to str the recipient e coli etec was sensitive to apr tcr and kmr a conjugative transfer model was established and the detailed process is illustrated in text s3 for free radical exposure the donor cells were mixed with the recipient cells e coli etec at a ratio of 1 1 v v total 4 ml for different times 6 24 h the mixture was shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h at 37 c to optimize the conjugative transfer models single factor experiments were conducted to optimize the donor recipient ratios 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 1 7 and mating times 4 6 16 18 and 24 h and the results are shown in fig s2 the conjugative transfer frequency was calculated as follows guo et al 2015 1 conjugative transfer frequency transfromant cells cfu m l 1 total recipient cells cfu m l 1 in addition conjugation experiments were conducted to determine whether free radical exposure could change the content of intracellular ros lu et al 2018 herein 100 mm thiourea as ros scavenger was added to the intergenerational mating system after the free radical exposure treatment 2 4 rna sequencing and bioinformatics analysis after free radical exposure the bacterial colonies before and after the conjugation mating were taken and the strains were harvested by centrifugation and preserved under 80 c biological triplicate rna samples were then submitted to sangon biotech shanghai co ltd for strand specific cdna library construction and illumina paired end sequencing for each gene expression level was measured by feature counts and weighted correlation network analysis wgcna besides differences in rna expressions were analyzed by deseq2 degseq and edger 2 5 other analytical methods the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany was used to examine the formation of short life active species li et al 2021 the sanprep column rapid plasmid micro extraction kit sangon biotech china was used to extract plasmids from selected donors acceptors and transducers following extraction agarose gel electrophoresis was applied to verify the presence of plasmids in each sample ros enzyme assay kit solarbio science technology co ltd china was used to determine ros concentration lu et al 2018 enzymatic assays were conducted to determine catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod activities wang et al 2019b malondialdehyde mda assay kit based on the thiobarbituric acid method was used to examine the lipid peroxidation scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi japan was used to observe the cell integrity these above analyzes are illustrated in text s4 polysaccharide and protein content were determined by phenol sulfuric acid method glucose as a standard and a micro bca protein assay kit beyotime china respectively nakamura et al 2013 zuriaga agust√≠ et al 2013 the bacterial adhesion was quantified according to the protocol of yu et al 2020 text s5 the free radicals were monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany li et al 2021 and the test conditions were as follows microwave frequency 9 825 ghz x band center field 3498 g microwave power 0 5024 mw modulation frequency 1 0 g sweep width 1 g time constant 0 01 ms sweep time 30 0 s and 3 scans the cellular adenosine triphosphate atp was determined by using solarbio atp assay kit solarbio science technology co ltd china yu et al 2020 the zeta potential and hydrodynamic size of suspended cells were measured using a 108 cfu ml 1 zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern uk wilson et al 2001 all experiments were repeated at least three times and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation statistical analysis was carried out using spss software 3 results and discussion 3 1 inhibition of conjugative transfer frequency prior to conjugative transfer free radicals production was explored using epr the typical epr signals of the free radicals are depicted in fig 1 a c obviously oh 1o2 and o2 were detected and their epr intensities decreased in the presence of the args furthermore the relative contents of oh 1o2 and o2 were linear with the applied voltage fig 1d and thus the contents of these free radicals were adjusted by changing the applied voltage in the later experiments resistance genes are commonly associated with mobile genetic elements the mobilome and can be transferred between distantly related bacteria corresponding to different phyla wellington et al 2013 fig 2 a shows the changes in args concentration with the free radical exposure time all args decreased after the free radical exposure with the removal efficiency higher than 90 the args including tetc tetw and integron gene inti1 decreased by 1 3log 2 4log and 4 4log after 10 min free radical exposure at 11 kv p 0 05 respectively these results indicated that the free radical exposure could effectively destroy the args of the donor ar e coli since the numbers of copies deoxynucleotide base and sequences of the genes in the cells were different and ros would attack different sites of the genes thus different removal efficiencies were observed for different genes guo et al 2018 ma et al 2019 in addition the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 from e coli dh5a to e coli etec after the free radical exposure is depicted in fig 2b compared with the control the conjugative transfer frequency increased from 4 08 10 5 to 8 25 10 5 within 2 min free radical exposure while it greatly decreased to 1 2 10 8 after 10 min exposure at 11 kv p 0 05 correspondingly the number of transconjugant significantly decreased by 61 7 after 10 min exposure p 0 05 as shown in fig 2c the transconjugant was considered to be an indicator of successful conjugative transfer of the plasmid from the donor bacteria to the recipient bacteria huang et al 2019 these results demonstrated that appropriate free radical exposure significantly inhibited the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 from donor strains to recipient strains fig 2d depicts the conjugative transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 at different free radical dosages applied voltages compared with the control the conjugative transfer frequency gradually decreased as the voltage increased after 10 min exposure the conjugative transfer frequency decreased from initial 4 08 10 5 to 7 06 10 6 at 7 kv and it further decreased to 1 42 10 8 at 11 kv p 0 05 usually relatively high bacterial density favors conjugative transfer and the hgt of args qiu et al 2012 su et al 2019 it is obvious that both the donor and recipient e coli concentrations gradually decreased as the free radical exposure time increased fig s3 this disfavored the hgt of args among the donor and recipient bacteria huang et al 2019 reported that free nitrous acid significantly inhibited the binding and transfer of plasmid rp4 by eliminating the initial cell densities of the donor and recipient strains to explore the contributions of oh 1o2 and o2 on conjugate transfer frequency mannitol l histidine l his and superoxide dismutase sod were used as scavengers of oh 1o2 and o2 during the free radical exposure process respectively as shown in fig 2e the conjugate transfer frequency was significantly improved with the addition of these three scavengers p 0 05 the conjugate transfer frequency in the presence of mannitol l his and sod was ranked as sod l his mannitol indicating that oh was more likely to attack args thereby inhibiting the conjugate transfer frequency compared to 1o2 and o2 li et al 2021 found that the free radicals including oh 1o2 and o2 could attack the bacterial structures cell membrane protein and dna by various pathways which probably inhibited the args conjugative transfer frequency in order to further prove the inhibition of conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 randomly selected transconjugants were subjected to the minimal inhibited concentration mic against antibiotics and gel electrophoresis of plasmids giannakis et al 2018 reported that the mic could determine whether the bacteria was still resistant to their corresponding antibiotics after inactivation as shown in table s1 the transconjugant was highly resistant to the four typical antibiotics tcr apr kmr and str with mics of 256 512 512 and 1024 mg l 1 respectively after 10 min free radical exposure the mics of the transconjugant for tcr apr kmr and str all decreased the gel electrophoresis images of plasmids extracted from the donor recipient and transconjugants are shown in fig s4 obviously the donor and all transconjugant strains carried the rp4 plasmid but the recipient strains did not in addition the transconjugants showed a bright band prior to plasma treatment while the bright band became weaker after 10 min free radical exposure this suggested that the plasmid concentration decreased during the free radical exposure process compared with the control group after 10 min free radical exposure there were 1839 differentially transcribed genes and the expression of 1168 genes was significantly down regulated accounting for 63 5 of the total transcribed genes fig 3 a as shown in fig 3b the main gene ontology go enrichment analysis indicated that the down regulated genes mainly involved in the biological processes response to stimulus metabolic process and cellular process cellular components cell part cell and protein containing complex and molecular functions transporter activity catalytic activity and binding these results indicated that the free radical exposure distinctly affected the metabolism of the donor e coli which then affected the sos response membrane permeability intercellular adhesion and energy supply in the cell lu et al 2018 and the conjugative transfer would be regulated by these responses yu et al 2020 3 2 sos responses sos response ros content and enzyme levels is one of the key signals of conjugative transfer which affects the horizontal transfer of args liao et al 2019a excessive accumulation of ros may increase membrane permeability and induce sos response promoting the horizontal transfer of args maiques et al 2006 liao et al 2019a wang et al 2019a antioxidant enzymes sod and cat function to scavenge ros yu et al 2020 antioxidant stress caused by ros is well known to influence the conjugative transfer of args beaber et al 2004 dolezalova and lukes 2015 the antioxidant stress and sos response induced by the free radical exposure are depicted in fig 4 obviously the intracellular ros level and antioxidant enzyme sod and cat activities in the donor e coli strains after 10 min free radical exposure were significantly lower than those of control p 0 05 fig 4a b yu et al 2020 reported that low dose ceo2 nanoparticles inhibited the conjugative transfer via elimination of excessive intracellular ros wang et al 2019 also found that excessive accumulation of ros damaged the cell membrane thus made them more permeable to the transfer of genetic materials and promoted the conjugative transfer furthermore obvious inhibition effects on the conjugative transfer frequency were observed in the presence of ros scavenger thiourea as shown in fig 4c these findings magnified that decreased intracellular ros production indeed inhibited conjugative transfer generally intracellular ros such as oh 1o2 and o2 can regulate intracellular redox homeostasis chen et al 2010 wang et al 2019b and they diffuse via cell wall leading to damages to the cell membrane proteins and dna curtin et al 2002 lu et al 2020 enhanced sos response can induce conjugative transfer via up regulating gene expression for plasmid transfer yu et al 2020 the gene expressions related to ros production and sos response are shown in fig 4d compared with the control group the genes related to ros production oxyr gor sufb sufa sufc sufd and katg and sos response ompn ompl recr reco recn recb reca sula lexa dini dind dinb and dinf of the donor e coli were significantly up regulated after 2 min free radical exposure but down regulated after 10 min exposure before and after the conjugation mating therefore the long time free radical exposure inhibited the conjugative transfer of args partially due to the decreased antioxidant stress and the attenuation of the sos response curtin et al 2002 lu et al 2020 pearson correlation analysis showed that there were significantly positive correlations among the conjugative transfer frequency intracellular ros level and antioxidant enzyme activities of the donor strains fig s5 suggesting that the inhibition of conjugative transfer of args by the free radical exposure was associated with the decreased antioxidant stress in the donor e coli 3 3 cell membrane permeability the bacterial outer membrane was considered as an obstacle for conjugative transfer of args koebnik et al 2000 the cell membrane integrity was examined via sem and mda analysis as shown in fig 5 compared with the control wrinkled and rough morphology appeared after 2 min free radical exposure and the cell member was completely ruptured after 10 min free radical exposure treatment fig 5a c mda was a typical product of cell membrane lipid oxidation and there was a positive correlation between the content of mda and cell destruction ji et al 2018 the mda concentration gradually increased with the free radical exposure treatment fig 5d suggesting that the cell membrane of the donor e coli was destroyed thus leading to inactivation of the donor e coli furthermore the transcription levels of the genes related to the cell membrane yfat yfaq yfaa yiaw yiam yial yiaa yeby yebs yoho and yohc and osmotic stress osmb osme osmy and osmf were all up regulated before and after the conjugation mating after 10 min free radical exposure fig 5e these results demonstrated that the cell membrane permeability of the donor e coli increased as a result of the free radical exposure this should have facilitated arg conjugative transfer however there was a significant negative correlation between the cell membrane permeability of the donor e coli and the conjugative transfer of args fig s5 this might be explained by the significant decreases in the numbers of donor e coli reduced 5 4log and plasmids concentration figs s3 and s4 3 4 intercellular contact active intercellular contact between the donor and recipient strains is one of the prerequisites for conjugative transfer of args extracellular polymeric substances eps composed of proteins polysaccharides dna and lipids were important for adhesion and communication between cells flemming and wingender 2010 more et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 a the ratio of protein to polysaccharide pn ps in the donor e coli cells increased after 2 min free radical exposure and then dramatically decreased after 10 min exposure following similar variation trend of conjugative transfer frequency similarly the adhesion between bacteria also decreased by 57 4 after 10 min exposure p 0 05 fig 6a it was reported that eps compositions significantly affected the cell adhesion by changing the hydrophobicity and cell surface charges tsuneda et al 2003 the findings in this study indicated that the free radical exposure mediated the intercellular interactions by changing the contents of extracellular polysaccharides and proteins in addition eps could function as a barrier for bacteria in response to inactivation joshi et al 2012 thus the reduction of eps caused by the free radical exposure might lead to the destruction of the stress defense system which was evidenced by the distinctly reduced sod and cat activities yu et al 2020 besides ros acted as a secondary signal messenger for transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolism and a low ros level led to a decrease in the amount of eps perry et al 2005 xi et al 2017 han et al 2019 han et al 2019 reported that ros regulated bacterial and algal eps production via activating genes expression involved in metabolic processes the changes in the gene expressions related to membrane protein and polysaccharide export are shown in fig 6b before and after the conjugation mating of the e coli strains the cell membrane proteins related genes secm secf secg seca yajl yajg tate tatd tatb and tata were up regulated after 2 min free radical exposure but down regulated after 10 min exposure the same trends were also observed for the polysaccharide export encoding genes therefore the long time free radical exposure mediated the interactions between cells by reducing the content of extracellular polysaccharides and protein related gene expression the negative charges on the cell surface could cause repulsion between cells and make the intracellular contact difficult yu et al 2020 the zeta potentials and hydrodynamic diameter of the donor e coli cells significantly decreased after 10 min free radical exposure p 0 05 fig 6c d these findings further evidence that the free radical exposure reduced the cell aggregation ability terada et al 2012 to sum up changes in the eps compositions may be a prominent factor influencing cell surface properties in the conjugative transfer model there were significantly positive correlations among the conjugative transfer frequency eps content cell adhesion zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter fig s5 which further proved that the decrease in the intercellular contact induced by the free radical exposure made contributions to the depressed conjugative transfer of args 3 5 energy driving force for conjugative transfer atp can provide energy for conjugative transfer of args and induces the morphogenesis of conjugation machinery yu et al 2020 chen et al 2005 reported that atp energy was needed for conjugative dna transfer the changes in the atp level with the free radical exposure time are depicted in fig 7 a the atp level increased after 2 min free radical exposure which was consistent with the increased conjugative transfer in fig 2b d after 10 min exposure the atp level decreased approximately 70 8 which corresponded to a rapid decrease in the conjugative transfer frequency willis and whitfield 2013 reported that the production of atp and eps were mutually dependent thus the reduction of atp level might inhibit the production of eps fig 7a thereby reducing the resistance of bacteria in addition to its function as an energy currency within the cells atp could also enhance the cell s resistance to environmental stress which was essential for atp biosynthesis and the signal transduction pathway of defense yu et al 2020 nitrite could be produced due to nitrogen ionization and its content increased during the treatment process as shown in fig s6 the no2 could combine with proteins to form complexes which then prevented the degradation of acetone into atp cunningham bussel et al 2013 previous studies also reported that no2 affected the stability of the energy charge and electron transport chains and thus affecting atp production and gene expression komirishetty et al 2017 aryannejad et al 2021 it is worth noting that genes related to atp production atpa atpb and atpf were significantly down regulated before and after the conjugation mating 10 min exposure fig 7b suggesting that the long time free radical exposure reduced the atp production by depressing the expression of the related genes e coli combines aerobic respiratory catabolism with atp synthesis through a proton powered primary generator borisov et al 2011 electron transport chain etc is a system that transfers electrons from nadh or fadh2 to oxygen and it is the main way for intracellular atp production fig 7c zhao et al 2021 reported that etc was composed of transmembrane protein complexes i iv as well as the electron transporters ubiquinone and cytochrome c the complex i nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase was the largest multi subunit enzyme complex in etc which could transfer electrons from nadh to ubiquinone zhao et al 2021 the complex i was also considered to be the main sites of ros production in mitochondria kowaltowski et al 2009 correspondingly the ros level increased after 2 min free radical exposure and then dropped fig 4a complex ii succinate dehydrogenase was a component of etc and it is involved in the metabolic process of cells additionally complex i related genes nuol nuom nuof nuog and nuoh and complex ii related genes sdhd sdhc sdha frdd frdc frdb and frda were down regulated before and after the conjugation mating 10 min free radical exposure fig 7b the expression levels of complex iv related genes transfer electrons to oxygen were also significantly down regulated after 10 min exposure the dysfunction of complexes i ii and iv implied that less electrons and protons were available for etc ultimately leading to low oxygen consumption and atp synthesis in summary change in the atp level induced by the free radical exposure was probably an important factor influencing conjugative transfer there was a significant correlation between atp and conjugative transfer frequency fig s5 further proving that the decrease in atp induced by the free radical exposure affected the energy driving force for conjugative transfer of args 3 6 expression of conjugation genes in rp4 plasmid during the process of conjugative transfer rp4 plasmid undergoes a continuous processes of replication distribution and conjugation and a series of coding genes are used to regulate conjugative transfer qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2019a the global regulator genes kora and korb conjugative transfer transcription regulator genes trba traf and trfap are the genes on the rp4 plasmid that are important for the continuous conjugation process liao et al 2019a yu et al 2020 as shown in fig 8 the expressions of kora korb trba traf and trfap increased after 2 min free radical exposure before and after the conjugation mating however they were down regulated after 10 min exposure these results proved that long time free radical exposure inhibited the conjugation activity of the rp4 plasmid in addition the pilin regulator genes were the first step in the processes of conjugative transfer and pilin bridge could transfer the plasmid from the donor strains to the recipient strains qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2019a chen et al 2005 found that the mating pair formation system was formed by the pilin regulator genes on the rp4 plasmid such as trag before and after the conjugation mating the mrna expression levels of pilin regulator genes trag were up regulated after 2 min free radical exposure and then down regulated after 10 min exposure fig 8 therefore it could be deduced that the long time free radical exposure inhibited the conjugative transfer by inducing decreased expression of the pilin production genes and by altering expression of the conjugative regulators 4 conclusion the potential effects of environmental free radicals on conjugative transfer of args were explored obvious suppression on the conjugative transfer frequency of args between e coli strains was realized after free radicals exposure with appropriate doses free radicals including oh 1o2 and o2 all contributed to the inhibition effects oh was more likely to attack args thereby inhibiting the conjugate transfer frequency compared to 1o2 and o2 analysis on intracellular ros sos response intercellular contact and energy driving force demonstrated that the expression of sos response genes cell membrane permeability repair genes eps related genes atp synthesis genes and conjugation related genes were depressed after long time free radical exposure these changes finally resulted in inhibition of conjugative transfer of args this study disclosed the underneath mechanisms for depressing args transfer via environmental free radical exposure supporting
