applied for cereal grown in the kebir rhumel basin algeria the water stress index defined as crop stress index csi and derived by accumulating differences in water supply and demand over time to assess the maximum cumulative deficit the forecasting crop water stress index for cereals was developed here as a way of understanding and hedging risk the csi was forecasted using the appropriate climate predictors as predictors in a non parametric k nearest neighbors k nn approach that issues probabilistic forecasts the accuracy of the csi forecasts in the years 2002 2013 was judged based directional concordance and contingency metrics such as hit miss and false alarm rate the results showed that our forecasts were correct 8 out of 12 times with three misses and just one false alarm these results confirmed that this is a useful approach in investigating irrigation needs finally it was found that this water stress index is a useful tool to estimate water storage and irrigation requirements in the interest of agricultural water resources keywords water stress index large scale climate indices non parametric k nearest neighbors k nn approach kebir rhumel basin data availability the data used in this paper is available upon request of the contact author 1 introduction climate change is one of the most important topics in water resources the influence of climate change inducing increasing of extreme weather events such as droughts reduces the predictability of water availability and creates additional pressure on the already scare water supplies chen et al 2014 gao et al 2018 oki and kanae 2006 prudhomme et al 2014 in many regions in the world climate change is likely to increase water demand while decrease water supplies algeria is one of the countries where the water stress is widely recognized crisis due to the population growth rapid urbanization agricultural growth and industrialization the total annual available water resources in algeria are 19 4 billion m3 with 14 2 billion m3 in the north areas and 5 2 billion m3 in the saharan areas these numbers correspond to an annual per capita water availability of 600 m3 by 2020 indicating that algeria falls into the category of countries with low available water resources taking the threshold of scarcity as an annual per capita water availability of 1000 m3 beckerman 1992 falkenmark and widstrand 1992 irrigated agriculture is considered as the largest user of water resources in algeria accounting for more than 65 of all consumptive use laoubi et al 2009 2012 the water resources currently used for agriculture are estimated at nearly 3 billion m3 kelkouli et al 2011 cereal products occupy an important strategic place in the food system and the national economy during the two periods 2000 2009 and 2010 2017 the area of cereals occupies an average annual of 40 of the total agricultural area the cereal area during the period 2000 2009 is estimated at 3200 930 ha which durum wheat and barley occupy the majority of this area with 74 of the total cereal area during the period 2010 2017 this area reached an average of 3385 560 ha indicating an increase of 6 compared to the previous period 2000 2009 the production of cereals during the period 2010 2017 is estimated at 41 2 million quintals on average indicating an increase of 26 compared to the period 2000 2009 when the production is estimated on average at 32 6 million quintals the production consists mainly of wheat durum and barley which represent 51 and 29 of all cereal production on average 2010 2017 respectively http madrp gov dz agriculture statistiques agricoles one of the major constraints faced by the agricultural sector is the water deficit for irrigation due to the irregular spatio temporal distribution of rainfall and the low remobilization of the water resources despite the increasing risk of droughts affecting the most regions of algeria a few studies have been carried out on drought analysis and all of them used only the standardized precipitation index spi and effective drought index edi to quantitatively measure and evaluate the water stress risk achour et al 2020 djellouli et al 2016 djerbouai and souag gamane 2016 habibi et al 2018 khedimallah et al 2020 lazri et al 2015 meddi et al 2014 mellak et al 2020 however this index used only precipitation and temperature averaged over a specific time window without taking in consideration the demand while water stress indices have mostly considered only available water supply without considering potential drought severity and duration kim et al 2018 reig et al 2013 for water sustainability it is necessary to examine the differences in water supply and demand and their spatio temporal distribution to quantify the dimensions of the water risk in this context the water stress index introduced by devineni et al 2013 and applied here by contrast addresses both current water demand and supply this index is a determinant of water stress faced by the crop and hence of the dependence of the crop yield on water availability therefore the index directly informs of not only crop water stress but water storage requirements to meet the projected supply demand imbalance at desired levels of reliability devineni et al 2013 2015 ravindranath et al 2018 investigating the relations between water stress index and the climate variabilities could enable the development of models that can be used to understand and hence forecast the variability in the water stress in this paper a non parametric k nearest neighbor k nn bootstrapping algorithm as described in lall and sharma 1996 is applied for forecasting of crop water stress index using selecting climate indices also we analyze the forecasts and proposed some ways of interpreting them in a way that can help stakeholders in the agricultural water resource sector in addressing the questions about water storage and irrigation requirements the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area section 3 presents the data and methodologies used while section 4 presents the results obtained a discussion of these results and their implications finally section 5 concludes of the paper 2 study area we provide an application of our general approach to evaluate and forecast the water stress index for cereal grown in the kebir rhumel basin algeria as an application where this basin is considered as one of the most important basins in algeria with a surface area of 8815 km2 it is divided into seven sub basins fig 1 and table 1 also the basin is considered as one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country the cereal crops such as wheat durum and common barley and oats are a major cash crops in the basin and account for at least 75 of the total production there are major dams such as beni haroun and boussiaba existed in the basin with a capacity of 960 and 120 hm3 respectively marouf et al 2019 the climate is semi arid in the southern side and humid in the northern side of the basin mebarki 2005 the average annual temperature is 15 4oc and the average annual rainfall in this basin is around 476 mm with a high inter annual variability fig 2 shows the boxplot of the annual of rainfall and evapotranspiration for sub basins in case of annual rainfall the highest annual rainfall occurred over the sb07 while the lowest annual rainfall occurred over the sb05 for the annual evapotranspiration a higher value was observed in the sub basin sb04 and a lower value was detected in the sub basin sb07 as shown in fig 2 we can see a significant variability of rainfall and evapotranspiration in the kebir rhumel basin which indicates that there is an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the two climate variables in general when the annual rainfall below the long term average the basin has experienced five droughts since 2002 in order to understand more about the droughts we forecast the water stress index which developed here for cereal grown over the period 2002 2013 3 methodology 3 1 data and water stress index monthly rainfall temperature maximum minimum mean and dew point sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity for each sub basin of kebir rhumel from 1974 to 2013 were obtained from the national agency for hydraulic resources anrh and office national of meteorology nom the rainfall data was used to estimate the water supply ws j t for each sub basin the harvested crops data were obtained from management of agricultural services for each sub basin the planting season for cereal crops were taken according to the fao and some local farmers the crop water requirements for different cereal crops were estimated based on fao recommended crop coefficients and reference crop evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated based on the data of maximum temperature minimum temperature mean temperature dew point temperature sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity data we quantify the agricultural water demand awd j t as the estimated total crop water requirement for about four major cereal crops cultivated such as wheat durum wheat common barley and oats we estimate the water use for each cultivated crop based on the estimated crop growth stage and reference crop et o the agricultural water demand awd j t is given as 1 a w d j t m 1 n u m b e r o f c r o p s k c m e t 0 j t where k c m is the crop coefﬁcient for the crop m the renewable water supply ws j t is estimated as 2 w s j t α p j t where p j t is the rainfall for any time t and α j is the factor that determine the usable fraction of rainfall for irrigation the parameter α j can be varied parametrically and regionally based on the information available in this study we selected α j to be 0 7 which is the effective rainfall that the crops can utilize from the total rainfall for location j allen et al 1998 devineni et al 2013 in the current study we developed a modified version of the water stress index introduced by devineni et al 2013 in order to compute the maximum cumulative deficit between the agricultural water demand for cereal crop growth and water supply rainfall the cumulative deficit index is a primary determinant of the water stress faced by the crop and hence of the dependence of the crop yield on water availability the different variants of this approach have been presented in previous studies for quantify the water stress devineni et al 2013 2015 chen et al 2014 etienne et al 2016 ho et al 2016 the water holding capacity of the soil is not include in estimating the deficit because the data are not available the index developed and applied in this work computes the maximum cumulative deficit over a growing season between water requirement for optimal crop growth and the effective rainfall this index focuses on the rainfall distribution within the growing season relative to the crop water demand hence we give this index the name crop stress index csi therefore the sci accounts for the timing of planting different stages of crop growth and the timing and distribution of rainfall in the growing season the basic steps for the computation of the cumulative deficit index are presented below for the j th geographical unit define the following quantities 3 d e f i c i t j t max d e f i c t j t 1 a w d j t w s j t 0 w h e r e d e f i c i t j t 0 0 4 s i i j y max d e f i c i t j t y t 1 n s w h e r e d e f i c i t j t 0 y 0 y 1 n where deficit j t refers to the accumulated deficit for any given year with a crop growth period of n s awd j t to the total agricultural water demand ws j t to the total water supply for geographical location j and time t y refers to a calendar or cropping year and n is the number total of years the maximum cumulative deficit for an n year record is defined as sii jy stress index intra annual the crop stress index csi jy is given as 5 c s i j y s i i j y a p j where ap j is the average annual rainfall for district j 3 2 k nearest neighbor algorithm k nn many researchers have recently started to propose and develop many forecasting methodologies for water management and agricultural planning djerbouai and souag gamane 2016 investigated the drought forecasting using neural networks wavelet neural networks and stochastic models in the algerois basin north algeria they used the artificial neural networks ann and wavelet neural networks wann models to forecast drought using spi as drought quantifying parameter the results were compared with traditional stochastic models arima and sarima models using three performance measures such as nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse rmse and mae it is found that the coupled wann models were the best models for drought forecasting for all spi time series and over lead times varying between 1 and 6 months habibi et al 2018 studied the characterization and prediction of meteorological drought using stochastic models in the semi arid chéliff zahrez basin algeria and found that the asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity aparch approach appeared to be the best way of predicting the return periods of meteorological droughts achour et al 2020 studied the spatio temporal analysis and forecasting of drought based on the standardized precipitation index spi series at different time scales during the period 1960 2010 in the plains of northwestern algeria in their work the multilayer perceptron mlp feed forward network was used to forecast the spi at 2 months lead time at different time scales 3 6 9 and 12 months it was found that the proposed ann based drought forecast model can be conveniently adopted to establish with 2 months ahead adequate irrigation schedules in case of water stress and for optimizing agricultural production despite of a variety of methods to forecast of water stress as demonstrated as above review however none of these directly inform irrigation water requirement for a specific crop due to a water deficit our interest in the present study is to directly address forecasting a measure that can be tuned to a specific crop using historical data and crop models in this context we employed the k nn algorithm here to forecast the crop stress index csi for the period 1974 2013 using the selected set of climate indices as a predictors in this approach we incorporated climate information in the choice of neighbors the steps of the k nn algorithm are as follows let y t represent the vector of csi values for a time t and x t p be a matrix of climate predictors where p is the number of climate predictors selected let use denote the vector of containing the values of each predictor by x i and the current values of the predictors by x c the first step is to compute the individual distance between x c and x i where i 1 to c 1 using mahalanobis distance mahalanobis 1936 unlike a solely physical distance the mahalanobis distance is an extremely useful metric to judge point separations in a metric space based on statistical dissimilarity ravindranath et al 2018 here the mahalanobis distance is calculated in order to determine which neighbors are the nearest to x i sharma and o neill 2002 yates et al 2003 6 d i x c x i t x c x i 1 where t refers to the transpose operation and σ 1 is the inverse of the covariance of the neighbors matrix in the second step after the calculation of the mahalanobis distance for each neighbor the neighbors are ranked in ascending distance order and the corresponding years analog years in which these distances occurred are noted then the nearest k neighbors are chosen from which the successor will be selected in this step we use a popular heuristic suggested in lall and sharma 1996 in which k n n is defined as number of years to estimate the number of nearest neighbors k lall and sharma 1996 note that there is a trade off in choosing k in that a large k leads to increased variability but distorts the reproduction of distributional properties and vice versa for a small k however this heuristic approach has generally performed well in a variety of applications lall and sharma 1996 lee and ouarda 2012 lee et al 2010 rajagopalan and lall 1999 yates et al 2003 in the third step we used the same discrete resampling kernel described in lall and sharma 1996 to resample csi values form the analog years the general form of the discrete resampling kernel k j is given as 7 k j 1 j j 1 k 1 j where j is the rank of each neighbor of x c the neighbor with the smallest distance is assigned the highest weight while the neighbor with the largest distance gets the least weight by computing the cumulative distribution function of corresponding to kernel we generate a value from uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 in order to choose which of the k neighbors is selected the result of the k nn resampling method is a time series for each forecasted year consisting of 1000 realizations the forecast procedure is testing using the leave one out cross validation loocv approach and 28 years of training data 1974 2001 to build forecast distribution for each of the years 2002 2013 at each step the training data were updated to included data from all of the years up to year being cross validated thus we always use only the historical data and update the model each year with the information from the previous year much as a normal user of the forecast system would have to do hence as we move from year to year we update the model observations and predict the future state 3 3 self organizing maps som method self organizing map som is a type of artificial neural network which was applied to nonlinear dimensionality reduction and unsupervised classification kohonen 1982 the som is an effective tool for the visualization of high dimensional data it implements an orderly mapping of a high dimensional distribution onto a regular low dimensional grid usually two dimensional jin et al 2011 nakagawa et al 2020 nguyen et al 2015 the som involves of an input layer and a layer of neurons which are arranged on a hexagonal grid selection of proper initialization and data processing methods is extremely important before applying som vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 proposed that the optimal number of neurons is close to 5 n n is the number of input data the quality of the mapping is usually measured with the quantization error qe and topographic error te park et al 2003 tsai et al 2017 the unified distance matrix u matrix is usually used for visualizing a trained som vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 the clustering of the data either can be manually determined by u matrix or can be automated by a clustering algorithm implemented in the som an alternative method is to apply a k means clustering algorithm to the som output nodes to confirm the subgroups divided by the u matrix this clustering method provides a better understanding about the group formations and reduces noise without loss of information de matos et al 2007 ki et al 2011 löhr et al 2010 tobiszewski et al 2012 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 the davies bouldin index can be used to measure the cluster validity based on the rule that its minimum value determines the optimal number of clusters davies et al 1979 all computations concerning som were performed by som toolbox 2 0 developed by helsinki university of technology from matlab r2016a vesanto et al 2000 3 4 the climate precursors in the present study the main goal is to develop a simple statistical model for predicting the csi for cereal crops in kebir rhumel basin based on the appropriate climate predictors there are only a few studies that demonstrate the influence of the climate variability on the drought in algeria meddi et al 2014 studied the drought in seven algerian plains during the period 1930 2007 and found that the annual precipitation is strongly related to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and north atlantic oscillation nao indices and negatively correlated with el niño southern oscillation enso also they demonstrated that the period of deficit starting from 1975 corresponds to a phase of increasing amo index to reach a positive phase khedimallah et al 2020 analyzed the interannual variability of precipitation and runoff rates and their relationship to the nao climate index using continuous wavelet analyses in the cheliff and medjerda basins their results reveal that the different scales of precipitation and runoff variability seem to be clearly related to the nao with different degrees of correlation hallouz et al 2020 evaluated the dry sequences in the cheliff basin through the analysis of the temporal variability of their frequency and intensity and the identification of climate indices of general atmospheric circulation influencing this variability they analyzed climate indices for five atmospheric circulation modes such as el niño southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao mediterranean oscillation mo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the western mediterranean oscillation wemo and found that the most of the stations are more correlated with the mo and amo climatic indices than the other indices all previous studies are focused only with studying the impact of climate variability using correlation coefficient however none of these used them as a predictors for drought forecasting in order to understand more about the temporal variability of the crop stress index csi in the kebir rhumel basin the relationship between the mean crop stress index csimean and the climate variability is analyzed therefore investigating this relationship could enable the development of forecasting models that can be used to understand and predict the variability in the csimean 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of the water stress index the crop stress index csi described above is computed for each sub basin in the kebir rhumel using the climate records from 1974 to 2013 the crop stress index and the maximum of the crop stress index csimax refers to the highest value of csi in any year are shown in fig 3 we can see that for the year with the worst deﬁcit the sub basin sb07 has csimax less than 1 csimax 1 indicating moderate storage requirements or water stress for this sub basin the average annual rainfall is greater than the magnitude of cumulative deficit or risk while in the case of sb01 sb02 sb03 sb05 and sb06 csimax is greater than 1 csimax 1 indicates that the cumulative deﬁcit is greater than the average annual rainfall therefore the annual rate of consumption in these sub basins is higher than the average utilizable rainfall rates sb02 sb03 sb04 and sb05 have csimax 2 indicating that these sub basins require more than two times the average annual rainfall in storage to meet the stress the rate of consumption is higher than the endogenously available water supply 4 2 spatio temporal distribution of csi in this study we analyze the spatio temporal distribution of the crop stress index based on the self organizing maps som method som provides an objective way to classify csi into different homogenous clusters the som maps were formed using a 10 x 3 hexagonal architecture with a gaussian neighborhood fig 4 and the quantization error qe and the topographic error te were equal to 0 95 and 0 000 respectively indicating that the som was smoothly trained in topology the visualization of the component plane and the components plane ordering of each sub basin in each neuron on the som are showed in figs 4 and 5 the high neuron values relate to maroon shades whilst the lowest one link to dark blue shades thus component planes help to visually identify relationships in terms of correlations between the variables sub basins involved in the analysis we can see clearly that all sub basins except sb07 had a similar pattern of color gradient with the lowest values of csi were located in the upper left corner indicating that there is a strong positive correlation among these six sub basins sb07 showed a different pattern of color gradient with the lowest values were found in the upper right corner of the map in this study a final fine tuning cluster analysis was carried out by k means clustering method in order to select the optimal number of clusters the davies bouldin index dbi davies et al 1979 values based on the k means algorithm were computed and displayed in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 we can observe that the most appropriate number of clusters corresponding to minimum dbi was two once the minimum dbi had been selected the k means clustering method was carried out to obtained the two clusters for fine tuning the pattern classification fig 7 displays the pattern classification map of the two clusters for more quantitative information of each cluster the mean values of csi csimean between the sub basins were calculated and showed in fig 8 and table 2 from the results we can see a clear separation of clusters in which the values of csi decreased from the first cluster cluster 1 to the second cluster cluster 2 indicating that the first cluster is characterized by high values of the csi for all sub basins the first cluster is composed by the following years 1988 1997 from 1999 to 2002 and from 2006 to 2013 14 years and concerns 35 of the total years we can observe that the rate of consumption in these years is much higher csimean 1 5 than the average utilizable rainfall rates while the second cluster is represented by the rest of the years and consists of about 65 of the total years for the years identified in cluster 2 the values of the csimean are ranged from 1 06 to 1 6 indicating that the average water demand is greater than the average renewable water supply 4 3 forecasting of the crop stress index 4 3 1 predictor identification to identify appropriate climate indices that significantly influenced the mean crop stress index csimean we consider sea surface temperature sst conditions during february april fma which can then be used as predictors in the statistical forecast models the sst data were taken from the royal netherlands meteorological institute climate explorer dataset knmi 2020 fig 9 shows the spearman s rank correlation between the csimean and the global sst conditions during fma here spearman rank correlation was applied in order to detect the regions presenting significant correlations at a confidence level of 95 the selected sst regions and their correlation with the csimean at the study area are summarized in the table 3 it is clearly seen that sst grids over enso region niño 12 5os 20os and 110ow 90ow tropical west pacific region twp 20on 20os and 120oe 180oe north atlantic region nat 30on 60on and 40ow 5ow and tropical atlantic region tal 10on eq and 50ow 10ow have a significant influence on the csimean in the kebir rhumel basin at the 95 significance level form the table 3 we observed a significant positive correlation between the csimean and the four regions niño 12 twp nat and tal suggesting that warm conditions in the regions result in above normal csimean or high crop water stress hence using sst information can provide a lead time for predicting the crop stress index for a given cereal crops in the study area for this reason we chose the selected regions to be a candidate predictors in the forecasting model 4 3 2 the k nearest neighbors forecasting model in the current study we applied a non parametric nearest neighbors k nn model to forecast the csimean of the 12 years 2002 2013 for a given cereal crops in the kebir rhumel basin here the csimean is predicted using the k nn model developed based on data from 1979 to 2001 in this application we used the selected climate predictors niño 12 twp nat and tal as a best climate predictors in the forecasting model pairwise boxplots are useful to visually compare the observed and forecasted data if the forecasted data were to reproduce the observed statistics exactly the extents of the median and the whiskers for both observed and forecasted datasets would be identical fig 10 shows the boxplot of forecasted values and observed values of csimean as can be seen form fig 10 it is clearly that the boxplots are similar indicating that the model was able to adequately reproduce the historical values of csimean to compare the observed and the ensemble of forecasted scenarios we show a series of boxplot diagrams depicting the k nn forecast distributions for csimean in the years 2002 2013 fig 11 the box and whiskers shown in fig 11 illustrate the range of possible value of csimean for each year the box shows the range of the forecast values of csimean that are likely to occur at least 25 of the time and at most 75 of the time the solid line in the middle of the box represents the median 50 of the forecasts the uncertainty in the forecast indicated by the spread between the 25 and the 75 and the median indicates a middle value that may be useful to compare with the observed data of csimean the identical directionality and dissimilar directionality proposed by ravindranath et al 2018 are identified the forecast for a given year has identical directionality if both the median of the forecast and the observed csimean data are either above the historical average or below the historical average while the absence of the identical directionality will be called dissimilar directionality the probabilities for the two categories such as above normal and below normal from the forecasting distributions are calculated and used to evaluate the accuracy of the forecast then the interquartile range iqr is calculated in the way to get a sense of the spread and variability in the boxplot distribution the results of the probabilities observed csimean data categories am and bm and iqr values are presented in table 4 form the fig 11 we can observe that the identical directionalities are registered in eight years for the years 2002 2008 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 both the median of the forecast and observed csimean data triangles are above the historical average these years are found in the first cluster where the highest values of the csimean are registered the dissimilar directionalities are observed in the rest of years four years the results of the probabilities from the table 4 columns 2 and 3 showed that the probability above the mean is observed in the most years seven years 58 the forecasts suggest higher probability values 70 for above mean category am during 2002 2004 and 2012 suggesting that these years were likely to see higher than normal cereal water stress however the observed csimean data were placed in the below mean category bm implying the opposite scenario to evaluate the results of the csimean forecasts the hit miss and false alarm for each year were computed the hit has occurred when the identical directionality is observed above mean or below mean if the observed csimean is placed in the above mean category while the forecast is placed in the below mean category then a miss has occurred finally a false alarm occurs if we have the opposite of miss where the forecast is situated above average water stress while the observation shows below average water stress ravindranath et al 2018 table 5 shows the results of the hit miss and false alarm form the table 5 we find that the hit miss and false alarm rate of the k nn forecast of csimean is 8 12 3 12 and 1 12 respectively hence more than 67 hits are registered which indicates a good forecasting procedure for an informative crop water stress index in the study area after getting the results of the csi forecasts the question arises is that how these forecasts can help and facilitate a better decision making as an example the mean value of the crop stress index csimean 1 81 is registered in 2002 which the irrigating water storage equal to 0 862 m3 per m2 and above the average csimean value of 0 719 m3 per m2 for the cereal crops in the case of the absence of any data about the crop stress index we can use the results obtained by the csi forecasting here we can use the median as a plausible estimate for the true csi value in 2002 the median of the csimean forecast equal to 0 843 m3 per m2 for the irrigating water storage in this context we can conclude that the targeted forecasting of the water stress index is potentially very useful to stakeholders and decision makers in relevant sectors 5 conclusion most prior drought indices considered only temperature and precipitation averaged over a specific time window without looking at demand while water stress indices have mostly considered only available water supply without considering potential drought severity and duration the modified version of the water stress index introduced by devineni et al 2013 developed here by contrast addresses both current agricultural water demand and water supply in the current study this water stress index was used to compute the maximum cumulative deficit over time between the monthly water requirement for cereal crop growth and the monthly rainfall in kebir rhumel basin then the forecasting of the crop stress index csi was developed in order to understand more about the water risk the csi was forecasted using the large scale climate indices as predictors in a non parametric k nearest neighbors k nn approach based on the results achieved we observed in this approach a great tendency towards strong and informative forecasts we can conclude that our forecasting approach is potentially very useful in investigating irrigation requirement declaration of competing interest the author declares that he has no conflict of interest acknowledgments i am is very grateful to prof naresh devineni for his helpful comments and suggestions that substantially improved this work i wish to thank the national agency for hydraulic resources anrh and office national of meteorology nom for providing material help and data on which reported analyses are based i would also like to express sincere gratitude to the anonymous reviewers whose comments and suggestions have greatly improved the paper

2014 gao et al 2018 oki and kanae 2006 prudhomme et al 2014 in many regions in the world climate change is likely to increase water demand while decrease water supplies algeria is one of the countries where the water stress is widely recognized crisis due to the population growth rapid urbanization agricultural growth and industrialization the total annual available water resources in algeria are 19 4 billion m3 with 14 2 billion m3 in the north areas and 5 2 billion m3 in the saharan areas these numbers correspond to an annual per capita water availability of 600 m3 by 2020 indicating that

periods 2000 2009 and 2010 2017 the area of cereals occupies an average annual of 40 of the total agricultural area the cereal area during the period 2000 2009 is estimated at 3200 930 ha which durum wheat and barley occupy the majority of this area with 74 of the total cereal area during the period 2010 2017 this area reached an average of 3385 560 ha indicating an increase of 6 compared to the previous period 2000 2009 the production of cereals during the period 2010 2017 is estimated at 41 2 million quintals on average indicating an increase of 26 compared to the period 2000 2009 when the production is estimated on average at 32 6 million quintals the production consists mainly of wheat durum and barley which represent 51 and 29 of all cereal production on average 2010 2017 respectively http madrp gov dz agriculture statistiques agricoles one of the major constraints faced by the agricultural sector is the water deficit for irrigation due to the irregular spatio temporal distribution of rainfall and the low remobilization of the water resources despite the increasing risk of droughts affecting the most regions of algeria a few studies have been carried out on drought analysis and all of them used only the standardized precipitation index spi and effective drought index edi to quantitatively measure and evaluate the water stress risk achour et al 2020 djellouli et al 2016 djerbouai and souag gamane 2016 habibi et al 2018 khedimallah et al 2020 lazri et al 2015 meddi et al 2014 mellak et al 2020 however this index used only precipitation and temperature averaged over a specific time window without taking in consideration the demand while water stress indices have mostly considered only available water supply without considering potential drought severity and duration kim et al 2018 reig et al 2013 for water sustainability it is necessary to examine the differences in water supply and demand and their spatio temporal distribution to quantify the dimensions of the water risk in this context the water stress index introduced by devineni et al 2013 and applied here by contrast addresses both current water demand and supply this index is a determinant of water stress faced by the crop and hence of the dependence of the crop yield on water availability therefore the index directly informs of not only crop water stress but water storage requirements to meet the projected supply demand imbalance at desired levels of reliability devineni et al 2013 2015 ravindranath et al 2018 investigating the relations between water stress index and the climate variabilities could enable the development of models that can be used to understand and hence forecast the variability in the water stress in this paper a non parametric k nearest neighbor k nn bootstrapping algorithm as described in lall and sharma 1996 is applied for forecasting of crop water stress index using selecting climate indices also we analyze the forecasts and proposed some ways of interpreting them in a way that can help stakeholders in the agricultural water resource sector in addressing the questions about water storage and irrigation requirements the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area section 3 presents the data and methodologies used while section 4 presents the results obtained a discussion of these results and their implications finally section 5 concludes of the paper 2 study area we provide an application of our general approach to evaluate and forecast the water stress index for cereal grown in the kebir rhumel basin algeria as an application where this basin is considered as one of the most important basins in algeria with a surface area of 8815 km2 it is divided into seven sub basins fig 1 and table 1 also the basin is considered as one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country the cereal crops such as wheat durum and common barley and oats are a major cash crops in the basin and account for at least 75 of the total production there are major dams such as beni haroun and boussiaba existed in the basin with a capacity of 960 and 120 hm3 respectively marouf et al 2019 the climate is semi arid in the southern side and humid in the northern side of the basin mebarki 2005 the average annual temperature is 15 4oc and the average annual rainfall in this basin is around 476 mm with a high inter annual variability fig 2 shows the boxplot of the annual of rainfall and evapotranspiration for sub basins in case of annual rainfall the highest annual rainfall occurred over the sb07 while the lowest annual rainfall occurred over the sb05 for the annual evapotranspiration a higher value was observed in the sub basin sb04 and a lower value was detected in the sub basin sb07 as shown in fig 2 we can see a significant variability of rainfall and evapotranspiration in the kebir rhumel basin which indicates that there is an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the two climate variables in general when the annual rainfall below the long term average the basin has experienced five droughts since 2002 in order to understand more about the droughts we forecast the water stress index which developed here for cereal grown over the period 2002 2013 3 methodology 3 1 data and water stress index monthly rainfall temperature maximum minimum mean and dew point sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity for each sub basin of kebir rhumel from 1974 to 2013 were obtained from the national agency for hydraulic resources anrh and office national of meteorology nom the rainfall data was used to estimate the water supply ws j t for each sub basin the harvested crops data were obtained from management of agricultural services for each sub basin the planting season for cereal crops were taken according to the fao and some local farmers the crop water requirements for different cereal crops were estimated based on fao recommended crop coefficients and reference crop evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated based on the data of maximum temperature minimum temperature mean temperature dew point temperature sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity data we quantify the agricultural water demand awd j t as the estimated total crop water requirement for about four major cereal crops cultivated such as wheat durum wheat common barley and oats we estimate the water use for each cultivated crop based on the estimated crop growth stage and reference crop et o the agricultural water demand awd j t is given as 1 a w d j t m 1 n u m b e r o f c r o p s k c m e t 0 j t where k c m is the crop coefﬁcient for the crop m the renewable water supply ws j t is estimated as 2 w s j t α p j t where p j t is the rainfall for any time t and α j is the factor that determine the usable fraction of rainfall for irrigation the parameter α j can be varied parametrically and regionally based on the information available in this study we selected α j to be 0 7 which is the effective rainfall that the crops can utilize from the total rainfall for location j allen et al 1998 devineni et al 2013 in the current study we developed a modified version of the water stress index introduced by devineni et al 2013 in order to compute the maximum cumulative deficit between the agricultural water demand for cereal crop growth and water supply rainfall the cumulative deficit index is a primary determinant of the water stress faced by the crop and hence of the dependence of the crop yield on water availability the different variants of this approach have been presented in previous studies for quantify the water stress devineni et al 2013 2015 chen et al 2014 etienne et al 2016 ho et al 2016 the water holding capacity of the soil is not include in estimating the deficit because the data are not available the index developed and applied in this work computes the maximum cumulative deficit over a growing season between water requirement for optimal crop growth and the effective rainfall this index focuses on the rainfall distribution within the growing season relative to the crop water demand hence we give this index the name crop stress index csi therefore the sci accounts for the timing of planting different stages of crop growth and the timing and distribution of rainfall in the growing season the basic steps for the computation of the cumulative deficit index are presented below for the j th geographical unit define the following quantities 3 d e f i c i t j t max d e f i c t j t 1 a w d j t w s j t 0 w h e r e d e f i c i t j t 0 0 4 s i i j y max d e f i c i t j t y t 1 n s w h e r e d e f i c i t j t 0 y 0 y 1 n where deficit j t refers to the accumulated deficit for any given year with a crop growth period of n s awd j t to the total agricultural water demand ws j t to the total water supply for geographical location j and time t y refers to a calendar or cropping year and n is the number total of years the maximum cumulative deficit for an n year record is defined as sii jy stress index intra annual the crop stress index csi jy is given as 5 c s i j y s i i j y a p j where ap j is the average annual rainfall for district j 3 2 k nearest neighbor algorithm k nn many researchers have recently started to propose and develop many forecasting methodologies for water management and agricultural planning djerbouai and souag gamane 2016 investigated the drought forecasting using neural networks wavelet neural networks and stochastic models in the algerois basin north algeria they used the artificial neural networks ann and wavelet neural networks wann models to forecast drought using spi as drought quantifying parameter the results were compared with traditional stochastic models arima and sarima models using three performance measures such as nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse rmse and mae it is found that the coupled wann models were the best models for drought forecasting for all spi time series and over lead times varying between 1 and 6 months habibi et al 2018 studied the characterization and prediction of meteorological drought using stochastic models in the semi arid chéliff zahrez basin algeria and found that the asymmetric power autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity aparch approach appeared to be the best way of predicting the return periods of meteorological droughts achour et al 2020 studied the spatio temporal analysis and forecasting of drought based on the standardized precipitation index spi series at different time scales during the period 1960 2010 in the plains of northwestern algeria in their work the multilayer perceptron mlp feed forward network was used to forecast the spi at 2 months lead time at different time scales 3 6 9 and 12 months it was found that the proposed ann based drought forecast model can be conveniently adopted to establish with 2 months ahead adequate irrigation schedules in case of water stress and for optimizing agricultural production despite of a variety of methods to forecast of water stress as demonstrated as above review however none of these directly inform irrigation water requirement for a specific crop due to a water deficit our interest in the present study is to directly address forecasting a measure that can be tuned to a specific crop using historical data and crop models in this context we employed the k nn algorithm here to forecast the crop stress index csi for the period 1974 2013 using the selected set of climate indices as a predictors in this approach we incorporated climate information in the choice of neighbors the steps of the k nn algorithm are as follows let y t represent the vector of csi values for a time t and x t p be a matrix of climate predictors where p is the number of climate predictors selected let use denote the vector of containing the values of each predictor by x i and the current values of the predictors by x c the first step is to compute the individual distance between x c and x i where i 1 to c 1 using mahalanobis distance mahalanobis 1936 unlike a solely physical distance the mahalanobis distance is an extremely useful metric to judge point separations in a metric space based on statistical dissimilarity ravindranath et al 2018 here the mahalanobis distance is calculated in order to determine which neighbors are the nearest to x i sharma and o neill 2002 yates et al 2003 6 d i x c x i t x c x i 1 where t refers to the transpose operation and σ 1 is the inverse of the covariance of the neighbors matrix in the second step after the calculation of the mahalanobis distance for each neighbor the neighbors are ranked in ascending distance order and the corresponding years analog years in which these distances occurred are noted then the nearest k neighbors are chosen from which the successor will be selected in this step we use a popular heuristic suggested in lall and sharma 1996 in which k n n is defined as number of years to estimate the number of nearest neighbors k lall and sharma 1996 note that there is a trade off in choosing k in that a large k leads to increased variability but distorts the reproduction of distributional properties and vice versa for a small k however this heuristic approach has generally performed well in a variety of applications lall and sharma 1996 lee and ouarda 2012 lee et al 2010 rajagopalan and lall 1999 yates et al 2003 in the third step we used the same discrete resampling kernel described in lall and sharma 1996 to resample csi values form the analog years the general form of the discrete resampling kernel k j is given as 7 k j 1 j j 1 k 1 j where j is the rank of each neighbor of x c the neighbor with the smallest distance is assigned the highest weight while the neighbor with the largest distance gets the least weight by computing the cumulative distribution function of corresponding to kernel we generate a value from uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 in order to choose which of the k neighbors is selected the result of the k nn resampling method is a time series for each forecasted year consisting of 1000 realizations the forecast procedure is testing using the leave one out cross validation loocv approach and 28 years of training data 1974 2001 to build forecast distribution for each of the years 2002 2013 at each step the training data were updated to included data from all of the years up to year being cross validated thus we always use only the historical data and update the model each year with the information from the previous year much as a normal user of the forecast system would have to do hence as we move from year to year we update the model observations and predict the future state 3 3 self organizing maps som method self organizing map som is a type of artificial neural network which was applied to nonlinear dimensionality reduction and unsupervised classification kohonen 1982 the som is an effective tool for the visualization of high dimensional data it implements an orderly mapping of a high dimensional distribution onto a regular low dimensional grid usually two dimensional jin et al 2011 nakagawa et al 2020 nguyen et al 2015 the som involves of an input layer and a layer of neurons which are arranged on a hexagonal grid selection of proper initialization and data processing methods is extremely important before applying som vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 proposed that the optimal number of neurons is close to 5 n n is the number of input data the quality of the mapping is usually measured with the quantization error qe and topographic error te park et al 2003 tsai et al 2017 the unified distance matrix u matrix is usually used for visualizing a trained som vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 the clustering of the data either can be manually determined by u matrix or can be automated by a clustering algorithm implemented in the som an alternative method is to apply a k means clustering algorithm to the som output nodes to confirm the subgroups divided by the u matrix this clustering method provides a better understanding about the group formations and reduces noise without loss of information de matos et al 2007 ki et al 2011 löhr et al 2010 tobiszewski et al 2012 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 the davies bouldin index can be used to measure the cluster validity based on the rule that its minimum value determines the optimal number of clusters davies et al 1979 all computations concerning som were performed by som toolbox 2 0 developed by helsinki university of technology from matlab r2016a vesanto et al 2000 3 4 the climate precursors in the present study the main goal is to develop a simple statistical model for predicting the csi for cereal crops in kebir rhumel basin based on the appropriate climate predictors there are only a few studies that demonstrate the influence of the climate variability on the drought in algeria meddi et al 2014 studied the drought in seven algerian plains during the period 1930 2007 and found that the annual precipitation is strongly related to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and north atlantic oscillation nao indices and negatively correlated with el niño southern oscillation enso also they demonstrated that the period of deficit starting from 1975 corresponds to a phase of increasing amo index to reach a positive phase khedimallah et al 2020 analyzed the interannual variability of precipitation and runoff rates and their relationship to the nao climate index using continuous wavelet analyses in the cheliff and medjerda basins their results reveal that the different scales of precipitation and runoff variability seem to be clearly related to the nao with different degrees of correlation hallouz et al 2020 evaluated the dry sequences in the cheliff basin through the analysis of the temporal variability of their frequency and intensity and the identification of climate indices of general atmospheric circulation influencing this variability they analyzed climate indices for five atmospheric circulation modes such as el niño southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao mediterranean oscillation mo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the western mediterranean oscillation wemo and found that the most of the stations are more correlated with the mo and amo climatic indices than the other indices all previous studies are focused only with studying the impact of climate variability using correlation coefficient however none of these used them as a predictors for drought forecasting in order to understand more about the temporal variability of the crop stress index csi in the kebir rhumel basin the relationship between the mean crop stress index csimean and the climate variability is analyzed therefore investigating this relationship could enable the development of forecasting models that can be used to understand and predict the variability in the csimean 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of the water stress index the crop stress index csi described above is computed for each sub basin in the kebir rhumel using the climate records from 1974 to 2013 the crop stress index and the maximum of the crop stress index csimax refers to the highest value of csi in any year are shown in fig 3 we can see that for the year with the worst deﬁcit the sub basin sb07 has csimax less than 1 csimax 1 indicating moderate storage requirements or water stress for this sub basin the average annual rainfall is greater than the magnitude of cumulative deficit or risk while in the case of sb01 sb02 sb03 sb05 and sb06 csimax is greater than 1 csimax 1 indicates that the cumulative deﬁcit is greater than the average annual rainfall therefore the annual rate of consumption in these sub basins is higher than the average utilizable rainfall rates sb02 sb03 sb04 and sb05 have csimax 2 indicating that these sub basins require more than two times the average annual rainfall in storage to meet the stress the rate of consumption is higher than the endogenously available water supply 4 2 spatio temporal distribution of csi in this study we analyze the spatio temporal distribution of the crop stress index based on the self organizing maps som method som provides an objective way to classify csi into different homogenous clusters the som maps were formed using a 10 x 3 hexagonal architecture with a gaussian neighborhood fig 4 and the quantization error qe and the topographic error te were equal to 0 95 and 0 000 respectively indicating that the som was smoothly trained in topology the visualization of the component plane and the components plane ordering of each sub basin in each neuron on the som are showed in figs 4 and 5 the high neuron values relate to maroon shades whilst the lowest one link to dark blue shades thus component planes help to visually identify relationships in terms of correlations between the variables sub basins involved in the analysis we can see clearly that all sub basins except sb07 had a similar pattern of color gradient with the lowest values of csi were located in the upper left corner indicating that there is a strong positive correlation among these six sub basins sb07 showed a different pattern of color gradient with the lowest values were found in the upper right corner of the map in this study a final fine tuning cluster analysis was carried out by k means clustering method in order to select the optimal number of clusters the davies bouldin index dbi davies et al 1979 values based on the k means algorithm were computed and displayed in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 we can observe that the most appropriate number of clusters corresponding to minimum dbi was two once the minimum dbi had been selected the k means clustering method was carried out to obtained the two clusters for fine tuning the pattern classification fig 7 displays the pattern classification map of the two clusters for more quantitative information of each cluster the mean values of csi csimean between the sub basins were calculated and showed in fig 8 and table 2 from the results we can see a clear separation of clusters in which the values of csi decreased from the first cluster cluster 1 to the second cluster cluster 2 indicating that the first cluster is characterized by high values of the csi for all sub basins the first cluster is composed by the following years 1988 1997 from 1999 to 2002 and from 2006 to 2013 14 years and concerns 35 of the total years we can observe that the rate of consumption in these years is much higher csimean 1 5 than the average utilizable rainfall rates while the second cluster is represented by the rest of the years and consists of about 65 of the total years for the years identified in cluster 2 the values of the csimean are ranged from 1 06 to 1 6 indicating that the average water demand is greater than the average renewable water supply 4 3 forecasting of the crop stress index 4 3 1 predictor identification to identify appropriate climate indices that significantly influenced the mean crop stress index csimean we consider sea surface temperature sst conditions during february april fma which can then be used as predictors in the statistical forecast models the sst data were taken from the royal netherlands meteorological institute climate explorer dataset knmi 2020 fig 9 shows the spearman s rank correlation between the csimean and the global sst conditions during fma here spearman rank correlation was applied in order to detect the regions presenting significant correlations at a confidence level of 95 the selected sst regions and their correlation with the csimean at the study area are summarized in the table 3 it is clearly seen that sst grids over enso region niño 12 5os 20os and 110ow 90ow tropical west pacific region twp 20on 20os and 120oe 180oe north atlantic region nat 30on 60on and 40ow 5ow and tropical atlantic region tal 10on eq and 50ow 10ow have a significant influence on the csimean in the kebir rhumel basin at the 95 significance level form the table 3 we observed a significant positive correlation between the csimean and the four regions niño 12 twp nat and tal suggesting that warm conditions in the regions result in above normal csimean or high crop water stress hence using sst information can provide a lead time for predicting the crop stress index for a given cereal crops in the study area for this reason we chose the selected regions to be a candidate predictors in the forecasting model 4 3 2 the k nearest neighbors forecasting model in the current study we applied a non parametric nearest neighbors k nn model to forecast the csimean of the 12 years 2002 2013 for a given cereal crops in the kebir rhumel basin here the csimean is predicted using the k nn model developed based on data from 1979 to 2001 in this application we used the selected climate predictors niño 12 twp nat and tal as a best climate predictors in the forecasting model pairwise boxplots are useful to visually compare the observed and forecasted data if the forecasted data were to reproduce the observed statistics exactly the extents of the median and the whiskers for both observed and forecasted datasets would be identical fig 10 shows the boxplot of forecasted values and observed values of csimean as can be seen form fig 10 it is clearly that the boxplots are similar indicating that the model was able to adequately reproduce the historical values of csimean to compare the observed and the ensemble of forecasted scenarios we show a series of boxplot diagrams depicting the k nn forecast distributions for csimean in the years 2002 2013 fig 11 the box and whiskers shown in fig 11 illustrate the range of possible value of csimean for each year the box shows the range of the forecast values of csimean that are likely to occur at least 25 of the time and at most 75 of the time the solid line in the middle of the box represents the median 50 of the forecasts the uncertainty in the forecast indicated by the spread between the 25 and the 75 and the median indicates a middle value that may be useful to compare with the observed data of csimean the identical directionality and dissimilar directionality proposed by ravindranath et al 2018 are identified the forecast for a given year has identical directionality if both the median of the forecast and the observed csimean data are either above the historical average or below the historical average while the absence of the identical directionality will be called dissimilar directionality the probabilities for the two categories such as above normal and below normal from the forecasting distributions are calculated and used to evaluate the accuracy of the forecast then the interquartile range iqr is calculated in the way to get a sense of the spread and variability in the boxplot distribution the results of the probabilities observed csimean data categories am and bm and iqr values are presented in table 4 form the fig 11 we can observe that the identical directionalities are registered in eight years for the years 2002 2008 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 both the median of the forecast and observed csimean data triangles are above the historical average these years are found in the first cluster where the highest values of the csimean are registered the dissimilar directionalities are observed in the rest of years four years the results of the probabilities from the table 4 columns 2 and 3 showed that the probability above the mean is observed in the most years seven years 58 the forecasts suggest higher probability values 70 for above mean category am during 2002 2004 and 2012 suggesting that these years were likely to see higher than normal cereal water stress however the observed csimean data were placed in the below mean category bm implying the opposite scenario to evaluate the results of the csimean forecasts the hit miss and false alarm for each year were computed the hit has occurred when the identical directionality is observed above mean or below mean if the observed csimean is placed in the above mean category while the forecast is placed in the below mean category then a miss has occurred finally a false alarm occurs if we have the opposite of miss where the forecast is situated above average water stress while the observation shows below average water stress ravindranath et al 2018 table 5 shows the results of the hit miss and false alarm form the table 5 we find that the hit miss and false alarm rate of the k nn forecast of csimean is 8 12 3 12 and 1 12 respectively hence more than 67 hits are registered which indicates a good forecasting procedure for an informative crop water stress index in the study area after getting the results of the csi forecasts the question arises is that how these forecasts can help and facilitate a better decision making as an example the mean value of the crop stress index csimean 1 81 is registered in 2002 which the irrigating water storage equal to 0 862 m3 per m2 and above the average csimean value of 0 719 m3 per m2 for the cereal crops in the case of the absence of any data about the crop stress index we can use the results obtained by the csi forecasting here we can use the median as a plausible estimate for the true csi value in 2002 the median of the csimean forecast equal to 0 843 m3 per m2 for the irrigating water storage in this context we can conclude that the targeted forecasting of the water stress index is potentially very useful to stakeholders and decision makers in relevant sectors 5 conclusion most prior drought indices considered only temperature and precipitation averaged over a specific time window without looking at demand while water stress indices have mostly considered only available water supply without considering potential drought severity and duration the modified version of the water stress index introduced by devineni et al 2013 developed here by contrast addresses both current agricultural water demand and water supply in the current study this water stress index was used to compute the maximum cumulative deficit over time between the monthly water requirement for cereal crop growth and the monthly rainfall in kebir rhumel basin then the forecasting of the crop stress index csi was developed in order to understand more about the water risk the csi was forecasted using the large scale climate indices as predictors in a non parametric k nearest neighbors k nn approach based on the results achieved we observed in this approach a great tendency towards strong and informative forecasts we can conclude that our forecasting approach is potentially very useful in investigating irrigation requirement declaration of competing interest the author declares that he has no conflict of interest acknowledgments i am is very grateful to prof naresh devineni for his helpful comments and suggestions that substantially improved this work i wish to thank the national agency for hydraulic resources anrh and office national of meteorology nom for providing material help and data on

countries has also increased since late 1970s however compared with the developed countries the researches on the effect of n fertiliser application on quality of groundwater in the developing countries remain largely unexplored once nitrate contaminates an aquifer remediation is costly gutiérrez et al 2018 identification of the pollutant sources is the first step in taking proper action toward protecting and improving the groundwater quality the sources of no3 in aquifers include chemical fertiliser or manure and sewage soil organic n and atmospheric deposition different no3 sources have different stable isotope signatures kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 yang et al 2013 hence the natural abundances of 15n and 18o of no3 in water are used to identify the no3 sources in surface waters or groundwater hassen et al 2016 hosono et al 2013 spalding et al 2019 vrzel et al 2016 however the use of stable isotope analysis alone cannot always provide conclusive information owing to the overlapping isotopic values and signature changes caused by biogeochemical processes wang et al 2017 xu et al 2016 several recent studies have shown that a combination of dual isotope analysis and statistical tools such as the principal components analysis pca enhances the identification of no3 sources kaown et al 2007 kim et al 2015a 2015b matiatos 2016 meghdadi and javar 2018 the northern slope region of the qinling mountains in shaanxi province accounts for approximately 23 of global kiwifruit actinidia deliciosa cultivation area faostat 2019 shaanxi provincial bureau of statistics 2018 overuse of fertilisation in kiwifruit production is very common and causes high n accumulation and leaching the annual n fertilisation rate in kiwifruit orchards was approximately 2 9 times higher than that in wheat maize fields and the no3 accumulation in kiwifruit orchards in the 400 cm soil profile reached 3288 kg n ha 1 gao et al 2019 lu et al 2016 intensive rainfall and flood irrigation in the region increase risk of groundwater quality degradation however almost no research studies the effect of the land use change and fertilisation on local groundwater quality the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the groundwater ion composition with different land use patterns 2 to identify the dominate sources of groundwater no3 contamination using hydrochemical analysis and isotope data 3 to quantify the contribution of no3 sources with different land use patterns using the isotope mass balance mixing model our hypothesis was that long term intensive land use patterns would deteriorate the groundwater quality of the small catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted in the yujiahe catchment 34 5 34 9 n 108 0 108 3 e located in the zhouzhi county shaanxi province on the northern sloping region of the qinling mountains china fig 1 the soils are developed from loess and the primary soil types include typic usti alluvic primosols loessi orthic primosols and typic hapli ustic isohumosols chinese soil taxonomy research group 2001 the soil type in the upstream is typic hapli ustic isohumosols typic usti alluvic primosols loessi orthic primosols and typic hapli ustic isohumosols are found in the midstream typic hapli ustic isohumosols is the primary soil type in the downstream the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 13 2 c and 708 mm respectively a total of 60 80 of annual precipitation occurs between july and september the monthly temperature and precipitation during the study period is showed in fig 2 hydrostratigrapically the catchment can be divided into two main systems of aquifers an unconfined and confined aquifer the unconfined aquifer can be divided into two aquifers a fissured rock aquifer in the southern mountains upstream of the catchment and a porous aquifer in the agricultural areas mid and downstream of the catchment the porous aquifer lithology is composed of sand mud gravel and pebbles filled with pore water in this study the groundwater in unconfined aquifer is called shallow groundwater the groundwater in confined aquifer is called deep groundwater the elevation ranges from 904 m in the southern upstream mountains to 478 m downstream the flow direction of the groundwater is the ne fig 1 zhou et al 2018 the depths of the groundwater tables in the catchment range from 6 to 17 m and was increased from sw to ne the groundwater is pumped for drinking and irrigation the land use in the catchment ranges from natural vegetation fargesia spathacea robinia pseudoacacia pinus tabulaeformis etc upstream to intensive agricultural areas downstream before 1990s wheat and maize were main crops 41 2 of land use in the catchment kiwifruit was established after the early 1990s because of its high profit and is currently the primary fruit crops in the catchment fig 1 land uses in the catchment include forests 37 2 crops 18 2 orchards 21 7 residential areas 12 1 and other types 10 8 including nurseries reservoirs and unused land chemical fertilisers with little or no manure are applied on the cropland at the mean rate of 391 kg n ha 1 yr 1 compared to cereals kiwifruit production is a very intensive system and fertiliser overuse is very common chemical fertiliser combined with manure is applied to the orchards at the mean rate of 1131 kg n ha 1 yr 1 lu et al 2016 cereals are usually rainfed and kiwifruit vines are irrigated the annual irrigation rate in the kiwifruit orchards is primarily determined by the local rainfall frequency and rate approximately 3 4 irrigations events 100 150 mm each are normally required during each summer therefore the different intensive land use gradients in the small catchment provides an ideal site to investigate the effect of agricultural production on groundwater quality 2 2 study methods we divided the catchment into three regions from south to north to compare the effects of land use patterns on groundwater quality i region a natural vegetation of the qinling mountains ii region b primarily occupied by cereal fields and iii region c primarily occupied by kiwifruit orchards water samples were collected at 40 locations in june and july from 2015 to 2017 water samples were collected from the three regions including 4 springs sp from region a 2 shallow wells s from region b 16 shallow wells s and 18 deep wells d from region c fig 1 shallow wells had depths of 50 m and deep wells had depths of 50 m most of the wells were located in the sites with typic hapli ustic isohumosols groundwater samples were collected after being continuously pumped to remove stagnant well water the average groundwater table depth of the shallow wells was presented in table s1 the ph ec and major ions of the samples collected from 2015 to 2017 were determined the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of samples collected in july 2017 were also analysed ec and ph were measured in situ using portable metres the samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm cellulose membranes and transferred to a 1 l polyethylene bottle at laboratory all chemical parameter analysis samples were kept at 4 c isotopes analysis samples were frozen potential sources of the no3 in the catchment include soil organic nitrogen ns manure m inorganic nitrogen fertiliser nf and atmospheric deposition ad therefore soil synthetic fertiliser manure and rainwater samples were collected in this catchment soil samples 0 20 cm n 12 were collected from different land use areas in the catchment in 2017 synthetic fertiliser samples n 9 including urea diammonium phosphate compound fertilisers and seven manure samples chicken cake sheep pig and commercial organic fertiliser were collected from farmers or the local markets all solid samples were air dried and ground into 100 meshes for 15n stable isotope determination rainwater n 13 was collected during events from april 2017 to july 2017 and filtered 0 22 µm and frozen until analysis 2 3 chemical and isotope analysis major dissolved cations na k ca2 and mg2 were analysed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry z 2000 icp aes japan major dissolved anions cl so4 2 and no3 were determined using ion chromatography ics 2100 dionex usa bicarbonate was analysed using titration with normal diluted 0 01 mol l h2so4 immediately after the water samples were taken back to the lab the δ15n and δ18o values of no3 in water samples were analysed using the agno3 method silva et al 2000 xing and liu 2011 the water samples were briefly passed through the cation and anion exchanges to purify and concentrate the no3 the hcl was used to elute no3 from the resin and the dissolved no3 was converted to agno3 by adding ag2o the agno3 solution was freeze dried to solid agno3 for δ15n and δ18o analysis a ce flash 1112 elemental analyser ea interfaced with a delta plus continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer was used to analyse the δ15n of the solid agno3 and soil fertiliser δ18o was determined using the delta plus instrument connected to a high temperature conversion elemental analyser a soil standard δ15n 5 2 one laboratory reference material kno3 δ15n 6 3 δ18o 15 6 a type of cellulose δ18o 29 0 that did not contain n and the international isotopic reference material iaea n3 δ15n 4 7 δ18o 25 6 were measured to monitor analytical accuracy xing and liu 2016 isotope analyses were conducted at the key laboratory of loess and quaternary geology institute of earth environment chinese academy of sciences the stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta δ units and a per mil notation relative to an international standard 1 δsample r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample and r standard are the isotope ratios 15n 14n and 18o 16o of the sample and standard respectively the international standards are atmospheric nitrogen for the nitrogen isotopes and the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for oxygen isotope the analytical errors for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are less than 0 3 and 1 respectively 2 4 multivariate statistical analysis multivariate statistical methods were used to analyse the relationships between the variables the principal component analysis pca is widely used for the data set reduction in hydrochemical and hydrogeological analysis and explaining the variance of a large set of inter correlated variables a small number of comprehensive indicators are taken to characterize the study objectives through data reduction in the pca analysis the principal components pcs are the uncorrelated orthogonal variables obtained by multiplying the original correlated variables with eigenvector loadings the pcs numbers were selected on the basis of the kaiser criterion in which only the components having eigenvalues above 1 were retained taufiq et al 2019 the data set of the physical chemical parameters of shallow groundwater samples in the yujiahe catchment were analyzed through pca for this raw data was first converted to a dimensionless standardized form to remove the effect of variable dimensions 2 5 estimation of the contributions from different no3 sources to estimate the contribution of no3 sources in the catchment the stable isotope analysis in r siar mixing model was used the detailed description of this model can be found in parnell et al 2010 and xue et al 2012 values from four potential no3 sources ad ns nf and m were used as specific isotope values table 1 to partition the no3 mixture the shapiro wilk normality test was applied to verify whether the no3 sources isotope data were normally distributed the principle component analysis pca for major ions and the correlation coefficient analysis were conducted using spss 13 0 the significance of isotopic values of groundwater nitrate in different regions were evaluated by analysis of variance with sas 9 0 followed by the least significant different test for comparing the mean values at the 1 and 5 levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and stable isotopes of no3 in groundwater the no3 concentration of springs in region a mean 32 5 mg l range from 27 2 to 39 6 mg l and groundwater in region b mean 34 8 mg l range from 33 8 to 35 8 mg l were all below the who permissible drinking water standard 50 mg l who world health organization 2011 the no3 concentration for shallow groundwater in region c mean 55 3 mg l range from 14 0 to 122 9 mg l was highest and approximately 56 3 of the shallow wells had no3 concentrations higher than the who permissible standard compared to shallow wells 22 2 of deep wells mean 28 9 mg l range from 8 3 to 86 1 mg l exceeded the who standard of 50 mg l table 2 and fig 3 this is consistent with the results reported in other studies a survey conducted in the north china plain showed that the no3 groundwater concentrations in economic forestland and farmland were significantly higher than those in the natural vegetation area because of higher fertilisation wang et al 2017 an assessment of groundwater no3 concentration in the united states indicated that they were higher beneath agricultural areas with high n input burow et al 2010 the δ15n no3 values for springs in region a were relatively low mean 1 5 range from 0 3 to 3 4 and increased to 3 5 range from 3 2 to 3 8 for groundwater samples in region b the δ15n no3 values in shallow mean 5 8 range from 4 1 to 8 3 and deep mean 4 9 range from 4 2 to 5 4 groundwater in region c were the highest fig 4a higher δ15n values indicate a more open n cycle in the ecosystems hietz et al 2011 hogberg 1997 the δ15n no3 values of groundwater significantly increased from natural vegetation region a to intensive kiwifruit regions region c indicating the drastic effect of land use change on the n cycle in the small catchment the δ18o no3 values for springs in region a mean 4 9 range from 3 6 to 5 7 and groundwater in region b mean 4 8 range from 4 6 to 5 0 were the highest the δ18o no3 values in groundwater in regions c s and c d had mean values and ranges of 3 6 and 0 2 to 6 7 and 2 6 and 1 0 to 6 5 respectively fig 4b compared with the shallow wells the no3 concentrations in deep wells were lower table 2 suggesting less anthropogenic influence no3 may come from soil nitrogen nitrification or historical n application burow et al 2010 however almost all the δ15n no3 values in deep groundwater were higher than those in regions a and b indicating that the quality of deep groundwater has also been affected by long term fertilisation used in kiwifruit production the d5 d6 d9 d18 wells with relative shallow depth 50 100 m also suffered from the severe no3 contamination fig 3 the groundwater mixing between shallow and deep groundwater may be one reason for the no3 contamination taufiq et al 2019 3 2 hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater the averaged ec values of groundwater in different regions followed the order of region c s mean 753 µs cm region c d 548 µs cm region b 525 µs cm region a 438 µs cm among the major cations and anions in shallow groundwater of the three regions the ca2 and hco3 were the dominated ions in the groundwater followed by the so4 2 no3 cl mg2 and na the ca2 mg2 na and hco3 cl concentrations were highest averaged 122 3 22 4 20 2 383 and 20 8 mg l respectively in region c and lowest averaged 67 8 11 0 5 8 183 and 4 5 mg l respectively in region a table 2 most parameters for deep groundwater had relatively lower values than for shallow groundwater in region c the major ions included the no3 are shown in a piper diagram fig 5 the main groundwater type identified in the three regions was ca hco3 regions a and b tended to have more ca hco3 so4 compared to region a and region b the shallow groundwater in region c tended to ca hco3 cl no3 type the cl is a stable tracer and useful indicator for tracking the contamination source han et al 2015 meghdadi and javar 2018 the increased concentrations of cl and no3 in the region c indicated the intensive kiwifruit production have changed the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater the correlation coefficient and pca are applied based on the average concentrations of twelve parameters ph ec na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and δ15n δ18o of the shallow groundwater samples over three year sampling periods to better understand the factors affecting groundwater quality high positive correlations between ec and na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and no3 were observed table 3 na ca2 mg2 cl and no3 ions are primarily associated with the input of solute from anthropogenic activities such as the application of chemical fertiliser manure or domestic sewage wang et al 2017 the ec of groundwater is direct index of the salinisation of water anthropogenic activities and accelerated weathering can increase the salinisation of fresh water kaushal 2016 the positive correlation between no3 and ec indicated that high salinisation and solute enrichment of groundwater were caused by nitrate ions table 3 the pca analysis revealed that the principal components pc1 and pc2 together explain 79 96 of the total variation for the shallow groundwater data fig 6 the pc1 accounted for 56 98 of the total variation illustrating significant positive correlations among a number of hydrochemical variables ec na ca2 mg2 cl hco3 no3 and δ15n the significant positive loading value of δ15n and no3 in pc1 and high correlation between no3 and δ15n table 3 suggested that the enrichments of solute were mainly caused by the no3 sources with elevated δ15n values such as manure or domestic sewage the significant positive correlation between no3 and ca2 and mg2 indicated that the nitrification of reduced n from ammonium based fertiliser or manure generates acidity and no3 and enhances carbonate dissolution aquilina et al 2012 this is confirmed by the negative correlation between ph with ca2 mg2 cl hco3 and no3 table 3 and the moderate negative loading of ph in pc1 fig 6 the ec and concentrations of na ca2 mg2 cl and no3 in groundwater increased from natural vegetation to intensive horticultural orchards therefore land use patterns have significantly changed the biogeochemical processes of the catchment and deteriorated groundwater quality 3 3 identification of potential no3 sources in shallow groundwater the 15n and 18o isotopic compositions of no3 in shallow groundwater showed differences among the three regions with different land use patterns fig 4 the nitrification process usually produces depleted δ15n no3 values while the denitrification process produces the enriched isotope values li et al 2019 during the nitrification process the new formed no3 with 2 3 of the o comes from the ambient water and 1 3 from the atmosphere generally the δ18o no3 values were less than 10 böttcher et al 1990 kendall 1998 the values of δ18o no3 in all groundwater samples were consistent with those expected for no3 formed from nh4 nitrification fig 4b therefore the nitrate of the groundwater in the three regions of the catchment were mainly from the ammonium based chemical fertilisers or urea n compounds in manure soil organic nitrogen and atmospheric ammonium deposition microbial denitrification is an important process for the reduction of no3 in the aquatic environment hosono et al 2013 xue et al 2009 the process generates δ18o 15n ratios from 1 1 3 1 2 1 liu et al 2006 the δ18o 15n ratios of no3 in the shallow groundwater in this catchment were not at this ranges 1 1 3 1 2 1 fig 7 and no notable negative correlation was found between no3 concentration and δ15n no3 fig s1a there was also no significantly positive relationship δ18o 0 25δ15n 5 15 between the δ15n and δ18o values of the groundwater samples fig s1b the dissolved oxygen do concentrations of all shallow groundwater in the three regions were much higher than the o2 concentration suitable for denitrification 2 mg l table 2 for the deep groundwater there was also no notable negative correlation between no3 concentration and δ15n no3 fig s1c and no significantly positive relationship was found between the δ15n and δ18o values of the deep groundwater samples fig s1d the do concentrations of all deep groundwater were also much higher than the appropriate limit 2 mg l for the denitrification fukada et al 2003 ogrinc et al 2019 xing and liu 2016 xue et al 2009 table 2 all these evidences indicate that the denitrification processes in the shallow and deep groundwater of this catchment is very weak the 15n and 18o isotopic compositions of no3 in springs sp1 sp4 in region a were lower and primarily fall into the typical range of nh4 in fertiliser rain and soil n fig 7 indicating that mineralisation and nitrification of soil n and nh4 from precipitation are the primary no3 sources previous study indicated that the δ15n values of nh4 are usually lower due to the preferential volatilization of 14n jia and chen 2010 kaushal et al 2011 indicated that the no3 in water from forested area had lower δ15n no3 values and was primarily derived from microbial uptake mineralisation and the nitrification of soil the 15n and 18o isotopic values of no3 water samples in region b s1 s2 fall into the typical range of fertiliser soil fig 7 field surveys in region b found that chemical fertiliser was the primary n input source in this region therefore no3 in groundwater could be attributed to the application of chemical fertiliser or the mineralisation of soil n at these sites the δ15n no3 values of shallow groundwater samples s3 s18 in region c overlap those of fertiliser nh4 soil n and manure and septic waste making the identification of the predominant no3 source difficult fig 7 almost all the samples fall into the soil n source window it seems that the no3 were likely from the nitrification of soil organic nitrogen amended by fertiliser since this region mainly occupied by intensive kiwifruit orchards with large amount of fertiliser application however significant positive correlation was found between no3 and cl table 3 indicating that the manure was an important source for the no3 in groundwater because of no chemical fertiliser applied in this region containing the cl the no3 derived from manure always shows higher δ15n no3 values choi et al 2002 xue et al 2009 however most of the samples with δ15n values were lower than that of the local manure table 1 this might be attributed to the mixing of other nitrate sources with lower δ15n values such as chemical nitrogen fertiliser researches indicated that the mixing of different sources can result in a change of isotopic signature kaushal et al 2011 vystavna et al 2017 the mean annual nitrogen input in orchard was higher than 1100 kg n ha 1 with a combination of chemical fertiliser with manure gao et al 2019 we assumed that the no3 in groundwater mainly originated from the mixing of chemical fertilisers with manure followed by the soil organic nitrogen therefore different land use patterns have dramatic effects on the concentrations and isotopic compositions of groundwater nitrate from region a to c increasing nitrogen input chemical fertiliser with manure seriously polluted the groundwater quality manure application resulted in elevated δ15n no3 values in region c choi et al 2002 xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 the decrease of δ18o no3 values from region a to c may be due to the effect of precipitation in the upstream section whereas the effect of chemical fertiliser and manure application in the mid and downstream sections zhang et al 2015 the siar mixing model was applied to estimate the potential contributions from each source to no3 in groundwater of different regions using isotope values determined in our study catchment table 1 the results revealed a high variability in the contributions of the four potential no3 sources in the three regions for region a the contributions of ns and nf to no3 in the springs were 33 0 and 48 1 respectively fig 8a for region b ns 32 4 and nf 32 2 were the primary contributors to no3 in shallow groundwater fig 8b compared to region b m was the principal no3 contributor 39 7 for shallow groundwater and the fertiliser chemical and manure contribution in region c s was 58 2 fig 8c no3 in deep groundwater in region c was primarily contributed by ns 52 3 and the contribution from m was 29 0 fig 8d the no3 contribution of each source to the water samples calculated by siar were in accordance with the results from the dual plot approach analysis hence the large fertiliser application manure combined with chemical for kiwifruit production significantly impacts the no3 concentrations of local groundwater 3 4 strategies to reduce no3 loss into the groundwater in intensive agricultural regions in this catchment land use change has significantly affected the local groundwater quality due to excessive application of n fertilisers therefore comprehensive measures are urgently needed to reduce soil no3 accumulation and loss the n application rate in orchards must be optimised our 3 year field experiments in the catchment showed that compared with conventional farming n fertilisation kiwifruit yield and quality was not affected by a 25 reduction in the n application rate in 2012 2014 and a 45 reduction in 2014 2015 however no3 accumulation in soil profiles was reduced lu et al 2018 intensive rainfall and flood irrigation are the primary factors responsible for no3 leaching into the groundwater costa et al 2002 gheysari et al 2009 maharjan et al 2014 therefore reducing the irrigation rate or adopting fertigation is an efficient practice to decrease no3 leaching increasing evidence suggests that no3 accumulation in the vadose zone is a globally significant store of no3 and affects n budgets and management on different scales ascott et al 2017 scanlon et al 2008 van meter et al 2016 our study estimated that the total no3 storage in 0 400 cm soil profiles in the catchment was approximately 464 8 mg n gao et al 2019 the massive no3 storage in the vadose zone will risk groundwater no3 contamination in the catchment and a long term assessment of the water quality is needed 4 conclusions our study shows that land use patterns from natural forest to kiwifruit orchards significantly increased ec and concentrations of no3 hco3 ca2 mg2 na and cl ions additionally δ15n increased while δ18o decreased in no3 in groundwater the no3 concentration percentages of shallow groundwater exceeded the permissible standard and were as high as 56 thus long term kiwifruit production has deteriorated groundwater quality in the region the results of the statistical analysis and dual isotope approach and quantification by siar showed that chemical fertiliser combined with manure was the primary 58 2 no3 contributor to shallow groundwater wells in the kiwifruit orchard region hence fertiliser application must be optimised to reduce n accumulation in soil and no3 leaching in intensive horticultural systems our study provides a significant reference for other countries especially the developing countries that are undergoing land use changes similar to those in china to avoid local fresh water

higher than that in wheat maize fields and the no3 accumulation in kiwifruit orchards in the 400 cm soil profile reached 3288 kg n ha 1 gao et al 2019 lu et al 2016 intensive rainfall and flood irrigation in the region increase risk of groundwater quality degradation however almost no research studies the effect of the land use change and fertilisation on local groundwater quality the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the groundwater ion composition with different land use patterns 2 to identify the dominate sources of groundwater no3 contamination using hydrochemical analysis and isotope data 3 to quantify the contribution of no3 sources with different land use patterns using the isotope mass balance mixing model our hypothesis was that long term intensive land use patterns would deteriorate the groundwater quality of the small catchment 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted in the yujiahe catchment 34 5 34 9 n 108 0 108 3 e located in the zhouzhi county shaanxi province on the northern sloping region of the qinling mountains china fig 1 the soils are developed from loess and the primary soil types include typic usti alluvic primosols loessi orthic primosols and typic hapli ustic isohumosols chinese soil taxonomy research group 2001 the soil type in the upstream is typic hapli ustic isohumosols typic usti alluvic primosols loessi orthic primosols and typic hapli ustic isohumosols are found in the midstream typic hapli ustic isohumosols is the primary soil type in the downstream the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 13 2 c and 708 mm respectively a total of 60 80 of annual precipitation occurs between july and september the monthly temperature and precipitation during the study period is showed in fig 2 hydrostratigrapically the catchment can be divided into two main systems of aquifers an unconfined and confined aquifer the unconfined aquifer can be divided into two aquifers a fissured rock aquifer in the southern mountains upstream of the catchment and a porous aquifer in the agricultural areas mid and downstream of the catchment the porous aquifer lithology is composed of sand mud gravel and pebbles filled with pore water in this study the groundwater in unconfined aquifer is called shallow groundwater the groundwater in confined aquifer is called deep groundwater the elevation ranges from 904 m in the southern upstream mountains to 478 m downstream the flow direction of the groundwater is the ne fig 1 zhou et al 2018 the depths of the groundwater tables in the catchment range from 6 to 17 m and was increased from sw to ne the groundwater is pumped for drinking and irrigation the land use in the catchment ranges from natural vegetation fargesia spathacea robinia pseudoacacia pinus tabulaeformis etc upstream to intensive agricultural areas downstream before 1990s wheat and maize were main crops 41 2 of land use in the catchment kiwifruit was established after the early 1990s because of its high profit and is currently the primary fruit crops in the catchment fig 1 land uses in the catchment include forests 37 2 crops 18 2 orchards 21 7 residential areas 12 1 and other types 10 8 including nurseries reservoirs and unused land chemical fertilisers with little or no manure are applied on the cropland at the mean rate of 391 kg n ha 1 yr 1 compared to cereals kiwifruit production is a very intensive system and fertiliser overuse is very common chemical fertiliser combined with manure is applied to the orchards at the mean rate of 1131 kg n ha 1 yr 1 lu et al 2016 cereals are usually rainfed and kiwifruit vines are irrigated the annual irrigation rate in the kiwifruit orchards is primarily determined by the local rainfall frequency and rate approximately 3 4 irrigations events 100 150 mm each are normally required during each summer therefore the different intensive land use gradients in the small catchment provides an ideal site to investigate the effect of agricultural production on groundwater quality 2 2 study methods we divided the catchment into three regions from south to north to compare the effects of land use patterns on groundwater quality i region a natural vegetation of the qinling mountains ii region b primarily occupied by cereal fields and iii region c primarily occupied by kiwifruit orchards water samples were collected at 40 locations in june and july from 2015 to 2017 water samples were collected from the three regions including 4 springs sp from region a 2 shallow wells s from region b 16 shallow wells s and 18 deep wells d from region c fig 1 shallow wells had depths of 50 m and deep wells had depths of 50 m most of the wells were located in the sites with typic hapli ustic isohumosols groundwater samples were collected after being continuously pumped to remove stagnant well water the average groundwater table depth of the shallow wells was presented in table s1 the ph ec and major ions of the samples collected from 2015 to 2017 were determined the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of samples collected in july 2017 were also analysed ec and ph were measured in situ using portable metres the samples were filtered through a 0 22 µm cellulose membranes and transferred to a 1 l polyethylene bottle at laboratory all chemical parameter analysis samples were kept at 4 c isotopes analysis samples were frozen potential sources of the no3 in the catchment include soil organic nitrogen ns manure m inorganic nitrogen fertiliser nf and atmospheric deposition ad therefore soil synthetic fertiliser manure and rainwater samples were collected in this catchment soil samples 0 20 cm n 12 were collected from different land use areas in the catchment in 2017 synthetic fertiliser samples n 9 including urea diammonium phosphate compound fertilisers and seven manure samples chicken cake sheep pig and commercial organic fertiliser were collected from farmers or the local markets all solid samples were air dried and ground into 100 meshes for 15n stable isotope determination rainwater n 13 was collected during events from april 2017 to july 2017 and filtered 0 22 µm and frozen until analysis 2 3 chemical and isotope analysis major dissolved cations na k ca2 and mg2 were analysed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry z 2000 icp aes japan major dissolved anions cl so4 2 and no3 were determined using ion chromatography ics 2100 dionex usa bicarbonate was analysed using titration with normal diluted 0 01 mol l h2so4 immediately after the water samples were taken back to the lab the δ15n and δ18o values of no3 in water samples were analysed using the agno3 method silva et al 2000 xing and liu 2011 the water samples were briefly passed through the cation and anion exchanges to purify and concentrate the no3 the hcl was used to elute no3 from the resin and the dissolved no3 was converted to agno3 by adding ag2o the agno3 solution was freeze dried to solid agno3 for δ15n and δ18o analysis a ce flash 1112 elemental analyser ea interfaced with a delta plus continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer was used to analyse the δ15n of the solid agno3 and soil fertiliser δ18o was determined using the delta plus instrument connected to a high temperature conversion elemental analyser a soil standard δ15n 5 2 one laboratory reference material kno3 δ15n 6 3 δ18o 15 6 a type of cellulose δ18o 29 0 that did not contain n and the international isotopic reference material iaea n3 δ15n 4 7 δ18o 25 6 were measured to monitor analytical accuracy xing and liu 2016 isotope analyses were conducted at the key laboratory of loess and quaternary geology institute of earth environment chinese academy of sciences the stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta δ units and a per mil notation relative to an international standard 1 δsample r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample and r standard are the isotope ratios 15n 14n and 18o 16o of the sample and standard respectively the international standards are atmospheric nitrogen for the nitrogen isotopes and the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for oxygen isotope the analytical errors for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are less than 0 3 and 1 respectively 2 4 multivariate statistical analysis multivariate statistical methods were used to analyse the relationships between the variables the principal component analysis pca is widely used for the data set reduction in hydrochemical and hydrogeological analysis and explaining the variance of a large set of inter correlated variables a small number of comprehensive indicators are taken to characterize the study objectives through data reduction in the pca analysis the principal components pcs are the uncorrelated orthogonal variables obtained by multiplying the original correlated variables with eigenvector loadings the pcs numbers were selected on the basis of the kaiser criterion in which only the components having eigenvalues above 1 were retained taufiq et al 2019 the data set of the physical chemical parameters of shallow groundwater samples in the yujiahe catchment were analyzed through pca for this raw data was first converted to a dimensionless standardized form to remove the effect of variable dimensions 2 5 estimation of the contributions from different no3 sources to estimate the contribution of no3 sources in the catchment the stable isotope analysis in r siar mixing model was used the detailed description of this model can be found in parnell et al 2010 and xue et al 2012 values from four potential no3 sources ad ns nf and m were used as specific isotope values table 1 to partition the no3 mixture the shapiro wilk normality test was applied to verify whether the no3 sources isotope data were normally distributed the principle component analysis pca for major ions and the correlation coefficient analysis were conducted using spss 13 0 the significance of isotopic values of groundwater nitrate in different regions were evaluated by analysis of variance with sas 9 0 followed by the least significant different test for comparing the mean values at the 1 and 5 levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations and stable isotopes of no3 in groundwater the no3 concentration of springs in region a mean 32 5 mg l range from 27 2 to 39 6 mg l and groundwater in region b mean 34 8 mg l range from 33 8 to 35 8 mg l were all below the who permissible drinking water standard 50 mg l who world health organization 2011 the no3 concentration for shallow groundwater in region c mean 55 3 mg l range from 14 0 to 122 9 mg l was highest and approximately 56 3 of the shallow wells had no3 concentrations higher than the who permissible standard compared to shallow wells 22 2 of deep wells mean 28 9 mg l range from 8 3 to 86 1 mg l exceeded the who standard of 50 mg l table 2 and fig 3 this is consistent with the results reported in other studies a survey conducted in the north china plain showed that the no3 groundwater concentrations in economic forestland and farmland were significantly higher than those in the natural vegetation area because of higher fertilisation wang et al 2017 an assessment of groundwater no3 concentration in the united states indicated that they were higher beneath agricultural areas with high n input burow et al 2010 the δ15n no3 values for springs in region a were relatively low mean 1 5 range from 0 3 to 3 4 and increased to 3 5 range from 3 2 to 3 8 for groundwater samples in region b the δ15n no3 values in shallow mean 5 8 range from 4 1 to 8 3 and deep mean 4 9 range from 4 2 to 5 4 groundwater in region c were the highest fig 4a higher δ15n values indicate a more open n cycle in the ecosystems hietz et al 2011 hogberg 1997 the δ15n no3 values of groundwater significantly increased from natural vegetation region a to intensive kiwifruit regions region c indicating the drastic effect of land use change on the n cycle in the small catchment the δ18o no3 values for springs in region a mean 4 9 range from 3 6 to 5 7 and groundwater in region b mean 4 8 range from 4 6 to 5 0 were the highest the δ18o no3 values in groundwater in regions c s and c d had mean values and ranges of 3 6 and 0 2 to 6 7 and 2 6 and 1 0 to 6 5 respectively fig 4b compared with the shallow wells the no3 concentrations in deep wells were lower table 2 suggesting less anthropogenic influence no3 may come from soil nitrogen nitrification or historical n application burow et al 2010 however almost all the δ15n no3 values in deep groundwater were higher than those in regions a and b indicating that the quality of deep groundwater has also been affected by long term fertilisation used in kiwifruit production the d5 d6 d9 d18 wells with relative shallow depth 50 100 m also suffered from the severe no3 contamination fig 3 the groundwater mixing between shallow and deep groundwater may be one reason for the no3 contamination taufiq et al 2019 3 2 hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater the averaged ec values of groundwater in different regions followed the order of region c s mean 753 µs cm region c d 548 µs cm region b 525 µs cm region a 438 µs cm among the major cations and anions in shallow groundwater of the three regions the ca2 and hco3 were the dominated ions in the groundwater followed by the so4 2 no3 cl mg2 and na the ca2 mg2 na and hco3 cl concentrations were highest averaged 122 3 22 4 20 2 383 and 20 8 mg l respectively in region c and lowest averaged 67 8 11 0 5 8 183 and 4 5 mg l respectively in region a table 2 most parameters for deep groundwater had relatively lower values than for shallow groundwater in region c the major ions included the no3 are shown in a piper diagram fig 5 the main groundwater type identified in the three regions was ca hco3 regions a and b tended to have more ca hco3 so4 compared to region a and region b the shallow groundwater in region c tended to ca hco3 cl no3 type the cl is a stable tracer and useful indicator for tracking the contamination source han et al 2015 meghdadi and javar 2018 the increased concentrations of cl and no3 in the region c indicated the intensive kiwifruit production have changed the hydrochemical characteristics of the groundwater the correlation coefficient and pca are applied based on the average concentrations of twelve parameters ph ec na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and δ15n δ18o of the shallow groundwater samples over three year sampling periods to better understand the factors affecting groundwater quality high positive correlations between ec and na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 hco3 and no3 were observed table 3 na ca2 mg2 cl and no3 ions are primarily associated with the input of solute from anthropogenic activities such as the application of chemical fertiliser manure or domestic sewage wang et al 2017 the ec of groundwater is direct index of the salinisation of water anthropogenic activities and accelerated weathering can increase the salinisation of fresh water kaushal 2016 the positive correlation between no3 and ec indicated that high salinisation and solute enrichment of groundwater were caused by nitrate ions table 3 the pca analysis revealed that the principal components pc1 and pc2 together explain 79 96 of the total variation for the shallow groundwater data fig 6 the pc1 accounted for 56 98 of the total variation illustrating significant positive correlations among a number of hydrochemical variables ec na ca2 mg2 cl hco3 no3 and δ15n the significant positive loading value of δ15n and no3 in pc1 and high correlation between no3 and δ15n table 3 suggested that the enrichments of solute were mainly caused by the no3 sources with elevated δ15n values such as manure or domestic sewage the significant positive correlation between no3 and ca2 and mg2 indicated that the nitrification of reduced n from ammonium based fertiliser or manure generates acidity and no3 and enhances carbonate dissolution aquilina et al 2012 this is confirmed by the negative correlation between ph with ca2 mg2 cl hco3 and no3 table 3 and the moderate negative loading of ph in pc1 fig 6 the ec and concentrations of na ca2 mg2 cl and no3 in groundwater increased from natural vegetation to intensive horticultural orchards therefore land use patterns have significantly changed the biogeochemical processes of the catchment and deteriorated groundwater quality 3 3 identification of potential no3 sources in shallow groundwater the 15n and 18o isotopic compositions of no3 in shallow groundwater showed differences among the three regions with different land use patterns fig 4 the nitrification process usually produces depleted δ15n no3 values while the denitrification process produces the enriched isotope values li et al 2019 during the nitrification process the new formed no3 with 2 3 of the o comes from the ambient water and 1 3 from the atmosphere generally the δ18o no3 values were less than 10 böttcher et al 1990 kendall 1998 the values of δ18o no3 in all groundwater samples were consistent with those expected for no3 formed from nh4 nitrification fig 4b therefore the nitrate of the groundwater in the three regions of the catchment were mainly from the ammonium based chemical fertilisers or urea n compounds in manure soil organic nitrogen and atmospheric ammonium deposition microbial denitrification is an important process for the reduction of no3 in the aquatic environment hosono et al 2013 xue et al 2009 the process generates δ18o 15n ratios from 1 1 3 1 2 1 liu et al 2006 the δ18o 15n ratios of no3 in the shallow groundwater in this catchment were not at this ranges 1 1 3 1 2 1 fig 7 and no notable negative correlation was found between no3 concentration and δ15n no3 fig s1a there was also no significantly positive relationship δ18o 0 25δ15n 5 15 between the δ15n and δ18o values of the groundwater samples fig s1b the dissolved oxygen do concentrations of all shallow groundwater in the three regions were much higher than the o2 concentration suitable for denitrification 2 mg l table 2 for the deep groundwater there was also no notable negative correlation between no3 concentration and δ15n no3 fig s1c and no significantly positive relationship was found between the δ15n and δ18o values of the deep groundwater samples fig s1d the do concentrations of all deep groundwater were also much higher than the appropriate limit 2 mg l for the denitrification fukada et al 2003 ogrinc et al 2019 xing and liu 2016 xue et al 2009 table 2 all these evidences indicate that the denitrification processes in the shallow and deep groundwater of this catchment is very weak the 15n and 18o isotopic compositions of no3 in springs sp1 sp4 in region a were lower and primarily fall into the typical range of nh4 in fertiliser rain and soil n fig 7 indicating that mineralisation and nitrification of soil n and nh4 from precipitation are the primary no3 sources previous study indicated that the δ15n values of nh4 are usually lower due to the preferential volatilization of 14n jia and chen 2010 kaushal et al 2011 indicated that the no3 in water from forested area had lower δ15n no3 values and was primarily derived from microbial uptake mineralisation and the nitrification of soil the 15n and 18o isotopic values of no3 water samples in region b s1 s2 fall into the typical range of fertiliser soil fig 7 field surveys in region b found that chemical fertiliser was the primary n input source in this region therefore no3 in groundwater could be attributed to the application of chemical fertiliser or the mineralisation of soil n at these sites the δ15n no3 values of shallow groundwater samples s3 s18 in region c overlap those of fertiliser nh4 soil n and manure and septic waste making the identification of the predominant no3 source difficult fig 7 almost all the samples fall into the soil n source window it seems that the no3 were likely from the nitrification of soil organic nitrogen amended by fertiliser since this region mainly occupied by intensive kiwifruit orchards with large amount of fertiliser application however significant positive correlation was found between no3 and cl table 3 indicating that the manure was an important source for the no3 in groundwater because of no chemical fertiliser applied in this region containing the cl the no3 derived from manure always shows higher δ15n no3 values choi et al 2002 xue et al 2009 however most of the samples with δ15n values were lower than that of the local manure table 1 this might be attributed to the mixing of other nitrate sources with lower δ15n values such as chemical nitrogen fertiliser researches indicated that the mixing of different sources can result in a change of isotopic signature kaushal et al 2011 vystavna et al 2017 the mean annual nitrogen input in orchard was higher than 1100 kg n ha 1 with a combination of chemical fertiliser with manure gao et al 2019 we assumed that the no3 in groundwater mainly originated from the mixing of chemical fertilisers with manure followed by the soil organic nitrogen therefore different land use patterns have dramatic effects on the concentrations and isotopic compositions of groundwater nitrate from region a to c increasing nitrogen input chemical fertiliser with manure seriously polluted the groundwater quality manure application resulted in elevated δ15n no3 values in region c choi et al 2002 xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 the decrease of δ18o no3 values from region a to c may be due to the effect of precipitation in the upstream section whereas the effect of chemical fertiliser and manure application in the mid and downstream sections zhang et al 2015 the siar mixing model was applied to estimate the potential contributions from each source to no3 in groundwater of different regions using isotope values determined in our study catchment table 1 the results revealed a high variability in the contributions of the four potential no3 sources in the three regions for region a the contributions of ns and nf to no3 in the springs were 33 0 and 48 1 respectively fig 8a for region b ns 32 4 and nf 32 2 were the primary contributors to no3 in shallow groundwater fig 8b compared to region b m was the principal no3 contributor 39 7 for shallow groundwater and the fertiliser chemical and manure contribution in region c s was 58 2 fig 8c no3 in deep groundwater in region c was primarily contributed by ns 52 3 and the contribution from m was 29 0 fig 8d the no3 contribution of each source to the water samples calculated by siar were in accordance with the results from the dual plot approach analysis hence the large fertiliser application manure combined with chemical for kiwifruit production significantly impacts the no3 concentrations of local groundwater 3 4 strategies to reduce no3 loss into the groundwater in intensive agricultural regions in this catchment land use change has significantly affected the local groundwater quality due to excessive application of n fertilisers therefore comprehensive measures are urgently needed to reduce soil no3 accumulation and loss the n application rate in orchards must be optimised our 3 year field experiments in the catchment showed that compared with conventional farming n fertilisation kiwifruit yield and quality was not affected by a 25 reduction in the n application rate in 2012 2014 and a 45 reduction in 2014 2015 however no3 accumulation in soil profiles was reduced lu et al 2018 intensive rainfall and flood irrigation are the primary factors responsible for no3 leaching into the groundwater costa et al 2002 gheysari et al 2009 maharjan et al 2014 therefore reducing the irrigation rate or adopting fertigation is an efficient practice to decrease no3 leaching increasing evidence suggests that no3 accumulation in the vadose zone is a globally significant store of no3 and affects n budgets and management on different scales ascott et al 2017 scanlon et al 2008 van meter et al 2016 our study estimated that the total no3 storage in 0 400 cm soil profiles in the catchment was approximately 464 8 mg n gao et al 2019 the massive no3 storage in the vadose zone will risk groundwater no3 contamination in the catchment and a long term assessment of the water quality is needed 4 conclusions our study shows that land use patterns from natural forest to kiwifruit orchards significantly increased ec and concentrations of no3 hco3 ca2 mg2 na and cl ions additionally δ15n increased while δ18o decreased in no3 in groundwater the no3 concentration percentages of shallow groundwater exceeded the permissible standard and were as high as 56 thus long term kiwifruit production has deteriorated groundwater quality in the region the results of the statistical analysis and dual isotope approach and quantification by siar showed that chemical fertiliser combined with manure was the primary 58 2 no3 contributor to shallow groundwater wells in the kiwifruit orchard region hence fertiliser application must be optimised to reduce n accumulation in soil and no3 leaching in intensive horticultural systems our study provides a significant reference for other countries especially the developing countries that are undergoing land use changes similar to those in china to avoid local fresh water

10062,the a p approach developed by allen and pereira 2009 estimates single and basal crop coefficients kc and kcb from the observed fraction of ground cover fc and crop height h the practical application of the a p for several crops was reviewed and tested in a companion paper pereira et al 2020 the current study further addresses the derivation of optimal values for a p parameter values representing canopy transparency ml and stomatal adjustment fr and tests the resulting model performance values reported in literature of ml and fr were analysed optimal ml and fr values were derived by a numerical search that minimized the differences between kcb a p with standard kcb for vegetable field and fruit crops as tabulated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 sources for fc were literature reviews supplemented by a remote sensing survey computed kcb and kc for mid and end season together with associated parameters values were tabulated to improve the usability of the ml and fr parameters a cross validation was performed which consisted of the linear regression between kcb computed by a p and observed kcb relative to independent data sets obtained from field observations results show that both series of kcb match well with regression coefficients very close to 1 0 coefficients of determination near 1 0 and root mean square errors rmse of 0 06 for the annual crops and rmse 0 07 for the trees and vines these errors represent less than 10 of most of the computed tabulated kcb the tabulated fr and ml of this paper can be regarded as defaults to support a p field practice when observations of fc and h are performed therefore the a p approach shows to be appropriate for use in irrigation scheduling and planning when fc and h are observed using ground and or remote sensing hence supporting irrigation water savings keywords a p approach basal crop coefficient fractional cover and crop height remote sensing parameters search and usability crop water and irrigation requirements 1 introduction the food and agriculture organization fao two step crop coefficient method kc eto doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 has been a successful and dependable means to estimate crop evapotranspiration etc and crop water requirements pereira et al 2015a jensen and allen 2016 the method uses weather data to compute the grass reference evapotranspiration eto with the fao penman monteith eto equation pm eto equation allen et al 1998 and a crop coefficient kc that represents the relative rate of evapotranspiration from a specific crop and condition to that of the reference crop etc eto the reference condition is et from a clipped cool season well watered grass with a height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 fully covering the ground the calculation of eto has been standardized by fao allen et al 1998 2006 and the american society of civil engineers asce ewri 2005 therefore standard kc values have to be computed using the standardized pm eto equation using alternative reference et equations is only acceptable for local practice the kc eto approach provides a simple convenient and reproducible way to estimate et from a variety of crops and climatic conditions allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 2015a jensen and allen 2016 crop coefficient curves have been developed and reported for a wide range of agricultural crops allen et al 1998 2007 jensen and allen 2016 and their standard values were recently updated for vegetable and field crops pereira et al 2021a 2021b as well as for fruit tree and vine crops rallo et al 2021 standard kc represents the relative fraction of eto that is governed by the amount type and condition of a given crop type under standard pristine conditions and is regarded as generally transferable among regions subject to adjustment for local climate under the assumption that the eto accounts for nearly all weather related etc variation when a crop is cultivated under water and or saline stress or under specific management conditions differing from pristine conditions well watered homogeneous crop without yield limitations from water stress nutrient availability salinity pests or disease the actual crop et is affected relative to the potential etc i e etc act etc thus a stress coefficient has to be considered as etc act ks kc eto ks 1 0 unless available soil water and or salinity limits transpiration in which case ks 1 0 allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 in the case of tree and vine crops etc and kc values are assumed as standard when cropping conditions are nearly pristine but may involve some beneficial water stress aimed at maximizing crop yield and quality in addition to the single kc a dual kc is proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 i e kc kcb ke where kcb refers to crop transpiration and ke refers to the evaporation from the soil the estimation of ke from the fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation fc is described in allen et al 1998 this partition is detailed by allen et al 2005a and its modelling is described by rosa et al 2012 adopting the dual kc approach and the use of ks results in eq 1 1 k c act k s k cb k e which shows that ks applies only to kcb which represents the transpiration component the fao segmented approach is commonly adopted to describe the kc and kcb curves where the four linear segments represent the initial development mid season and late season periods the fao kc curve requires knowledge of only three key values kc ini for the initial period kc mid during the midseason period and kc end at the end of the late season doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 however many authors do not adopt the fao kc curve and do not distinguish mid and end season kc in their reporting e g defining kc or kcb as a non linear function of time after planting which may be appropriate for local use but limits the subsequent relevance and transferability of their research results to different locations the derivation of kc and kcb values from field data requires that etc is accurately determined as discussed in the recent kc reviews pereira et al 2021a 2021b rallo et al 2021 those field based etc measurements are appropriate for research purposes but are generally impractical for grower use due to complexity and expense nevertheless as discussed in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 kc and kcb values can be accurately estimated through their relationship with the ground fraction covered or shadowed by the crop canopy fc the height h of the vegetation and the relative amount of stomatal adjustment under moist soil conditions this approach was initially proposed in fao56 further developed by allen and pereira 2009 and was extensively tested in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 where it is referred to as the a p approach however it must be taken into consideration that kcb and kc values estimated with this approach kcb a p and kc a p are not standard but actual values since stress often occurs in practice which affects fc crop h and the relative stomatal resistance nevertheless when computations are performed using parameters obtained under optimal pristine cropping conditions the estimated kcb a p and kc a p may be considered to represent standard values the study by allen and pereira 2009 is often quoted when users compare kcb from field research with paper tabulated kcb values e g for strawberries lozano et al 2016 vineyards moratiel and martínez cob 2012 picón toro et al 2012 poblete echeverrı a et al

kcb with remote sensing vegetation indices are also reported pôças et al 2015 2020 in various cases parameters proposed by allen and pereira 2009 were not modified when the approach is used to

plays an important role as for water stressed rainfed maize wu et al 2015 grasslands wu et al 2016 and intercrop cultivation miao et al 2016 direct computation of kcb with the a p approach often

2012 and olive paço et al 2019 conceição et al 2017 puppo et al 2019 including to non irrigated water stressed olive groves santos et al 2012 applications also include crops not previously considered such as chinese tamarisk li et al 2015 an application to perennial crops aimed at water resources balance studies is reported for california by devine and o geen 2019 studies relative to orchards demonstrate the need for modifying the empirical equation by defining the impacts of stomatal adjustment which is adopted in this study on basis of research reported by taylor et al 2015 2017 for orange orchards and mobe et al 2020 for apples the a p approach has been adopted by the satellite irrigation management support sims for use with remote sensing data for mapping crop et in california and the western united states us that application to vegetable field and fruit tree and vine crops with the sims system shows its usability for wide area mapping of crop et and for delivery of data and information for irrigation management to farmers melton et al 2012 2020 crop specific tests using sims compared with ground based et measurements were performed to evaluate system accuracy melton et al 2018 wang et al 2021 the companion paper pereira et al 2020 discussed the feasibility of the practical use of the a p approach and tested the use and variability of the parameters ml and fr used in the computations for several vegetable field tree and vine crops with fc and h obtained from ground and remote sensing observations that study also revised approaches used to derive fc and h using ground and remote sensing observations the objectives of the current study considering the reviews and tests reported in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 consist of providing for the usability of the a p approach in the field by practitioners using available fc and h data as well as to parameterize the approach for a wide variety of crops the aims include tabulating values for kcb and related computation parameters and performing their cross validation with independent data sets to assess the accuracy of kcb estimation it is expected that the tabulated parameters will facilitate the use of the a p approach in the practice of et based irrigation management and will support increased adoption of data driven irrigation with associated advances in on farm water use efficiency this article is organized into the following sections designed to assist the reader in locating information that is relevant to their intended use and practical application the section 2 describes the computational approach section 3 presents a summary of the data and parameterization of the a p as well as of the procedures used while section 4 consist of the presentation of the tabulated parameters and the kc and kcb values computed with the a p approach concluding with the cross validation of the tabulated parameters for vegetable field crops and vine and fruit tree crops section 5 provides conclusions and recommendations 2 estimating kcb from the fraction of ground cover and crop height for expanses of vegetation large enough that an equilibrium boundary is established so that general one dimensional equations such as the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 apply a maximum upper limit on et is established due to the law of conservation of energy therefore for large expanses of vegetation larger than about 500 to 2 000 m2 the kc development process has upper limits for kc of 1 2 1 3 for the grass reference however under conditions of clothesline effects where vegetation height exceeds that of the surroundings or oasis effects where vegetation has higher soil water availability than the surroundings the peak kc values may exceed those limits caution is required when extrapolating et measurements from small vegetation plots to large stands or regions because estimation errors of et may occur following the a p approach the basal kcb because it primarily represents transpiration depends upon the amount of vegetation and can be expressed as a function of a density coefficient kd as 2 k cb k c min k d k cb full k c min where kcb is approximated for conditions represented by the density coefficient kd kcb full is the estimated basal kc during peak plant growth for conditions having nearly full ground cover or lai 3 and kc min is the minimum basal kc for bare soil 0 15 under typical agricultural conditions examples of application to several crops are given by pereira et al 2020 for tree crops having grass or other ground cover eq 2 takes a different form to consider transpiration by the active ground cover thus 3 k cb k cb cover k d max k cb full k cb cover k cb full k cb cover 2 where kcb cover is the kcb of the active ground cover in the absence of tree foliage the second term of the max function reduces the estimate for kcb mid by half the difference between kcb full and kc cover when this difference is negative this accounts for impacts of shading by vegetation when kcb kcb cover due to differences in stomatal conductance eq 3 applies to estimate kcb during any period two application examples are provided by fandiño et al 2012 and cancela et al 2015 as described by allen and pereira 2009 the approach of eq 3 can be similarly applied to estimate a single kc coefficient the value for kcb full represents a general upper limit on kcb mid for vegetation having full ground cover and lai 3 under full water supply kcb full can be approximated as a function of mean plant height and adjusted for climate following allen et al 1998 4 k cb ful l f r min 1 0 k h h 1 20 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where u2 is average daily wind speed m s 1 at a height of 2 m above ground level during the growth period rhmin is average daily minimum relative humidity during the growth period and h is the mean plant height m during midseason eq 4 suggests that an upper bound for kcb full is 1 20 prior to climatic adjustment effects of crop height are considered through the sum 1 kh h with kh 0 1 for tree and vine crops as well as tall field crops and kh 0 2 for short crops and vegetables pereira et al 2020 eq 4 produces increases in kcb full with plant height and when local climates are more arid or windier than standard climate conditions the parameter fr applies an empirical downward adjustment fr 1 0 if the vegetation exhibits more stomatal adjustment on transpiration than is typical of most annual agricultural crops fr is near 1 0 for annual crops cultivated under non stressed pristine conditions and decreases when crops are water or salinity stressed for trees and vines fr is high when crops exhibit great vegetative vigor and decreases by effect of pruning and training as well as limited water supply examples are provided in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 adopting the allen et al 1998 definition for fr considering the variability of leaf resistance from annual to perennial crops it is assumed 5 f r γ 1 0 34 u 2 γ 1 0 34 u 2 r l r t y p where rl and rtyp are respectively the mean leaf resistance and the typical leaf resistance s m 1 for the vegetation in question δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure vs air temperature curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 both relative to the period when kcb full is computed the original version of that equation was established with a fixed rtyp 100 s m 1 a common value for annual crops the fr equation is rewritten to cover a wider range of typical leaf resistances for a variety of crops including the perennials important to note that fr applies to kcb full in the direct calculation of actual or standard kcb eqs 2 and 3 as adopted by allen and pereira 2009 and pereira et al 2020 while ks applies to convert standard kcb into kcb act when performing a soil water balance to a stressed crop e g rosa et al 2012 wu et al 2015 2016 giménez et al 2017 minhas et al 2020 the original fr eq 5 was developed to empirically consider the effects of stomatal adjustment on kcb full and therefore on kcb in response to water stress allen et al 1998 since stomatal closure causes a decrease of transpiration thus of kcb and kc stomatal adjustment processes were quite well known for annual crops monteith 1965 van bavel and ehrler 1968 hsiao 1973 szeicz et al 1973 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 chaves 1991 mcnaughton and jarvis 1991 it was also known that stomatal adjustment processes varied among crops and throughout the crop cycle and that leaf aging favors stomatal closure in response to water stress relative to younger leaves jordan et al 1975 stomatal adjustment in fruit trees and grapevine was less well known but despite leaf resistances are much higher it the process is coherent with that of annual crops cohen and cohen 1983 chaves and rodrigues 1987 steinberg et al 1989 winkel and rambal 1990 the effect of stomatal adjustment processes on transpiration could therefore be characterized by empirical adjustment of fr eq 5 was developed previously using a default rtyp value of 100 s m 1 but default fr values were indicated by allen and pereira 2009 for tree and vine crops fr serves to adjust kcb full for considering effects of stomatal adjustment in relation to typical leaf resistance associated with a given crop type and growth stage this adjustment is particularly important for perennials which have a fr behavior different from annuals as referred by allen and pereira 2009 the standard value for fr is 1 0 for annuals before leaf senescence i e when rl is close to rtyp fr decreases during the late season when senescence develops and stomatal closure increases for perennials fr not only decreases during the late season but is smaller than 1 0 when pruning and training reduce the vigor of the plant good results were obtained assuming that the fr values are estimated with empirical consideration of stomatal adjustment for various annual and perennial crops pereira et al 2020 thus not measuring stomatal resistances however different approaches may have to be used when dealing with various orchards of the same crop but having different varieties planting spacings and fc values mobe et al 2020 using observed apple rl found that fr was over estimated when using the ratio rl 100 proposed by allen et al 1998 and by allen and pereira 2009 thus they replaced the 100 s m 1 value with a resistance parameter representing the minimum unstressed canopy resistance for apple trees following this adjustment kcb a p was able to match the kcb derived from eddy covariance ec measurements over the 12 orchards evaluated in the study the earlier studies by taylor et al 2015 2017 relative to citrus orchards and the mobe et al 2020 modification of fr originated the current change in eq 5 using a numerical search procedure focusing on fr not requiring to observe rl and rtyp it was possible to find fr values for various crop stages allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020 this empirical approach may however be tested when rl could be measured a density coefficient kd used in eqs 2 and 3 describes the increase in kc with increases in the amount of vegetation where estimates of the fraction of ground surface covered by vegetation fc are available the kd is estimated as allen and pereira 2009 6 k d min 1 m l f c eff f c eff 1 1 h where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation 0 01 1 near solar noon ml is a multiplier on fc eff describing the effect of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative et per fraction of ground shaded 1 0 2 0 and h is the mean vegetation height m the fc eff parameter is often observed as the shaded area near noon between 11 00 and 15 00 or as the fraction of intercepted light or the intercepted photosynthetic active radiation as reviewed by pereira et al 2020 estimation of fc eff for row crops was described by fao56 and for trees was provided by allen and pereira 2009 as with sims remotely sensed vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi can be used to estimate fc eff for agricultural crops johnson and trout 2012 melton et al 2012 the ml multiplier on fc eff in eq 6 imposes an upper limit on the relative magnitude of transpiration per unit of ground area as represented by fc eff allen et al 1998 it is expected to usually range from 1 0 to 2 0 depending on the canopy density and thickness and will have a low value when the canopy transparency to solar radiation is higher the value for ml should be modified to fit the specific vegetation and the respective crop stage as reported by allen and pereira 2009 and pereira et al 2020 as well as by several users as analyzed in section 3 1 as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 where lai m2 m 2 can be observed or estimated kd can be alternatively estimated as 7 k d 1 e 0 7 lai where lai is defined as the leaf area per area of ground surface averaged over a large area with consideration of only one side of green healthy leaves active in vapor transfer and 0 7 is a common value for the light extinction coefficient kex used for annual crops e g for maize ding et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 and tomato zheng et al 2013 however the extinction coefficient changes with the crop type crop density lai and over the course of the growing season e g flenet et al 1996 zhang et al 2014 a different exponent in eq 7 may be used if more appropriate information is available for the specific crop considered or a numerical search is performed as reported for applications to shrubs kex 0 46 li et al 2015 and vineyards kex 0 32 zhao et al 2018 3 methods data and parameterization of the a p approach 3 1 parameterization of the a p approach requirements for parameterization of the a p approach refer to the parameter fr used in the calculation of kcb full eqs 4 and 5 and ml used in the computation of the density coefficient kd eq 6 both kd and kcb full are used when computing kcb for any crop with or without active ground cover eqs 2 and 3 it has been observed pereira et al 2020 that fr plays a primary role particularly for trees and vines the selection of fr and ml values is performed through a numerical search for the values of the parameters that make kcb a p to match the tabulated kcb tab values the kcb a p are those computed with the a p approach and the kcb tab are those tabulated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 the procedure consists of 1 selecting initial values for fr and ml 2 computing crop kcb a p for observed known values of fc and h and comparing the resulting kcb a p with the standard tabulated kcb tab for the same crop 3 repeating the computations using an iterative numerical search where the initial fr values are progressively changed but are constrained by the limits of fr maximum is 1 0 and minimum is 0 25 and comparing the resulting kcb a p with kcb tab values for the same crop progressively decreasing the differences between both values until that difference is negligible 4 when a fr value is selected the calculations are performed with the fr value obtained in the previous calculation set now changing ml within its interval 1 0 2 0 however with a smaller minimum of 0 3 for the initial phase of annual crops aiming at minimizing the difference between kcb a p with kcb tab 5 if increasing or decreasing ml leads to increases in the difference between kcb a p and kcb tab then the last value for ml is retained as well as the fr used in the calculation however if the difference decreases a new run must be conducted until an ml value is found that minimizes the difference the value selected for fr in step 3 should remain fixed throughout steps 4 and 5 but it may be required to apply again the numerical search focusing fr 6 the procedure ends when the difference kcb a p kcb tab is minimized and values for both ml and fr are selected the target standard kcb tab values for vegetable field tree and vine crops have been reviewed and updated in three papers of the current special issue pereira et al 2021a 2021b rallo et al 2021 ancillary data published in these papers as well as fc and h data published in allen and pereira 2009 were used to define the fraction of ground cover and crop height used with the current application of the a p approach to better represent actual conditions in production agriculture fc values obtained from a remote sensing rs survey described below in section 3 2 and table 5 were also considered the fc data have considerable variability for both the mid and late season because fc is strongly dependent on various facets of crop management nevertheless it was possible to select for each crop a fc value that is assumed to represent the most common fc values at the initial mid and end seasons and to associate these values with crop heights to compute kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end for every vegetable field tree and vine crop when these data were not available in the referenced review papers a precise approach to compute fc eff from raw fc data as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 could not be adopted because it was not possible to establish a well defined sun angle thus the raw fc values were used as the best estimator of fc eff it is however assumed that in practice in the field ground and remote observations of fc may be performed accurately as already reviewed in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 in the a p approach kcb eqs 2 and 3 depends upon the definition of a kc min value the estimation of kcb full eq 4 and the estimation of kd eqs 6 or 7 for all annual crops kc min was set to 0 15 following the recommendations of allen et al 1998 and allen and pereira 2009 for perennial crops a value of kc min 0 05 was adopted for all orchard and vine crops to avoid the situation where computations of kcb mid could be larger than kcb full kd was estimated from ml fc eff and h eq 6 the parameter ml is a multiplier on fc eff describing the effect of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative et per fraction of ground shaded considered to represent the transparency of the crop canopy to solar radiation it is expected to usually range from 1 5 to 2 0 during mid season when fc is high and varies with the canopy density and thickness in contrast ml is low when the canopy transparency to solar radiation is higher for example during the initial crop stages when fc is small thus low ml value are assumed in the initial crop development stage while in contrast a high ml close to 2 0 was assumed for the mid season to increase the effects of fc in addition a lower value was considered for the end season when fc is generally decreased relative to the mid season values of ml for annuals and perennials retrieved from the literature are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively during the mid season ml values ranged 1 5 2 0 those values should depend on the leaf cutout type insertion angle of the leaves number of overlapping leaf layers canopy architecture which directly influence the crop canopy transparence to solar radiation in this approach crops with more vertical production training systems or with less leaf density or with leaves of very small dimension were consider having lower ml values crops with leaves still active at harvest such as the evergreen were suggested to have ml mid ml end however the effect of the ml value on kd depends upon the effect of the exponent 1 1 h of fc eff in eq 6 which decreases when h increases the use of diverse ml values in the range from 1 5 2 0 do not influence kd for crops with h 3 0 and fc 0 60 thus for the considered vegetable crops grain legumes fiber oil and sugar crops and cereals the values of ml reported do not induce changes in kd values for the mid and end season in contrast for the initial stage where fc is around 0 10 low ml values were selected since using large ml values would excessively increase kd a smaller range of ml values was adopted for orchards and vines however it was observed that the computation of kd was highly determined by h in the exponent 1 1 h of fc eff for perennials the selected ml values impacted kd when fc 0 60 i e for low and medium density and young orchards this is the case of olive orchards wine grapes and table grapes trained with a t trellis as referred before the parameter fr 1 0 applies an empirical downward adjustment if the vegetation exhibits more stomatal adjustment on transpiration than is typical of most agricultural crops i e when the leaf resistance rl is greater than the typical leaf resistance eq 5 values of fr used in previous studies are presented in table 3 for vegetable and field crops and in table 4 for fruit trees and vines values for vegetable and field crops correspond to nearly pristine non stressed cropping conditions i e when stomatal adjustment is small or not occurring and fr values at mid season are equal or close to 1 0 when crops vegetable are harvested green and the late season is very short stomatal adjustment is very limited or does not typically occur thus fr values at the end season are also equal or close to 1 0 in contrast for field crops harvested dry or nearly dry stomatal adjustment occurs during the late season with the result that fr decreases to near 0 30 by the end season low fr values ranging from 0 20 to 0 45 were obtained for the end season of crops drying in the field pereira et al 2020 for silage where stomatal adjustment is limited at harvesting an intermediate value of fr 0 65 was used for the end season for trees and vines the fr assumed was almost always a value 1 0 table 4 the variability of the reported values and the use of numerical search make it difficult to explain the results published in the literature results for wine grapes show that there is an influence of the training and management of the vineyard as well as an influence of the varieties on stomatal adjustment thus on fr souza et al 2005 rodrigues et al 2008 costa et al 2012 results also show the influence of management namely irrigation management since higher fr values refer to training with pergola trellis in case of wine grapes and to overhead trellis systems in vineyards for table grapes where supplemental irrigation is adopted there is a great variability of fr values for citrus and olives table 4 that is associated with irrigation management and crop varieties fr values are smaller for olives because these trees present an important stomatal adjustment in response to water stress fernández et al 1997 moriana et al 2002 tognetti et al 2009 fernández 2014 perez martin et al 2014 in terms of management the low fr values reported indicate that applied irrigation in orchards used in the studies cited was far from the full satisfaction of crop water requirements despite the fact that production was high i e the beneficial deficit irrigation in olives is large citrus also present strong stomatal adjustment to cope with water stress since a heavy beneficial deficit irrigation is often practiced obiremi and oladele 2001 poggi et al 2007 ribeiro and machado 2007 in contrast a small beneficial deficit irrigation is practiced with pome trees stone fruit trees and nut trees which is due to commonly managing irrigation using partial root drying thus resulting a in smaller stomatal adjustment o connell and goodwin 2007a 2007b and resulting fr values close or equal to 1 0 through the mid season table 4 it is important to note that temperate deciduous trees have a large daily variability in both kcb and stomatal conductance villalobos et al 2013 however almond trees show stomatal adjustment during summer romero and botía 2006 rouhi et al 2007 karimi et al 2015 espadafor et al 2017 with fr values of 1 0 during late season leaves start yellowing stomata close and leaf conductance decreases resulting in lower values for fr by the end season table 4 the complexity of abiotic factors and the differences among crop varieties or species referred above demonstrate that the parameterization of fr can only be performed with a numerical search procedure when this procedure cannot be applied users may adopt the ml and fr values presented in this study particularly those given in next sections for a variety of annual and perennial crops which were obtained applying a numerical search procedure whose initial values of the searched parameters are those in tables 1 4 the estimation of the parameters ml and fr used in the a p approach is subject to error pereira et al 2020 evaluated crop coefficients for a wide range of crops calculated using the a p approach driven with fc and h against results from prior studies that derived kc and kcb values from field measured data with simultaneously observed fc and h comparisons of kcb values computed with the a p method against results from these studies produced regression coefficients close to 1 0 and coefficients of determination 0 92 except for orchards expected errors and or challenges with orchards are higher due to effects of pruning training and crop varieties 3 2 single and basal crop coefficients the numerical search to determine ml and fr values using the a p approach described in section 3 1 focused on evaluation of kcb values only inclusion of corresponding kc values in tables 6 10 is also valuable for practical use and the approach used to calculate the corresponding kc values for each crop type is described below for vegetable and field crops kc mid and kc end values were determined from kcb mid and kcb end as performed in fao56 allen et al 1998 kc mid values were calculated by adding 0 05 to kcb mid values while kc end was obtained by adding 0 05 or 0 10 to kcb end values with the additive value of 0 05 for crops harvested green thus also following the estimation approaches used by pereira et al 2021a 2021b when computing kc end from the kcb end values for trees and vines kc mid was also computed when adding 0 05 to kcb mid while kc end was obtained by adding a specific value in the range 0 05 0 40 to kcb end this simple procedure used in fao56 allen et al 1998 can be modified when the user knows the expected behavior of the crop at the end of the season as described by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 kc ini values were not tabulated in those studies focused on updating kc values for vegetable and field crops and tree and vine crops during the initial crop stage of annuals the ground cover is very small as well as h as a result the variability of kc ini relates to soil evaporation and factors controlling it such as the frequency of wettings by rainfall the frequency and depth of irrigation applications the fraction of soil wetted by irrigation which relates with the irrigation method and the presence of plastic mulches plastic tunnels organic mulching or soil residue management with such a variety of influencing factors it is not possible to tabulate values for kc ini and it was not possible to derive related values from the reviewed papers for deciduous trees and vines the initial phase also has small fc values and the variability of kc ini is similar to that described for annuals in contrast for evergreen crops fc is much higher and the role of soil evaporation is reduced however there is little information on kc ini reported for those tree crops the rice crop is an exception because when flooded or when the soil is kept close to saturation kc ini does not vary as it does for other cereal crops therefore the approach used by pereira et al 2021b was adopted herein as a result differences between kc ini and kcb ini values for rice are the same as those determined by pereira et al 2021b fao56 provided indicative kc ini values corresponding to the most common conditions i e a standard sub humid climate where minimum relative air humidity equals 45 and wind speed is of 2 m s 1 surface irrigation was used and the soil was maintained bare the fao56 tabulated kc ini and kcb ini values were provided as indicative values having large errors than tabulated standard kc mid and kc end values as well as the kcb mid and kcb end therefore due to the variability of conditions determining crop et during the initial crop period we did not include kc ini values instead the computational procedures proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 and by allen et al 2005b are recommended simple models can be used for that purpose for the dual kc approach the value kcb ini 0 15 is the recommended default value for annuals since it represents average conditions from bare soil with fraction of ground cover fc 0 10 it is assumed to include diffusive or residual evaporation from soil for potentially long periods following a wetting allen et al 2005a however under dry conditions with long periods between wettings or during the non growing season kcb ini can be set much lower even close to 0 in contrast the evaporation coefficient ke should be computed taking into consideration all the factors affecting soil evaporation as detailed by allen et al 2005a nevertheless the values of kc ini tabulated in fao56 in allen and pereira 2009 and in jensen and allen 2016 are recommended indicative values for trees and vines 3 3 fraction of ground cover from remote sensing in california when combined with information on crop height information on expected maximum fc values can be useful in calculating maximum expected kcb values for a range of crops using the a p approach determination of a representative average crop height h is typically less difficult than estimation of average fc at field scales to provide a characterization of typical expected maximum fc values for a range of crops the satellite irrigation management support sims melton et al 2012 2020 framework conducted an analysis using landsat satellite data combined with field boundary and crop type information for all irrigated lands in california obtained from the california agricultural commissioners and sealers association cacasa database for 2016 sims combines satellite based measurements of ndvi and fc with the a p approach and a soil water balance model to provide support for mapping of crop coefficients and crop evapotranspiration across the western u s sims was developed to increase access to satellite derived et data by agricultural producers to inform irrigation management california was selected as the site for this analysis since more than 400 different crops are produced in the state and detailed field boundaries and crop type information reported by famers were available for the state in 2016 while the sims framework was used to support the satellite data processing and computations only the algorithms for calculation of fc from ndvi were used for this analysis atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data for 2016 for all of california were obtained from the collection of landsat data on google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 including usgs landsat collection 1 for the enhanced thematic mapper etm on landsat 7 and the operational land imager oli on landsat 8 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data were first calculated for each scene from the landsat surface reflectances using earth engine gorelick et al 2017 with a total of more than 1 900 landsat scenes processed for this analysis next fc was calculated from ndvi using eq 8 following johnson and trout 2012 8 f c 1 26 ndvi 0 18 johnson and trout 2012 and trout et al 2008 found robust relationships between ndvi and fc across a range of different crop types and canopy architectures eq 8 was derived based on in situ fc measurements of 49 commercial fields and 18 major crop types row crops grains orchard vineyard of varying maturity that were made on 11 landsat overpass dates in the san joaquin valley of california from april to october the studies found a strong linear relationship between ndvi and fc r 2 0 96 rmse 0 06 a shapefile containing the 2016 field boundaries and crop type information for more than 200 000 individual irrigated agricultural fields was used to define field boundaries and the crop type for each field the crop type information was reported by farmers during calendar year 2016 to the agricultural commissioners in each county in california as part of the pesticide use reporting process and composited into a geospatial database by cacasa for each field and each landsat scene the field average fc value was calculated using all cloud free pixels contained within each field boundary next for each field the maximum annual fc value was selected from the satellite overpass dates that spanned the growing season for each crop type for most annual crops vineyards and tree crops the maximum values from the period between may 1 and october 31 were used these dates were selected to correspond with the timing of peak canopy cover for a range of crops and also to minimize the influence of cover crops for vineyards and tree crops since it is not possible to discriminate between the crop canopy and the cover crop at the spatial resolution of landsat 30 m x 30 m however cover crops that may be present in the interrow for vineyards and orchards are typically mowed and rapidly senescing in california in may well before the vine and tree canopies reach maximum fc in mature orchards and vineyards as such cover crops were expected to have a minimal influence on the maximum annual fc value calculated for each field in cases where an irrigated cover crop persists throughout the summer users would need to employ eq 3 to account separately for the kcb for the cover crop and the kcb for the vine or tree for alfalfa and cereal crops we selected the maximum values from the period between january 1 and october 31 we then collated the data from all fields by crop type and selected both the 75th and 95th percentile values for each crop type we selected the 75th percentile value to represent an expected maximum fc value for a typical well irrigated crop grown under near ideal conditions but with some heterogeneity across the field due to variability in soil conditions distribution uniformity of irrigation or the presence of pests or pathogens in isolated regions in the field we selected the 95th percentile value to represent an expected upper limit on fc for a well irrigated crop grown under ideal conditions and with very little heterogeneity across the field for perennial crops the maximum fc values are also representative of mature orchards and vineyards any crop types with fewer than 50 fields sampled were excluded from the analysis table 5 reports the 75th and 95th percentile of the maximum annual fc values fc 75 and fc 95 measured using satellite data over california for each annual crop type the number of fields n of each crop type included in the analysis and used to calculate fc 75 and fc 95 are also included in table 1 these fc values can be combined with direct measurements of h for specific fields or typical maximum h values listed in tables 2 4 below to support assessment of typical maximum kcb values using the a p approach these values represent expected maximum values under ideal conditions and lower kcb values would be expected for immature orchard and vineyard crops deficit irrigation nutrient deficiencies or due to the presence of plant pests and pathogens in the current study fc values between the tabulated fc 75 and fc 95 were used in combination with the fc max values tabulated in pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 relative to kcb and kc for vegetable field crops and perennials respectively to estimate the indicative fc values used to compute kcb and kc for these crops as presented in section 4 3 4 procedures used in computations predicted values for kcb and kc computed with the a p approach as well as the computational parameters used are presented and discussed in the following sections and tables 6 8 relative to vegetable crops tables 9 11 for field crops and tables 12 15 relative to tree and vine crops computations using the equations described in section 2 were performed following the same approach for all crops in particular 1 the calculations assume the standard sub humid climate adopted in fao56 i e average minimum relative humidity rhmin 45 and wind speed u2 2 m s 1 which results in an upper bound of kcb full 1 20 eq 4 2 the fc eff values for the mid season resulted from combining observed fc values collected from the literature tabulated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 with the 75th and 95th percentile fc 75 and fc 95 of remotely sensed fc values tabulated in table 5 unreasonable values were discarded generally the values considered are intermediate between fc 75 and fc 95 a for crops not having fc values included in the above referred tables various additional sources were used artichoke grattan et al 1998 and visconti et al 2014 beans dry grattan et al 1998 and kim et al 2020 beets table gimenez et al 2002 and reid et al 2020 brussels sprout jones 1972 and everaarts et al 1998 castor bean li et al 2011 and sadras et al 2016 flax and linseed casa et al 2000 and kar et al 2007 lentils ayaz et al 2004 and mckenzie and andrews 2010 millet corlett et al 1992 and bello and walker 2016 mustard kar et al 2007 and gupta et al 2017 okra agba et al 2011 and konyeha and alatise 2013 spinach gimenez et al 2002 and nomura et al 2020 b fc values were not available for parsnip rutabaga and turnip thus we assumed mid season fc max similar respectively to radish and to table beet for the latter two c for crops that are not object of any study referring to fc or lai observations the fc values adopted herein considering the personal knowledge of the authors are assumed from comparing with similar crops for example values for rye and oats were selected based on comparison against values for wheat 3 crop heights were defined from those tabulated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 which resulted from combining observed values reported in the literature and referenced by the authors with h values tabulated in fao56 4 kc and kcb values were tabulated for vegetable and tree and vine crops assuming they are irrigated with drip irrigation with pipes and wetted area shadowed by the crop thus reducing evaporation of applied irrigation water for the field crops well managed sprinkler irrigation was considered to be the default irrigation type 5 cropping is assumed to be practiced with bare soil special practices such as the use of plastic films and organic mulches or small plastic tunnels were not considered due to the lack of information on the reductions in kc associated with these practices brief notes on their effects on kc were recently provided by jovanovic et al 2020 relative to the initial crop stage there was a lack of base information for appropriate parameterization for tree and vine crops therefore related kc ini values were not computed for the annual crops the main assumptions are discussed in section 3 2 the following may be relevant 1 the fc eff values for the initial period were assumed equal to 0 05 for all annual crops since by definition in fao56 allen et al 1998 fc varies from 0 up to 0 10 during that stage 2 the parameter ml was set to 0 30 for sown crops and 0 40 for transplanted crops these low ml values correspond to a very open canopy as occurs for small fc values 3 because the young plants are assumed not to require stomatal adjustment at this stage the value fr 1 0 was assumed for all annual crops these assumptions when considering the initial crop stage resulted in the common value of kcb full 1 0 and kcb ini 0 15 the latter in agreement with allen et al 1998 2005a 4 results 4 1 vegetable crops for roots tuber bulb and stem crops table 6 it has been generally assumed that h does not change from the mid season to the end season since crop senescence generally occurs over a short time period however this assumption is not true for various crops the case of asparagus is likely the most evident because harvesting is performed when the crop reduces to the asparagus spears which are much lower than the mid season vegetation in spite of the subsequent regrowth of the vegetative part of the crop after harvesting other exceptions include crops that have a longer late season to allow the crop to dry out before harvesting this is the case for garlic onion and long season potato fc eff is assumed not to change from mid to end season for crops having a very short late season carrots celery parsnip radish and turnip a small decrease in fc eff was considered for other crops having a short senescence period beets for table rutabaga and sweet potato changes in fc and h may also be made by users based on their observations and the way in which the crop is managed i e allowing for a longer or shorter senescence period the ml values for both the mid and end season are all in the range of 1 5 2 0 because that value does not influence the kd results eq 6 in contrast the ml value influences the computation of kd relative to the initial crop stage as already discussed in section 3 4 the fr values selected for the mid season were all very close or equal to 1 0 table 6 thus indicating that likely there was no stomatal adjustment since the roots tuber bulb and stem vegetable crops were considered not to be stressed and cropped under pristine conditions and because values used are based on computation of the standard kcb tab the numerical search procedure produced fr 1 0 for most of crops and fr 1 0 but close to 1 0 for asparagus carrots celery garlic radish rutabaga and turnip all the end season values for fr obtained through a numerical search procedure are all decreased relative to the mid season values when the late season is short and the product goes to the table with its typical colour and tenderness the end season fr is close to the mid season value as for table beets carrots celery green and seed onions parsnip radish rutabaga and turnip fr decreases substantially for asparagus because only the harvestable spears are present at harvesting a much lower fr value results for the crops that have a long late season and senesce before harvesting this is typically the case for garlic dry onion long late season potato and sweet potato therefore users should select the end season fr 1 0 for these crops taking into consideration the possible occurrence of stress which requires stomatal adjustment and the duration of the late season which is associated with crop senescence the computed values resulting from the a p application show kcb mid a p and kcb end a p values equal to the tabulated ones reported by pereira et al 2021a this is expected since the numerical search aimed at matching kcb a p with the kcb tab values the kc values were estimated as kc mid kcb mid 0 05 for a few crops asparagus potato radish sweet potato and turnip otherwise the additional term was 0 10 for kc end generally it differed from kcb end by 0 10 such differences are similar to those relative for roots tuber bulb and stem vegetable crops tabulated by pereira et al 2021a based upon observed values published in the literature the a p computation parameters used for leaves and flowers vegetable crops table 7 behave similarly to the roots tuber bulb and stem crops ml values were also 2 0 since the value for ml did not influence the kd value in contrast low values were used for the initial crop stage as reported earlier it was assumed that these crops were not stressed because the related kcb tab values are supposed to represent standard near to the pristine crop conditions however the numerical search procedure led to fr values slightly below 1 0 with the exception of lettuce since the late season is very short for these crops the result was that kcb end a p values were close to kcb mid a p values generally differing by 0 10 or 0 05 in agreement with the values tabulated by pereira et al 2021a kc mid a p and kc end a p were computed from kcb mid a p and kcb end a p respectively assuming a difference of 0 10 for all crops except artichoke and lettuce where that difference is 0 05 following the assumptions made in fao56 and pereira et al 2021a moreover it was observed that a p computed kc and kcb values for leaves and flowers vegetable crops are equal to the values tabulated by pereira et al 2021a which should be expected because the latter were used as target of the numerical search procedure used to find the best ml and fr parameters for most fruit and pod vegetable crops table 8 since the late season is short h values do not change from the mid season to the end season while fc eff was considered to decrease by 0 05 from the mid to the end season in agreement with the information provided by pereira et al 2021a however because these crops are harvested early no decreases were considered for cucumber and okra in contrast a decrease of 0 10 was assumed for squash and zucchini ml values close to 2 0 were assumed for all crops at both the mid and end season because the ml value does not influence the kd results eq 6 as for the previously discussed vegetable crops fr was assumed to be close to 1 0 for all fruit and pod vegetable crops during the mid season since the target kcb tab values pereira et al 2021a are standard not stressed and cultivated under nearly pristine conditions in contrast lower fr values were considered at harvest for all crops of this type since they have a relatively long late season especially chili pepper melon pumpkin squash and watermelon the computed kcb end a p values are smaller than kcb mid a p values in all cases but just slightly smaller in the case of produce that are consumed fresh e g bell pepper cucumber eggplant okra strawberries and tomato when predicting crop coefficients for vegetable crops users of the a p approach should verify that the assumptions describe above are appropriate for their local environment crop varieties and management and therefore if the default values for the ml and fr parameters presented in this paper can be used as defaults in their computations with observed fc and h when the crops are stressed the application of the a p approach may also be performed using observed fc and h and a reduced fr value 4 2 field crops table 9 presents the results of the application of the a p approach to grain legumes and includes the parameters used in the computations in all cases h values decreased from the mid season to the end season due to crop senescence but decreases in h values are small when grain pods are harvested green or fresh as occurs for bean grams and fava bean crops fc eff by the end season is always smaller than at the mid season particularly when grain legumes are harvested dry similar to the vegetable crops ml at the mid season equals 2 0 fr values are equal or near to 1 0 for all crops during the mid season since it is assumed that the crops are not stressed and are cultivated in the pristine conditions represented by standard crop coefficients pereira et al 2021b fr values at end season are close to 1 0 when the crop is cultivated for harvesting green as it happens for bean black or green gram and fava bean when harvesting at the green pods stage and to peas harvested for processing in contrast fr is low when the crop is harvested with dry grains which happens with most crops listed in table 9 all fr values were obtained with a numerical search procedure targeting the kcb mid tab and kcb end tab values tabulated by pereira et al 2021b therefore the adopted parameters ml and fr are those appropriate for predicting kcb a p of grain legume crops in agreement with values tabulated by pereira et al 2021b the kc mid a p values were estimated by adding 0 05 to the kcb mid a p values and the kc end a p values were estimated by adding 0 10 to the kcb end a p values exceptions refer to the cases when the late season is very short such as peas harvested for processing for dry grain production kcb a p and kc a p values for the end season are much smaller than at mid season results for fiber oil and sugar crops are reported in table 10 the h values are assumed to slightly decrease after the mid season with the exception of sugar beet and sugar cane for which h values do not decrease as per the information used by pereira et al 2021b similarly slight decreases of fc eff are also assumed for all crops ml was assumed to equal 2 0 as for other field crops since kd at the mid and end season does not change computed fr values through the numerical search procedure revealed values that were equal or close to 1 0 at the mid season all but the sugar crops dry out in the field and have a large late season therefore fr decreases to values below 0 40 for fiber and oil crops down to values smaller than 0 25 in case of canola safflower and sunflower in contrast fr values at end season are larger for the sugar crops coherently the kcb end a p values are much lower than kcb mid a p with the exception of the sugar crops which are kept green until harvest and have kcb end a p values of 0 75 or higher kc a p values were computed assuming a difference relative to kcb a p of 0 05 at the mid season for the end season that difference is 0 10 for cotton canola castor bean sugar beet and sugar cane in agreement with tabulated values in fao56 and pereira et al 2021b results for cereals table 11 show a similar behaviour among crops however with large differences in the case of rice the values for h are generally slightly smaller at the end season after a long late season when senescence occurs similarly fc eff also slightly decreases after the mid season ml values of 2 0 were adopted for all crops and both the mid and end seasons since only very low values not appropriate for the considered vegetable and field crops would influence the computation of kd the numerical search procedure which used as the target the kcb tab values tabulated by pereira et al 2021b values for fr in the mid season are close or equal to 1 0 and much smaller fr values at the end season the latter are quite small around 0 20 when harvested with low moisture and around 0 45 with high moisture since in that case the late season is relatively short fr decreases much less when the crop is harvested for silage or is used as biomass for energy because the late season is then short following the tabulated values in fao56 allen et al 1998 and in the review paper by pereira et al 2021b the kc a p values generally are just 0 05 higher than kcb a p for all cereals during the mid season and for most of them at the end season table 11 exceptions include maize for silage grain and sweet sorghum and wheat harvested with high moisture grain whose kc end a p result from adding 0 10 to kcb end a p thus when the crop does not dry much before harvesting as expected the kcb a p and kc a p values from the numerical search procedure fully match the tabulated values in pereira et al 2021b which favours the use ml and fr parameters as default parameters by any user of the a p approach that intends to determine crop coefficients from observed values of fc and h for flooded paddy rice table 11 regardless of use of dry seeding and adopting or not anticipated cut off for intermittently irrigated rice and for aerobic irrigated rice the ml parameter behaves similarly to other cereals in contrast to other cereals fr 1 0 at the initial and through the crop season until the end of the mid season decreasing just a little from the mid season to the end season which is likely due to the water regime of rice paddies it results in a kcb end a p value generally equal to kcb mid a p except when the anticipated cut off is adopted kc mid a p is larger than kcb mid a p by a value varying from 0 05 to 0 15 depending upon the soil water regime with the larger difference for the intermittent irrigation mode differences for the end season are greater when anticipated cut off or intermittent irrigation are adopted because a lower soil water content is then produced at harvesting aerobic irrigated rice shows a behaviour that is in between intermittently irrigated paddies and upland cereals like wheat 4 3 tree and vine crops indicative values for standard kcb and kc for tree and vine fruit crops computed with the a p approach are presented in table 12 for vines table 13 for evergreen trees table 14 for pome fruits and pomegranate and table 15 for stone fruits and nut deciduous trees the crop parameters used for the computations are also tabulated to support applications by users the kcb a p and kc a p values refer only to the mid season and end season and to cultivation under conditions with no ground cover computations do not refer to kcb ini or kc ini because the initial season is short soil evaporation is dominant in the case of vines and deciduous trees during the initial season and soil evaporation varies with the soil water the frequency and amounts of wettings by rain and irrigation and the soil hydrodynamic properties in the case of evergreen crops kcb ini and kc ini are tied with kcb and kc relative to the non growing season which varies with the climate crop coefficients for the end season are also tied with kc and kcb for the non growing season and are also largely dependent upon the local climate therefore calculations refer to kcb a p and kc a p relative to the mid and end season which are largely dependent upon the dynamics of transpiration the option to disregard active ground cover is due to on the one hand the decreased trend in adoption of active ground cover in orchards and vineyards and on the other hand the fact that kcb a p calculation requires the use of a specific equation eq 3 and thus a different parameterization for active cover crops however the result is not far from that calculated without crop cover e g fandiño et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 crop heights were defined from those tabulated in fao56 in table 2 of allen and pereira 2009 and in tables 5 7 of rallo et al 2021 for vine crops evergreen trees and deciduous trees respectively however h values were selected considering the current trends for high densities and vigour reducing rootstocks aimed to facilitate mechanized harvesting which implies shorter crop heights changes in h from the mid season to end season were not considered the values for fc eff resulted from combining the remote sensing observed fc values tabulated in table 5 those previously tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 and observed values reported in literature and tabulated by rallo et al 2021 ml and fr values were obtained through the numerical search aimed at matching the standard values tabulated by rallo et al 2021 considering crop density and training systems as well as the selected fc and h tabulated by these authors because kcb values tabulated in rallo et al 2021 refer to a central value 10 the numerical search was applied targeting two values the central one kcb a p and the upper one kcb a p 10 computations for grapes table 12 were performed with consideration of training and fc given that kcb a p is influenced primely by training and fc and secondarily by h these factors lead generally to larger fc and h values for table grapes compared to wine grapes resulting in larger kcb a p values for table grapes for all vines kc mid a p resulted from adding 0 05 to kcb mid a p in agreement with the simplified procedure used in fao56 allen et al 1998 and in rallo et al 2021 this approach results from the fact that drip irrigation systems are commonly used with vines and thus only a small fraction of soil is wetted by irrigation most of the wetted soil area is under the shadow of the vine canopy and thus only a limited amount of solar energy reaches the soil surface also limiting the amount of soil water evaporation in contrast following rallo et al 2021 kc end a p values were obtained by adding 0 10 to kcb end a p when fc 0 30 and adding 0 05 when fc is higher the ml values were based upon those of table 2 used to initiate the numerical search procedure in contrast the fr values vary considerably and indicate that stomatal adjustment is applied by the crop since a beneficial deficit irrigation is commonly practiced to limit the vegetative vigour of the plants larger fr correspond to the larger kcb target when the numerical search was applied larger fr values for table grapes were observed for the young plants because the water deficits are then smaller and when the training system was overhead horizontal and t trellis for wine grapes the highest fr values are also associated with the young vineyards because less stress is then applied to the crop and to the training system of vertical shoot positioned trellis systems the variability of fr values was expected after the test results reported in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 and likely result from the variety of crop and irrigation management practices that influence the response of vineyards to various levels of stress kcb a p values for kiwi table 12 are not very high but fc is quite large likely because this vine is trained with pergola and t bar trellis systems kc a p values differ by 0 05 from kcb a p considering both high fc and h it results in a relatively high value for fr larger for the mid season and when the target kcb value is larger for the evergreen fruit trees table 13 in agreement with rallo et al 2021 kc mid a p was computed when adding 0 05 to kcb mid a p while kc end a p was obtained by adding a diverse amount to kcb end a p that amount decreases when fc increases i e when the canopy shaded area is larger for citrus trees the added value ranged from 0 25 in the young orchards where fc is small fc 0 25 to 0 10 in the high density orchards with fc 0 65 data for citrus table 13 was derived mainly from studies of orange trees but some information was also available for clementine and mandarin all information was assembled and it has been possible to distinguish the densities of crops fc and h the ml parameter varies little 1 6 1 7 and apparently plays a minor role in the computations the fr values are higher for the young plants since they are generally considered to be non stressed and to the orchards with taller trees and larger density i e when vegetative vigour of plants is larger specific to citrus orchards is the fact that the end season kcb a p is equal to kcb mid a p because senescence of leaves does not occur differently kc end a p is higher than kc mid a p because fruits grow and mature in winter when wetting events by precipitation are frequent data collected for olive trees made it possible to perform the calculations table 13 in relation to the density of trees and the main training types the traditional vase hedge pruned olives and hedgerow super intensive modern orchards the fc values are generally not high 0 45 and change little among the various types of orchards therefore the changes in kcb are also small the olive orchards have a larger kc end a p which is computed from the kcb end a p by adding 0 35 0 40 because the end season as well as the non growing season occur during the rainy period the parameter ml also plays a minor role and is approximately constant and equal to 1 5 since fc changes little among the considered types of orchards the fr values change little around 0 55 10 with values indicating a strong stomatal adjustment which is to be expected since pruning and training are designed to control the vigor of the trees while irrigation is practiced with application of limited volumes of water to be noted that the numerical search procedure led to fully match the target standard kcb tab values computations for apple and pear trees were performed individually in contrast to the approach used in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 despite the fact that central leader type of systems are generally adopted for both crops table 14 our approach was to group both crops with pomegranate trees which commonly have similar training systems the indicative kc mid a p values for pome fruit trees and pomegranate were calculated by adding 0 05 to the kcb mid a p value while the kc end a p values were obtained by adding 0 10 or 0 05 according to the fraction of ground cover larger when fc is smaller fc 0 35 i e for the young and low density orchards where soil evaporation is larger it was assumed that height and fc are more often larger for apple and due to the canopy opacity girona et al 2011 apple orchards have a slightly higher ml than pears it resulted in quite similar values for kd and kcb full therefore in kcb values that are also quite similar fr values are larger for the young orchards less stressed than the mature ones and for medium to very high density central leader systems when more vegetative vigour is allowed nevertheless all fr values denote stomatal adjustment since beneficial deficit irrigation is commonly practiced differences among stone fruits and nut trees were reported in the reviewed literature table 4 however the information on training was insufficient for all deciduous fruits and both vase and central leader systems were mentioned thus for all stone fruits and nut trees it was only possible to tie the calculations to the crop densities table 15 the indicative kc mid a p values in for stone fruits and nut trees were computed by adding 0 05 to kcb mid a p the kc end a p values were obtained by adding 0 10 or 0 05 to kcb end a p with the highest added value for young low and medium density orchards i e when the canopy shadow at the end season is reduced relative to stone fruits crop heights are higher for apricot cherry and plum orchards but fc ml and fr values were similar to those of peach nevertheless the kcb values calculated for these crops are quite similar but it is expected that differences in crop varieties and crop management practices will result in differences for kcb a p walnut trees are higher than pistachio trees and walnut orchards are likely denser than those of pistachio related crop training was not discussed in the reviewed literature therefore following rallo et al 2021 larger fc and h values were assumed for walnut orchards resulting in larger kcb a p values than for pistachio the application of the numerical search procedure led to similar ml values for the mentioned stone fruit and nut crops with lower values for the less dense orchards fr values were higher for the mid season and lower for the end season when stomatal adjustment is strong young orchards show higher fr values because training and pruning as well as irrigation promote large vegetative vigour higher density orchards with tall trees also result in large fr values 4 4 cross validation of the ml and fr parameters usability of the a p approach the results of the a p computation are overall excellent after the application of a numerical search procedure for estimating the best ml and fr parameters that procedure aimed at finding the ml and fr parameters that led the kcb a p values to match the kcb tab by pereira et al 2021a 2021b respectively for the vegetable and field crops and by rallo et al 2021 for tree and vine crops the close agreement may be observed in tables 6 8 for vegetable crops tables 9 11 for field crops and tables 12 15 for vines and trees by comparing the tabulated kcb a p values in the 7th 8th column with the target kcb tab values in the 10th 11th column with these results we could conclude that the ml and fr parameters are adequate to compute kcb with the fc and h data tabulated in the 3rd 4th column i e the data collected from pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 however there is the need for additional validation of these ml and fr parameters using independent data cross validation was therefore applied data available for the cross validation includes already published data on fc and h which consist of input data for the application of the a p approach and kcb obs data which are to be compared with the kcb a p for the comparison a linear regression forced through the origin was adopted input data refer to the following vegetable and legume crops onion lópez urrea et al 2009a 2009b pea paredes et al 2017 soybean wei et al 2015 giménez et al 2017 and tomato zheng et al 2013 field crops cereals barley pereira et al 2015a 2015b maize martins et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 giménez et al 2016 miao et al 2016 and wheat zhao et al 2013 sánchez et al 2015 miao et al 2016 oil and fiber crops canola sánchez et al 2014 sunflower miao et al 2016 and cotton rosa et al 2012 vine and tree crops wine grapes with bare soil lópez urrea et al 2012 peach paço et al 2012 olives paço et al 2019 and pear and lemon rosa 2019 the cross validation was performed using the parameters ml and fr obtained with the numerical search procedure to compute kcb a p using the observed fc and h determined in the studies referred above tables 5 15 and then comparing the resulting kcb a p with the reported kcb obs results for the annual crops are presented in fig 1 and for trees and vines in fig 2 they show a quasi equality between kcb a p and the reported kcb obs with the regression coefficient b0 very close to 1 0 and the coefficient of determination r2 also not far from 1 0 consequently the root mean square errors rmse are quite small rmse 0 06 for the three sets of annual crops and rmse 0 07 for the tree and vine crops these errors are less than 10 for most of the computed kcb a p values as well as the observed kcb obs the good statistical goodness of fit values for b0 r2 and rmse allow us to conclude that the parameters ml and fr tabulated and presented here are appropriate for use with the a p approach when a user seeks to estimate a kcb value using local observations of fc and h for annual crops the goodness of fit herein were obtained with selecting the fr and ml values relative to the considered crop but for tree and vine crops the computations were performed selecting the crop group having the pair fc and h closer to the observed fc and h the results in figs 1 and 2 indicate that selecting fr and ml with that simplicity is appropriate however users may use some kind of interpolation extrapolation of fr and secondly the ml considering the fc value observed and secondly the h value this means that using the a p approach adopting the tabulated parameters fr and ml is an adequate tool to estimate kcb for the crops referred herein thus for also estimating kc using the same relations between kc and kcb referred above since kcb and kc decrease when a crop is water and or salt stressed the a p approach is also usable when deficit irrigation or low quality water are applied with observed fc and height values reflecting the impacts of those stress conditions e g santos et al 2012 wu et al 2015 5 conclusions and recommendations the allen and pereira 2009 approach to estimate crop coefficients from the fraction of ground cover and crop height following the review and application tests developed in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 has been applied to a large variety of annual and perennial crops here application of the a p approach used fc collected from both ground observations and remote sensing supplemented by ground observed h values a numerical search procedure was used to specify ml and fr parameter values resulting in best match of kcb a p with the updated standard kcb tab values of pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 the initial values of ml and fr were those already published in the literature when those parameters were not available initial values were based on those of similar crops the numerical search facilitated the determination of optimal ml and fr values for all crops and showed excellent agreement with the updated kcb values for each crop indicative kcb and kc were tabulated for the mid and end season along with corresponding values of fc and h the respective optimized ml and fr values and of the tabulated kcb tab and kc tab used as the target in the search procedure to validate the accuracy of the approach we evaluated the computations of kcb against independent sets of observed data for a diverse set of vegetable field and fruit crops a linear regression demonstrated a very good match between the observed measured kcb and the kcb derived by the a p approach using the optimized ml and fr parameters these results support adoption of the tabulated ml and fr parameters values by field practitioners in the field when using fc and h observations to calculate kcb a p the application of the a p approach using observations of fc and h with the tabulated ml and fr parameters provides for the estimation of appropriate values for local actual crop coefficients including when water and salt stresses occur the approach developed and summarized here is more practical and cost effective than estimating crop coefficients using field et observations by bowen ratio energy balance breb eddy covariance instrumentation ec soil water balance swb sap flow approaches or weighing lysimeters the predicted values calculated through use of the a p approach may be more accurate and representative of local conditions than estimating actual kc or kcb values from the tabulated standard crop coefficients however particular attention must be paid to the field evaluation of fc and h practical use of the a p approach is primarily intended to support irrigation scheduling and planning as well as to advance the use of water conservation practices which are essential responses to the challenges and pressures of global climatic changes implementation of the a p approach coupled with satellite based fc measurements within the fully automated sims framework melton et al 2012 2020 demonstrate the potential to reduce the effort required to calculate kcb values and increase access to accurate data for et based irrigation management continued development of the a p approach should proceed in parallel with additional research where actual et is observed through use of breb ec swb sap flow or remote sensing and related approaches such complementary research continues to be a high priority in order to progressively refine the fao56 methodologies development of practical approaches such as a p are particularly important in the context of challenges imposed on irrigated agriculture by global change and the growing

10062,the a p approach developed by allen and pereira 2009 estimates single and basal crop coefficients kc and kcb from the observed fraction of ground cover fc and crop height h the practical application of the a p for several crops was reviewed and tested in a companion paper pereira et al 2020 the current study further addresses the derivation of optimal values for a p parameter values representing canopy transparency ml and stomatal adjustment fr and tests the resulting model performance values reported in literature of ml and fr were analysed optimal ml and fr values were derived by a numerical search that minimized the differences between kcb a p with standard kcb for vegetable field and fruit crops as tabulated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 sources for fc were literature reviews supplemented by a remote sensing survey computed kcb and kc for mid and end season together with associated parameters values were tabulated to improve the usability of the ml and fr parameters a cross validation was performed which consisted of the linear regression between kcb computed by a p and observed kcb relative to independent data sets obtained from field observations results show that both series of kcb match well with regression coefficients very close to 1 0 coefficients of determination near 1 0 and root mean square errors rmse of 0 06 for the annual crops and rmse 0 07 for the trees and vines these errors represent less than 10 of most of the computed tabulated kcb the tabulated fr and ml of this paper can be regarded as defaults to support a p field practice when observations of fc and h are performed therefore the a p approach shows to be appropriate for use in irrigation scheduling and planning when fc and h are observed using ground and or remote sensing hence supporting irrigation water savings keywords a p approach basal crop coefficient fractional cover and crop height remote sensing parameters search and usability crop water and irrigation requirements 1 introduction the food and agriculture organization fao two step crop coefficient method kc eto doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 has been a successful and dependable means to estimate crop evapotranspiration etc and crop water requirements pereira et al 2015a jensen and allen 2016 the method uses weather data to compute the grass reference evapotranspiration eto with the fao penman monteith eto equation pm eto equation allen et al 1998 and a crop coefficient kc that represents the relative rate of evapotranspiration from a specific crop and condition to that of the reference crop etc eto the reference condition is et from a clipped cool season well watered grass with a height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 fully covering the ground the calculation of eto has been standardized by fao allen et al 1998 2006 and the american society of civil engineers asce ewri 2005 therefore standard kc values have to be computed using the standardized pm eto equation using alternative reference et equations is only acceptable for local practice the kc eto approach provides a simple convenient and reproducible way to estimate et from a variety of crops and climatic conditions allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 2015a jensen and allen 2016 crop coefficient curves have been developed and reported for a wide range of agricultural crops allen et al 1998 2007 jensen and allen 2016 and their standard values were recently updated for vegetable and field crops pereira et al 2021a 2021b as well as for fruit tree and vine crops rallo et al 2021 standard kc represents the relative fraction of eto that is governed by the amount type and condition of a given crop type under standard pristine conditions and is regarded as generally transferable among regions subject to adjustment for local climate under the assumption that the eto accounts for nearly all weather related etc variation when a crop is cultivated under water and or saline stress or under specific management conditions differing from pristine conditions well watered homogeneous crop without yield limitations from water stress nutrient availability salinity pests or disease the actual crop et is affected relative to the potential etc i e etc act etc thus a stress coefficient has to be considered as etc act ks kc eto ks 1 0 unless available soil water and or salinity limits transpiration in which case ks 1 0 allen et al 1998 minhas et al 2020 in the case of tree and vine crops etc and kc values are assumed as standard when cropping conditions are nearly pristine but may involve some beneficial water stress aimed at maximizing crop yield and quality in addition to the single kc a dual kc is proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 i e kc kcb ke where kcb refers to crop transpiration and ke refers to the evaporation from the soil the estimation of ke from the fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation fc is described in allen et al 1998 this partition is detailed by allen et al 2005a and its modelling is described by rosa et al 2012 adopting the dual kc approach and the use of ks results in eq 1 1 k c act k s k cb k e which shows that ks applies only to kcb which represents the transpiration component the fao segmented approach is commonly adopted to describe the kc and kcb curves where the four linear segments represent the initial development mid season and late season periods the fao kc curve requires knowledge of only three key values kc ini for the initial period kc mid during the midseason period and kc end at the end of the late season doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 however many authors do not adopt the fao kc curve and do not distinguish mid and end season kc in their reporting e g defining kc or kcb as a non linear function of time after planting which may be appropriate for local use but limits the subsequent relevance and transferability of their research results to different locations the derivation of kc and kcb values from field data requires that etc is accurately determined as discussed in the recent kc reviews pereira et al 2021a 2021b rallo et al 2021 those field based etc measurements are appropriate for research purposes but are generally impractical for grower use due to complexity and expense nevertheless as discussed in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 kc and kcb values can be accurately estimated through their relationship with the ground fraction covered or shadowed by the crop canopy fc the height h of the vegetation and the relative amount of stomatal adjustment under moist soil conditions this approach was initially proposed in fao56 further developed by allen and pereira 2009 and was extensively tested in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 where it is referred to as the a p approach however it must be taken into consideration that kcb and kc values estimated with this approach kcb a p and kc a p are not standard but actual values since stress often occurs in practice which affects fc crop h and the relative stomatal resistance nevertheless when computations are performed using parameters obtained under optimal pristine cropping conditions the estimated kcb a p and kc a p may be considered to represent standard values the study by allen and pereira 2009 is often quoted when users compare kcb from field research with paper tabulated kcb values e g for strawberries lozano et al 2016 vineyards moratiel and martínez cob 2012 picón toro et al 2012 poblete echeverrı a et al 2017 and almond orchards stevens et al 2012 more important numerous studies report successful applications of the a p approach to calculate kcb mainly for trees and vines applications when computing kcb with remote sensing vegetation indices are also reported pôças et al 2015 2020 in various cases parameters proposed by allen and pereira 2009 were not modified when the approach is used to estimate kcb e g in successful applications to vineyards fandiño et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 olives conceição et al 2017 almonds phogat et al 2013 trellised tomato zheng et al 2013 and bermudagrass subjected to cuts paredes et al 2018 studies relative to field crops generally did not report changes of the originally proposed parameters but in some cases equations were modified ding et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 the a p approach has been integrated with the simdualkc soil water balance model rosa et al 2012 and has been successfully used with numerous crops particularly when crop density plays an important role as for water stressed rainfed maize wu et al 2015 grasslands wu et al 2016 and intercrop cultivation miao et al 2016 direct computation of kcb with the a p approach often requires the numerical search of the empirical parameters relative to canopy transparency to solar radiation ml and to the effects of stomatal adjustment fr e g in applications to peach paço et al 2012 and olive paço et al 2019 conceição et al 2017 puppo et al 2019 including to non irrigated water stressed olive groves santos et al 2012 applications also include crops not previously considered such as chinese tamarisk li et al 2015 an application to perennial crops aimed at water resources balance studies is reported for california by devine and o geen 2019 studies relative to orchards demonstrate the need for modifying the empirical equation by defining the impacts of stomatal adjustment which is adopted in this study on basis of research reported by taylor et al 2015 2017 for orange orchards and mobe et al 2020 for apples the a p approach has been adopted by the satellite irrigation management support sims for use with remote sensing data for mapping crop et in california and the western united states us that application to vegetable field and fruit tree and vine crops with the sims system shows its usability for wide area mapping of crop et and for delivery of data and information for irrigation management to farmers melton et al 2012 2020 crop specific tests using sims compared with ground based et measurements were performed to evaluate system accuracy melton et al 2018 wang et al 2021 the companion paper pereira et al 2020 discussed the feasibility of the practical use of the a p approach and tested the use and variability of the parameters ml and fr used in the computations for several vegetable field tree and vine crops with fc and h obtained from ground and remote sensing observations that study also revised approaches used to derive fc and h using ground and remote sensing observations the objectives of the current study considering the reviews and tests reported in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 consist of providing for the usability of the a p approach in the field by practitioners using available fc and h data as well as to parameterize the approach for a wide variety of crops the aims include tabulating values for kcb and related computation parameters and performing their cross validation with independent data sets to assess the accuracy of kcb estimation it is expected that the tabulated parameters will facilitate the use of the a p approach in the practice of et based irrigation management and will support increased adoption of data driven irrigation with associated advances in on farm water use efficiency this article is organized into the following sections designed to assist the reader in locating information that is relevant to their intended use and practical application the section 2 describes the computational approach section 3 presents a summary of the data and parameterization of the a p as well as of the procedures used while section 4 consist of the presentation of the tabulated parameters and the kc and kcb values computed with the a p approach concluding with the cross validation of the tabulated parameters for vegetable field crops and vine and fruit tree crops section 5 provides conclusions and recommendations 2 estimating kcb from the fraction of ground cover and crop height for expanses of vegetation large enough that an equilibrium boundary is established so that general one dimensional equations such as the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 apply a maximum upper limit on et is established due to the law of conservation of energy therefore for large expanses of vegetation larger than about 500 to 2 000 m2 the kc development process has upper limits for kc of 1 2 1 3 for the grass reference however under conditions of clothesline effects where vegetation height exceeds that of the surroundings or oasis effects where vegetation has higher soil water availability than the surroundings the peak kc values may exceed those limits caution is required when extrapolating et measurements from small vegetation plots to large stands or regions because estimation errors of et may occur following the a p approach the basal kcb because it primarily represents transpiration depends upon the amount of vegetation and can be expressed as a function of a density coefficient kd as 2 k cb k c min k d k cb full k c min where kcb is approximated for conditions represented by the density coefficient kd kcb full is the estimated basal kc during peak plant growth for conditions having nearly full ground cover or lai 3 and kc min is the minimum basal kc for bare soil 0 15 under typical agricultural conditions examples of application to several crops are given by pereira et al 2020 for tree crops having grass or other ground cover eq 2 takes a different form to consider transpiration by the active ground cover thus 3 k cb k cb cover k d max k cb full k cb cover k cb full k cb cover 2 where kcb cover is the kcb of the active ground cover in the absence of tree foliage the second term of the max function reduces the estimate for kcb mid by half the difference between kcb full and kc cover when this difference is negative this accounts for impacts of shading by vegetation when kcb kcb cover due to differences in stomatal conductance eq 3 applies to estimate kcb during any period two application examples are provided by fandiño et al 2012 and cancela et al 2015 as described by allen and pereira 2009 the approach of eq 3 can be similarly applied to estimate a single kc coefficient the value for kcb full represents a general upper limit on kcb mid for vegetation having full ground cover and lai 3 under full water supply kcb full can be approximated as a function of mean plant height and adjusted for climate following allen et al 1998 4 k cb ful l f r min 1 0 k h h 1 20 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where u2 is average daily wind speed m s 1 at a height of 2 m above ground level during the growth period rhmin is average daily minimum relative humidity during the growth period and h is the mean plant height m during midseason eq 4 suggests that an upper bound for kcb full is 1 20 prior to climatic adjustment effects of crop height are considered through the sum 1 kh h with kh 0 1 for tree and vine crops as well as tall field crops and kh 0 2 for short crops and vegetables pereira et al 2020 eq 4 produces increases in kcb full with plant height and when local climates are more arid or windier than standard climate conditions the parameter fr applies an empirical downward adjustment fr 1 0 if the vegetation exhibits more stomatal adjustment on transpiration than is typical of most annual agricultural crops fr is near 1 0 for annual crops cultivated under non stressed pristine conditions and decreases when crops are water or salinity stressed for trees and vines fr is high when crops exhibit great vegetative vigor and decreases by effect of pruning and training as well as limited water supply examples are provided in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 adopting the allen et al 1998 definition for fr considering the variability of leaf resistance from annual to perennial crops it is assumed 5 f r γ 1 0 34 u 2 γ 1 0 34 u 2 r l r t y p where rl and rtyp are respectively the mean leaf resistance and the typical leaf resistance s m 1 for the vegetation in question δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure vs air temperature curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 both relative to the period when kcb full is computed the original version of that equation was established with a fixed rtyp 100 s m 1 a common value for annual crops the fr equation is rewritten to cover a wider range of typical leaf resistances for a variety of crops including the perennials important to note that fr applies to kcb full in the direct calculation of actual or standard kcb eqs 2 and 3 as adopted by allen and pereira 2009 and pereira et al 2020 while ks applies to convert standard kcb into kcb act when performing a soil water balance to a stressed crop e g rosa et al 2012 wu et al 2015 2016 giménez et al 2017 minhas et al 2020 the original fr eq 5 was developed to empirically consider the effects of stomatal adjustment on kcb full and therefore on kcb in response to water stress allen et al 1998 since stomatal closure causes a decrease of transpiration thus of kcb and kc stomatal adjustment processes were quite well known for annual crops monteith 1965 van bavel and ehrler 1968 hsiao 1973 szeicz et al 1973 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 chaves 1991 mcnaughton and jarvis 1991 it was also known that stomatal adjustment processes varied among crops and throughout the crop cycle and that leaf aging favors stomatal closure in response to water stress relative to younger leaves jordan et al 1975 stomatal adjustment in fruit trees and grapevine was less well known but despite leaf resistances are much higher it the process is coherent with that of annual crops cohen and cohen 1983 chaves and rodrigues 1987 steinberg et al 1989 winkel and rambal 1990 the effect of stomatal adjustment processes on transpiration could therefore be characterized by empirical adjustment of fr eq 5 was developed previously using a default rtyp value of 100 s m 1 but default fr values were indicated by allen and pereira 2009 for tree and vine crops fr serves to adjust kcb full for considering effects of stomatal adjustment in relation to typical leaf resistance associated with a given crop type and growth stage this adjustment is particularly important for perennials which have a fr behavior different from annuals as referred by allen and pereira 2009 the standard value for fr is 1 0 for annuals before leaf senescence i e when rl is close to rtyp fr decreases during the late season when senescence develops and stomatal closure increases for perennials fr not only decreases during the late season but is smaller than 1 0 when pruning and training reduce the vigor of the plant good results were obtained assuming that the fr values are estimated with empirical consideration of stomatal adjustment for various annual and perennial crops pereira et al 2020 thus not measuring stomatal resistances however different approaches may have to be used when dealing with various orchards of the same crop but having different varieties planting spacings and fc values mobe et al 2020 using observed apple rl found that fr was over estimated when using the ratio rl 100 proposed by allen et al 1998 and by allen and pereira 2009 thus they replaced the 100 s m 1 value with a resistance parameter representing the minimum unstressed canopy resistance for apple trees following this adjustment kcb a p was able to match the kcb derived from eddy covariance ec measurements over the 12 orchards evaluated in the study the earlier studies by taylor et al 2015 2017 relative to citrus orchards and the mobe et al 2020 modification of fr originated the current change in eq 5 using a numerical search procedure focusing on fr not requiring to observe rl and rtyp it was possible to find fr values for various crop stages allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020 this empirical approach may however be tested when rl could be measured a density coefficient kd used in eqs 2 and 3 describes the increase in kc with increases in the amount of vegetation where estimates of the fraction of ground surface covered by vegetation fc are available the kd is estimated as allen and pereira 2009 6 k d min 1 m l f c eff f c eff 1 1 h where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation 0 01 1 near solar noon ml is a multiplier on fc eff describing the effect of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative et per fraction of ground shaded 1 0 2 0 and h is the mean vegetation height m the fc eff parameter is often observed as the shaded area near noon between 11 00 and 15 00 or as the fraction of intercepted light or the intercepted photosynthetic active radiation as reviewed by pereira et al 2020 estimation of fc eff for row crops was described by fao56 and for trees was provided by allen and pereira 2009 as with sims remotely sensed vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi can be used to estimate fc eff for agricultural crops johnson and trout 2012 melton et al 2012 the ml multiplier on fc eff in eq 6 imposes an upper limit on the relative magnitude of transpiration per unit of ground area as represented by fc eff allen et al 1998 it is expected to usually range from 1 0 to 2 0 depending on the canopy density and thickness and will have a low value when the canopy transparency to solar radiation is higher the value for ml should be modified to fit the specific vegetation and the respective crop stage as reported by allen and pereira 2009 and pereira et al 2020 as well as by several users as analyzed in section 3 1 as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 where lai m2 m 2 can be observed or estimated kd can be alternatively estimated as 7 k d 1 e 0 7 lai where lai is defined as the leaf area per area of ground surface averaged over a large area with consideration of only one side of green healthy leaves active in vapor transfer and 0 7 is a common value for the light extinction coefficient kex used for annual crops e g for maize ding et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 and tomato zheng et al 2013 however the extinction coefficient changes with the crop type crop density lai and over the course of the growing season e g flenet et al 1996 zhang et al 2014 a different exponent in eq 7 may be used if more appropriate information is available for the specific crop considered or a numerical search is performed as reported for applications to shrubs kex 0 46 li et al 2015 and vineyards kex 0 32 zhao et al 2018 3 methods data and parameterization of the a p approach 3 1 parameterization of the a p approach requirements for parameterization of the a p approach refer to the parameter fr used in the calculation of kcb full eqs 4 and 5 and ml used in the computation of the density coefficient kd eq 6 both kd and kcb full are used when computing kcb for any crop with or without active ground cover eqs 2 and 3 it has been observed pereira et al 2020 that fr plays a primary role particularly for trees and vines the selection of fr and ml values is performed through a numerical search for the values of the parameters that make kcb a p to match the tabulated kcb tab values the kcb a p are those computed with the a p approach and the kcb tab are those tabulated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 the procedure consists of 1 selecting initial values for fr and ml 2 computing crop kcb a p for observed known values of fc and h and comparing the resulting kcb a p with the standard tabulated kcb tab for the same crop 3 repeating the computations using an iterative numerical search where the initial fr values are progressively changed but are constrained by the limits of fr maximum is 1 0 and minimum is 0 25 and comparing the resulting kcb a p with kcb tab values for the same crop progressively decreasing the differences between both values until that difference is negligible 4 when a fr value is selected the calculations are performed with the fr value obtained in the previous calculation set now changing ml within its interval 1 0 2 0 however with a smaller minimum of 0 3 for the initial phase of annual crops aiming at minimizing the difference between kcb a p with kcb tab 5 if increasing or decreasing ml leads to increases in the difference between kcb a p and kcb tab then the last value for ml is retained as well as the fr used in the calculation however if the difference decreases a new run must be conducted until an ml value is found that minimizes the difference the value selected for fr in step 3 should remain fixed throughout steps 4 and 5 but it may be required to apply again the numerical search focusing fr 6 the procedure ends when the difference kcb a p kcb tab is minimized and values for both ml and fr are selected the target standard kcb tab values for vegetable field tree and vine crops have been reviewed and updated in three papers of the current special issue pereira et al 2021a 2021b rallo et al 2021 ancillary data published in these papers as well as fc and h data published in allen and pereira 2009 were used to define the fraction of ground cover and crop height used with the current application of the a p approach to better represent actual conditions in production agriculture fc values obtained from a remote sensing rs survey described below in section 3 2 and table 5 were also considered the fc data have considerable variability for both the mid and late season because fc is strongly dependent on various facets of crop management nevertheless it was possible to select for each crop a fc value that is assumed to represent the most common fc values at the initial mid and end seasons and to associate these values with crop heights to compute kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end for every vegetable field tree and vine crop when these data were not available in the referenced review papers a precise approach to compute fc eff from raw fc data as proposed by allen and pereira 2009 could not be adopted because it was not possible to establish a well defined sun angle thus the raw fc values were used as the best estimator of fc eff it is however assumed that in practice in the field ground and remote observations of fc may be performed accurately as already reviewed in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 in the a p approach kcb eqs 2 and 3 depends upon the definition of a kc min value the estimation of kcb full eq 4 and the estimation of kd eqs 6 or 7 for all annual crops kc min was set to 0 15 following the recommendations of allen et al 1998 and allen and pereira 2009 for perennial crops a value of kc min 0 05 was adopted for all orchard and vine crops to avoid the situation where computations of kcb mid could be larger than kcb full kd was estimated from ml fc eff and h eq 6 the parameter ml is a multiplier on fc eff describing the effect of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative et per fraction of ground shaded considered to represent the transparency of the crop canopy to solar radiation it is expected to usually range from 1 5 to 2 0 during mid season when fc is high and varies with the canopy density and thickness in contrast ml is low when the canopy transparency to solar radiation is higher for example during the initial crop stages when fc is small thus low ml value are assumed in the initial crop development stage while in contrast a high ml close to 2 0 was assumed for the mid season to increase the effects of fc in addition a lower value was considered for the end season when fc is generally decreased relative to the mid season values of ml for annuals and perennials retrieved from the literature are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively during the mid season ml values ranged 1 5 2 0 those values should depend on the leaf cutout type insertion angle of the leaves number of overlapping leaf layers canopy architecture which directly influence the crop canopy transparence to solar radiation in this approach crops with more vertical production training systems or with less leaf density or with leaves of very small dimension were consider having lower ml values crops with leaves still active at harvest such as the evergreen were suggested to have ml mid ml end however the effect of the ml value on kd depends upon the effect of the exponent 1 1 h of fc eff in eq 6 which decreases when h increases the use of diverse ml values in the range from 1 5 2 0 do not influence kd for crops with h 3 0 and fc 0 60 thus for the considered vegetable crops grain legumes fiber oil and sugar crops and cereals the values of ml reported do not induce changes in kd values for the mid and end season in contrast for the initial stage where fc is around 0 10 low ml values were selected since using large ml values would excessively increase kd a smaller range of ml values was adopted for orchards and vines however it was observed that the computation of kd was highly determined by h in the exponent 1 1 h of fc eff for perennials the selected ml values impacted kd when fc 0 60 i e for low and medium density and young orchards this is the case of olive orchards wine grapes and table grapes trained with a t trellis as referred before the parameter fr 1 0 applies an empirical downward adjustment if the vegetation exhibits more stomatal adjustment on transpiration than is typical of most agricultural crops i e when the leaf resistance rl is greater than the typical leaf resistance eq 5 values of fr used in previous studies are presented in table 3 for vegetable and field crops and in table 4 for fruit trees and vines values for vegetable and field crops correspond to nearly pristine non stressed cropping conditions i e when stomatal adjustment is small or not occurring and fr values at mid season are equal or close to 1 0 when crops vegetable are harvested green and the late season is very short stomatal adjustment is very limited or does not typically occur thus fr values at the end season are also equal or close to 1 0 in contrast for field crops harvested dry or nearly dry stomatal adjustment occurs during the late season with the result that fr decreases to near 0 30 by the end season low fr values ranging from 0 20 to 0 45 were obtained for the end season of crops drying in the field pereira et al 2020 for silage where stomatal adjustment is limited at harvesting an intermediate value of fr 0 65 was used for the end season for trees and vines the fr assumed was almost always a value 1 0 table 4 the variability of the reported values and the use of numerical search make it difficult to explain the results published in the literature results for wine grapes show that there is an influence of the training and management of the vineyard as well as an influence of the varieties on stomatal adjustment thus on fr souza et al 2005 rodrigues et al 2008 costa et al 2012 results also show the influence of management namely irrigation management since higher fr values refer to training with pergola trellis in case of wine grapes and to overhead trellis systems in vineyards for table grapes where supplemental irrigation is adopted there is a great variability of fr values for citrus and olives table 4 that is associated with irrigation management and crop varieties fr values are smaller for olives because these trees present an important stomatal adjustment in response to water stress fernández et al 1997 moriana et al 2002 tognetti et al 2009 fernández 2014 perez martin et al 2014 in terms of management the low fr values reported indicate that applied irrigation in orchards used in the studies cited was far from the full satisfaction of crop water requirements despite the fact that production was high i e the beneficial deficit irrigation in olives is large citrus also present strong stomatal adjustment to cope with water stress since a heavy beneficial deficit irrigation is often practiced obiremi and oladele 2001 poggi et al 2007 ribeiro and machado 2007 in contrast a small beneficial deficit irrigation is practiced with pome trees stone fruit trees and nut trees which is due to commonly managing irrigation using partial root drying thus resulting a in smaller stomatal adjustment o connell and goodwin 2007a 2007b and resulting fr values close or equal to 1 0 through the mid season table 4 it is important to note that temperate deciduous trees have a large daily variability in both kcb and stomatal conductance villalobos et al 2013 however almond trees show stomatal adjustment during summer romero and botía 2006 rouhi et al 2007 karimi et al 2015 espadafor et al 2017 with fr values of 1 0 during late season leaves start yellowing stomata close and leaf conductance decreases resulting in lower values for fr by the end season table 4 the complexity of abiotic factors and the differences among crop varieties or species referred above demonstrate that the parameterization of fr can only be performed with a numerical search procedure when this procedure cannot be applied users may adopt the ml and fr values presented in this study particularly those given in next sections for a variety of annual and perennial crops which were obtained applying a numerical search procedure whose initial values of the searched parameters are those in tables 1 4 the estimation of the parameters ml and fr used in the a p approach is subject to error pereira et al 2020 evaluated crop coefficients for a wide range of crops calculated using the a p approach driven with fc and h against results from prior studies that derived kc and kcb values from field measured data with simultaneously observed fc and h comparisons of kcb values computed with the a p method against results from these studies produced regression coefficients close to 1 0 and coefficients of determination 0 92 except for orchards expected errors and or challenges with orchards are higher due to effects of pruning training and crop varieties 3 2 single and basal crop coefficients the numerical search to determine ml and fr values using the a p approach described in section 3 1 focused on evaluation of kcb values only inclusion of corresponding kc values in tables 6 10 is also valuable for practical use and the approach used to calculate the corresponding kc values for each crop type is described below for vegetable and field crops kc mid and kc end values were determined from kcb mid and kcb end as performed in fao56 allen et al 1998 kc mid values were calculated by adding 0 05 to kcb mid values while kc end was obtained by adding 0 05 or 0 10 to kcb end values with the additive value of 0 05 for crops harvested green thus also following the estimation approaches used by pereira et al 2021a 2021b when computing kc end from the kcb end values for trees and vines kc mid was also computed when adding 0 05 to kcb mid while kc end was obtained by adding a specific value in the range 0 05 0 40 to kcb end this simple procedure used in fao56 allen et al 1998 can be modified when the user knows the expected behavior of the crop at the end of the season as described by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 kc ini values were not tabulated in those studies focused on updating kc values for vegetable and field crops and tree and vine crops during the initial crop stage of annuals the ground cover is very small as well as h as a result the variability of kc ini relates to soil evaporation and factors controlling it such as the frequency of wettings by rainfall the frequency and depth of irrigation applications the fraction of soil wetted by irrigation which relates with the irrigation method and the presence of plastic mulches plastic tunnels organic mulching or soil residue management with such a variety of influencing factors it is not possible to tabulate values for kc ini and it was not possible to derive related values from the reviewed papers for deciduous trees and vines the initial phase also has small fc values and the variability of kc ini is similar to that described for annuals in contrast for evergreen crops fc is much higher and the role of soil evaporation is reduced however there is little information on kc ini reported for those tree crops the rice crop is an exception because when flooded or when the soil is kept close to saturation kc ini does not vary as it does for other cereal crops therefore the approach used by pereira et al 2021b was adopted herein as a result differences between kc ini and kcb ini values for rice are the same as those determined by pereira et al 2021b fao56 provided indicative kc ini values corresponding to the most common conditions i e a standard sub humid climate where minimum relative air humidity equals 45 and wind speed is of 2 m s 1 surface irrigation was used and the soil was maintained bare the fao56 tabulated kc ini and kcb ini values were provided as indicative values having large errors than tabulated standard kc mid and kc end values as well as the kcb mid and kcb end therefore due to the variability of conditions determining crop et during the initial crop period we did not include kc ini values instead the computational procedures proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 and by allen et al 2005b are recommended simple models can be used for that purpose for the dual kc approach the value kcb ini 0 15 is the recommended default value for annuals since it represents average conditions from bare soil with fraction of ground cover fc 0 10 it is assumed to include diffusive or residual evaporation from soil for potentially long periods following a wetting allen et al 2005a however under dry conditions with long periods between wettings or during the non growing season kcb ini can be set much lower even close to 0 in contrast the evaporation coefficient ke should be computed taking into consideration all the factors affecting soil evaporation as detailed by allen et al 2005a nevertheless the values of kc ini tabulated in fao56 in allen and pereira 2009 and in jensen and allen 2016 are recommended indicative values for trees and vines 3 3 fraction of ground cover from remote sensing in california when combined with information on crop height information on expected maximum fc values can be useful in calculating maximum expected kcb values for a range of crops using the a p approach determination of a representative average crop height h is typically less difficult than estimation of average fc at field scales to provide a characterization of typical expected maximum fc values for a range of crops the satellite irrigation management support sims melton et al 2012 2020 framework conducted an analysis using landsat satellite data combined with field boundary and crop type information for all irrigated lands in california obtained from the california agricultural commissioners and sealers association cacasa database for 2016 sims combines satellite based measurements of ndvi and fc with the a p approach and a soil water balance model to provide support for mapping of crop coefficients and crop evapotranspiration across the western u s sims was developed to increase access to satellite derived et data by agricultural producers to inform irrigation management california was selected as the site for this analysis since more than 400 different crops are produced in the state and detailed field boundaries and crop type information reported by famers were available for the state in 2016 while the sims framework was used to support the satellite data processing and computations only the algorithms for calculation of fc from ndvi were used for this analysis atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data for 2016 for all of california were obtained from the collection of landsat data on google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 including usgs landsat collection 1 for the enhanced thematic mapper etm on landsat 7 and the operational land imager oli on landsat 8 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data were first calculated for each scene from the landsat surface reflectances using earth engine gorelick et al 2017 with a total of more than 1 900 landsat scenes processed for this analysis next fc was calculated from ndvi using eq 8 following johnson and trout 2012 8 f c 1 26 ndvi 0 18 johnson and trout 2012 and trout et al 2008 found robust relationships between ndvi and fc across a range of different crop types and canopy architectures eq 8 was derived based on in situ fc measurements of 49 commercial fields and 18 major crop types row crops grains orchard vineyard of varying maturity that were made on 11 landsat overpass dates in the san joaquin valley of california from april to october the studies found a strong linear relationship between ndvi and fc r 2 0 96 rmse 0 06 a shapefile containing the 2016 field boundaries and crop type information for more than 200 000 individual irrigated agricultural fields was used to define field boundaries and the crop type for each field the crop type information was reported by farmers during calendar year 2016 to the agricultural commissioners in each county in california as part of the pesticide use reporting process and composited into a geospatial database by cacasa for each field and each landsat scene the field average fc value was calculated using all cloud free pixels contained within each field boundary next for each field the maximum annual fc value was selected from the satellite overpass dates that spanned the growing season for each crop type for most annual crops vineyards and tree crops the maximum values from the period between may 1 and october 31 were used these dates were selected to correspond with the timing of peak canopy cover for a range of crops and also to minimize the influence of cover crops for vineyards and tree crops since it is not possible to discriminate between the crop canopy and the cover crop at the spatial resolution of landsat 30 m x 30 m however cover crops that may be present in the interrow for vineyards and orchards are typically mowed and rapidly senescing in california in may well before the vine and tree canopies reach maximum fc in mature orchards and vineyards as such cover crops were expected to have a minimal influence on the maximum annual fc value calculated for each field in cases where an irrigated cover crop persists throughout the summer users would need to employ eq 3 to account separately for the kcb for the cover crop and the kcb for the vine or tree for alfalfa and cereal crops we selected the maximum values from the period between january 1 and october 31 we then collated the data from all fields by crop type and selected both the 75th and 95th percentile values for each crop type we selected the 75th percentile value to represent an expected maximum fc value for a typical well irrigated crop grown under near ideal conditions but with some heterogeneity across the field due to variability in soil conditions distribution uniformity of irrigation or the presence of pests or pathogens in isolated regions in the field we selected the 95th percentile value to represent an expected upper limit on fc for a well irrigated crop grown under ideal conditions and with very little heterogeneity across the field for perennial crops the maximum fc values are also representative of mature orchards and vineyards any crop types with fewer than 50 fields sampled were excluded from the analysis table 5 reports the 75th and 95th percentile of the maximum annual fc values fc 75 and fc 95 measured using satellite data over california for each annual crop type the number of fields n of each crop type included in the analysis and used to calculate fc 75 and fc 95 are also included in table 1 these fc values can be combined with direct measurements of h for specific fields or typical maximum h values listed in tables 2 4 below to support assessment of typical maximum kcb values using the a p approach these values represent expected maximum values under ideal conditions and lower kcb values would be expected for immature orchard and vineyard crops deficit irrigation nutrient deficiencies or due to the presence of plant pests and pathogens in the current study fc values between the tabulated fc 75 and fc 95 were used in combination with the fc max values tabulated in pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 relative to kcb and kc for vegetable field crops and perennials respectively to estimate the indicative fc values used to compute kcb and kc for these crops as presented in section 4 3 4 procedures used in computations predicted values for kcb and kc computed with the a p approach as well as the computational parameters used are presented and discussed in the following sections and tables 6 8 relative to vegetable crops tables 9 11 for field crops and tables 12 15 relative to tree and vine crops computations using the equations described in section 2 were performed following the same approach for all crops in particular 1 the calculations assume the standard sub humid climate adopted in fao56 i e average minimum relative humidity rhmin 45 and wind speed u2 2 m s 1 which results in an upper bound of kcb full 1 20 eq 4 2 the fc eff values for the mid season resulted from combining observed fc values collected from the literature tabulated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 with the 75th and 95th percentile fc 75 and fc 95 of remotely sensed fc values tabulated in table 5 unreasonable values were discarded generally the values considered are intermediate between fc 75 and fc 95 a for crops not having fc values included in the above referred tables various additional sources were used artichoke grattan et al 1998 and visconti et al 2014 beans dry grattan et al 1998 and kim et al 2020 beets table gimenez et al 2002 and reid et al 2020 brussels sprout jones 1972 and everaarts et al 1998 castor bean li et al 2011 and sadras et al 2016 flax and linseed casa et al 2000 and kar et al 2007 lentils ayaz et al 2004 and mckenzie and andrews 2010 millet corlett et al 1992 and bello and walker 2016 mustard kar et al 2007 and gupta et al 2017 okra agba et al 2011 and konyeha and alatise 2013 spinach gimenez et al 2002 and nomura et al 2020 b fc values were not available for parsnip rutabaga and turnip thus we assumed mid season fc max similar respectively to radish and to table beet for the latter two c for crops that are not object of any study referring to fc or lai observations the fc values adopted herein considering the personal knowledge of the authors are assumed from comparing with similar crops for example values for rye and oats were selected based on comparison against values for wheat 3 crop heights were defined from those tabulated by pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 which resulted from combining observed values reported in the literature and referenced by the authors with h values tabulated in fao56 4 kc and kcb values were tabulated for vegetable and tree and vine crops assuming they are irrigated with drip irrigation with pipes and wetted area shadowed by the crop thus reducing evaporation of applied irrigation water for the field crops well managed sprinkler irrigation was considered to be the default irrigation type 5 cropping is assumed to be practiced with bare soil special practices such as the use of plastic films and organic mulches or small plastic tunnels were not considered due to the lack of information on the reductions in kc associated with these practices brief notes on their effects on kc were recently provided by jovanovic et al 2020 relative to the initial crop stage there was a lack of base information for appropriate parameterization for tree and vine crops therefore related kc ini values were not computed for the annual crops the main assumptions are discussed in section 3 2 the following may be relevant 1 the fc eff values for the initial period were assumed equal to 0 05 for all annual crops since by definition in fao56 allen et al 1998 fc varies from 0 up to 0 10 during that stage 2 the parameter ml was set to 0 30 for sown crops and 0 40 for transplanted crops these low ml values correspond to a very open canopy as occurs for small fc values 3 because the young plants are assumed not to require stomatal adjustment at this stage the value fr 1 0 was assumed for all annual crops these assumptions when considering the initial crop stage resulted in the common value of kcb full 1 0 and kcb ini 0 15 the latter in agreement with allen et al 1998 2005a 4 results 4 1 vegetable crops for roots tuber bulb and stem crops table 6 it has been generally assumed that h does not change from the mid season to the end season since crop senescence generally occurs over a short time period however this assumption is not true for various crops the case of asparagus is likely the most evident because harvesting is performed when the crop reduces to the asparagus spears which are much lower than the mid season vegetation in spite of the subsequent regrowth of the vegetative part of the crop after harvesting other exceptions include crops that have a longer late season to allow the crop to dry out before harvesting this is the case for garlic onion and long season potato fc eff is assumed not to change from mid to end season for crops having a very short late season carrots celery parsnip radish and turnip a small decrease in fc eff was considered for other crops having a short senescence period beets for table rutabaga and sweet potato changes in fc and h may also be made by users based on their observations and the way in which the crop is managed i e allowing for a longer or shorter senescence period the ml values for both the mid and end season are all in the range of 1 5 2 0 because that value does not influence the kd results eq 6 in contrast the ml value influences the computation of kd relative to the initial crop stage as already discussed in section 3 4 the fr values selected for the mid season were all very close or equal to 1 0 table 6 thus indicating that likely there was no stomatal adjustment since the roots tuber bulb and stem vegetable crops were considered not to be stressed and cropped under pristine conditions and because values used are based on computation of the standard kcb tab the numerical search procedure produced fr 1 0 for most of crops and fr 1 0 but close to 1 0 for asparagus carrots celery garlic radish rutabaga and turnip all the end season values for fr obtained through a numerical search procedure are all decreased relative to the mid season values when the late season is short and the product goes to the table with its typical colour and tenderness the end season fr is close to the mid season value as for table beets carrots celery green and seed onions parsnip radish rutabaga and turnip fr decreases substantially for asparagus because only the harvestable spears are present at harvesting a much lower fr value results for the crops that have a long late season and senesce before harvesting this is typically the case for garlic dry onion long late season potato and sweet potato therefore users should select the end season fr 1 0 for these crops taking into consideration the possible occurrence of stress which requires stomatal adjustment and the duration of the late season which is associated with crop senescence the computed values resulting from the a p application show kcb mid a p and kcb end a p values equal to the tabulated ones reported by pereira et al 2021a this is expected since the numerical search aimed at matching kcb a p with the kcb tab values the kc values were estimated as kc mid kcb mid 0 05 for a few crops asparagus potato radish sweet potato and turnip otherwise the additional term was 0 10 for kc end generally it differed from kcb end by 0 10 such differences are similar to those relative for roots tuber bulb and stem vegetable crops tabulated by pereira et al 2021a based upon observed values published in the literature the a p computation parameters used for leaves and flowers vegetable crops table 7 behave similarly to the roots tuber bulb and stem crops ml values were also 2 0 since the value for ml did not influence the kd value in contrast low values were used for the initial crop stage as reported earlier it was assumed that these crops were not stressed because the related kcb tab values are supposed to represent standard near to the pristine crop conditions however the numerical search procedure led to fr values slightly below 1 0 with the exception of lettuce since the late season is very short for these crops the result was that kcb end a p values were close to kcb mid a p values generally differing by 0 10 or 0 05 in agreement with the values tabulated by pereira et al 2021a kc mid a p and kc end a p were computed from kcb mid a p and kcb end a p respectively assuming a difference of 0 10 for all crops except artichoke and lettuce where that difference is 0 05 following the assumptions made in fao56 and pereira et al 2021a moreover it was observed that a p computed kc and kcb values for leaves and flowers vegetable crops are equal to the values tabulated by pereira et al 2021a which should be expected because the latter were used as target of the numerical search procedure used to find the best ml and fr parameters for most fruit and pod vegetable crops table 8 since the late season is short h values do not change from the mid season to the end season while fc eff was considered to decrease by 0 05 from the mid to the end season in agreement with the information provided by pereira et al 2021a however because these crops are harvested early no decreases were considered for cucumber and okra in contrast a decrease of 0 10 was assumed for squash and zucchini ml values close to 2 0 were assumed for all crops at both the mid and end season because the ml value does not influence the kd results eq 6 as for the previously discussed vegetable crops fr was assumed to be close to 1 0 for all fruit and pod vegetable crops during the mid season since the target kcb tab values pereira et al 2021a are standard not stressed and cultivated under nearly pristine conditions in contrast lower fr values were considered at harvest for all crops of this type since they have a relatively long late season especially chili pepper melon pumpkin squash and watermelon the computed kcb end a p values are smaller than kcb mid a p values in all cases but just slightly smaller in the case of produce that are consumed fresh e g bell pepper cucumber eggplant okra strawberries and tomato when predicting crop coefficients for vegetable crops users of the a p approach should verify that the assumptions describe above are appropriate for their local environment crop varieties and management and therefore if the default values for the ml and fr parameters presented in this paper can be used as defaults in their computations with observed fc and h when the crops are stressed the application of the a p approach may also be performed using observed fc and h and a reduced fr value 4 2 field crops table 9 presents the results of the application of the a p approach to grain legumes and includes the parameters used in the computations in all cases h values decreased from the mid season to the end season due to crop senescence but decreases in h values are small when grain pods are harvested green or fresh as occurs for bean grams and fava bean crops fc eff by the end season is always smaller than at the mid season particularly when grain legumes are harvested dry similar to the vegetable crops ml at the mid season equals 2 0 fr values are equal or near to 1 0 for all crops during the mid season since it is assumed that the crops are not stressed and are cultivated in the pristine conditions represented by standard crop coefficients pereira et al 2021b fr values at end season are close to 1 0 when the crop is cultivated for harvesting green as it happens for bean black or green gram and fava bean when harvesting at the green pods stage and to peas harvested for processing in contrast fr is low when the crop is harvested with dry grains which happens with most crops listed in table 9 all fr values were obtained with a numerical search procedure targeting the kcb mid tab and kcb end tab values tabulated by pereira et al 2021b therefore the adopted parameters ml and fr are those appropriate for predicting kcb a p of grain legume crops in agreement with values tabulated by pereira et al 2021b the kc mid a p values were estimated by adding 0 05 to the kcb mid a p values and the kc end a p values were estimated by adding 0 10 to the kcb end a p values exceptions refer to the cases when the late season is very short such as peas harvested for processing for dry grain production kcb a p and kc a p values for the end season are much smaller than at mid season results for fiber oil and sugar crops are reported in table 10 the h values are assumed to slightly decrease after the mid season with the exception of sugar beet and sugar cane for which h values do not decrease as per the information used by pereira et al 2021b similarly slight decreases of fc eff are also assumed for all crops ml was assumed to equal 2 0 as for other field crops since kd at the mid and end season does not change computed fr values through the numerical search procedure revealed values that were equal or close to 1 0 at the mid season all but the sugar crops dry out in the field and have a large late season therefore fr decreases to values below 0 40 for fiber and oil crops down to values smaller than 0 25 in case of canola safflower and sunflower in contrast fr values at end season are larger for the sugar crops coherently the kcb end a p values are much lower than kcb mid a p with the exception of the sugar crops which are kept green until harvest and have kcb end a p values of 0 75 or higher kc a p values were computed assuming a difference relative to kcb a p of 0 05 at the mid season for the end season that difference is 0 10 for cotton canola castor bean sugar beet and sugar cane in agreement with tabulated values in fao56 and pereira et al 2021b results for cereals table 11 show a similar behaviour among crops however with large differences in the case of rice the values for h are generally slightly smaller at the end season after a long late season when senescence occurs similarly fc eff also slightly decreases after the mid season ml values of 2 0 were adopted for all crops and both the mid and end seasons since only very low values not appropriate for the considered vegetable and field crops would influence the computation of kd the numerical search procedure which used as the target the kcb tab values tabulated by pereira et al 2021b values for fr in the mid season are close or equal to 1 0 and much smaller fr values at the end season the latter are quite small around 0 20 when harvested with low moisture and around 0 45 with high moisture since in that case the late season is relatively short fr decreases much less when the crop is harvested for silage or is used as biomass for energy because the late season is then short following the tabulated values in fao56 allen et al 1998 and in the review paper by pereira et al 2021b the kc a p values generally are just 0 05 higher than kcb a p for all cereals during the mid season and for most of them at the end season table 11 exceptions include maize for silage grain and sweet sorghum and wheat harvested with high moisture grain whose kc end a p result from adding 0 10 to kcb end a p thus when the crop does not dry much before harvesting as expected the kcb a p and kc a p values from the numerical search procedure fully match the tabulated values in pereira et al 2021b which favours the use ml and fr parameters as default parameters by any user of the a p approach that intends to determine crop coefficients from observed values of fc and h for flooded paddy rice table 11 regardless of use of dry seeding and adopting or not anticipated cut off for intermittently irrigated rice and for aerobic irrigated rice the ml parameter behaves similarly to other cereals in contrast to other cereals fr 1 0 at the initial and through the crop season until the end of the mid season decreasing just a little from the mid season to the end season which is likely due to the water regime of rice paddies it results in a kcb end a p value generally equal to kcb mid a p except when the anticipated cut off is adopted kc mid a p is larger than kcb mid a p by a value varying from 0 05 to 0 15 depending upon the soil water regime with the larger difference for the intermittent irrigation mode differences for the end season are greater when anticipated cut off or intermittent irrigation are adopted because a lower soil water content is then produced at harvesting aerobic irrigated rice shows a behaviour that is in between intermittently irrigated paddies and upland cereals like wheat 4 3 tree and vine crops indicative values for standard kcb and kc for tree and vine fruit crops computed with the a p approach are presented in table 12 for vines table 13 for evergreen trees table 14 for pome fruits and pomegranate and table 15 for stone fruits and nut deciduous trees the crop parameters used for the computations are also tabulated to support applications by users the kcb a p and kc a p values refer only to the mid season and end season and to cultivation under conditions with no ground cover computations do not refer to kcb ini or kc ini because the initial season is short soil evaporation is dominant in the case of vines and deciduous trees during the initial season and soil evaporation varies with the soil water the frequency and amounts of wettings by rain and irrigation and the soil hydrodynamic properties in the case of evergreen crops kcb ini and kc ini are tied with kcb and kc relative to the non growing season which varies with the climate crop coefficients for the end season are also tied with kc and kcb for the non growing season and are also largely dependent upon the local climate therefore calculations refer to kcb a p and kc a p relative to the mid and end season which are largely dependent upon the dynamics of transpiration the option to disregard active ground cover is due to on the one hand the decreased trend in adoption of active ground cover in orchards and vineyards and on the other hand the fact that kcb a p calculation requires the use of a specific equation eq 3 and thus a different parameterization for active cover crops however the result is not far from that calculated without crop cover e g fandiño et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 crop heights were defined from those tabulated in fao56 in table 2 of allen and pereira 2009 and in tables 5 7 of rallo et al 2021 for vine crops evergreen trees and deciduous trees respectively however h values were selected considering the current trends for high densities and vigour reducing rootstocks aimed to facilitate mechanized harvesting which implies shorter crop heights changes in h from the mid season to end season were not considered the values for fc eff resulted from combining the remote sensing observed fc values tabulated in table 5 those previously tabulated by allen and pereira 2009 and observed values reported in literature and tabulated by rallo et al 2021 ml and fr values were obtained through the numerical search aimed at matching the standard values tabulated by rallo et al 2021 considering crop density and training systems as well as the selected fc and h tabulated by these authors because kcb values tabulated in rallo et al 2021 refer to a central value 10 the numerical search was applied targeting two values the central one kcb a p and the upper one kcb a p 10 computations for grapes table 12 were performed with consideration of training and fc given that kcb a p is influenced primely by training and fc and secondarily by h these factors lead generally to larger fc and h values for table grapes compared to wine grapes resulting in larger kcb a p values for table grapes for all vines kc mid a p resulted from adding 0 05 to kcb mid a p in agreement with the simplified procedure used in fao56 allen et al 1998 and in rallo et al 2021 this approach results from the fact that drip irrigation systems are commonly used with vines and thus only a small fraction of soil is wetted by irrigation most of the wetted soil area is under the shadow of the vine canopy and thus only a limited amount of solar energy reaches the soil surface also limiting the amount of soil water evaporation in contrast following rallo et al 2021 kc end a p values were obtained by adding 0 10 to kcb end a p when fc 0 30 and adding 0 05 when fc is higher the ml values were based upon those of table 2 used to initiate the numerical search procedure in contrast the fr values vary considerably and indicate that stomatal adjustment is applied by the crop since a beneficial deficit irrigation is commonly practiced to limit the vegetative vigour of the plants larger fr correspond to the larger kcb target when the numerical search was applied larger fr values for table grapes were observed for the young plants because the water deficits are then smaller and when the training system was overhead horizontal and t trellis for wine grapes the highest fr values are also associated with the young vineyards because less stress is then applied to the crop and to the training system of vertical shoot positioned trellis systems the variability of fr values was expected after the test results reported in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 and likely result from the variety of crop and irrigation management practices that influence the response of vineyards to various levels of stress kcb a p values for kiwi table 12 are not very high but fc is quite large likely because this vine is trained with pergola and t bar trellis systems kc a p values differ by 0 05 from kcb a p considering both high fc and h it results in a relatively high value for fr larger for the mid season and when the target kcb value is larger for the evergreen fruit trees table 13 in agreement with rallo et al 2021 kc mid a p was computed when adding 0 05 to kcb mid a p while kc end a p was obtained by adding a diverse amount to kcb end a p that amount decreases when fc increases i e when the canopy shaded area is larger for citrus trees the added value ranged from 0 25 in the young orchards where fc is small fc 0 25 to 0 10 in the high density orchards with fc 0 65 data for citrus table 13 was derived mainly from studies of orange trees but some information was also available for clementine and mandarin all information was assembled and it has been possible to distinguish the densities of crops fc and h the ml parameter varies little 1 6 1 7 and apparently plays a minor role in the computations the fr values are higher for the young plants since they are generally considered to be non stressed and to the orchards with taller trees and larger density i e when vegetative vigour of plants is larger specific to citrus orchards is the fact that the end season kcb a p is equal to kcb mid a p because senescence of leaves does not occur differently kc end a p is higher than kc mid a p because fruits grow and mature in winter when wetting events by precipitation are frequent data collected for olive trees made it possible to perform the calculations table 13 in relation to the density of trees and the main training types the traditional vase hedge pruned olives and hedgerow super intensive modern orchards the fc values are generally not high 0 45 and change little among the various types of orchards therefore the changes in kcb are also small the olive orchards have a larger kc end a p which is computed from the kcb end a p by adding 0 35 0 40 because the end season as well as the non growing season occur during the rainy period the parameter ml also plays a minor role and is approximately constant and equal to 1 5 since fc changes little among the considered types of orchards the fr values change little around 0 55 10 with values indicating a strong stomatal adjustment which is to be expected since pruning and training are designed to control the vigor of the trees while irrigation is practiced with application of limited volumes of water to be noted that the numerical search procedure led to fully match the target standard kcb tab values computations for apple and pear trees were performed individually in contrast to the approach used in allen and pereira 2009 and jensen and allen 2016 despite the fact that central leader type of systems are generally adopted for both crops table 14 our approach was to group both crops with pomegranate trees which commonly have similar training systems the indicative kc mid a p values for pome fruit trees and pomegranate were calculated by adding 0 05 to the kcb mid a p value while the kc end a p values were obtained by adding 0 10 or 0 05 according to the fraction of ground cover larger when fc is smaller fc 0 35 i e for the young and low density orchards where soil evaporation is larger it was assumed that height and fc are more often larger for apple and due to the canopy opacity girona et al 2011 apple orchards have a slightly higher ml than pears it resulted in quite similar values for kd and kcb full therefore in kcb values that are also quite similar fr values are larger for the young orchards less stressed than the mature ones and for medium to very high density central leader systems when more vegetative vigour is allowed nevertheless all fr values denote stomatal adjustment since beneficial deficit irrigation is commonly practiced differences among stone fruits and nut trees were reported in the reviewed literature table 4 however the information on training was insufficient for all deciduous fruits and both vase and central leader systems were mentioned thus for all stone fruits and nut trees it was only possible to tie the calculations to the crop densities table 15 the indicative kc mid a p values in for stone fruits and nut trees were computed by adding 0 05 to kcb mid a p the kc end a p values were obtained by adding 0 10 or 0 05 to kcb end a p with the highest added value for young low and medium density orchards i e when the canopy shadow at the end season is reduced relative to stone fruits crop heights are higher for apricot cherry and plum orchards but fc ml and fr values were similar to those of peach nevertheless the kcb values calculated for these crops are quite similar but it is expected that differences in crop varieties and crop management practices will result in differences for kcb a p walnut trees are higher than pistachio trees and walnut orchards are likely denser than those of pistachio related crop training was not discussed in the reviewed literature therefore following rallo et al 2021 larger fc and h values were assumed for walnut orchards resulting in larger kcb a p values than for pistachio the application of the numerical search procedure led to similar ml values for the mentioned stone fruit and nut crops with lower values for the less dense orchards fr values were higher for the mid season and lower for the end season when stomatal adjustment is strong young orchards show higher fr values because training and pruning as well as irrigation promote large vegetative vigour higher density orchards with tall trees also result in large fr values 4 4 cross validation of the ml and fr parameters usability of the a p approach the results of the a p computation are overall excellent after the application of a numerical search procedure for estimating the best ml and fr parameters that procedure aimed at finding the ml and fr parameters that led the kcb a p values to match the kcb tab by pereira et al 2021a 2021b respectively for the vegetable and field crops and by rallo et al 2021 for tree and vine crops the close agreement may be observed in tables 6 8 for vegetable crops tables 9 11 for field crops and tables 12 15 for vines and trees by comparing the tabulated kcb a p values in the 7th 8th column with the target kcb tab values in the 10th 11th column with these results we could conclude that the ml and fr parameters are adequate to compute kcb with the fc and h data tabulated in the 3rd 4th column i e the data collected from pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 however there is the need for additional validation of these ml and fr parameters using independent data cross validation was therefore applied data available for the cross validation includes already published data on fc and h which consist of input data for the application of the a p approach and kcb obs data which are to be compared with the kcb a p for the comparison a linear regression forced through the origin was adopted input data refer to the following vegetable and legume crops onion lópez urrea et al 2009a 2009b pea paredes et al 2017 soybean wei et al 2015 giménez et al 2017

al 2012 peach paço et al 2012 olives paço et al 2019 and pear and lemon rosa 2019 the cross validation was performed using the parameters ml and fr obtained with the numerical search procedure to compute kcb a p using the observed fc and h determined in the studies referred above tables 5 15 and then comparing the resulting kcb a p with the reported kcb obs results for the annual crops are presented in fig 1 and for trees and vines in fig 2 they show a quasi equality between kcb a p and the reported kcb obs with the regression coefficient b0 very close to 1 0 and the coefficient of determination r2 also not far from 1 0 consequently the root mean square errors rmse are quite small rmse 0 06 for the three sets of annual crops and rmse 0 07 for the tree and vine crops these errors are less than 10 for most of the computed kcb a p values as well as the observed kcb obs the good statistical goodness of fit values for b0 r2 and rmse allow us to conclude that the parameters ml and fr tabulated and presented here are appropriate for use with the a p approach when a user seeks to estimate a kcb value using local observations of fc and h for annual crops the goodness of fit herein were obtained with selecting the fr and ml values relative to the considered crop but for tree and vine crops the computations were performed selecting the crop group having the pair fc and h closer to the observed fc and h the results in figs 1 and 2 indicate that selecting fr and ml with that simplicity is appropriate however users may use some kind of interpolation extrapolation of fr and secondly the ml considering the fc value observed and secondly the h value this means that using the a p approach adopting the tabulated parameters fr and ml is an adequate tool to estimate kcb for the crops referred herein thus for also estimating kc using the same relations between kc and kcb referred above since kcb and kc decrease when a crop is water and or salt stressed the a p approach is also usable when deficit irrigation or low quality water are applied with observed fc and height values reflecting the impacts of those stress conditions e g santos et al 2012 wu et al 2015 5 conclusions and recommendations the allen and pereira 2009 approach to estimate crop coefficients from the fraction of ground cover and crop height following the review and application tests developed in the companion paper pereira et al 2020 has been applied to a large variety of annual and perennial crops here application of the a p approach used fc collected from both ground observations and remote sensing supplemented by ground observed h values a numerical search procedure was used to specify ml and fr parameter values resulting in best match of kcb a p with the updated standard kcb tab values of pereira et al 2021a 2021b and rallo et al 2021 the initial values of ml and fr were those already published in the literature when those parameters were not available initial values were based on those of similar crops the numerical search facilitated the determination of optimal ml and fr values for all crops and showed excellent agreement with the updated kcb values for each crop indicative kcb and kc were tabulated for the mid and end season along with corresponding values of fc and h the respective optimized ml and fr values and of the tabulated kcb tab and kc tab used as the target in the search procedure to validate the accuracy of the approach we evaluated the computations of kcb against independent sets of observed data for a diverse set of vegetable field and fruit crops a linear regression demonstrated a very good match between the observed measured kcb and the kcb derived by the a p approach using the optimized ml and fr parameters these results support adoption of the tabulated ml and fr parameters values by field practitioners in the field when using fc and h observations to calculate kcb a p the application of the a p approach using observations of fc and h with the tabulated ml and fr parameters provides for the estimation of appropriate values for local actual crop coefficients including when water and salt stresses occur the approach developed and summarized here is more practical and cost effective than estimating crop coefficients using field et observations by bowen ratio energy balance breb eddy covariance instrumentation ec soil water balance swb sap flow approaches or weighing lysimeters the predicted values calculated through use of the a p approach may be more accurate and representative of local conditions than estimating actual kc or kcb values from the tabulated standard crop coefficients however particular attention must be paid to the field evaluation of fc and h practical use of the a p approach is primarily intended to support irrigation scheduling and planning as well as to advance the use of water conservation practices which are essential responses to the challenges and pressures of global climatic changes implementation of the a p approach coupled with satellite based fc measurements within the fully automated sims framework melton et al 2012 2020 demonstrate the potential to reduce the effort required to calculate kcb values and increase access to accurate data for et based irrigation management continued development of the a p approach should proceed in parallel with additional research where actual et is observed through use of breb ec swb sap flow or remote sensing and related approaches such complementary research continues to be a high priority in order to progressively refine the fao56 methodologies development of practical approaches such as a p are particularly important in the context of challenges imposed on irrigated agriculture by global change and the growing

10063,the aquacrop model was evaluated considering a data set from a cowpea br3 tracuateua cultivar cultivation in castanhal brazil under different irrigations during the reproductive phase which is sensitive to water deficit data on leaf area index lai soil water content swc biomass and final yield of two harvests were used for model calibration 2013 and validation 2014 lai data were used for parameterization of canopy cover cc and some crop parameters obtained in the field the model was also used to evaluate the impacts of sowing dates as well as the strategy of using an economical irrigation threshold 60 of readily available water on the water use and crop yield regarding the results after parameterization of the canopy cover curve the model efficiency index ef presented a satisfactory performance 0 98 which is due to the high correlation coefficient r2 0 99 between the simulated and observed values and the low values of normalized root mean square error nrmse 6 33 for model performance in simulating swc there was high efficiency ef 0 70 for all treatments with low estimated errors and nrmse representing 8 12 of mean swc observations during validation indicating high precision for simulation of biomass and cowpea yield the model performance index ranged from 0 92 to 0 94 for biomass and from 0 92 to 0 99 for final yield these results showed that aquacrop is suitable for simulating biomass production and yield of cowpea additionally sowing in early april is appropriate for better water use and productivity and the tested irrigation threshold can be indicated to significantly improve final crop yields keywords agricultural modeling vigna unguicula l walp drip irrigation water use efficiency crop yield 1 introduction the cowpea vigna unguiculata l walp is a fast growing leguminous species that produces pod type fruits this plant plays an important socioeconomic role as one of the crops most cultivated by family farmers in underdeveloped regions farias et al 2017 in brazil it is cultivated especially in the north and northeast regions where it is a staple food for millions of families in addition it is a relevant source of employment and income lima filho et al 2013a lima et al 2016 the northeastern pará state is the main production hub in the northern brazil souza et al 2017 in this region planting is commonly performed at the end of the rainy season april aiming at reducing precipitation related risks to the harvests therefore production is limited to only one harvest conab 2018 nunes et al 2019 however cowpea still has relatively low average yield in the region 821 kg ha 1 conab 2018 generally due to crop mismanagement and water deficit especially during the reproductive phase it is because seeds are formed at this stage and when cowpea is under water deficit there is a decrease in biomass and stomatal conductance that leads to a relative reduction in grain production souza et al 2017 in order to supply the amount of water required by the cowpea crop in the region irrigation has been applied especially over the reproductive phase and in the least rainy season in this way water deficit impacts can be avoided and both the quality and quantity of the cowpea yield can be positively influenced louzada and jobim 2011 lima et al 2016 farias et al 2017 moreover other sowing dates can be proposed for cowpea cultivation in the region tools capable of assisting the proper crop management and simulating biomass and yields have been presented as important strategies for planning and reducing risks in agriculture as well as assisting in decision making agrometeorological or dynamic crop models also known as agricultural forecasting models are good examples of such tools martins et al 2014 lima et al 2016 these models are used in studies on climatic risks moradi et al 2013 in addition they are also used to obtain the best yield considering different factors such as the number of individuals at sowing and different fertilizations irrigation systems and water depths barterng et al 2010 lima filho et al 2013b some models were applied in cowpea yield simulation such as beangro hoogenboom et al 1992 and cropgro oliveira et al 2012 lima filho et al 2013a 2013b however the fao s model for agricultural growth and production aquacrop raes et al 2012 paredes and torres 2016 currently used for several crops has been hardly tested on cowpea nunes et al 2019 since the parameterization of aquacrop rarely considers field based experimental data using irrigation under different water depths this study evaluated the aquacrop model s ability to simulate biomass and yield of cowpea in the northeastern pará state the experiment was carried out in the municipality of castanhal assessing different water depths over the reproductive phase the effects on yield and soil water dynamics were evaluated and this information was compared to the data collected in the field the objectives of this study were to use the field data of cowpea from two harvests to 1 parameterize the aquacrop model for simulation of canopy cover and soil water 2 evaluate the accuracy of the model for biomass and yield predictions under different irrigations during the reproductive phase to simulate the yields based on the sowing dates used by farmers 3 evaluate supplementary irrigation strategies for increasing crop production and water use efficiency 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area and crop management the field experiment was carried out at an experimental farm belonging to the federal rural university of the amazon ufra located in the municipality of castanhal 1 32 s 47 96 w and 41 m above sea level northeastern pará state during 2013 and 2014 according to the koppen climatic classification provided by alvares et al 2013 the region climate is characterized as am 1 1 tropical humid or tropical monsoon climate are regions characterized by annual precipitation greater than 1500 mm with the driest month showing average precipitation below 60 mm they are also mega thermic regions whose average temperatures in the coldest month is always above 18 c alvares et al 2013 with an average annual air temperature of 26 c and maximum and minimum air temperatures corresponding to 28 and 22 c respectively the average annual precipitation in the study period was 1781 60 mm with a rainy season from january to may 70 of total precipitation and a dry season from august to december 16 of total precipitation farias et al 2017 daily meteorological data 2003 2014 were collected from an automatic meteorological station on a grassy surface instrumented approximately 3 km from the experimental field belonging to the national institute of meteorology inmet brazil the model used data on average maximum and minimum temperatures tmed tmax and tmin c relative humidity rh wind speed at 2 m u2 m s 1 solar radiation sr w m 2 or mj m 2 day 1 and precipitation prp mm the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 mm day 1 was calculated using the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 during the experiments an automatic meteorological station was installed to monitor the meteorological variables in the field temperature rh u2 global radiation gr w m 2 prp and volumetric soil water content in the 0 30 m depth swc cm3 cm 3 there were sensors attached to a cr10x datalogger and an am16 32 multiplexer campbell scientific inc that recorded and stored the averages of these variables every 10 min the prp was measured in the experimental area to calculate the net water depth that should be applied according to the daily crop evapotranspiration etc mm d 1 of the previous day as proposed by farias et al 2017 this value was subtracted from the full irrigation to be applied on a particular day of the experiment for the calculation of etc during the experiment the single crop coefficient kc suggested by bastos et al 2008 was used table 1 the area was cultivated with the br3 tracuateua cultivar which has prostrate and indeterminate growth whose cycle lasts between 60 and 70 days freire filho et al 2009 reported that this cultivar is the most recommended for the region and the one most used by farmers in the state because it is moderately tolerant to high temperatures and to the local climate souza et al 2017 sowing was performed mechanically with a spacing of 0 50 m between the planting rows and 10 plants per linear meter total of 200 000 plants per ha on october 1 2013 and september 9 2014 during the dry season in the region the harvest was carried out on december 6 and november 11 in 2013 and 2014 respectively the soil of the experimental site was classified as dystrophic yellow latosol lima et al 2016 with sandy loam texture ramos et al 2016 the texture and other physical properties of the soil were determined in laboratories from the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa brazil for this purpose 15 undisturbed soil samples were collected using the richards pressure chamber to determine the permanent wilting point θwp cm3 cm 3 a tension table was used to measure saturation θsat cm3 cm 3 and field capacity θfc cm3 cm 3 table 2 for calculating θwp a pressure value of 1500 kpa was applied regarding θsat and θfc pressure values of 0 and 10 kpa were applied respectively in these methods soil samples lose water when the potential is higher than the retention forces therefore the sample moisture is obtained by gravimetry each potential until equilibrium is reached applied to the samples is evaluated through successive weighings or until there is no more flow teixeira and behring 2017 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat cm d 1 values were determined by pedotransfer functions based on organic matter bulk density and texture data of soil layers saxton and rawls 2006 ramos et al 2014 available soil water content awc mm was also calculated using the soil physical and hydrological properties and effective root zone zr m which was 0 30 m in the present study souza et al 2017 in a study in the same area found cowpea effective root of 0 25 m in length that is 0 05 m less than the minimum value allowed by the model and the value used in this study after parameterization the model simulation of soil water content swc was evaluated therefore the simulated values were compared to those observed in the field fertilization was carried out according to methodology proposed by embrapa for cultivation of cowpea based on the information provided by chemical analysis of the soil samples collected in the study area farias et al 2017 it was divided and performed before and 30 days after sowing das using n p k chemical fertilizers with formulations of 0 60 45 in the first year and 0 40 45 in the second year 115 and 85 kg ha 1 respectively during the experiments management treatments were performed to keep the area free of weeds diseases and pests 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experimental design was randomized with six blocks and four treatments in area of 100 m2 these treatments had different irrigations applied during the cowpea reproductive phase which is more sensitive to water deficit carvalho et al 2014 lima et al 2016 on the other hand over the vegetative phase all treatments received the same water depth 100 etc replacement in order to keep them at field capacity fc treatment 1 t1 consisted in replacing 100 of the water lost by etc in treatment 2 t2 50 of the water lost by etc was replaced in treatment 3 t3 25 of the water lost by etc was replaced and in treatment 4 t4 control there was no water replacement through irrigation aiming at representing the scenario found by most farmers in the region the irrigation depths adopted in 2013 and 2014 were applied daily and every two days respectively aiming to maintain the treatments in function of the fc 0 22 cm3 cm 3 considering water losses through evapotranspiration and to ensure that the analyzes occurred in function of the decrease of this water replacement and not by the deficit arising from several days these treatments started at 35 das and extended to 58 and 56 das in 2013 and 2014 respectively irrigation was stopped after these days since the beginning of the cowpea maturation stages was reached total required or full irrigation ci mm was based on the net water depth to the application efficiency ae of the irrigation system in the different treatments these values are shown in table 3 together with prp in the years of the experiment and cowpea phases although the experiment was carried out over the dry season in both years the occurrence of prp was noticed during both phases the vegetative phase of 2014 126 00 mm had more precipitation than in the previous year 111 75 mm which assisted to maintain the treatments at fc however during the reproductive phase the prp 153 41 and 36 82 mm in 2013 and 2014 respectively disrupted the maintenance of the target treatments overall it added a greater amount of water in both years 30 45 and 60 more for t2 t3 and t4 respectively especially in 2013 since these prp events occurred after the irrigation in the treatments table 3 therefore irrigation was applied to each treatment again when the values lost by the crop etc reached the time and quantity that allowed another application that is the daily prp in the area was always considered subtracted from the full amount of irrigation to be applied 2 3 irrigation system the system used was drip irrigation with a flow rate of 1 03 l h 1 service pressure of 29 4 kpa and emitters spaced 0 20 m apart the drip tapes were made of polyethylene with a diameter of 16 mm and built in emitters it is noteworthy that the water depths were controlled in all experiments as a function of time aided by manometers spigots and timers according to the flow rate of the emitters hydraulic evaluations were performed to determine the performance of the system according to the methodology proposed by bernardo et al 2006 this analysis was performed in all treatments and blocks by collecting containers 1000 ml positioned at the beginning middle and end of the irrigation lines for 20 min and with two repetitions these values were used to obtain the christiansen uniformity coefficient cuc 96 and 94 in 2013 and 2014 respectively the distribution uniformity coefficient duc 92 in 2013 and 89 in 2014 and ae 94 in 2013 and 92 in 2014 despite the decrease in evaluation values between the years which is normal in a system used over several years the system still had acceptable performance in both experimental years merriam and keller 1978 2 4 crop data growth was monitored daily from emergence to the end of the cowpea cycle in order to achieve it the gepts and fernández scale farias et al 2017 was used in which 10 plants were observed in a linear 1 m line used exclusively for monitoring purposes the growth measures were collected between 15 and 9 das in 2013 and 2014 respectively and weekly by selecting two 20 meter lines in each treatment five plants per treatment were collected 0 50 m linear following the experimental design adopted for each block 6 replications the organs were separated into stem petiole leaf discs peduncle flower pod and grain when present yield was computed when 90 of the plants were at maturation stages 66 and 63 das in 2013 and 2014 respectively three central linear lines with 2 m were selected for yield analysis in each treatment therefore treatment edges were not used in any analysis to avoid border effects pods and grains were collected and counted all the samples were weighed with a precision scale 0 001 g to determine fresh weight and 1000 grain weight when there were grains samples were taken to 70 c aerated stoves for 72 h in order to determine constant dry weight total dry matter dmt above ground biomass and yield kg ha 1 and weighed again leaf area index lai cm2 cm2 was determined by the disc method for all phenological stages in which three leaf discs with a radius of 0 01 m were removed from each plant ten in each treatment using leaf dry matter samples farias et al 2017 these values were used to calculate canopy cover cc which was used to compare the values simulated by the aquacrop model paredes et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 the cc values were derived using an exponential function of temporal degradation paredes and torres 2016 1 cc 1 exp α lai where α dimensionless is the light extinction coefficient of the canopy this coefficient was initially discussed by jeuffroy and ney who suggested several ways for obtaining it depends and varies for each crop and for the density of plants katerji et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 several values of α are reported for cowpea i e san josé et al 2004 studying m 28 6 6 cultivar obtained an average value of 0 66 and tesfaye et al 2006 studying the roba 1 cultivar in ethiopia found a value of 0 86 both cases were under ideal conditions without water deficit teixeira et al 2015 studying the pérola and radiante bean cultivars found values of 0 79 and 0 74 respectively in this study considering the lai and the fraction of photosynthetic radiation intercepted by the plant the value of α was determined by the coefficient of the exponential function over the cowpea cycle pengelly et al 1999 the α values were 0 83 0 80 0 77 and 0 74 for t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively c3 plants such as cowpea when compared to c4 present different behaviors for light and water during the vegetative development which explains the high value for t1 since the higher the α the greater the interception of radiation by the canopy reducing the loss of water in the soil by evaporation casaroli et al 2007 providing a higher lai and consequently a higher cc as found in the experiment harvest index hi was determined by the ratio of grain yield economically marketed part on plants used to calculate the yield in each treatment to total above ground biomass production according to the methodology proposed by meireles souza et al 2014 this index evaluates the performance of the cultivar submitted to different conditions aiming at verifying the possibility of use in a given region 2 5 aquacrop model the aquacrop model steduto et al 2012 raes et al 2012 simulates the growth of several crops cotton barley potato beet sorghum wheat and etc as a function of canopy cover cc it was developed by the fao s land and water division in 2009 to assist agricultural management and production regarding the effect of water on yield this index establishes a balance between precision simplicity and robustness it has already been widely tested for crops such as corn and tomato katerji et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 and through the parameterization for new crops such as pea paredes and torres 2016 it is possible to assist in planting planning and to analyze future scenarios the model considers the daily time step to calculate etc by treating crop transpiration tc mm d 1 and soil evaporation es mm d 1 separately however this separation is different from the one used by fao56 and was widely discussed by pereira et al 2015 thus tc is given by a simple equation 2 t c cc k ctr x et 0 tc is calculated by the canopy cover adjusted by the micro advective effects cc by the maximum transpiration coefficient kctr x dimensionless in this study the value of 1 14 was used which was adjusted by the value obtained by farias et al 2017 and et0 the kctr x is adjusted by the model taking into account the phenological stages and crop senescence the actual or adjusted transpiration ta mm d 1 can be obtained by adjusting tc to soil water stress conditions using the water stress coefficient ks whose values range from 0 to 1 through ta kstc ks describes the effects of soil water stress on the following crop growth processes raes et al 2012 1 reduction of the canopy expansion rate 2 acceleration of leaf senescence 3 stomatal closure and 4 by the penalties on hi after the beginning of the reproductive phase this value is defined in terms of a stress indicator p dimensionless specifying an upper limit 0 40 was used in the present study and a lower limit raes et al 2012 vanuytrecht et al 2014 this is different from the fao56 approach which considers a linear relationship between water stress and tc therefore the p values proposed by fao56 were not used in the aquacrop model since the processes involved do not have a linear relationship in most crops paredes and torres 2016 moreover the aquacrop model performs a daily soil water balance in the root zone in terms of depletion dr mm dr is expressed as a fraction of total available water taw mm raes et al 2012 dr ranges from zero when soil water is at fc i e 0 depletion ks 1 to one when soil water is 100 depleted ks 0 water stress begins to affect plant growth when dr exceeds readily available water raw ptaw vanuytrecht et al 2014 thus several irrigation management programs can be designed with the assistance of the model when it is necessary to avoid water stress the model immediately applies irrigation before dr reaches raw on the other hand when water stress needs to be allowed the threshold for water application is higher than raw each process affected by soil water stress senescence stomatal opening among others has its own upper and lower threshold levels raes et al 2012 es is also obtained from cc and et0 through the equation 3 e s k r 1 cc k ex et 0 where kex dimensionless is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient and kr which ranges from 0 to 1 is the evaporation reduction coefficient when kr 1 there is water availability in the soil to respond to the evaporative demand from the atmosphere in the model etc directly depends on cc therefore the model s ability to produce good predictions of biomass and yield depends on the proper parameterization of cc paredes et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 the simulation of cc growth occurs through the combination of four parts sub models steduto et al 2012 raes et al 2012 1 soil water balance 2 crop development growth and yield 3 an atmospheric sub model the rain cycle evaporative demand et0 and co2 concentration 4 a management sub model which includes irrigation and fertilization paredes et al 2014 more details about the model are available in the studies carried out by steduto et al 2012 raes et al 2012 paredes et al 2014 the estimation of cc occurs for the whole cycle considering three growth phases raes et al 2012 vanuytrecht et al 2014 the first phase starts at emergence characterized by initial canopy cover in the soil cc0 which ends when half of the maximum cc ccx is reached the exponential function of time describing the rate of cc growth uses a canopy growth coefficient cgc gdd 1 the second phase lasts until the ccx is reached at the level in which the model adopts an exponential function using the same cgc the third phase refers to the decline in cc after the beginning of senescence using a coefficient of canopy decrease cdc gdd 1 since cowpea is harvested a few days after leaf senescence begins a detailed determination of cdc was not relevant because of the short periods wellens et al 2013 followed the same procedure when parameterizing the aquacrop for cabbage and paredes and torres 2016 for peas in this study the derivation of cc paredes and torres 2016 was based on the observed lai values table 4 the model simulates dry matter above ground considering the ratio of biomass production to water transpired by the crop over the day crop yield y kg ha 1 is simulated by the model from the biomass b kg ha 1 through the following equation 4 y ƒ hi hi 0 b where hi0 is the reference harvest index souza et al 2014 that indicates the harvestable proportion and ƒhi dimensionless is an adjustment factor calculated internally and depending on the treatment used water stress and other penalties this adjustment may include impacts of water and temperature on final yield since this parameter is closely linked to the characteristics of each region some authors suggest that the index can be used only for the region and cultivar studied fanceli 2003 in the present study hi0 29 was considered for t1 because there was no water restriction in the stages of cowpea under this treatment therefore the model input data in this study included i climatic data from the inmet automatic station containing information from 2003 to 2014 consisting of daily and average annual concentrations of co2 in the atmosphere in the present study the co2 concentration of the model database and the calculated et0 values were used ii soil data referring to textural and hydraulic properties of five layers 1 m iii readily evaporable

depletion expressed in mm or raw percentage and depth criteria refilling to fc or using a fixed net water application expressed in mm or in raw percentage further information required in the model input is provided by raes et al 2012 2 6 parameterization calibration and validation parameterization was performed using the independent data sets related to the experimental site during 2013 calibration and 2014 validation initially it was performed for the parameters that influence cc and the t1 treatment which did not suffer water restrictions and then for the other parameters the initial values for the conservative parameters of cowpea were selected from the values reported for peas which is a relatively similar grain legume crop and by parameters obtained experimentally according to the methodology adopted by steduto et al 2012 the same approach was adopted by paredes and torres 2016 who considered the conservative soybean parameters as initial values for pea these values were later refined through a trial and error procedure until the simulation reached 80 adjustment in order to guarantee the best performance between simulated and observed variables after completing this procedure another trial and error procedure was applied to determine the best value of bwp biomass water productivity g m 2 through the execution of successive model simulations final biomass used in comparison with the values observed in summary the trial and error procedure began with the adjustment of the cc parameters followed by kctr x cn and finally bwp model calibration and validation required at least two distinct series of real data of the crop studied in the first step calibration model parameters were adjusted until the responses approached the observed values the parameters were considered adjusted when they presented low values of errors and high values of efficiency in the simulations regarding the validation of the results obtained for the two time series comparisons were made using graphical methods i e hydrograms and regression lines or statistical analysis such as student s t test wilmott s concordance index d and the efficiency of the model ef by nash and sutcliffe pereira et al 2015 lima et al 2016 2 7 model performance evaluation regarding the model evaluation and to assist the best adjustment of the parameters used in the crop several statistical indices were used according to the methodology adopted by paredes and torres 2016 i the determination coefficient r2 of the ordinary least squares regression and the slope b0 of the regression forced to the origin fto ii indicators of residual estimation errors normalized root mean square error nrmse mean percentage bias pbias and mean absolute error mae all expressed as a percentage these indicators were calculated for each interaction supporting the parameterization by showing the smallest error obtained iii modeling efficiency ef which indicates the quality of the modeling and provides an indication of the relative magnitude of the mean square error compared to the data variance observed all these values were calculated on a ms excel spreadsheet since there are few observations nrmse could not be calculated for the yield forecasts therefore only the gross and the relative differences were used respectively through the following equations 5 gd pi oi 6 rd pi oi oi where gd kg ha 1 is the gross difference and rd is the relative difference oi kg ha 1 represents the observations and pi kg ha 1 the yield forecasts 2 8 evaluation of sowing dates and supplementary irrigation strategy adopted in the region considering the ability of the aquacrop model to forecast cowpea yield and the simulation of soil water content under irrigation the impacts on yield and use of water were evaluated for three sowing dates april 1st 10th and 20th which are used by producers in the region conab 2018 both years of 2013 and 2014 and the series of 12 years 2003 2014 were evaluated in the automatic meteorological station from the municipality of castanhal since farmers aim to achieve high yields of cowpea and cost reduction only two scenarios of automatic programming by the model were evaluated for the three dates 1 irrigated i up to field capacity aiming at minimizing economic and production losses it is noteworthy that an irrigation threshold was used for acceptable depletion in cowpea corresponding to 60 of raw at this point the automatic irrigation of the model was triggered to restore θfc 2 non irrigated ni in order to evaluate the stress caused by lack of water on yield representing the way that cowpea is currently produced in the region the kolmogorov smirnov normality test was applied assistat software version 7 7 to verify if the dependent variable data estimated yield followed a normal distribution at the significance level of 5 silva and azevedo 2016 the estimated yields in all years did not present a normal distribution thus the non parametric kruskal wallis test was applied at the p 0 05 level to demonstrate that the supplementary irrigation strategy achieved high yields in the region all simulations were also evaluated in terms of relative yield decrease ryd paredes and torres 2016 calculated by 7 ryd y m y a y m 100 where ym kg ha 1 is the potential yield and ya kg ha 1 is the actual observed or estimated

subtracting the final soil water swend from the initial soil water swini values both computed in the field and compared with those values estimated by the model after analyzing the sowing dates adopted by producers in the region the water balance simulated by the model was demonstrated for the scenarios and years studied in addition the net irrigation requirements nir mm for the three sowing dates were calculated considering the meteorological data series 12 years these nir values were obtained from the simulations of the scenarios used in the study at the level of probability of occurrence during the simulations therefore nir series were generated for all dates analyzed paredes and torres 2016 3 results 3 1 model parameterization the parameters such as cgc cdg α and etc that influence the simulation of cc by the model were evaluated by different indicators of adjustment quality threshold values 80 adjustment which are shown in figs 1 and 2 for the comparison of observed cc values at the different treatments adopted and during the model calibration 2013 and validation 2014 respectively in the year of calibration fig 1 the parameter values adopted for the simulation of the cc presented low estimative errors nrmse 4 75 and high ef 0 97 in all treatments these results were due to the high correlation r2 0 98 between the observed and simulated values in addition they showed small underestimation trends in the simulation of cc b0 0 93 and 2 69 pbias 0 13 in most treatments t1 t2 and t4 it contributed to a low mae mae 5 25 in all treatments during the validation year fig 2 there was a tendency to underestimate the cc b0 0 98 and 1 13 pbias 3 17 in t2 t3 and t4 however the estimation errors were low and acceptable nrmse 6 33 and ef was high ef 0 97 for all treatments figs 1 and 2 these results indicate a good parameterization obtained for cc the simulation of irrigation by the model can be assessed through the dynamics of soil water content swc figs 3 and 4 show this dynamics simulated by the model in relation to the dynamics observed in the field the adjustment quality indicators show a slight tendency to underestimate the swc in the calibration year with b0 0 73 and low values of pbias 1 03 pbias 1 96 for all treatments moreover estimation errors are low and acceptable nrsme 10 73 and mae 8 91 since they did not affect the ef of the model which was higher than 0 77 for all treatments fig 3 during the validation the results were also satisfactory for the simulation of swc the adjustment quality indicators showed a small tendency of underestimation with values of b0 close to 0 92 and values of pbias ranging from 2 32 to 5 16 for all treatments overall the errors are acceptable 6 65 nrmse 8 12 and 4 17 mae 7 66 for these treatments in summary these error values did not influence the model efficiency in the simulation of swc during the validation step since the ef values were higher than 0 70 t1 fig 4 these results demonstrate that the model can support irrigation strategies in the study area since the observed swc variation was well simulated by the model satisfactory results were achieved during model calibration and validation table 5 shows all the parameter values obtained and used for cc crop water use and yield fractional thresholds of soil water depletion and soil water balance the approaches used to obtain these parameter values also include field observations the parameterization procedure and the default values were from the study by raes et al 2012 the best simulation by model in the initial cowpea phase was due to the use of the same amount of water over this phase which was also found by pereira et al 2015 in the reproductive phase in which there was differentiation in the treatments there were low underestimation values due to the treatments adopted but they did not affect the model performance it is due to the short last stage of cowpea which facilitates the parameterization cc and consequently the simulation of swc ta and es as found by paredes and torres 2016 the second phase lasts until ccx in this study the value of 93 was used is reached at the level in which the model adopts an exponential function using the same cgc and finally the third phase refers to the decline in cc after the beginning of senescence and uses a canopy decrease coefficient cdc gdd 1 the cgc and cdc parameters 0 97 and 0 53 gdd 1 respectively were adjusted and used for both years to simulate cc 3 2 biomass and yield simulations biomass b and grain yield y of cowpea both simulated by the model were used to validate the predictions in comparison to the observed values since cc was well simulated by the aquacrop model figs 1 and 2 the simulation and accuracy for both b fig 5 and y table 6 were also satisfactory in general biomass simulations along the two harvests used for calibration 2013 and validation 2014 showed an underestimation trend the regression coefficient b0 ranged between 0 93 and 1 16 with negative biases pbias ranging from 3 91 to 19 13 these trends did not affect the model performance since it had high efficiency ef in the simulation of b for both crops which resulted in values higher than 0 88 additionally estimation errors were acceptable 15 81 nrmse 21 82 and 18 20 mae 23 71 for these predictions due to the high ef of the model in biomass simulation fig 5 this underestimation was found over the early cowpea stages it was particularly related to the underestimation of the cc figs 1 and 2 curve at these stages a similar pattern was found in the study by paredes and torres 2016 in general the model also showed a satisfactory efficiency ef in the simulation of cowpea yield both in calibration and validation for all treatments adopted during 2013 the efficiency value was 0 95 due to the trend of overestimating the yield for t4 difference of 8 81 to the observed value on the other hand the other treatments showed a small difference between the observed and simulated yields ranging from 2 68 to 1 13 considering the observed mean values t1 and t3 showed a tendency of underestimation in calibration 2 65 and 2 48 of the observed mean values however during validation the model was more efficient ef 0 99 in the simulation of y it is due to the small tendency of overestimation of the simulated values of y which ranged from 0 34 to 5 39 of the observed average yield table 6 3 3 evaluation of sowing dates adopted in the region and supplementary irrigation strategy table 7 shows the supplementary irrigation strategy for 2013 and 2014 and the meteorological series 2003 2014 included in the model considering the three sowing dates april 1st 10th and 20th regarding the results for scenario i irrigated the water values used in irrigation and estimated actual evapotranspiration iwu and etc act increased according to the delay in the sowing date from the beginning to the end of april in the two simulated years 2013 and 2014 and for the series analyzed 2003 2014 it is due to the decrease in precipitation at the end of april which had increased the need for irrigation and the amount of water lost by the crop on the other hand values of total water use twu had decreased in most simulated years 2014 and 2003 2014 with the delay of sowing which may be due to the reduction of precipitation in the region therefore yields are higher on ending sowing dates for 2013 1700 kg ha 1 and for the meteorological series 1598 kg ha 1 with the exception of 2014 higher yield on april 10th ryd ranged from 5 6 to 7 8 in 2013 and from 3 9 to 9 9 in 2014 with average 2003 2014 that increased as a function of the delay in sowing thus when considering scenario i sowing at the beginning of april has a lower chance of ryd and a lower use of iwu both results were confirmed by the wpirrig values which are higher with earlier sowing april 1st therefore under the first scenario values between 1 41 and 4 69 kg m 3 were reached table 7 regarding the ni non irrigated scenario which is predominant in the region ryd had a smaller variation between sowing dates however they were quite high during the experiment performed in 2013 they ranged from 11 5 to 18 on the other hand they ranged from 17 6 to 19 4 in 2014 considering the series of meteorological data they ranged from 9 1 to 16 5 therefore there is a noticeable relation with the distribution of water in the soil when sowing was delayed under the ni scenario there was a greater risk of higher ryd ryd 16 5 for the series from 2003 2014 especially due to the lack of water for the crop during stages with a greater water requirement reproductive phase likewise in scenario i ni showed an increase of etc values with the delay in sowing consequently there was a decrease in the water use efficiency by the crop wpet table 7 considering the results of wp on both scenarios i and ni in 2013 the highest values were obtained for the sowing of april 1st 0 62 and 0 63 kg m 3 respectively however in 2014 the values referring to sowing on april 10th 0 64 and 1 21 kg m 3 were the highest in the study for the meteorological data series 2003 2014 april 20th 0 43 and 0 46 kg m 3 showed the highest values all of them were due to high yields in these days and lower twu values these results show that in a year without water deficit 2013 and 2003 2014 there is a lower variation in water productivity when the scenarios in use and years with a lower precipitation distribution 2014 are considered there is a greater variation in this efficiency table 7 the simulation of water balance by the model for these adopted scenarios i and ni shows that with the delay in sowing a greater amount of water is lost through infiltration infil drain and runoff in both simulated scenarios and years analyzed sowing on april 1st also ensures a better use of water by the crop through transpiration tc and fewer losses of water by evaporation es this result shows that in addition to leading to a higher production gain table 7 this date decreases the losses of water by other balance components table 8 fig 6 shows the probability curves of the net irrigation requirements nir for the three sowing dates resulting from model simulation for the series included they show that nir varied highly from 5 to 104 9 118 and 10 122 mm for april 1st april 10th and the last date of sowing respectively this variability results mainly from the high variation in the effective precipitation between the years in the region which ranged from 180 to 513 117 482 and 137 442 mm when sowing was performed on april 1st 10th and 20th respectively fig 6 therefore farmers who sow at the end of april are more likely to apply irrigation especially in severe summer years 122 mm in general although the first date experiences a greater amount of effective precipitation farmers must apply a small water depth which demonstrates the need for irrigation 4 discussion many authors state that a proper parameterization of the cc curve and the water use parameters are necessary to obtain the soil water balance provided by the model paredes et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 thus the aquacrop model can assist in irrigation strategies and crop yield prediction pereira et al 2015 in this study suitable swc simulation results were obtained for both years calibration and validation it shows that these values are consistent with the values observed in the field which also indicates that the parameterization of the model for cc and soil water content parameters kc tr x coefficient of water stress in soil ks rew e cn had satisfactory adjustments and are adequate when compared to models tested in the simulation of swc the aquacrop model demonstrated a better performance dallacort et al 2010 for example using the cs cropgro model for different conditions and water depths in common bean cultivation found a correlation coefficient r2 ranging from 0 70 to 0 74 in addition these authors found considerable differences between the observed and simulated values which indicates inefficiency in the simulation of water absorption and redistribution into the soil more recently santos et al 2016 using the same model cs cropgro for the iac carioca cultivar in jaboticabal sp also reported low model efficiency in the simulation of swc which was due to low correlation between the values r2 0 55 and high estimation errors rmse 0 037 cm3 cm 3 for the approached years therefore the aquacrop model proved to be useful in estimating swc for local and experimental conditions during parameterization the aquacrop model does not follow the approach suggested by fao56 and uses different thresholds for the impacts of soil water stress on the various physiological processes if the upper limit value proposed by allen et al 1998 pupper 0 45 were taken into account the model would consider cowpea as extremely tolerant to water stress regarding leaf expansion and moderately sensitive to senescence consequently the model performance would not agree with results found by fernandes et al 2015 and farias et al 2017 moreover for the pollination failure pupper in the aquacrop a minimum value of 0 75 is established thus according to several studies the cowpea crop is considered as sensitive to water stress souza et al 2017 in relation to this condition in this study values for these parameters pupper and ks curve forms were adopted by conviction and references table 5 therefore it is noticeable that the parameterization adopted in this study is proper moreover it emphasizes that the aquacrop model demonstrates high efficiency for simulation of cowpea biomass production and yield predictions for all adopted treatments these results are similar to other model applications for cowpea bastos et al 2002 found differences ranging from 2 0 to 9 8 using the cropgro model for the br 14 mulato cowpea cultivar dallacort et al 2011 using the cs cropgro model found a difference of 29 santos et al 2016 also using the cs cropgro model in the simulation of common bean yield found a difference ranging from 16 7 51 6 in the treatments adopted more recently in the study by nunes et al 2019 with the aquacrop model for assessing climate risk and the performance of the model for the simulation of cowpea yield the results showed that the model can be used in the simulation of yields for the region since it was sensitive to the seasonality and proved to be consistent in these predictions although it was not validated in the field in turn the yield results found in this study demonstrate that the use of irrigation during the dry season in the region can be an alternative not only for managing to produce a new crop but also for minimizing the effects of lack of water during the reproductive period of the season as found by farias et al 2017 nunes et al 2019 the differences between the adopted scenarios are relevant table 7 as well as the sowing dates which indicate that later sowing should be avoided april 20th fortunately sowing has been practiced by most farmers conab 2018 in addition adopting supplementary irrigation especially over the reproductive period of cowpea has been suggested in other studies such as farias et al 2017 souza et al 2017 since the model was also applied for the series of climatic conditions of the region 2003 2014 the duration of cowpea cycle for sowing until april 1st ranged from 67 to 69 days on the other hand for the sowing on april 10th the cycle ranged from 65 to 66 days and had small durations from 64 to 65 days which corresponded to sowing until april 20th such differences are due to the fact that the crop cycle develops in advance under high temperatures paredes and torres 2016 in the study carried out by farias et al 2017 it was found that the cowpea cycle is anticipated when it is sown in the months with warmer temperatures and yield may decrease due to the lack of water during the reproductive phase of the crop this response is similar to the results found in the simulation performed by the model in the present study late sowing in castanhal can decrease not only the period available for harvest but also final yield this result may increase the demand for supplementary irrigation especially during the reproductive phase which could increase final yield for farmers and lead to optimal crop water use the simulation of the water balance by the model showed that it can provide further insights into the strategies adopted by farmers in the region it is important to mention that these results are simulated and the users must be careful since there was no validation with a field experiment finally the evaluated scenarios demonstrate that when farmers perform late sowing they are more likely to use supplementary irrigation reaching up to 122 mm it reinforces that the study of the climatic variability of the region has a great importance when high yields and better water use are intended therefore the aquacrop model can assist in this understanding and management 5 conclusions this study presents an approach to the parameterization of the aquacrop model for the cowpea crop focusing on water use biomass yield under different irrigations during the reproductive phase and the impact of sowing dates normally used the ability of the model to simulate canopy cover cc soil water content biomass and ﬁnal grain yield was assessed using soil water content and crop observations during two years calibration and validation despite the limited dataset used parameterization was successfully tested resulting in very low deviations in biomass and yield prediction the satisfactory predictions for biomass and yield obtained in the present study refers to i the data quality obtained in the field and the crop parameters for studies on parameterization of crop models such efficiency can be achieved when using at least two year series ii the suitable parameterization of the cc curve and iii optimal parameterization relative to soil water content simulation the results of this study provide a noteworthy basis for further research including the need to reﬁne the parameterization considering a broader range of environments and varieties of cowpea as well as the use of climatic series with more years of data contributing with the establishment of the most appropriate sowing period using the model the parameterized model was used for evaluating supplementary irrigation for cowpea regarding yield and water productivity the results indicate that the use of a threshold that corresponded to 60 of readily available water raw aiming at reducing irrigation costs and minimizing yield losses even in a rainy season decreased the relative yield loss ryd by up to 10 consequently it resulted in increased cowpea production average increase of 65 kg ha 1 in production the best sowing date corresponds to early april while late sowing should be avoided in addition after assessing the sowing dates for the experiment years supplementary irrigation should be adopted to ensure high yields however the proper application requires support to farmers decisions on irrigation values therefore the aquacrop model can be a useful tool to help decision making for cowpea irrigation management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10063,the aquacrop model was evaluated considering a data set from a cowpea br3 tracuateua cultivar cultivation in castanhal brazil under different irrigations during the reproductive phase which is sensitive to water deficit data on leaf area index lai soil water content swc biomass and final yield of two harvests were used for model calibration 2013 and validation 2014 lai data were used for parameterization of canopy cover cc and some crop parameters obtained in the field the model was also used to evaluate the impacts of sowing dates as well as the strategy of using an economical irrigation threshold 60 of readily available water on the water use and crop yield regarding the results after parameterization of the canopy cover curve the model efficiency index ef presented a satisfactory performance 0 98 which is due to the high correlation coefficient r2 0 99 between the simulated and observed values and the low values of normalized root mean square error nrmse 6 33 for model performance in simulating swc there was high efficiency ef 0 70 for all treatments with low estimated errors and nrmse representing 8 12 of mean swc observations during validation indicating high precision for simulation of biomass and cowpea yield the model performance index ranged from 0 92 to 0 94 for biomass and from 0 92 to 0 99 for final yield these results showed that aquacrop is suitable for simulating biomass production and yield of cowpea additionally sowing in early april is appropriate for better water use and productivity and the tested irrigation threshold can be indicated to significantly improve final crop yields keywords agricultural modeling vigna unguicula l walp drip irrigation water use efficiency crop yield 1 introduction the cowpea vigna unguiculata l walp is a fast growing leguminous species that produces pod type fruits this plant plays an important socioeconomic role as one of the crops most cultivated by family farmers in underdeveloped regions farias et al 2017 in brazil it is cultivated especially in the north and northeast regions where it is a staple food for millions of families in addition it is a relevant source of employment and income lima filho et al 2013a lima et al 2016 the northeastern pará state is the main production hub in the northern brazil souza et al 2017 in this region planting is commonly performed at the end of the rainy season april aiming at reducing precipitation related risks to the harvests therefore production is limited to only one harvest conab 2018 nunes et al 2019 however cowpea still has relatively low average yield in the region 821 kg ha 1 conab 2018 generally due to crop mismanagement and water deficit especially during the reproductive phase it is because seeds are formed at this stage and when cowpea is under water deficit there is a decrease in biomass and stomatal conductance that leads to a relative reduction in grain production souza et al 2017 in order to supply the amount of water required by the cowpea crop in the region irrigation has been applied especially over the reproductive phase and in the least rainy season in this way water deficit impacts can be avoided and both the quality and quantity of the cowpea yield can be positively influenced louzada and jobim 2011 lima et al 2016 farias et al 2017 moreover other sowing dates can be proposed for cowpea cultivation in the region tools capable of assisting the proper crop management and simulating biomass and yields have been presented as important strategies for planning and reducing risks in agriculture as well as assisting in decision making agrometeorological or dynamic crop models also known as agricultural forecasting models are good examples of such tools martins et al 2014 lima et al 2016 these models are used in studies on climatic risks moradi et al 2013 in addition they are also used to obtain the best yield considering different factors such as the number of individuals at sowing and different fertilizations irrigation systems and water depths barterng et al 2010 lima filho et al 2013b some models were applied in cowpea yield simulation such as beangro hoogenboom et al 1992 and cropgro oliveira et al 2012 lima filho et al 2013a 2013b however the fao s model for agricultural growth and production aquacrop raes et al 2012 paredes and torres 2016 currently used for several crops has been hardly tested on cowpea nunes et al 2019 since the parameterization of aquacrop rarely considers field based experimental data using irrigation under different water depths this study evaluated the aquacrop model s ability to simulate biomass and yield of cowpea in the northeastern pará state the experiment was carried out in the municipality of castanhal assessing different water depths over the reproductive phase the effects on yield and soil water dynamics were evaluated and this information was compared to the data collected in the field the objectives of this study were to use the field data of cowpea from two harvests to 1 parameterize the aquacrop model for simulation of canopy cover and soil water 2 evaluate the accuracy of the model for biomass and yield predictions under different irrigations during the reproductive phase to simulate the yields based on the sowing dates used by farmers 3 evaluate supplementary irrigation strategies for increasing crop production and water use efficiency 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area and crop management the field experiment was carried out at an experimental farm belonging to the federal rural university of the amazon ufra located in the municipality of castanhal 1 32 s 47 96 w and 41 m above sea level northeastern pará state during 2013 and 2014 according to the koppen climatic classification provided by alvares et al 2013 the region climate is characterized as am 1 1 tropical humid or tropical monsoon climate are regions characterized by annual precipitation greater than 1500 mm with the driest month showing average precipitation below 60 mm they are also mega thermic regions whose average temperatures in the coldest month is always above 18 c alvares et al 2013 with an average annual air temperature of 26 c and maximum and minimum air temperatures corresponding to 28 and 22 c respectively the average annual precipitation in the study period was 1781 60 mm with a rainy season from january to may 70 of total precipitation and a dry season from august to december 16 of total precipitation farias et al 2017 daily meteorological data 2003 2014 were collected from an automatic meteorological station on a grassy surface instrumented approximately 3 km from the experimental field belonging to the national institute of meteorology inmet brazil the model used data

be applied according to the daily crop evapotranspiration etc mm d 1 of the previous day as proposed by farias et al 2017 this value was subtracted from the full irrigation to be applied on a particular day of the experiment for the calculation of etc during the experiment the single crop coefficient kc suggested by bastos et al 2008 was used table 1 the area was cultivated with the br3 tracuateua cultivar which has prostrate and indeterminate growth whose cycle lasts between 60 and 70 days freire filho et al 2009 reported that this cultivar is the most recommended for the region and the one most used by farmers in the state because it is moderately tolerant to high temperatures and to the local climate souza et al 2017 sowing was performed mechanically with a spacing of 0 50 m between the planting rows and 10 plants per linear meter total of 200 000 plants per ha on october 1 2013 and september 9 2014 during the dry season in the region the harvest was carried out on december 6 and november 11 in 2013 and 2014 respectively the soil of the experimental site was classified as dystrophic yellow latosol lima et al 2016 with sandy loam texture ramos et al 2016 the texture and other physical properties of the soil were determined in laboratories from the brazilian agricultural research corporation embrapa brazil for this purpose 15 undisturbed soil samples were collected using the richards pressure chamber to determine the permanent wilting point θwp cm3 cm 3 a tension table was used to measure saturation θsat cm3 cm 3 and field capacity θfc cm3 cm 3 table 2 for calculating θwp a pressure value of 1500 kpa was applied regarding θsat and θfc pressure values of 0 and 10 kpa were applied respectively in these methods soil samples lose water when the potential is higher than the retention forces therefore the sample moisture is obtained by gravimetry each potential until equilibrium is reached applied to the samples is evaluated through successive weighings or until there is no more flow teixeira and behring 2017 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat cm d 1 values were determined by pedotransfer functions based on organic matter bulk density and texture data of soil layers saxton and rawls 2006 ramos et al 2014 available soil water content awc mm was also calculated using the soil physical and hydrological properties and effective root zone zr m which was 0 30 m in the present study souza et al 2017 in a study in the same area found cowpea effective root of 0 25 m in length that is 0 05 m less than the minimum value allowed by the model and the value used in this study after parameterization the model simulation of soil water content swc was evaluated therefore the simulated values were compared to those observed in the field fertilization was carried out according to methodology proposed by embrapa for cultivation of cowpea based on the information provided by chemical analysis of the soil samples collected in the study area farias et al 2017 it was divided and performed before and 30 days after sowing das using n p k chemical fertilizers with formulations of 0 60 45 in the first year and 0 40 45 in the second year 115 and 85 kg ha 1 respectively during the experiments management treatments were performed to keep the area free of weeds diseases and pests 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experimental design was randomized with six blocks and four treatments in area of 100 m2 these treatments had different irrigations applied during the cowpea reproductive phase which is more sensitive to water deficit carvalho et al 2014 lima et al 2016 on the other hand over the vegetative phase all treatments received the same water depth 100 etc replacement in order to keep them at field capacity fc treatment 1 t1 consisted in replacing 100 of the water lost by etc in treatment 2 t2 50 of the water lost by etc was replaced in treatment 3 t3 25 of the water lost by etc was replaced and in treatment 4 t4 control there was no water replacement through irrigation aiming at representing the scenario found by most farmers in the region the irrigation depths adopted in 2013 and 2014 were applied daily and every two days respectively aiming to maintain the treatments in function of the fc 0 22 cm3 cm 3 considering water losses through evapotranspiration and to ensure that the analyzes occurred in function of the decrease of this water replacement and not by the deficit arising from several days these treatments started at 35 das and extended to 58 and 56 das in 2013 and 2014 respectively irrigation was stopped after these days since the beginning of the cowpea maturation stages was reached total required or full irrigation ci mm was based on the net water depth to the application efficiency ae of the irrigation system in the different treatments these values are shown in table 3 together with prp in the years of the experiment and cowpea phases although the experiment was carried out over the dry season in both years the occurrence of prp was noticed during both phases the vegetative phase of 2014 126 00 mm had more precipitation than in the previous year 111 75 mm which assisted to maintain the treatments at fc however during the reproductive phase the prp 153 41 and 36 82 mm in 2013 and 2014 respectively disrupted the maintenance of the target treatments overall it added a greater amount of water in both years 30 45 and 60 more for t2 t3 and t4 respectively especially in 2013 since these prp events occurred after the irrigation in the treatments table 3 therefore irrigation was applied to each treatment again when the values lost by the crop etc reached the time and quantity that allowed another application that is the daily prp in the area was always considered subtracted from the full amount of irrigation to be applied 2 3 irrigation system the system used was drip irrigation with a flow rate of 1 03 l h 1 service pressure of 29 4 kpa and emitters spaced 0 20 m apart the drip tapes were made of polyethylene with a diameter of 16 mm and built in emitters it is noteworthy that the water depths were controlled in all experiments as a function of time aided by manometers spigots and timers according to the flow rate of the emitters hydraulic evaluations were performed to determine the performance of the system according to the methodology proposed by bernardo et al 2006 this analysis was performed in all treatments and blocks by collecting containers 1000 ml positioned at the beginning middle and end of the irrigation lines for 20 min and with two repetitions these values were used to obtain the christiansen uniformity coefficient cuc 96 and 94 in 2013 and 2014 respectively the distribution uniformity coefficient duc 92 in 2013 and 89 in 2014 and ae 94 in 2013 and 92 in 2014 despite the decrease in evaluation values between the years which is normal in a system used over several years the system still had acceptable performance in both experimental years merriam and keller 1978 2 4 crop data growth was monitored daily from emergence to the end of the cowpea cycle in order to achieve it the gepts and fernández scale farias et al 2017 was used in which 10 plants were observed in a linear 1 m line used exclusively for monitoring purposes the growth measures were collected between 15 and 9 das in 2013 and 2014 respectively and weekly by selecting two 20 meter lines in each treatment five plants per treatment were collected 0 50 m linear following the experimental design adopted for each block 6 replications the organs were separated into stem petiole leaf discs peduncle flower pod and grain when present yield was computed when 90 of the plants were at maturation stages 66 and 63 das in 2013 and 2014 respectively three central linear lines with 2 m were selected for yield analysis in each treatment therefore treatment edges were not used in any analysis to avoid border effects pods and grains were collected and counted all the samples were weighed with a precision scale 0 001 g to determine fresh weight and 1000 grain weight when there were grains samples were taken to 70 c aerated stoves for 72 h in order to determine constant dry weight total dry matter dmt above ground biomass and yield kg ha 1 and weighed again leaf area index lai cm2 cm2 was determined by the disc method for all phenological stages in which three leaf discs with a radius of 0 01 m were removed from each plant ten in each treatment using leaf dry matter samples farias et al 2017 these values were used to calculate canopy cover cc which was used to compare the values simulated by the aquacrop model paredes et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 the cc values were derived using an exponential function of temporal degradation paredes and torres 2016 1 cc 1 exp α lai where α dimensionless is the light extinction coefficient of the canopy this coefficient was initially discussed by jeuffroy and ney who suggested several ways for obtaining it depends and varies for each crop and for the density of plants katerji et al 2013 pereira et al 2015 several values of α are reported for cowpea i e san josé et al 2004 studying m 28 6 6 cultivar obtained an average value of 0 66 and tesfaye et al 2006 studying the roba 1 cultivar in ethiopia found a value of 0 86 both cases were under ideal conditions without water deficit teixeira et al 2015 studying the pérola and radiante bean cultivars found values of 0 79 and 0 74 respectively in this study considering the lai and the fraction of photosynthetic radiation intercepted by the plant the value of α was determined by the coefficient of the exponential function over the cowpea cycle pengelly et al 1999 the α values were 0 83 0 80 0 77 and 0 74 for t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively c3 plants such as cowpea when compared to c4 present different behaviors for light and water during the vegetative development which explains the high value for t1 since the higher the α the greater the interception of radiation by the canopy reducing the loss of water in the soil by evaporation casaroli et al 2007 providing a higher lai and consequently a higher cc as found in the experiment harvest index hi was determined by the ratio of grain yield economically marketed part on plants used to calculate the yield in each treatment to total above ground biomass production according to the methodology proposed by meireles souza et al 2014 this index evaluates the performance of the cultivar submitted to different conditions aiming at verifying the possibility of use in a given region 2 5 aquacrop model the aquacrop model steduto et al 2012 raes et al 2012 simulates the growth of several crops cotton barley potato beet sorghum wheat and etc as a function of canopy cover cc it was developed by the fao s land and water division in 2009 to assist agricultural management and production regarding the effect of water on yield this index establishes a balance between precision simplicity and robustness it has already been widely tested for crops such as corn and tomato katerji et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 and through the parameterization for new crops such as pea paredes and torres 2016 it is possible to assist in planting planning and to analyze future scenarios the model considers the daily time step to calculate etc by treating crop transpiration tc mm d 1 and soil evaporation es mm d 1 separately however this separation is different from the one used by fao56 and was widely discussed by pereira et al 2015 thus tc is given by a simple equation 2 t c cc k ctr x et 0 tc is calculated by the canopy cover adjusted by the micro advective effects cc by the maximum transpiration coefficient kctr x dimensionless in this study the value of 1 14 was used which was adjusted by the value obtained by farias et al 2017 and et0 the kctr x is adjusted by the model taking into account the phenological stages and crop senescence the actual or adjusted transpiration ta mm d 1 can be obtained by adjusting tc to soil water stress conditions using the water stress coefficient ks whose values range from 0 to 1 through ta kstc ks describes the effects of soil water stress on the following crop growth processes raes et al 2012 1 reduction of the canopy expansion rate 2 acceleration of leaf senescence 3 stomatal closure and 4 by the penalties on hi after the beginning of the reproductive phase this value is defined in terms of a stress indicator p dimensionless specifying an upper limit 0 40 was used in the present study and a lower limit raes et al 2012 vanuytrecht et al 2014 this is different from the fao56 approach which considers a linear relationship between water stress and tc therefore the p values proposed by fao56 were not used in the aquacrop model since the processes involved do not have a linear relationship in most crops paredes and torres 2016 moreover the aquacrop model performs a daily soil water balance in the root zone in terms of depletion dr mm dr is expressed as a fraction of total available water taw mm raes et al 2012 dr ranges from zero when soil water is at fc i e 0 depletion ks 1 to one when soil water is 100 depleted ks 0 water stress begins to affect plant growth when dr exceeds readily available water raw ptaw vanuytrecht et al 2014 thus several irrigation management programs can be designed with the assistance of the model when it is necessary to avoid water stress the model immediately applies irrigation before dr reaches raw on the other hand when water stress needs to be allowed the threshold for water application is higher than raw each process affected by soil water stress senescence stomatal opening among others has its own upper and lower threshold levels raes et al 2012 es is also obtained from cc and et0 through the equation 3 e s k r 1 cc k ex et 0 where kex dimensionless is the maximum soil evaporation coefficient and kr which ranges from 0 to 1 is the evaporation reduction coefficient when kr 1 there is water availability in the soil to respond to the evaporative demand from the atmosphere in the model etc directly depends on cc therefore the model s ability to produce good predictions of biomass and yield depends on the proper parameterization of cc paredes et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 the simulation of cc growth occurs through the combination of four parts sub models steduto et al 2012 raes et al 2012 1 soil water balance 2 crop development growth and yield 3 an atmospheric sub model the rain cycle evaporative demand et0 and co2 concentration 4 a management sub model which includes irrigation and fertilization paredes et al 2014 more details about the model are available in the studies carried out by steduto et al 2012 raes et al 2012 paredes et al 2014 the estimation of cc occurs for the whole cycle considering three growth phases raes et al 2012 vanuytrecht et al 2014 the first phase starts at emergence characterized by initial canopy cover in the soil cc0 which ends when half of the maximum cc ccx is reached the exponential function of time describing the rate of cc growth uses a canopy growth coefficient cgc gdd 1 the second phase lasts until the ccx is reached at the level in which the model adopts an exponential function using the same cgc the third phase refers to the decline in cc after the beginning of senescence using a coefficient of canopy decrease cdc gdd 1 since cowpea is harvested a few days after leaf senescence begins a detailed determination of cdc was not relevant because of the short periods wellens et al 2013 followed the same procedure when parameterizing the aquacrop for cabbage and paredes and torres 2016 for peas in this study the derivation of cc paredes and torres 2016 was based on the observed lai values table 4 the model simulates dry matter above ground considering the ratio of biomass production to water transpired by the crop over the day crop yield y kg ha 1 is simulated by the model from the biomass b kg ha 1 through the following equation 4 y ƒ hi hi 0 b where hi0 is the reference harvest index souza et al 2014 that indicates the harvestable proportion and ƒhi dimensionless is an adjustment factor calculated internally and depending on the treatment used water stress and other penalties this adjustment may include impacts of water and temperature on final yield since this parameter is closely linked to the characteristics of each region some authors suggest that the index can be used only for the region and cultivar studied fanceli 2003 in the present study hi0 29 was considered for t1 because there was no water restriction in the stages of cowpea under this treatment therefore the model input data in this study included i climatic data from the inmet automatic station containing information from 2003 to 2014 consisting of daily and average annual concentrations of co2 in the atmosphere in the present study the co2 concentration of the model database and the calculated et0 values were used ii soil data referring to textural and hydraulic properties of five layers 1 m iii readily evaporable water rew mm and curve number cn dimensionless calibrated to characterize soil evaporation and surface runoff respectively rew was estimated by using the texture and retention characteristics of the upper layer 0 0 20 m allen et al 1998 iv data on soil management practices that influence soil water balance i e irrigation practices vegetation cover and runoff reduction v irrigation data 1 net

depletion expressed in mm or raw percentage and depth criteria refilling to fc or using a fixed net water application expressed in mm or in raw percentage further information required in the model input is provided by raes et al 2012 2 6 parameterization calibration and validation parameterization was performed using the independent data sets related to the experimental site during 2013 calibration and 2014 validation initially it was performed for the parameters that influence cc and the t1 treatment which did not suffer water restrictions and then for the other parameters the initial values for the conservative parameters of cowpea were selected from the values reported for peas which is a relatively similar grain legume crop and by parameters obtained experimentally according to the methodology adopted by steduto et al 2012 the same approach was adopted by paredes and torres 2016 who considered the conservative soybean parameters as initial values for pea these values were later refined through a trial and error procedure until the simulation reached 80 adjustment in order to guarantee the best performance between simulated and observed variables after completing this procedure another trial and error procedure was applied to determine the best value of bwp biomass water productivity g m 2 through the execution of successive model simulations final biomass used in comparison with the values observed in summary the trial and error procedure began with the adjustment of the cc parameters followed by kctr x cn and finally bwp model calibration and validation required at least two distinct series of real data of the crop studied in the first step calibration model parameters were adjusted until the responses approached the observed values the parameters were considered adjusted when they presented low values of errors and high values of efficiency in the simulations regarding the validation of the results obtained for the two time series comparisons were made using graphical methods i e hydrograms and regression lines or statistical analysis such as student s t test wilmott s concordance index d and the efficiency of the model ef by nash and sutcliffe pereira et al 2015 lima et al 2016 2 7 model performance evaluation regarding the model evaluation and to assist the best adjustment of the parameters used in the crop several statistical indices were used according to the methodology adopted by paredes and torres 2016 i the determination coefficient r2 of the ordinary least squares regression and the slope b0 of the regression forced to the origin fto ii indicators of residual estimation errors normalized root mean square error nrmse mean percentage bias pbias and mean absolute error mae all expressed as a percentage these indicators were calculated for each interaction supporting the parameterization by showing the smallest error obtained iii modeling efficiency ef which indicates the quality of the modeling and provides an indication of the relative magnitude of the mean square error compared to the data variance observed all these values were calculated on a ms excel spreadsheet since there are few observations nrmse could not be calculated for the yield forecasts therefore only the gross and the relative differences were used respectively through the following equations 5 gd pi oi 6 rd pi oi oi where gd kg ha 1 is the gross difference and rd is the relative difference oi kg ha 1 represents the observations and pi kg ha 1 the yield forecasts 2 8 evaluation of sowing dates and supplementary irrigation strategy adopted in the region considering the ability of the aquacrop model to forecast cowpea yield and the simulation of soil water content under irrigation the impacts on yield and use of water were evaluated for three sowing dates april 1st 10th and 20th which are used by producers in the region conab 2018 both years of 2013 and 2014 and the series of 12 years 2003 2014 were evaluated in the automatic meteorological station from the municipality of castanhal since farmers aim to achieve high yields of cowpea and cost reduction only two scenarios of automatic programming by the model were evaluated for the three dates 1 irrigated i up to field capacity aiming at minimizing economic and production losses it is noteworthy that an irrigation threshold was used for acceptable depletion in cowpea corresponding to 60 of raw at this point the automatic irrigation of the model was triggered to restore θfc 2 non irrigated ni in order to evaluate the stress caused by lack of water on yield representing the way that cowpea is currently produced in the region the kolmogorov smirnov normality test was applied assistat software version 7 7 to verify if the dependent variable data estimated yield followed a normal distribution at the significance level of 5 silva and azevedo 2016 the estimated yields in all years did not present a normal distribution thus the non parametric kruskal wallis test was applied at the p 0 05 level to demonstrate that the supplementary irrigation strategy achieved high yields in the region all simulations were also evaluated in terms of relative yield decrease ryd paredes and torres 2016 calculated by 7 ryd y m y a y m 100 where ym kg ha 1 is the potential yield and ya kg ha 1 is the actual observed or estimated yield the water productivity indicators pereira et al 2015 paredes and torres 2016 were also used to analyze the simulations irrigation water productivity wpirrig kg m 3 8 wp irrig y a iwu where iwu mm is the water used in irrigation it was based on the ratio of the applied or estimated net water depth to the beneficial water use fraction bwuf dimensionless which is the fraction of irrigation applied to the soil water storage in the root zone it was obtained as a function of the seasonal distribution efficiency 0 9 of the system measured from the water captured along the crop root zone pereira et al 2015 crop water productivity wpet kg m 3 9 wp et y a et c act where etc act mm is the actual crop evapotranspiration estimated by the model farm water productivity wp kg m 3 10 wp y a

table is very deep in the experimental site cr was null pe was obtained by subtracting the water lost by surface runoff ro mm which was estimated by aquacrop through the prp δsw was calculated by subtracting the final soil water swend from the initial soil water swini values both computed in the field and compared with those values estimated by the model after analyzing the sowing dates adopted by producers in the region the water balance simulated by the model was demonstrated for the scenarios and years studied in addition the net irrigation requirements nir mm for the three sowing dates were calculated considering the meteorological data series 12 years these nir values were obtained from the simulations of the scenarios used in the study at the level of probability of occurrence during the simulations therefore nir series were generated for all dates analyzed paredes and torres 2016 3 results 3 1 model parameterization the parameters such as cgc cdg α and etc that influence the simulation of cc by the model were evaluated by different indicators of adjustment quality threshold values 80 adjustment which are shown in figs 1 and 2 for the comparison of observed cc values at the different treatments adopted and during the model calibration 2013 and validation 2014 respectively in the year of calibration fig 1 the parameter values adopted for the simulation of the cc presented low estimative errors nrmse 4 75 and high ef 0 97 in all treatments these results were due to the high correlation r2 0 98 between the observed and simulated values in addition they showed small underestimation trends in the simulation of cc b0 0 93 and 2 69 pbias 0 13 in most treatments t1 t2 and t4 it contributed to a low mae mae 5 25 in all treatments during the validation year fig 2 there was a tendency to underestimate the cc b0 0 98 and 1 13 pbias 3 17 in t2 t3 and t4 however the estimation errors were low and acceptable nrmse 6 33 and ef was high ef 0 97 for all treatments figs 1 and 2 these results indicate a good parameterization obtained for cc the simulation of irrigation by the model can be assessed through the dynamics of soil water content swc figs 3 and 4 show this dynamics simulated by the model in relation to the dynamics observed in the field the adjustment quality indicators show a slight tendency to underestimate the swc in the calibration year with b0 0 73 and low values of pbias 1 03 pbias 1 96 for all treatments moreover estimation errors are low and acceptable nrsme 10 73 and mae 8 91 since they did not affect the ef of the model which was higher than 0 77 for all treatments fig 3 during the validation the results were also satisfactory for the simulation of swc the adjustment quality indicators showed a small tendency of underestimation with values of b0 close to 0 92 and values of pbias ranging from 2 32 to 5 16 for all treatments overall the errors are acceptable 6 65 nrmse 8 12 and 4 17 mae 7 66 for these treatments in summary these error values did not influence the model efficiency in the simulation of swc during the validation step since the ef values were higher than 0 70 t1 fig 4 these results demonstrate that the model can support irrigation strategies in the study area since the observed swc variation was well simulated by the model satisfactory results were achieved during model calibration and validation table 5 shows all the parameter values obtained and used for cc crop water use and yield fractional thresholds of soil water depletion and soil water balance the approaches used to obtain these parameter values also include field observations the parameterization procedure and the default values were from the study by raes et al 2012 the best simulation by model in the initial cowpea phase was due to the use of the same amount of water over this phase which was also found by pereira et al 2015 in the reproductive phase in which there was differentiation in the treatments there were low underestimation values due to the treatments adopted but they did not affect the model performance it is due to the short last stage of cowpea which facilitates the parameterization cc and consequently the simulation of swc ta and es as found by paredes and torres 2016 the second phase lasts until ccx in this study the value of 93 was used is reached at the level in which the model adopts an exponential function using the same cgc and finally the third phase refers to the decline in cc after the beginning of senescence and uses a canopy decrease coefficient cdc gdd 1 the cgc and cdc parameters 0 97 and 0 53 gdd 1 respectively were adjusted and used for both years to simulate cc 3 2 biomass and yield simulations biomass b and grain yield y of cowpea both simulated by the model were used to validate the predictions in comparison to the observed values since cc was well simulated by the aquacrop model figs 1 and 2 the simulation and accuracy for both b fig 5 and y table 6 were also satisfactory in general biomass simulations along the two harvests used for calibration 2013 and validation 2014 showed an underestimation trend the regression coefficient b0 ranged between 0 93 and 1 16 with negative biases pbias ranging from 3 91 to 19 13 these trends did not affect the model performance since it had high efficiency ef in the simulation of b for both crops which resulted in values higher than 0 88 additionally estimation errors were acceptable 15 81 nrmse 21 82 and 18 20 mae 23 71 for these predictions due to the high ef of the model in biomass simulation fig 5 this underestimation was found over the early cowpea stages it was particularly related to the underestimation of the cc figs 1 and 2 curve at these stages a similar pattern was found in the study by paredes and torres 2016 in general the model also showed a satisfactory efficiency ef in the simulation of cowpea yield both in calibration and validation for all treatments adopted during 2013 the efficiency value was 0 95 due to the trend of overestimating the yield for t4 difference of 8 81 to the observed value on the other hand the other treatments showed a small difference between the observed and simulated yields ranging from 2 68 to 1 13 considering the observed mean values t1 and t3 showed a tendency of underestimation in calibration 2 65 and 2 48 of the observed mean values however during validation the model was more efficient ef 0 99 in the simulation of y it is due to the small tendency of overestimation of the simulated values of y which ranged from 0 34 to 5 39 of the observed average yield table 6 3 3 evaluation of sowing dates adopted in the region and supplementary irrigation strategy table 7 shows the supplementary irrigation strategy for 2013 and 2014 and the meteorological series 2003 2014 included in the model considering the three sowing dates april 1st 10th and 20th regarding the results for scenario i irrigated the water values used in irrigation and estimated actual evapotranspiration iwu and etc act increased according to the delay in the sowing date from the beginning to the end of april in the two simulated years 2013 and 2014 and for the series analyzed 2003 2014 it is due to the decrease in precipitation at the end of april which had increased the need for irrigation and the amount of water lost by the crop on the other hand values of total water use twu had decreased in most simulated years 2014 and 2003 2014 with the delay of sowing which may be due to the reduction of precipitation in the region therefore yields are higher on ending sowing dates for 2013 1700 kg ha 1 and for the meteorological series 1598 kg ha 1 with the exception of 2014 higher yield on april 10th ryd ranged from 5 6 to 7 8 in 2013 and from 3 9 to 9 9 in 2014 with average 2003 2014 that increased as a function of the delay in sowing thus when considering scenario i sowing at the beginning of april has a lower chance of ryd and a lower use of iwu both results were confirmed by the wpirrig values which are higher with earlier sowing april 1st therefore under the first scenario values between 1 41 and 4 69 kg m 3 were reached table 7 regarding the ni non irrigated scenario which is predominant in the region ryd had a smaller variation between sowing dates however they were quite high during the experiment performed in 2013 they ranged from 11 5 to 18 on the other hand they ranged from 17 6 to 19 4 in 2014 considering the series of meteorological data they ranged from 9 1 to 16 5 therefore there is a noticeable relation with the distribution of water in the soil when sowing was delayed under the ni scenario there was a greater risk of higher ryd ryd 16 5 for the series from 2003 2014 especially due to the lack of water for the crop during stages with a greater water requirement reproductive phase likewise in scenario i ni showed an increase of etc values with the delay in sowing consequently there was a decrease in the water use efficiency by the crop wpet table 7 considering the results of wp on both scenarios i and ni in 2013 the highest values were obtained for the sowing of april 1st 0 62 and 0 63 kg m 3 respectively however in 2014 the values referring to sowing on april 10th 0 64 and 1 21 kg m 3 were the highest in the study for the meteorological data series 2003 2014 april 20th 0 43 and 0 46 kg m 3 showed the highest values all of them were due to high yields in these days and lower twu values these results show that in a year without water deficit 2013 and 2003 2014 there is a lower variation in water productivity when the scenarios in use and years with a lower precipitation distribution 2014 are considered there is a greater variation in this efficiency table 7 the simulation of water balance by the model for these adopted scenarios i and ni shows that with the delay in sowing a greater amount of water is lost through infiltration infil drain and runoff in both simulated scenarios and years analyzed sowing on april 1st also ensures a better use of water by the crop through transpiration tc and fewer losses of water by evaporation es this result shows that in addition to leading to a higher production gain table 7 this date decreases the losses of water by other balance components table 8 fig 6 shows the probability curves of the net irrigation requirements nir for the three sowing dates resulting from model simulation for the series included they show that nir varied highly from 5 to 104 9 118 and 10 122 mm for april 1st april 10th and the last date of sowing respectively this variability results mainly from the high variation in the effective precipitation between the years in the region which ranged from 180 to 513 117 482 and 137 442 mm when sowing was performed on april 1st 10th and 20th respectively fig 6 therefore farmers who sow at the end of april are more likely to apply irrigation especially in severe summer years 122 mm in general although the first date experiences a greater amount of effective precipitation farmers must apply a small water depth which demonstrates the need for irrigation 4 discussion many authors state that a proper parameterization of the cc curve and the water use parameters are necessary to obtain the soil water balance provided by the model paredes et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 thus the aquacrop model can assist in irrigation strategies and crop yield prediction pereira et al 2015 in this study suitable swc simulation results were obtained for both years calibration and validation it shows that these values are consistent with the values observed in the field which also indicates that the parameterization of the model for cc and soil water content parameters kc tr x coefficient of water stress in soil ks rew e cn had satisfactory adjustments and are adequate when compared to models tested in the simulation of swc the aquacrop model demonstrated a better performance dallacort et al 2010 for example using the cs cropgro model for different conditions and water depths in common bean cultivation found a correlation coefficient r2 ranging from 0 70 to 0 74 in addition these authors found considerable differences between the observed and simulated values which indicates inefficiency in the simulation of water absorption and redistribution into the soil more recently santos et al 2016 using the same model cs cropgro for the iac carioca cultivar in jaboticabal sp also reported low model efficiency in the simulation of swc which was due to low correlation between the values r2 0 55 and high estimation errors rmse 0 037 cm3 cm 3 for the approached years therefore the aquacrop model proved to be useful in estimating swc for local and experimental conditions during parameterization the aquacrop model does not follow the approach suggested by fao56 and uses different thresholds for the impacts of soil water stress on the various physiological processes if the upper limit value proposed by allen et al 1998 pupper 0 45 were taken into account the model would consider cowpea as extremely tolerant to water stress regarding leaf expansion and moderately sensitive to senescence consequently the model performance would not agree with results found by fernandes et al 2015 and farias et al 2017 moreover for the pollination failure pupper in the aquacrop a minimum value of 0 75 is established thus according to several studies the cowpea crop is considered as sensitive to water stress souza et al 2017 in relation to this condition in this study values for these parameters pupper and ks curve forms were adopted by conviction and references table 5 therefore it is noticeable that the parameterization adopted in this study is proper moreover it emphasizes that the aquacrop model demonstrates high efficiency for simulation of cowpea biomass production and yield predictions for all adopted treatments these results are similar to other model applications for cowpea bastos et al 2002 found differences ranging from 2 0 to 9 8 using the cropgro model for the br 14 mulato cowpea cultivar dallacort et al 2011 using the cs cropgro model found a difference of 29 santos et al 2016 also using the cs cropgro model in the simulation of common bean yield found a difference ranging from 16 7 51 6 in the treatments adopted more recently in the study by nunes et al 2019 with the aquacrop model for assessing climate risk and the performance of the model for the simulation of cowpea yield the results showed that the model can be used in the simulation of yields for the region since it was sensitive to the seasonality and proved to be consistent in these predictions although it was not validated in the field in turn the yield results found in this study demonstrate that the use of irrigation during the dry season in the region can be an alternative not only for managing to produce a new crop but also for minimizing the effects of lack of water during the reproductive period of the season as found by farias et al 2017 nunes et al 2019 the differences between the adopted scenarios are relevant table 7 as well as the sowing dates which indicate that later sowing should be avoided april 20th fortunately sowing has been practiced by most farmers conab 2018 in addition adopting supplementary irrigation especially over the reproductive period of cowpea has been suggested in other studies such as farias et al 2017 souza et al 2017 since the model was also applied for the series of climatic conditions of the region 2003 2014 the duration of cowpea cycle for sowing until april 1st ranged from 67 to 69 days on the other hand for the sowing on april 10th the cycle ranged from 65 to 66 days and had small durations from 64 to 65 days which corresponded to sowing until april 20th such differences are due to the fact that the crop cycle develops in advance under high temperatures paredes and torres 2016 in the study carried out by farias et al 2017 it was found that the cowpea cycle is anticipated when it is sown in the months with warmer temperatures and yield may decrease due to the lack of water during the reproductive phase of the crop this response is similar to the results found in the simulation performed by the model in the present study late sowing in castanhal can decrease not only the period available for harvest but also final yield this result may increase the demand for supplementary irrigation especially during the reproductive phase which could increase final yield for farmers and lead to optimal crop water use the simulation of the water balance by the model showed that it can provide further insights into the strategies adopted by farmers in the region it is important to mention that these results are simulated and the users must be careful since there was no validation with a field experiment finally the evaluated scenarios demonstrate that when farmers perform late sowing they are more likely to use supplementary irrigation reaching up to 122 mm it reinforces that the study of the climatic variability of the region has a great importance when high yields and better water use are intended therefore the aquacrop model can assist in this understanding and management 5 conclusions this study presents an approach to the parameterization of the aquacrop model for the cowpea crop focusing on water use biomass yield under different irrigations during the reproductive phase and the impact of sowing dates normally used the ability of the model to simulate canopy cover cc soil water content biomass and ﬁnal grain yield was assessed using soil water content and crop observations during two years calibration and validation despite the limited dataset used parameterization was successfully tested resulting in very low deviations in biomass and yield prediction the satisfactory predictions for biomass and yield obtained in the present study refers to i the data quality obtained in the field and the crop parameters for studies on parameterization of crop models such efficiency can be achieved when using at least two year series ii the suitable parameterization of the cc curve and iii optimal parameterization relative to soil water content simulation the results of this study provide a noteworthy basis for further research including the need to reﬁne the parameterization considering a broader range of environments and varieties of cowpea as well as the use of climatic series with more years of data contributing with the establishment of the most appropriate sowing period using the model the parameterized model was used for evaluating supplementary irrigation for cowpea regarding yield and water productivity the results indicate that the use of a threshold that corresponded to 60 of readily available water raw aiming at reducing irrigation costs and minimizing yield losses even in a rainy season decreased the relative yield loss ryd by up to 10 consequently it resulted in increased cowpea production average increase of 65 kg ha 1 in production the best sowing date corresponds to early april while late sowing should be avoided in addition after assessing the sowing dates for the experiment years supplementary irrigation should be adopted to ensure high yields however the proper application requires support to farmers decisions on irrigation values

10064,water shortage restricts the development of jujube plantation in southern xinjiang and the application of water saving irrigation technology is the key to solve this problem this study investigated the response of irrigation water use efficiency to various irrigation technologies vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation and jujube yield and quality and to choose a suitable irrigation method for hui jujube trees planting the field experiment was conducted over 2 years vertical tube irrigation was implemented with three levels of water pressure by using water pressure heads 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 m additionally surface drip irrigation was used as a control and four treatments were used in total the results indicated that vertical tube irrigation helped save approximately 37 70 of water and its water use efficiency was 1 4 4 3 times that of surface drip irrigation compared with hui jujube trees watered by drip irrigation those watered by vertical tube irrigation had slightly higher yield and decreased fruit cracking 25 83 moreover the sugar acid ratio increased significantly p 0 05 besides the continuous water supply used in vertical tube irrigation allowed the maintenance of relatively stable swc in the main root layer 20 60 cm can provided a good soil water air environment for jujube growth vertical tube irrigation saved water primarily because it sends water directly to the main root layer through the emitters buried in the soil reducing the evaporation of water in the upper soil layer the irrigation water amount of vertical tube irrigation was proportional to the water supply pressure head water use efficiency was the highest under the lowest water supply pressure water pressure head 0 8 m the present findings provide a scientific basis for the application of vertical tube irrigation in arid areas keywords vertical tube irrigation jujube yield irrigation water use efficiency soil water content 1 introduction china is the world s largest producer of the jujube with yields constituting 98 of the world total reaching 8 78 million tons in 2018 wang et al 2020 the largest land area devoted to jujube trees in china is in southern xinjiang where the jujube has become a major local commercial crops bai et al 2020 yu et al 2020 this region has a temperate continental climate with less rainfall and high evaporation rates the utilization efficiency of natural precipitation during the production of jujube trees is very low and is predominantly dependent on irrigation irrigation techniques and management methods affect the yield and water use of jujube trees compared with surface irrigation drip irrigation which can be divided into surface drip irrigation and underground drip irrigation according to the method by which the dripper is buried helps save more water martínez and reca 2014 studies have proved that both surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation can increase crop yields yazar and sesveren 2017 aydinsakir et al 2021 subsurface drip irrigation can reduce the amount of water produced by evaporation phogat et al 2016 roy et al 2019 and has a higher water use efficiency than surface drip irrigation martínez gimeno et al 2018a 2018b çetin and kara 2019 research on the water requirement rules of crops in different growth stages of crops has demonstrated that the amount of irrigation water affects both water use efficiency and crop yield for example when the grapes were regulated deficit irrigation and the amount of irrigation is appropriately reduced the quality of the fruit is higher yang et al 2020 nevertheless the fruit swelling period in the jujube reduces the amount of irrigation water and reduces crop transpiration resulting in reduced yield feng et al 2017 in an experiment of surge root irrigated of jujube trees dai et al 2019 found that water use efficiency and yield depend mainly on two factors irrigation level and nitrogen content in recent years water efficient surface and subsurface drip irrigation technologies have been applied to forest and fruit planting worldwide robles et al 2016 martínez gimeno et al 2018a 2018b hancioglu et al 2019 however these methods are unsuitable to the special climate of xinjiang when such technologies are implemented the same forests in different regions can behave differently and their normal growth is disrupted in addition the clogging problem of subsurface drip irrigation the implementation of this method over large areas is challenging at this stage most jujube producers use a combination of flood irrigation and surface drip irrigation surface drip irrigation is mainly implemented during the cell expansion period when the fruit is sensitive to water however its water saving effect is not obvious and its water use efficiency is low crop growth an water use efficiency are shaped by the soil water air environment su and midmore 2005 du et al 2020 subsurface drip irrigation results in higher swc reducing soil air permeability this negatively affects microorganism in the roots and soil and in turn may result in lower crop yield pendergast et al 2019 under aerated irrigation chen et al 2018 an effective solution to this problem water and oxygen are transported to the root zone creating a favorable water and air environment for crop growth li et al 2016 this environment is associated with greater crop yield and water use efficiency du et al 2019 girsang et al 2020 however the uneven water air transmission in the process leads to the loss of a large number of air bubbles thus the method by which air should be transported to the root zone as microbubbles is the key to deciding whether this method can be employed on a large scale bhattarai et al 2015 after the end of drip irrigation the soil water was rapidly reduced under soil evaporation and plant transpiration çolak et al 2017 thereby causing water stress that was unfavorable to crop growth developing new irrigation technologies for jujube trees that can provide a good water and air environment for the main root layer as well as improve water use efficiency and crop yield and quality of is challenging vertical tube irrigation is a new type of subsurface irrigation laboratory infiltration tests have indicated that continuous irrigation is possible trough automatic adjustment of emitter discharge according to the swc dan et al 2016a 2016b in the present study vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation were applied to jujube trees and their water efficiencies and impacts on crop yield and quality were compared in addition the water saving and production increasing mechanisms of vertical tube irrigation were examined the findings provide insights into the application of vertical tube irrigation in arid areas and promote the sustainable development of xinjiang s fruit industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was

minimum air temperatures and rainfall amounts in april to october of 2018 and 2019 temperatures were the highest in july over these 2 years corresponding to an average of 25 54 c and 27 49 c respectively total rainfall over the same period was 71 5 mm and 93 0 mm respectively the maximum monthly rainfall in june 2018 and august 2019 were 36 mm and 39 mm respectively soil samples from the first meter of soil were taken at 10 cm intervals the soil samples were assessed using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern panalytical malvern uk according to the classification criteria of the united states department of agriculture silty loam characterized the soil between 0 and 50 cm and sandy loam characterized between 51 and 100 cm air drying was used to measured

experimental design and crop management the research objects were 7 years old as of 2018 hui jujube yu et al 2020 trees approximately 3 5 m in height row and tree spacing was 3 0 m most of the jujube roots were concentrated in the upper layer approximately 0 50 cm dai et al 2019 hui jujube physiological and growth characteristics were observed and classified in five stages during the growing season i leaf emergence period early april mid may ii blossom and young fruit period late may mid june iii fruit swelling period mid june late july iv fruit maturation period early august late september v deciduous period early october late october irrigation water comes from the tarim river which is the water salinity is 2 01 3 40 g l 1 and ph is 7 4 8 0 between june july 2018 and 2019 between march and april of both experimental years spring irrigation was performed to wash away some of the salt in the soil in accordance with local agronomic practices after salt washing the average soil salinity in the 0 100 cm soil layer was 2 65 g kg 1 2018 and 3 15 g kg 1 2019 respectively standard agronomic measures such as fertilization trimming insecticide spraying and weed control were uniform for all trees in march of both years the chemical fertilizer co nh2 2 was applied with each tree 300 g tree 1 top dressing with k2hpo4 3h2o and nh4h2po4 was applied twice over each growing season 150 200 g tree 1 to explore the influence of irrigation technologies on the yield and quality of jujube trees and vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation a commonly used method for planting jujube trees in xinjiang were selected for the experiment to irrigate hui jujube trees fig 3 presents details of the vertical tube irrigation methods used the emitters in the vertical tube irrigation systems were composed of polyvinyl chloride and the inner diameter of the outlets was 1 6 cm fig 3 each tree was irrigated using four emitters placed 30 cm away their outlets were buried 40 cm below the soil surface the water supply heads which were between the water outlet of the vertical tube and the air inlet of the water tank were 0 8 1 0 1 2 m respectively and designated vi0 8 vi1 0 and vi1 2 accordingly under surface drip irrigation designated di the lateral pipe was 30 cm away from the tree rows the drip emitters were spaced at 20 cm intervals and had a discharge rate of 4 0 l h 1 in this experiment each jujube tree was applied as an independent research plot nine and three trees were selected to undergo vertical tube irrigation vi0 8 vi1 0 vi1 2 and surface drip irrigation di respectively each of the four treatments was repeated three times vertical tube irrigation was continuous implemented during early june the late in blossom and young fruit period to mid july the middle to late in fruit swelling period in 2018 this period was between june 13 and july 20 a total of 36 days water was shut off on june 17 18 and 23 and july 18 in 2019 this period spanned 34 days from june 13 to july 16 surface drip irrigation was implemented over 16 h three times a year in 2018 the dates were june 13 27 and july15 respectively in 2019 they were june 5 july 5 and 18 respectively 2 3 measurement and calculation data water conservation is the key to the sustainable development of agriculture in arid regions and irrigation technology directly affects the effect of irrigation for this reason the irrigation amount swc hui jujube yield and quality were measured to compare the effects of different irrigation technologies the specific measurement methods are as follows 2 3 1 irrigation amount a cuboid tank inner dimensions 29 6 cm 24 6 cm 35 0 cm was used to supply water for vertical tube irrigation the daily irrigation amount mm was calculated according to the difference in water level under surface drip irrigation water meters were installed on the lateral to record the irrigation amount i vi and i di denote the total irrigation amount over the growing season under vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation they were summed from the irrigation amount over each day or at each irrigation respectively 2 3 2 jujube yield and quality after the maturation stage october 2 on both years five hui jujube fruits were picked from the eastern southern western and northern aspects of each tree soluble reducing content was measured using ir240 hold refraction instrument ir240 insmark shanghai china and soluble reducing sugar content was measured using the anthrone method 2008 the acid sugar ratio solomakhin and blanke 2010 an indicator of taste and quality was calculated from the ratio of organic acid content determined through the titration method to soluble reducing content vitamin c vc content was measured using the 2 6 dichloroindophenol sodium salt method cui et al 2008 on the last 2 3 days of october of each year the fruit was harvested and the yield from each tree was calculated through weighing mark as y t ha 1 from each tree ten jujubes were randomly selected and weighed with the averaged weight denoted as y g the total yield i e number of fruits was mark as n the cracked jujube weighed mark as y 1 the fruit cracking rate of jujube cr was calculated using the following equations eq 1 1 cr y 1 y y 1 100 where cr is the fruit cracking rate y is the jujube yield t ha 1 and y 1 is the cracked jujube weighed t ha 1 2 3 3 swc volumetric swc in each field plot was measured using a trime t3 tubular time domain reflectometer trime pico iph imko gmbh ettlingen germany the vertical swc profile was measured at 20 cm intervals over the 100 cm soil layer the tdr tube of the reflectometer was installed 30 cm from each tree at a depth of 1 5 m fig 3 2 3 4 climate data climate data in the experimental site specifically solar radiation air temperature humidity and wind speed were recorded every 15 min by using a portable weather station watchdog 2000 spectrum technologies inc illinois america 2 3 5 the irrigation water use efficiency irrigation water use efficiency iwue du et al 2017 was calculated using the following equations eq 2 2 iwue 100 y i where iwue is the irrigation water use efficiency kg m 3 y is the jujube yield t ha 1 and i is the irrigation amount mm 2 4 data analysis the data were analyzed by variance performed with the spss statistical software version 24 0 spss the significance of the treatment effect was set at p 0 05 and was determined using the f test data for 2018 and 2019 were analyzed separately 3 results 3 1 irrigation water amount 3 1 1 comparison of the total irrigation water amount between the two irrigation techniques annual irrigation water amounts over study period and under different irrigation techniques are shown in table 2 in 2018 the average irrigation water amount for vertical tube irrigation over the three treatments was 183 42 3 11 mm 197 56 86 06 mm and 309 14 55 19 mm respectively the irrigation amount per tree under surface drip irrigation of 496 32 27 69 mm was 2 30 2 71 times that under vertical tube irrigation overall irrigation amounts across all treatments were significantly lower in 2019 than in 2018 in 2019 the irrigation water amount for vertical tube irrigation over the three treatments was 150 28 34 49 mm 198 31 25 20 mm 192 72 29 15 mm respectively the corresponding amounts per tree under surface drip irrigation of 502 26 6 46 mm was 2 53 3 34 times that under vertical tube irrigation the irrigation water amount differed significantly p 0 05 the irrigation water amount in vertical tube irrigation was higher under higher water supply pressure over the experiment period it exhibited a gradual reduction the irrigation water amount under surface drip irrigation increased slightly over the same duration but was essentially maintained at approximately 500 mm 3 1 2 irrigation processes fig 4 shows the processes of the two irrigation methods over the study period the single irrigation water amount differed by method in general the surface drip irrigation was performed when the swc was low and stopped once the swc had increased to a sufficient level or even reached the upper limit soil evaporation and tree transpiration lead to gradual reductions in swc before drip irrigation begins in other words drip irrigation is intermittent with a higher irrigation amount over 100 mm and a longer interval between irrigation sessions battam et al 2003 as mentioned the emitters used for vertical tube irrigation can automatically adjust the discharge according to the swc specifically discharge was lower when the swc was high dan et al 2016a thus the trees were continuously irrigated under this method in the initial stage of vertical tube irrigation the swc was low the growth requirements of jujube trees and soil evaporation water consumption meant that the daily irrigation water amount under vertical tube irrigation was relatively high in the initial stage in 2018 it decreased gradually and varied little in the later stages in the initial stage in 2019 of approximately 10 days this amount was higher than that in 2018 and it decreased gradually over the irrigation season at the end the daily irrigation amount was less than that in 2018 these changes stem from the effects of temperature on the tree water consumption montoro et al 2020 the average temperatures over the two irrigation seasons were 24 57 c and 24 35 c and the number of days when the average temperature exceeded 25 c was 15 and 11 days respectively fig 2 a rise in temperature was accompanied with an increase in the water absorption rate of the jujube root system leading to a change in the matric potential of the soil around it and a subsequent increase in the vertical tube emitter discharge 3 2 variations in swc the effects of irrigation on vertical direction soil water distribution in the jujube tree s root systems were analyzed figs 5 and 6 present the results of the analysis of vertical direction water content in different soil layers under vertical tube irrigation from 2018 to 2019 the swc changes were similar over the two experimental years the swc at 0 20 cm increased with the increases in water supply pressure but stayed at a low level approximately 20 25 cm3 cm 3 after approximately 10 days of continuous irrigation the swc in 2019 fig 6e was relatively stable compared to 2018 fig 5a which was mainly due to rainfall during the irrigation period in 2018 which caused slight fluctuations in surface soil water content in the initial stage the swc at 61 100 cm fluctuated slightly but in the later stages it was less than 30 cm3 cm 3 overall the swc was the highest in the soil layer between 21 and 60 cm approximately 30 40 cm3 cm 3 less than the saturated water content 45 cm3 cm 3 because the outlets were buried at a depth of 40 cm and water diffuses from the outlets to the surroundings although the irrigation amount of vertical tube irrigation is relatively small the swc of this soil layer is relatively stable higher irrigation amounts under higher water supply pressure the upward migration of water and increased the surface swc figs 5b c and 6e f conversely when the irrigation water amount was lower the surface swc was also low figs 5a and 6d figs 7 and 8 present the changes in swc of different layers in the first meter of soil under surface drip irrigation from 2018 to 2019 drip irrigation swc were not changes with the experimental years the swc changes periodically with irrigation the swc was low before irrigation increased after the process and then decreased gradually the most substantial changes were observed in the 0 20 cm soil layer specifically approximately 5 days after irrigation the swc decreases from 35 to approximately 20 cm3 cm 3 in the soil layer between 21 and 60 cm the swc increases after irrigation and then dropped by degrees and stayed at approximately 25 cm3 cm 3 between 61 and 100 cm it increased after irrigation and then stayed at 30 cm3 cm 3 in general swc gradually increases with increase in soil depth under the action of gravity water was easily transported to deeper soil layers and was therefore mostly inaccessible to crops song et al 2018 after the surface drip irrigation the water consumption increased of jujube trees over time and the mean swc gradually decreases with time until the next irrigation it gradually decreased from 39 to approximately 20 cm3 cm 3 over 10 days under surface drip irrigation water enters the soil from a point source on the surface forming a wet body centered on the soil below the dripper at the end of irrigation session both the maximum horizontal wetting distance and maximum swc could be determined from the surface the distribution of swc in the soil layers differed by method although the irrigation amount under vertical tube irrigation was low the swc in the main root layer of jujube trees can be maintained within an appropriate range tends to the growth of crops reyes cabrera et al 2016 although the irrigation amount under surface drip irrigation was high moisture on the soil surface evaporated easily feng et al 2017 causing the swc to fluctuate considerably before and after irrigation notably the diffusion of water into the deeper soil layer will reduce the water content of the main root layer which easily causes the main root to lack water and negatively affecting jujube trees growth patel and rajput 2007 3 3 jujube yield quality and iwue jujube tree yields obtained from the diverse treatments in the experimental years are presented in fig 9 in 2018 the jujube yield was the highest and lowest under the vi1 0 and vi1 2 treatments at 23 90 4 80 and 17 47 2 01 t ha 1 respectively the jujube yield was higher in 2019 but again the highest and lowest under the vi1 0 and vi1 2 treatments at 22 33 1 34 and 17 61 4 74 t ha 1 respectively the yield under the vi0 8 treatment essentially remained at 22 t ha 1 over 2 years the yield from surface drip irrigation 10 07 1 36 and 12 85 0 42 t ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively was positively correlated with the year the yield under vertical tube irrigation was significantly higher than that under surface drip irrigation over both years p 0 05 and the yield did not differ considerably by treatment the association between irrigation water amount and yield was not linear notably although vertical tube irrigation consumed less water than surface drip irrigation the yield was not lower under this method this may be because of the inefficient consumption of water under surface drip irrigation for example high surface evaporation solomakhin and blanke 2010 results from the statistical analysis on iwue under difference treatments are presented in fig 10 overall the iwue increased from 2018 to 2019 and the iwue of vertical tube irrigation was higher than that of surface drip irrigation p 0 05 in 2018 the vi1 0 treatment than of the other treatments and the vi0 8 treatment was better in 2019 under vertical tube irrigation increases in water supply pressure did not improve water use efficiency indicating that the main driving force for water consumption was transpiration therefore water supply pressure can be reduced in the practical implementation of vertical tube irrigation to reduce costs both the irrigation amount and method affect the iwue of crops piri and naserin 2020a the results also demonstrate that vertical tube irrigation is more water efficient than surface drip irrigation table 3 presents the results of the statistical analysis on the quality parameters of the jujube trees under different treatments the single fruit weight y was higher in 2018 than in 2019 for all treatments this may be affected by rainfall and climate the single fruit weight was lower under surface drip irrigation than under vertical tube irrigation possibly because the long interval between each irrigation session under surface drip irrigation caused a shortage of water during certain stages in the growth process ling et al 2017 the fruit cracking rate was significantly higher under surface drip irrigation than under vertical tube irrigation p 0 05 this was mainly because the swc before drip irrigation was low fig 5 leading to increase root water uptake during irrigation this high absorbance caused the fruit to grow rapidly in a short time resulting in fruit cracking ozturk et al 2018 under vertical tube irrigation no significant differences in fruit cracking rate were noted between each treatment the fruit cracking rate in 2018 and 2019 were the highest under vi1 0 and vi1 2 treatments respectively and the lowest under the vi0 8 treatment this indicates that fruit cracking rate under vertical tube irrigation would be more substantially reduce under low water supply pressure the content of reducing sugar and vc of the jujube fruit subjected to surface drip irrigation was significantly higher than those of the fruit receiving vertical tune irrigation p 0 05 the organic acid content did not differ significantly by vertical tube irrigation and the interannual changes were random under vertical tube irrigation the acid sugar ratio was significantly higher indicating that the taste of the fruit was significantly superior p 0 05 no significant between treatment differences in acid sugar ratio were noted by vertical tube irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 impact of irrigation technologies on irrigation water amount under surface drip irrigation water passes through the dripper and enters the soil through point source infiltration taghavi et al 1984 at the end of irrigation process the maximum horizontal wetting distance and the maximum soil moisture content both can both be determined from the surface at this time evaporation from the surface soil layer is high resulting in a rapid reduction in its water content the evaporation rate from the layer is then reduced in proportion to the swc martínez and reca 2014 feng et al 2017 in other words the swc from the upper layer is difficult to retain under surface drip irrigation especially in arid xinjiang notably some of the water flows into the deeper soil khorsand et al 2019 inducing large changes in soil moisture over a short duration for the entire cultivated soil layer and cannot be recharged until the next irrigation session as mentioned vertical tube irrigation is a type of continuous subsurface irrigation water is directly irrigated to the main root layer depth 20 60 cm of the crop through the vertical tube emitters to meet the water absorption demand of the main root layer of the jujube tree thereby promoting growth the reduction of evaporation from the surface soil layer is one of the main reasons that vertical tube irrigation saves more water than surface drip irrigation martínez and reca 2014 under surface drip irrigation the discharge of the dripper which is located on the surface soil layer does not change with the swc but is instead affected by the water supply pressure under a certain pressure the flow rate is constant and the irrigation amount depends on the irrigation duration despite the fact that water flow was continuous under vertical tube irrigation it had a significantly approximately 37 70 lower total annual irrigation amount than did surface drip irrigation the emitter discharge depends on the pressure potential the gravitational potential and the soil matric potential dan et al 2016b as confirmed through laboratory experiments when the soil moisture content is higher the discharge is lower and vice versa dan et al 2016b perhaps this is another reason why vertical tube irrigation save water compared to surface drip irrigation 4 2 impact of vertical tube irrigation jujube yield and quality numerous field experiments have shown that the amount of irrigation water directly affects crop yields and quality uçan et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 piri and naserin 2020b according to the statistical survey bai et al 2020 the yield from surface irrigation of the 7 8 years old hui jujube tree was about 8 7 9 2 t ha 1 from 2009 to 2017 however over the present 2 year field experiment the yield from surface vertical tube irrigation was approximately 17 23 t ha 1 although the irrigation water amount under vertical tube irrigation was approximately 20 70 of that under surface drip irrigation the jujube yield was not lower but slightly higher according to extensive studies on various crops water regulated deficit irrigation causes minimal damage to crops improves water use efficiency and does not reduce yield el wahed and ali 2013 zhong et al 2019 ozer et al 2020 this indicates that a higher irrigation amount does not necessarily correspond to higher crop yield as mentioned above small amounts of water were continuously supplied to the jujube trees under vertical tube irrigation over the growing season preventing water stress and maintaining a balanced soil water environment in the root system the efficient use of water for plant growth under this method ensures a stable yield fruit quality was significantly lower under surface drip irrigation than under vertical tube irrigation except for the vc and soluble reducing sugar of jujube fruits the fruit cracking rate is an important indicator for the jujube and cracks over the fruit skin reduce the quality influence consumer preferences and decrease cold storage and shelf life of the fruits schouten et al 2018 li et al 2020 the fruit cracking rate was 1 4 7 0 times higher under surface drip irrigation than under vertical tube irrigation although cracking is influenced by several factors including growth stage ambient temperature structure of cuticle layer osmotic potential fruit size rootstock and cultivar researchers mostly indicated the primary reason of cracking as the pre harvest precipitations yu et al 2014 li et al 2018 ozturk et al 2018 irrigation may be an important reason for fruit cracking in arid areas in the early stage of fruit growth early july the low swc caused the epidermal cells of the fruit to be relatively dense during the surface drip final irrigation season in mid july the swc increased rapidly and the root system absorbed a substantial amount of water this caused the growth rate of the fruit flesh to exceed that of the peel causing the peel to swell and the fruit to crack easily galindo et al 2016 schouten et al 2018 by contrast both swc and fruit growth rate were stable under vertical tube irrigation moreover although the soluble sugar content of the fruit was not higher the organic acid content decreased resulting in a higher acid sugar ratio and higher crop quality overall 4 3 impact of vertical tube irrigation on iwue soil is a complex system that consists of solid liquid and gaseous substances irrigation regulates the water and gas content in the soil a favorable water and air environment improves water use efficiency and is conducive to crop growth ling et al 2017 du et al 2018 water infiltrated into the soil during irrigation promotes gaseous discharge from the soil pores du et al 2019 swc changes periodically with irrigation flow under surface drip irrigation as the swc gradually increases the air in the soil is forced out this low soil air content negatively affects jujube growth girsang et al 2020 with the high continuous evaporation of soil moisture from the upper soil layer the air in the soil gradually increases but the swc in the main root zone continues to decrease causing water stress which is unfavorable to growth zhang et al 2020 under vertical tube irrigation the swc is the highest at the emitter outlets and relatively low in the upper and deep soil layers the maintenance of a suitable level of swc the swc is always lower than the saturated water content in the main root layer 20 60 cm ensures that soil air content is sufficient these conditions are conducive to the maintenance of relatively stable soil water air environment for root and jujube tree growth similar to aerated irrigation vertical tube irrigation solves the problem of hypoxia in the root zone that occurs under conventional irrigation methods it also improves soil air conductivity and ensures effective aerobic respiration in the roots in sum vertical tube irrigation uses water efficiently and provides a good soil environment for jujube trees thereby promoting their growth and ensuring stable yield and quality ma et al 2019 the results presented that vertical tube irrigation improves the jujube yield quality and iwue regarding the vertical tube irrigation emitter the tube diameter is 10 20 mm which is considerably larger than the size of the drip emitter and the structure of the emitter is complex and is prone to blockage cai et al 2019 nevertheless the lower end of the vertical tube emitter is an open water outlet which is not easily blocked investment is also crucial for irrigation systems in the drip irrigation system in order to meet the irrigation requirements the lateral must be replaced every year which obviously brings a lot of labor and material investment the material cost of lateral will be invested 306 every hectare the annual fee of drip irrigation system is 908 84 including the annual material costs 890 60 electricity cost 18 23 and water cost 137 00 however the vertical tube irrigation system had better anti blocking performance so there is no need to replace the vertical tube every year the annual costs of vertical tube irrigation system per hectare is about 800 50 including the annual material costs 794 29 electricity cost 0 73 and water cost 5 48 which is about 80 that of drip irrigation system moreover the working pressure of drip irrigation is generally at a head of 10 m while the vertical tube only needs a head of 0 8 2 0 m to work which greatly reduces energy consumption obviously vertical tube irrigation is more suitable for planting fruit trees however due to the complex terrain conditions and diverse soil types in the area the design of vertical tube irrigation lacks unified regulations and requirements however as a new type of irrigation technology vertical tube irrigation is currently at the stage of experimentation and there is still a lack of large scale planting demonstrations 5 conclusion through 2 years field experiment study on jujube trees taking the typical arid region of xinjiang as the research object the irrigation volume of vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation and their effects on the jujube yield and quality were compared in this research the main conclusions are as follows 1 compared with surface drip irrigation vertical tube irrigation was significantly more water efficient p 0 05 saving 37 70 of water it mainly reduced evaporation from surface soil water 2 under vertical tube irrigation the yield was slightly higher and the fruit cracking rate was significantly lower moreover the organic acid content was reduced and the sugar acid ratio was increased indicating superior taste and quality 3 the analysis of water efficiency and stable production revealed that the water use efficiency was higher under vertical tube irrigation because the continuous subsurface flow reduced the evaporation of the upper soil water during the irrigation process discharge was controlled by the soil matric potential sufficient water was directly supplied to the main root layer of the jujube trees at a depth of 20 60 cm these conditions promoted growth thereby increasing crop yield and quality the present findings indicate that vertical tube irrigation is more suitable for jujube growth than surface drip irrigation especially in arid and semi arid areas consequently this study indicates that vertical tube irrigation is a possible solution to improve irrigation water management by maximizing the water use efficiency without compromising yield production and quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10064,water shortage restricts the development of jujube plantation in southern xinjiang and the application of water saving irrigation technology is the key to solve this problem this study investigated the response of irrigation water use efficiency to various irrigation technologies vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation and jujube yield and quality and to choose a suitable irrigation method for hui jujube trees planting the field experiment was conducted over 2 years vertical tube irrigation was implemented with three levels of water pressure by using water pressure heads 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 m additionally surface drip irrigation was used as a control and four treatments were used in total the results indicated that vertical tube irrigation helped save approximately 37 70 of water and its water use efficiency was 1 4 4 3 times that of surface drip irrigation compared with hui jujube trees watered by drip irrigation those watered by vertical tube irrigation had slightly higher yield and decreased fruit cracking 25 83 moreover the sugar acid ratio increased significantly p 0 05 besides the continuous water supply used in vertical tube irrigation allowed the maintenance of relatively stable swc in the main root layer 20 60 cm can provided a good soil water air environment for jujube growth vertical tube irrigation saved water primarily because it sends water directly to the main root layer through the emitters buried in the soil reducing the evaporation of water in the upper soil layer the irrigation water amount of vertical tube irrigation was proportional to the water supply pressure head water use efficiency was the highest under the lowest water supply pressure water pressure head 0 8 m the present findings provide a scientific basis for the application of vertical tube irrigation in arid areas keywords vertical tube irrigation jujube yield irrigation water use efficiency soil water content 1 introduction china is the world s largest producer of the jujube with yields constituting 98 of the world total reaching 8 78 million tons in 2018 wang et al 2020 the largest land area devoted to jujube trees in china is in southern xinjiang where the jujube has become a major local commercial crops bai et al 2020 yu et al 2020 this region has a temperate continental climate with less rainfall and high evaporation rates the utilization efficiency of natural precipitation during the production of jujube trees is very low and is predominantly dependent on irrigation irrigation techniques and management methods affect the yield and water use of jujube trees compared with surface irrigation drip irrigation which can be divided into surface drip irrigation and underground drip irrigation according to the method by which the dripper is buried helps save more water martínez and reca 2014 studies have proved that both surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation can increase crop yields yazar and sesveren 2017 aydinsakir et al 2021 subsurface drip irrigation can reduce the amount of water produced by evaporation phogat et al 2016 roy et al 2019 and has a higher water use efficiency than surface drip irrigation martínez gimeno et al 2018a 2018b çetin and kara 2019 research on the water requirement rules of crops in different growth stages of crops has demonstrated that the amount of irrigation water affects both water use efficiency and crop yield for example when the grapes were regulated deficit irrigation and the amount of irrigation is appropriately reduced the quality of the fruit is higher yang et al 2020 nevertheless the fruit swelling period in the jujube reduces the amount of irrigation water and reduces crop transpiration resulting in reduced yield feng et al 2017 in an experiment of surge root irrigated of jujube trees dai et al 2019 found that water use efficiency and yield depend mainly on two factors irrigation level and nitrogen content in recent years water efficient surface and subsurface drip irrigation technologies have been applied to forest and fruit planting worldwide robles et al 2016 martínez gimeno et al 2018a 2018b hancioglu et al 2019 however these methods are unsuitable to the special climate of xinjiang when such technologies are implemented the same forests in different regions can behave differently and their normal growth is disrupted in addition the clogging problem of subsurface drip irrigation the implementation of this method over large areas is challenging at this stage most jujube producers use a combination of flood irrigation and surface drip irrigation surface drip irrigation is mainly implemented during the cell expansion period when the fruit is sensitive to water however its water saving effect is not obvious and its water use efficiency is low crop growth an water use efficiency are shaped by the soil water air environment su and midmore 2005 du et al 2020 subsurface drip irrigation results in higher swc reducing soil air permeability this negatively affects microorganism in the roots and soil and in turn may result in lower crop yield pendergast et al 2019 under aerated irrigation chen et al 2018 an effective solution to this problem water and oxygen are transported to the root zone creating a favorable water and air environment for crop growth li et al 2016 this environment is associated with greater crop yield and water use efficiency du et al 2019 girsang et al 2020 however the uneven water air transmission in the process leads to the loss of a large number of air bubbles thus the method by which air should be transported to the root zone as microbubbles is the key to deciding whether this method can be employed on a large scale bhattarai et al 2015 after the end of drip irrigation the soil water was rapidly reduced under soil evaporation and plant transpiration çolak et al 2017 thereby causing water stress that was unfavorable to crop growth developing new irrigation technologies for jujube trees that can provide a good water and air environment for the main root layer as well as improve water use efficiency and crop yield and quality of is challenging vertical tube irrigation is a new type of subsurface irrigation laboratory infiltration tests have indicated that continuous irrigation is possible trough automatic adjustment of emitter discharge according to the swc dan et al 2016a 2016b in the present study vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation were applied to jujube trees and their water efficiencies and impacts on crop yield and quality were compared in addition the water saving and production increasing mechanisms of vertical tube irrigation were examined the findings provide insights into the application of vertical tube irrigation in arid areas and promote the sustainable development of xinjiang s fruit industry 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was

experimental design and crop management the research objects were 7 years old as of 2018 hui jujube yu et al 2020 trees approximately 3 5 m in height row and tree spacing was 3 0 m most of the jujube roots were concentrated in the upper layer approximately 0 50 cm dai et al 2019 hui jujube physiological and growth characteristics were observed and classified in five stages during the growing season i leaf emergence period early april mid may ii blossom and young fruit period late may mid june iii fruit swelling period mid june late july iv fruit maturation period early august late september v deciduous period early october late october irrigation water comes from the tarim river which is the water salinity is 2 01 3 40 g l 1 and ph is 7 4 8 0 between june july 2018 and 2019 between march and april of both experimental years spring irrigation was performed to wash away some of the salt in the soil in accordance with local agronomic practices after salt washing the average soil salinity in the 0 100 cm soil layer was 2 65 g kg 1 2018 and 3 15 g kg 1 2019 respectively standard agronomic measures such as fertilization trimming insecticide spraying and weed control were uniform for all trees in march of both years the chemical fertilizer co nh2 2 was applied with each tree 300 g tree 1 top dressing with k2hpo4 3h2o and nh4h2po4 was applied twice over each growing season 150 200 g tree 1 to explore the influence of irrigation technologies on the yield and quality of jujube trees and vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation a commonly used method for planting jujube trees in xinjiang were selected for the experiment to irrigate hui jujube trees fig 3 presents details of the vertical tube irrigation methods used the emitters in the vertical tube irrigation systems were composed of polyvinyl chloride and the inner diameter of the outlets was 1 6 cm fig 3 each tree was irrigated using four emitters placed 30 cm away their outlets were buried 40 cm below the soil surface the water supply heads which were between the water outlet of the vertical tube and the air inlet of the water tank were 0 8 1 0 1 2 m respectively and designated vi0 8 vi1 0 and vi1 2 accordingly under surface drip irrigation designated di the lateral pipe was 30 cm away from the tree rows the drip emitters were spaced at 20 cm intervals and had a discharge rate of 4 0 l h 1 in this experiment each jujube tree was applied as an independent research plot nine and three trees were selected to undergo vertical tube irrigation vi0 8 vi1 0 vi1 2 and surface drip irrigation di respectively each of the four treatments was repeated three times vertical tube irrigation was continuous implemented during early june the late in blossom and young fruit period to mid july the middle to late in fruit swelling period in 2018 this period was between june 13 and july 20 a total of 36 days water was shut off on june 17 18 and 23 and july 18 in 2019 this period spanned 34 days from june 13 to july 16 surface drip irrigation was implemented over 16 h three times a year in 2018 the dates were june 13 27 and july15 respectively in 2019 they were june 5 july 5 and 18 respectively 2 3 measurement and calculation data water conservation is the key to the sustainable development of agriculture in arid regions and irrigation technology directly affects the effect of irrigation for this reason the irrigation amount swc hui jujube yield and quality were measured to compare the effects of different irrigation technologies the specific measurement methods are as follows 2 3 1 irrigation amount a cuboid tank inner dimensions 29 6 cm 24 6 cm 35 0 cm was used to supply water for vertical tube irrigation the daily irrigation amount mm was calculated according to the difference in water level under surface drip irrigation water meters were installed on the lateral to record the irrigation amount i vi and i di denote the total irrigation amount over the growing season under vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation they were summed from the irrigation amount over each day or at each irrigation respectively 2 3 2 jujube yield and quality after the maturation stage october 2 on both years five hui jujube fruits were picked from the eastern southern western and northern aspects of each tree soluble reducing content was measured using ir240 hold refraction instrument ir240 insmark shanghai china and soluble reducing sugar content was measured using the anthrone method 2008 the acid sugar ratio solomakhin and blanke 2010 an indicator of taste and quality was calculated from the ratio of organic acid content determined through the titration method to soluble reducing content vitamin c vc content was measured using the 2 6 dichloroindophenol sodium salt method cui et al 2008 on the last 2 3 days of october of each year the fruit was harvested and the yield from each tree was calculated through weighing mark as y t ha 1 from each tree ten jujubes were randomly selected and weighed with the averaged weight denoted as y g the total yield i e number of fruits was mark as n the cracked jujube weighed mark as y 1 the fruit cracking rate of jujube cr was calculated using the following equations eq 1 1 cr y 1 y y 1 100 where cr is the fruit cracking rate y is the jujube yield t ha 1 and y 1 is the cracked jujube weighed t ha 1 2 3 3 swc volumetric swc in each field plot was measured using a trime t3 tubular time domain reflectometer trime pico iph imko gmbh ettlingen germany the vertical swc profile was measured at 20 cm intervals over the 100 cm soil layer the tdr tube of the reflectometer was installed 30 cm from each tree at a depth of 1 5 m fig 3 2 3 4 climate data climate data in the experimental site specifically solar radiation air temperature humidity and wind speed were recorded every 15 min by using a portable weather station watchdog 2000 spectrum technologies inc illinois america 2 3 5 the irrigation water use

yield t ha 1 and i is the irrigation amount mm 2 4 data analysis the data were analyzed by variance performed with the spss statistical software version 24 0 spss the significance of the treatment effect was set at p 0 05 and was determined using the f test data for 2018 and 2019 were analyzed separately 3 results 3 1 irrigation water amount 3 1 1 comparison of the total irrigation water amount between the two irrigation techniques annual irrigation water amounts over study period and under different irrigation techniques are shown in table 2 in 2018 the average irrigation water amount for vertical tube irrigation over the three treatments was 183 42 3 11 mm 197 56 86 06 mm and 309 14 55 19 mm respectively the irrigation amount per tree under surface drip irrigation of 496 32 27 69 mm was 2 30 2 71 times that under vertical tube irrigation overall irrigation amounts across all treatments were significantly lower in 2019 than in 2018 in 2019 the irrigation water amount for vertical tube irrigation over the three treatments was 150 28 34 49 mm 198 31 25 20 mm 192 72 29 15 mm respectively the corresponding amounts per tree under surface drip irrigation of 502 26 6 46 mm was 2 53 3 34 times that under vertical tube irrigation the irrigation water amount differed significantly p 0 05 the irrigation water amount in vertical tube irrigation was higher under higher water supply pressure over the experiment period it exhibited a gradual reduction the irrigation water amount under surface drip irrigation increased slightly over the same duration but was essentially maintained at approximately 500 mm 3 1 2 irrigation processes fig 4 shows the processes of the two irrigation methods over the study period the single irrigation water amount differed by method in general the surface drip irrigation was performed when the swc was low and stopped once the swc had increased to a sufficient level or even reached the upper limit soil evaporation and tree transpiration lead to gradual reductions in swc before drip irrigation begins in other words drip irrigation is intermittent with a higher irrigation amount over 100 mm and a longer interval between irrigation sessions battam et al 2003 as mentioned the emitters used for vertical tube irrigation can automatically adjust the discharge according to the swc specifically discharge was lower when the swc was high dan et al 2016a thus the trees were continuously irrigated under this method in the initial stage of vertical tube irrigation the swc was low the growth requirements of jujube trees and soil evaporation water consumption meant that the daily irrigation water amount under vertical tube irrigation was relatively high in the initial stage in 2018 it decreased gradually and varied little in the later stages in the initial stage in 2019 of approximately 10 days this amount was higher than that in 2018 and it decreased gradually over the irrigation season at the end the daily irrigation amount was less than that in 2018 these changes stem from the effects of temperature on the tree water consumption montoro et al 2020 the average temperatures over the two irrigation seasons were 24 57 c and 24 35 c and the number of days when the average temperature exceeded 25 c was 15 and 11 days respectively fig 2 a rise in temperature was accompanied with an increase in the water absorption rate of the jujube root system leading to a change in the matric potential of the soil around it and a subsequent increase in the vertical tube emitter discharge 3 2 variations in swc the effects of irrigation on vertical direction soil water distribution in the jujube tree s root systems were analyzed figs 5 and 6 present the results of the analysis of vertical direction water content in different soil layers under vertical tube irrigation from 2018 to 2019 the swc changes were similar over the two experimental years the swc at 0 20 cm increased with the increases in water supply pressure but stayed at a low level approximately 20 25 cm3 cm 3 after approximately 10 days of continuous irrigation the swc in 2019 fig 6e was relatively stable compared to 2018 fig 5a which was mainly due to rainfall during the irrigation period in 2018 which caused slight fluctuations in surface soil water content in the initial stage the swc at 61 100 cm fluctuated slightly but in the later stages it was less than 30 cm3 cm 3 overall the swc was the highest in the soil layer between 21 and 60 cm approximately 30 40 cm3 cm 3 less than the saturated water content 45 cm3 cm 3 because the outlets were buried at a depth of 40 cm and water diffuses from the outlets to the surroundings although the irrigation amount of vertical tube irrigation is relatively small the swc of this soil layer is relatively stable higher irrigation amounts under higher water supply pressure the upward migration of water and increased the surface swc figs 5b c and 6e f conversely when the irrigation water amount was lower the surface swc was also low figs 5a and 6d figs 7 and 8 present the changes in swc of different layers in the first meter of soil under surface drip irrigation from 2018 to 2019 drip irrigation swc were not changes with the experimental years the swc changes periodically with irrigation the swc was low before irrigation increased after the process and then decreased gradually the most substantial changes were observed in the 0 20 cm soil layer specifically approximately 5 days after irrigation the swc decreases from 35 to approximately 20 cm3 cm 3 in the soil layer between 21 and 60 cm the swc increases after irrigation and then dropped by degrees and stayed at approximately 25 cm3 cm 3 between 61 and 100 cm it increased after irrigation and then stayed at 30 cm3 cm 3 in general swc gradually increases with increase in soil depth under the action of gravity water was easily transported to deeper soil layers and was therefore mostly inaccessible to crops song et al 2018 after the surface drip irrigation the water consumption increased of jujube trees over time and the mean swc gradually decreases with time until the next irrigation it gradually decreased from 39 to approximately 20 cm3 cm 3 over 10 days under surface drip irrigation water enters the soil from a point source on the surface forming a wet body centered on the soil below the dripper at the end of irrigation session both the maximum horizontal wetting distance and maximum swc could be determined from the surface the distribution of swc in the soil layers differed by method although the irrigation amount under vertical tube irrigation was low the swc in the main root layer of jujube trees can be maintained within an appropriate range tends to the growth of crops reyes cabrera et al 2016 although the irrigation amount under surface drip irrigation was high moisture on the soil surface evaporated easily feng et al 2017 causing the swc to fluctuate considerably before and after irrigation notably the diffusion of water into the deeper soil layer will reduce the water content of the main root layer which easily causes the main root to lack water and negatively affecting jujube trees growth patel and rajput 2007 3 3 jujube yield quality and iwue jujube tree yields obtained from the diverse treatments in the experimental years are presented in fig 9 in 2018 the jujube yield was the highest and lowest under the vi1 0 and vi1 2 treatments at 23 90 4 80 and 17 47 2 01 t ha 1 respectively the jujube yield was higher in 2019 but again the highest and lowest under the vi1 0 and vi1 2 treatments at 22 33 1 34 and 17 61 4 74 t ha 1 respectively the yield under the vi0 8 treatment essentially remained at 22 t ha 1 over 2 years the yield from surface drip irrigation 10 07 1 36 and 12 85 0 42 t ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively was positively correlated with the year the yield under vertical tube irrigation was significantly higher than that under surface drip irrigation over both years p 0 05 and the yield did not differ considerably by treatment the association between irrigation water amount and yield was not linear notably although vertical tube irrigation consumed less water than surface drip irrigation the yield was not lower under this method this may be because of the inefficient consumption of water under surface drip irrigation for example high surface evaporation solomakhin and blanke 2010 results from the statistical analysis on iwue under difference treatments are presented in fig 10 overall the iwue increased from 2018 to 2019 and the iwue of vertical tube irrigation was higher than that of surface drip irrigation p 0 05 in 2018 the vi1 0 treatment than of the other treatments and the vi0 8 treatment was better in 2019 under vertical tube irrigation increases in water supply pressure did not improve water use efficiency indicating that the main driving force for water consumption was transpiration therefore water supply pressure can be reduced in the practical implementation of vertical tube irrigation to reduce costs both the irrigation amount and method affect the iwue of crops piri and naserin 2020a the results also demonstrate that vertical tube irrigation is more water efficient than surface drip irrigation table 3 presents the results of the statistical analysis on the quality parameters of the jujube trees under different treatments the single fruit weight y was higher in 2018 than in 2019 for all treatments this may be affected by rainfall and climate the single fruit weight was lower under surface drip irrigation than under vertical tube irrigation possibly because the long interval between each irrigation session under surface drip irrigation caused a shortage of water during certain stages in the growth process ling et al 2017 the fruit cracking rate was significantly higher under surface drip irrigation than under vertical tube irrigation p 0 05 this was mainly because the swc before drip irrigation was low fig 5 leading to increase root water uptake during irrigation this high absorbance caused the fruit to grow rapidly in a short time resulting in fruit cracking ozturk et al 2018 under vertical tube irrigation no significant differences in fruit cracking rate were noted between each treatment the fruit cracking rate in 2018 and 2019 were the highest under vi1 0 and vi1 2 treatments respectively and the lowest under the vi0 8 treatment this indicates that fruit cracking rate under vertical tube irrigation would be more substantially reduce under low water supply pressure the content of reducing sugar and vc of the jujube fruit subjected to surface drip irrigation was significantly higher than those of the fruit receiving vertical tune irrigation p 0 05 the organic acid content did not differ significantly by vertical tube irrigation and the interannual changes were random under vertical tube irrigation the acid sugar ratio was significantly higher indicating that the taste of the fruit was significantly superior p 0 05 no significant between treatment differences in acid sugar ratio were noted by vertical tube irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 impact of irrigation technologies on irrigation water amount under surface drip irrigation water passes through the dripper and enters the soil through point source infiltration taghavi et al 1984 at the end of irrigation process the maximum horizontal wetting distance and the maximum soil moisture content both can both be determined from the surface at this time evaporation from the surface soil layer is high resulting in a rapid reduction in its water content the evaporation rate from the layer is then reduced in proportion to the swc martínez and reca 2014 feng et al 2017 in other words the swc from the upper layer is difficult to retain under surface drip irrigation especially in arid xinjiang notably some of the water flows into the deeper soil khorsand et al 2019 inducing large changes in soil moisture over a short duration for the entire cultivated soil layer and cannot be recharged until the next irrigation session as mentioned vertical tube irrigation is a type of continuous subsurface irrigation water is directly irrigated to the main root layer depth 20 60 cm of the crop through the vertical tube emitters to meet the water absorption demand of the main root layer of the jujube tree thereby promoting growth the reduction of evaporation from the surface soil layer is one of the main reasons that vertical tube irrigation saves more water than surface drip irrigation martínez and reca 2014 under surface drip irrigation the discharge of the dripper which is located on the surface soil layer does not change with the swc but is instead affected by the water supply pressure under a certain pressure the flow rate is constant and the irrigation amount depends on the irrigation duration despite the fact that water flow was continuous under vertical tube irrigation it had a significantly approximately 37 70 lower total annual irrigation amount than did surface drip irrigation the emitter discharge depends on the pressure potential the gravitational potential and the soil matric potential dan et al 2016b as confirmed through laboratory experiments when the soil moisture content is higher the discharge is lower and vice versa dan et al 2016b perhaps this is another reason why vertical tube irrigation save water compared to surface drip irrigation 4 2 impact of vertical tube irrigation jujube yield and quality numerous field experiments have shown that the amount of irrigation water directly affects crop yields and quality uçan et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 piri and naserin 2020b according to the statistical survey bai et al 2020 the yield from surface irrigation of the 7 8 years old hui jujube tree was about 8 7 9 2 t ha 1 from 2009 to 2017 however over the present 2 year field experiment the yield from surface vertical tube irrigation was approximately 17 23 t ha 1 although the irrigation water amount under vertical tube irrigation was approximately 20 70 of that under surface drip irrigation the jujube yield was not lower but slightly higher according to extensive studies on various crops water regulated deficit irrigation causes minimal damage to crops improves water use efficiency and does not reduce yield el wahed and ali 2013 zhong et al 2019 ozer et al 2020 this indicates that a higher irrigation amount does not necessarily correspond to higher crop yield as mentioned above small amounts of water were continuously supplied to the jujube trees under vertical tube irrigation over the growing season preventing water stress and maintaining a balanced soil water environment in the root system the efficient use of water for plant growth under this method ensures a stable yield fruit quality was significantly lower under surface drip irrigation than under vertical tube irrigation except for the vc and soluble reducing sugar of jujube fruits the fruit cracking rate is an important indicator for the jujube and cracks over the fruit skin reduce the quality influence consumer preferences and decrease cold storage and shelf life of the fruits schouten et al 2018 li et al 2020 the fruit cracking rate was 1 4 7 0 times higher under surface drip irrigation than under vertical tube irrigation although cracking is influenced by several factors including growth stage ambient temperature structure of cuticle layer osmotic potential fruit size rootstock and cultivar researchers mostly indicated the primary reason of cracking as the pre harvest precipitations yu et al 2014 li et al 2018 ozturk et al 2018 irrigation may be an important reason for fruit cracking in arid areas in the early stage of fruit growth early july the low swc caused the epidermal cells of the fruit to be relatively dense during the surface drip final irrigation season in mid july the swc increased rapidly and the root system absorbed a substantial amount of water this caused the growth rate of the fruit flesh to exceed that of the peel causing the peel to swell and the fruit to crack easily galindo et al 2016 schouten et al 2018 by contrast both swc and fruit growth rate were stable under vertical tube irrigation moreover although the soluble sugar content of the fruit was not higher the organic acid content decreased resulting in a higher acid sugar ratio and higher crop quality overall 4 3 impact of vertical tube irrigation on iwue soil is a complex system that consists of solid liquid and gaseous substances irrigation regulates the water and gas content in the soil a favorable water and air environment improves water use efficiency and is conducive to crop growth ling et al 2017 du et al 2018 water infiltrated into the soil during irrigation promotes gaseous discharge from the soil pores du et al 2019 swc changes periodically with irrigation flow under surface drip irrigation as the swc gradually increases the air in the soil is forced out this low soil air content negatively affects jujube growth girsang et al 2020 with the high continuous evaporation of soil moisture from the upper soil layer the air in the soil gradually increases but the swc in the main root zone continues to decrease causing water stress which is unfavorable to growth zhang et al 2020 under vertical tube irrigation the swc is the highest at the emitter outlets and relatively low in the upper and deep soil layers the maintenance of a suitable level of swc the swc is always lower than the saturated water content in the main root layer 20 60 cm ensures that soil air content is sufficient these conditions are conducive to the maintenance of relatively stable soil water air environment for root and jujube tree growth similar to aerated irrigation vertical tube irrigation solves the problem of hypoxia in the root zone that occurs under conventional irrigation methods it also improves soil air conductivity and ensures effective aerobic respiration in the roots in sum vertical tube irrigation uses water efficiently and provides a good soil environment for jujube trees thereby promoting their growth and ensuring stable yield and quality ma et al 2019 the results presented that vertical tube irrigation improves the jujube yield quality and iwue regarding the vertical tube irrigation emitter the tube diameter is 10 20 mm which is considerably larger than the size of the drip emitter and the structure of the emitter is complex and is prone to blockage cai et al 2019 nevertheless the lower end of the vertical tube emitter is an open water outlet which is not easily blocked investment is also crucial for irrigation systems in the drip irrigation system in order to meet the irrigation requirements the lateral must be replaced every year which obviously brings a lot of labor and material investment the material cost of lateral will be invested 306 every hectare the annual fee of drip irrigation system is 908 84 including the annual material costs 890 60 electricity cost 18 23 and water cost 137 00 however the vertical tube irrigation system had better anti blocking performance so there is no need to replace the vertical tube every year the annual costs of vertical tube irrigation system per hectare is about 800 50 including the annual material costs 794 29 electricity cost 0 73 and water cost 5 48 which is about 80 that of drip irrigation system moreover the working pressure of drip irrigation is generally at a head of 10 m while the vertical tube only needs a head of 0 8 2 0 m to work which greatly reduces energy consumption obviously vertical tube irrigation is more suitable for planting fruit trees however due to the complex terrain conditions and diverse soil types in the area the design of vertical tube irrigation lacks unified regulations and requirements however as a new type of irrigation technology vertical tube irrigation is currently at the stage of experimentation and there is still a lack of large scale planting demonstrations 5 conclusion through 2 years field experiment study on jujube trees taking the typical arid region of xinjiang as the research object the irrigation volume of vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation and their effects on the jujube yield and quality were compared in this research the main conclusions are as follows 1 compared with surface drip irrigation vertical tube irrigation was significantly more water efficient p 0 05 saving 37 70 of water it mainly reduced evaporation from surface soil water 2 under vertical tube irrigation the yield was slightly higher and the fruit cracking rate was significantly lower moreover the organic acid content was reduced and the sugar acid ratio was increased indicating superior taste and quality 3 the analysis of water efficiency and stable production revealed that the water use efficiency was higher under vertical tube irrigation because the continuous subsurface flow reduced the evaporation of the upper soil water during the irrigation process discharge was controlled by the soil matric potential sufficient water was directly supplied to the main root layer of the jujube trees at a depth of 20 60 cm these conditions promoted growth thereby increasing crop yield and quality the present findings indicate that vertical tube irrigation is more suitable for jujube growth than surface drip irrigation especially in arid and semi arid areas consequently this study indicates that vertical tube irrigation is a possible solution to improve irrigation water management by maximizing the water use efficiency without compromising yield production and quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the projects of the
