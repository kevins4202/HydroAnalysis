19435,when aluminum salts are added to water at around neutral ph a precipitate of al hydroxide is formed very rapidly initially the precipitate is in the form of nano scale primary particles which then aggregate to form flocs the nature of the flocs depends greatly on the solution composition for instance on the presence of humic acid ha which not only increases the size of the primary nanoparticles but also decreases the connection points between them the nanoparticles become smaller with aging both with and without ha as a result of crystallization the aggregated amorphous nanoparticles settled flocs undergo a room temperature structural modification best characterized as a disorder to order transition following elimination of water during this process the apparent al concentration in the supernatant of water increases with age the dissolved al concentration in the supernatant becomes higher with increasing ph and to some extent in the presence of ha however it can be shown that the dissolved al in the supernatant exists in the form of crystalline nano particles or larger clusters which are detached from the settled flocs tem results confirmed that ha only adsorbed on the surface of nano particles during the coagulation process which shows precipitate nanoparticles formed firstly during sweep coagulation before the adsorption of ha or complexed al3 ha however the adsorbed outer layer of ha does not change the crystallization process for the inner part of nano particles this laboratory study may have implications for the release of al from sediments into lake water following addition of coagulants to lower phosphorus concentrations graphical abstract image 1 keywords residual al crystallization flocs ageing nanoparticle 1 introduction many lake

of east china sea is associated with the development of hypoxia and the acidification of subsurface waters cai et al 2011 the magnitude of eutrophication explains the pattern of species loss and levels of genetic and functional distinctiveness among remaining species vonlanthen et al 2012 also algal production during summer is supported by rapidly recycled p within the water column or released from sediments for coastal ecosystems conley et al 2009 in order to decrease eutrophication in some lakes one method is to add metal based coagulants to decrease the phosphate concentration in the lake water phosphate could be removed by adsorption on precipitated hydroxide particles and become incorporated in lake sediments if the sediments are stable the phosphate will not be recycled into the lake water and is hence removed from the phosphorus cycle schelske 2009 addition of iron and aluminum compounds or iron nanoparticles has become an increasingly popular method to regulate phosphorus eutrophication in lakes and reservoirs and wetland systems pizarro et al 1995 sherwood and qualls 2001 auvray et al 2006 egemose et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 aluminum hydroxide and ferric hydroxide are capable of binding orthophosphate ions patrick and khalid 1974 however when elevated amounts of al are added to sediments al accumulation can occur in the lake water under traditional circumstances huser 2012 therefore understanding the formation of aggregates and their variation in the sediment at the bottom of lakes and oceans is of great importance because of their influence on water quality it is well known that when hydrolyzing coagulants are added to water at around neutral ph very rapid hydrolysis and precipitation occur giving hydrolyzed al and fe species and nano scale primary particles which may then aggregate the past decade has seen great progress in nanoparticle self assembly yet the quantitative prediction of the architecture of nanoparticle aggregates and their formation remains a challenge liu et al 2010 in chemically mediated assembly the description of the kinetics of polymerization was complicated by the ligand exchange step devries et al 2007 with ageing some crystallization of nanoparticles occurs after the amorphous flocs or aggregates are formed and the floc diameter distribution narrows poorly ordered x ray amorphous solid phases are transformed over time to relatively well ordered forms such as gibbsite berkowitz et al 2005 the floc size reduction during ageing is not due to erosion of particles from the floc surface but by the shrinkage of the constituent nanoparticles francois 1987 the reactivity of precipitated amorphous aluminum hydroxide actually nanoparticles has been found to steadily decrease with floc age during crystallization process bardossy and white 1979 duffy and vanloon 1994 de vicente et al 2008 with lower phosphate sorption and lower surface area berkowitz et al 2006 dissolved al concentrations increased after alum was added to the two us lakes berkowitz et al 2005 however the real nature of dissolved fe al has not been explored fully according to previous work yu et al 2016a hydroxide flocs are composed of very many nanoparticles and during crystallization their structures may change it has been found that organic matter present in lake waters has great importance in the coagulation sedimentation processes of iron particles and can influence the nature and morphology of submicron colloid aggregates in particular of those containing lake born iron oxyhydroxides pizarro et al 1995 some researchers found that the aluminum reactivity was only slightly influenced by the counteranion cl no3 and so4 2 of the aluminum salt but substantially affected by the presence of phosphate and organic matter duffy and vanloon 1994 or organic acids such as citric acid kwong and huang 1975 in soils organic acids retard or hinder the crystallization of al hydroxide violante and violante 1980 violante and huang 1985 in the present work several methods have been used to study the properties of sediment and supernatant after coagulant addition in the lab and to explore the variation of these properties with age changes in the structure of precipitated particles in the sediment may result in release of al or fe nanoparticles to the supernatant and this can be influenced by solution conditions such as ph and the presence of dissolved organic matter the results will be useful in predicting the changes in sediments in natural waters after hydrolyzing coagulants are added and giving a better understanding of coagulation mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 material and general preparative methods 5 g humic acid sodium salt aldrich cat hi 675 2 was dissolved in deionized di water with ph adjusted to 7 5 and mixed by a magnetic stirrer for 24 h the solution was diluted to 1 l in a measuring flask and was stored in the dark aluminum sulfate hydrate al2 so4 3 18h2o analytical reagent alum and ferric chloride fecl3 were used as coagulants stock alum and fecl3 solutions were prepared at a concentration of 0 1 m as al or fe in di water all reagents were of analytical grade 2 2 preparation of settled flocs the equipment used in the jar test was a beaker capacity 1 2 l with a flocculator zr4 2 zhongrun china which enables mixing speed and duration to be preset coagulants were added to 1 l of di water containing 5 mm nahco3 with ph adjusted to the required final value by addition of 0 1 m hcl in some cases 5 mg l humic acid or 0 02 mm phosphate were added to the solution before coagulant dosing a certain dose of alum or fecl3 0 2 mm calculated as al3 or fe3 was added with a simultaneous increase of stirring speed to 200 rpm 184 s 1 the rapid mix speed of 200 rpm was maintained for 1 min and then reduced to 50 rpm 23 s 1 for 15 min to allow floc growth to occur after 15 min of slow stirring the flocs were settled then the jars were covered by parafilm to decrease the evaporation and make sure no co2 get into the water samples were taken from the supernatant 2 cm below the water surface after settlement for 30 min or after standing for several days zeta potentials of samples were measured with a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk 2 3 analytical methods dissolved al or dissolved fe concentrations after adjusting the sample ph to 2 and 0 45 μm membrane filtration were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes optima 2000dv perkin elmer usa absorbance spectra were acquired using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer u 3010 hitachi high technologies co japan and the absorption values were recorded at 1 nm resolution within the range 200 400 nm but only the readings at 275 nm are reported here for x ray diffraction analysis xrd x pert pro mpd philips netherlands samples of freeze dried settled flocs after different ageing periods 0 30 days were mounted in 1 mm thick sample holders and diffraction patterns were recorded by unresolved cu κα radiation at 40 kv and 40 ma in addition the flocs after freeze drying were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrum 400

were platinum coated by a sputter and observed under scanning electron microscopy sem jsm7401f jedl japan and particle size distribution was derived using smileview software also the samples from the supernatant were taken and drops were transferred were to 200 mesh copper grids covered with thin amorphous carbon films then ethanol was used to rapidly dry the samples which were examined by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100f jeol japan 3 results 3 1 variation of al and fe concentration in supernatants as settled flocs may release fe or al the residual concentrations in the supernatant were measured after different ageing periods and at different ph values the effects of phosphate 0 02 m and humic acid 5 mg l on al and fe release were also determined the results in fig 1 a show that fe concentration in the supernatant remained at a very low level if the flocs were aged for less than about 15 days however residual fe increased significantly after 15 days aging which was independent of the existence of ha and phosphate it is possible that the formed fe aggregates decomposed or that nanoparticles became detached as the mechanism of fe3 is similar to al3 only al3 was discussed later pizarro et al 1995 in contrast al concentration in the supernatant increased with age at ph 7 which suggests that some al could escape from the flocs after sedimentation it seems that al oh 3 nano particles see later started to detach and release to the supernatant after 2 days ageing of the precipitate the dissolved al concentration increased quickly with aging and about one third of the al had been released from the sediment after about 15 days the presence of ha caused a slightly greater increase in the dissolved al concentration implying that al ha complexes or nano particles are more readily released from the sediment which may be related to the strength of the bonds between amorphous primary nano particles the increase concentration of al3 in the water was found by previous research berkowitz et al 2006 there is no effect of 0 02 mm po4 3 on the al release compared to that without phosphate at ph 7 the effect of ph between 6 and 8 on al concentration in the suspension was also explored and the results are shown in fig 1b al concentration increased significantly with age for all ph values between 6 and 8 and the increase was greater at higher ph the presence of humic acid gave higher al concentration for all ph values and this effect was most apparent at ph 8 for the same conditions as in fig 1b the absorbance of the supernatant samples was measured at a wavelength of 275 nm the results are shown in fig 2 the reduction in intensity of a light beam passing through a particle suspension extinction is both due to the light scattered by particles and light absorbed by particles and solutes bohren and huffman 2007 the absorbance at 275 nm increased with time for all ph values and the increase was much greater in the presence of humic acid which strongly suggests that the measured absorbance was mainly due to humic acid either free or adsorbed rather than to light scattering by released particles the results in fig 2 are broadly in line with those in fig 1b although it is not possible to draw conclusions concerning the nature of the al and al humic species in the supernatant 3 2 characterization of settled al oh 3 precipitate the increase of residual al in the supernatant should be from the settled flocs therefore the variation of settled flocs with or without ha for different ageing periods was characterized by sem fig 3 and particle size distribution was derived using smileview software it can be seen that the precipitate is composed of thousands of nano scale primary particles with similar size however the average size of nano particles alum precipitate decreased from 48 nm to 41 nm and 35 nm after 5 days and 15 days respectively while for ha alum nano particles it decreased from 66 nm to 49 nm and 41 nm respectively thus the size of alum ha nano particles is larger than for alum nano particles with same age and the size of nano particles became smaller with ageing for both species of flocs the ageing crystallization process may induce these nano particles to escape from the precipitate flocs which become either soluble al species or free nano particles in the supernatant both of which would contribute to the apparent dissolved al concentration organic acids such as glycine acetic acid and adipic acid can suppress the attachment penn and banfield 1999 causing lower growth ability of aggregates therefore the presence of ha could change the structure of flocs significantly it not only increases the size of primary nano particles comprising a floc but also decreases the connection points between these nano particles fig 3b less connection points between these al ha nano particles would cause the particles to be more easily detached from the flocs causing higher dissolved al in the supernatant 3 3 tga ftir and xrd pattern of settled flocs during the ageing crystallization process for al oh 3 precipitate the size of nanoparticles became smaller fig 3 tga ftir and xrd were used to characterize the crystallization process of precipitate flocs there were xrd peaks at around 40 but only broad profiles existed for fresh flocs fig 4 a indicating the presence of either an amorphous phase small nanocrystals 10 nm or a semicrystalline mixture of both mossaad et al 2011 auer and frenkel 2001 found that precipitation at high supersaturations yields truly amorphous structure rather than nano crystalline forms which means fresh alum precipitate should be amorphous there seems to be little variation with ph from 6 to 8 fig 4a which means ph does not influence the amorphous structure of fresh flocs significantly in contrast it is clearly shown that there were many peaks for alum precipitate flocs after 15 days fig 4b demonstrating that the precipitate undergoes an ageing process involving crystallization perhaps forming microcrystalline gibbsite berkowitz et al 2005 the intensity of peaks increased as the ph increased from 6 to 8 fig 4b showing that increasing ph gives an easier transition from amorphous to crystalline forms the result was very similar to the effect observed with fresh amorphous aluminum hydroxide when the ph was changed from 9 4 to 11 chitrakar et al 2010 with humic acid in the water the xrd results are similar there were small amorphous peaks at all ph values for the fresh flocs fig 4c which were similar to the finding of furrer et al 2002 they also found no evidence for a crystalline phase in organic rich lake waters with high al content by x ray diffraction the peaks intensity increased a little after 15 days fig 4d with crystalline peaks especially at ph 8 therefore the existence of ha may impede the crystallization process of fresh flocs this result seems similar to the finding of dandekar and doherty 2014 who found that the effect of impurity or additive molecules can hinder crystal growth by in situ afm imaging comparing fig 4 with fig 1 it could be speculated that the crystallization process of settled flocs is related to an increase of the dissolved al concentration when there is no ha in the water the crystallization process became greater as ph increased from 6 to 8 and the dissolved al concentration increased at ph 6 only smaller crystalline peaks could be found and a lower concentration of dissolved al however at ph 8 sharp xrd peaks and much higher concentration of dissolved al are found more than 10 times higher than that at ph 6 although greater solubility of al would be expected at higher ph this is not sufficient to explain the higher observed concentration therefore the extent of crystallization is positively related to the increased quantity of al nanoparticles escaped from the settled flocs which appear as dissolved al in the supernatant also although the presence of ha gave a decrease in the xrd peaks there were still some peaks and there was a positive correlation with the dissolved al concentration the formation of soluble al ha complexes may decrease the xrd peak intensity and be partially responsible for the increased al concentration in the supernatant ftir and tga results also confirmed that the humic acid gives negligible change in the alum precipitate particles in the ftir region of oh vibration it is also evident in fig 5 a that a distinct shift of the band associated with the intermolecular hydrogen bonding around 3390 cm 1 to the relatively lower o h stretching wavenumber of 3280 cm 1 snehalatha et al 2008 also the bending mode of the adsorbed water on the surface of flocs can be found at 1640 cm 1 li et al 2010 for both fresh and aged flocs while the adsorption of ha decreases that peak in the ftir spectrum the medium band at 1520 cm 1 is associated with the oh in plane bending mode snehalatha et al 2008 in the region of 1200 1000 cm 1 higher peak intensities 1050 cm 1 are evident upon hydration which reflects the appearance of medium bands zaki et al 2001 the absorption at 530 cm 1 demonstrates that there is coordinated water in fresh flocs zhang et al 2006 in the same way a red shift happens from 530 cm 1 fresh flocs to 465 cm 1 aged flocs which indicates the same trend of dehydration as the above the existence of the peak of 465 cm 1 indicates that the al o alo6 bond has been generated hou et al 2005 feng et al 2008 tang et al 2012 the result further confirmed that crystallization occurs during ageing of settled flocs in order to further confirm that amorphous flocs can transform to nanocrystals thermogravimetric analysis tga was performed on the fresh settled alum precipitate al ha flocs and after 30 days ageing fig 5b the tg dta analysis revealed that fresh sediment lost around 46 wt and 50 wt for al precipitate and al ha flocs respectively while the 30 day aged residual flocs lost around 39 wt and 42 wt al precipitate and al ha flocs respectively the loss of crystal water with age seems to be the main reason for the release of al nano particles dissolved al from settled flocs ageing is accompanied by a progressive change of the local chemical order from amorphous towards the crystalline form raty et al 2015 the curves show that the weight loss of both fresh flocs samples was greater than that of the 30 day aged flocs with most of the weight loss occurring at a temperature of 125 c for the fresh flocs and 150 c for the aged samples the weight loss observed at temperatures 130 150 c was caused mainly by the loss of bound water dehydration at around 330 indicated possible re structuring of nano particles during ageing which showed that there is water loss from the inner nano particles and is similar to the reported dehydroxylation temperatures for well ordered gibbsite near 340 c berkowitz et al 2005 comparing the fresh and aged flocs the weight loss is greater at temperatures of 250 500 c for the aged than for the fresh samples for both al precipitate and al ha flocs therefore two species of aged flocs seem to undergo a similar crystallization process the slow dehydration at higher temperature around 400 c is probably due to the quasicrystalline nature of aged al precipitate or al ha flocs comparing to those with only amorphous structure banfield et al 2000 also reported that crystal growth in natural iron oxyhydroxide is accomplished by eliminating water molecules at interfaces and forming iron oxygen bonds hence crystallization of the nanoparticles in the flocs could decrease their average size and may allow the nanoparticles to escape from their parent flocs 3 4 tem of escaped nanoparticles in supernatant schwertmann et al 1999 showed that recrystallization and transformation were enhanced by particle aggregation from poorly crystalline fe iii oxyhydroxides therefore in order to further confirm the results that the crystalline nature of settled flocs would increase the dissolved al or nanoparticles in the supernatant tem was used to compare fresh and aged settled flocs the use of conventional high resolution transmission electron microscopy tem has directly confirmed nano particles with amorphous structure for fresh flocs binding of particles into chains can be achieved by chemical cross linking or physical attraction of ligands devries et al 2007 diffuse diffraction rings displayed in fig 6 a and b indicated the amorphous nature of the nano aggregates for both al flocs and al ha flocs because of their structural and chemical complexities the description of grain boundaries has lacked a satisfactory conceptual framework and grain boundaries tend to be viewed as disordered regions fig 6a which has also been found by harmer 2011 goethite can form from ferrihydrite largely by relocation of a subset of iron atoms into adjacent face sharing octahedral sites and small displacements of every fourth oxygen plane banfield et al 2000 and amorphous aluminum hydroxide could form similar structures during the crystallization process the structural metastability induces the amorphous to crystalline transition of the nanoparticles under mild conditions epifani et al 2008 as confirmed by fig 4 the weak diffraction effect is simply due to the fact that crystallization occurred for the nano scale primary particles with ageing the nanoparticles were mostly single crystals with a spherical structure as well as some small aggregates which consisted of hundreds of nano scale particles during the crystallization process the nano particles would detach from the flocs as nano particles or small clusters fig 6c and e for samples taken from suspension after 30 days ageing the tem images confirm the crystallization process of nano particles it was found that the crystal lattice spacing of the nanoparticle was about 0 32 nm it is clearly shown that the connection between the nano particles is not oriented attachment fig 6d and the attachment mode is the same as with amorphous fresh nano particles fig 6a the detachment of nanoparticles from flocs depends on the inter particle forces when the attraction between particles in the settled floc is weaker detachment of individual nanoparticles or small clusters would be more likely the detachment of nano particles from settled flocs is probably related to the crystallization process of nanoparticles and particles will escape from the flocs as a result of brownian motion when these nano particles became smaller when ha was coagulated with alum the formed nano particles were larger than those without ha from the lattice fringe image the formed fresh flocs are also amorphous fig 6b after 30 days ageing nano particles clusters from the supernatant were also found by tem however the structure of al ha nano particles was very different from that of the al nanoparticles note that lattice fringes in pure crystalline al oh 3 nanoparticles extend to within 1 2 nm of the surface of the sample without ha fig 6d while the outer layer of the sample with ha is amorphous to electron diffraction to depths of 5 15 nm fig 6g which indicates that ha was adsorbed on the surface of nanoparticles after al oh 3 precipitate formed however the adsorbed ha does not change the crystallization process for the inner nano particles the crystallization process became slow after the adsorption of ha violante and violante 1980 violante and huang 1985 which is probably because the adsorbed ha layer on the nano particles hinders water release 4 discussion when al or fe salts are added to water at around neutral ph very rapid hydrolysis takes place followed by nucleation and precipitation of nano scale primary particles of metal hydroxide the initial size distribution of the nanoparticles is rather broad but becomes narrower because smaller particles grow faster than larger ones puntes et al 2001 zheng et al 2009 the particles are found to be nearly spherical lupulescu and rimer 2014 which is confirmed by fig 6 after precipitation the nanoparticles have an amorphous nature and usually form aggregates flocs consisting of very many primary particles which settle to form a sediment the amorphous particles undergo a slow structural change leading to crystalline forms as seen from xrd and other data when sediments of al precipitates are allowed to stand for several days there is a slow release of al to the supernatant solution which seems to be correlated with crystallization the dissolved al levels in solution are significantly higher than those expected from the solubility of amorphous al oh 3 for example at ph 7 the total soluble al concentration in equilibrium with the amorphous precipitate should be about 1 5 μm whereas from fig 1a the total dissolved al rises to about 60 μm after 15 days the release of al increases with increasing ph fig 1b as does the solubility of amorphous al oh 3 but the higher solubility is not sufficient to account for increasing dissolved al levels the solubility of crystalline forms is much lower than that of amorphous hydroxide precipitate which means that most of the al released from the aged sediments cannot be in true solution it is apparent from tem pictures fig 6 that much of the released al is in the form of aggregated nanoparticles which is consistent with the previous arguments crystallization involves a loss of water from the amorphous precipitate and a reduction in size of the primary nanoparticles fig 3 this could occur by nucleation of crystals in solution but a solid state transformation of the amorphous phase is more likely liu et al 2010 baumgartner et al 2013 this process must result in a change in the binding between aggregated particles probably giving weaker attachment so that particles can be detached from the aggregates the detached particles could either be released from the sediment into the supernatant solution or become re attached after some time the binding between amorphous particles in hydroxide flocs is not only due to colloidal dlvo interactions but also to specific chemical bonds such as hydroxyl bridges yu et al 2016b these bonds can explain the fact that broken hydroxide flocs cannot fully regrow yukselen and gregory 2004 during the slow crystallization of the primary nanoparticles and the loss of water from their surfaces it is highly likely that many of the inter particle bonds would be broken and probably not reform this would allow the detachment of either single nanoparticles or small aggregates from the sediment many of which would escape into the supernatant with increasing ph the surface charge of the nanoparticles becomes more negative and this would reduce the chance of re attachment partly by electrostatic repulsion and also because hydroxyl bridges are less likely to reform this could explain the large increase in released al as the ph is increased from 6 to 8 fig 1b since most of the released al is in the form of small aggregates fig 6 these are probably detached in this form however released single particles might subsequently aggregate the effect of added humic acid is to increase the al release from the sediment fig 1 the increase is quite small at ph 6 and 7 but more significant about 25 at ph 8 after 15 days aging ha adsorbs on the precipitated amorphous nanoparticles and gives an increase in negative surface charge table 1 adsorbed ha does not seem to have a major effect on crystallization which occurs inside the adsorbed ha layer the connection between nanoparticles with ha layer are definitely different with the precipitated amorphous nanoparticles the zeta potential of nanoparticles with ha layer is 8 90 mv 2 36 mv and 16 1 mv at ph 6 7 and 8 while for the one without ha layer they were 10 4 mv 2 4 mv and 2 7 mv as the zeta potential for nanoparticles with ha layer at ph 8 is much far away from 0 mv it would be much easy for nanoparticles to escape from each other by the repulsive force the zeta potential determines the connection chance but it does not determine the strength of the flocs connection efficiency as we have published papers before the chemical bonds on the surface of nanoparticles determined the connection mechanism yu et al 2010 2016b too much oh on the surface of al3 caused the connection points between two nanoparticles decreased therefore van der waals force and hydroxyl bridges on ha al3 complex are the two attractive forces between nanoparticles containing ha layer and electrostatic repulsion 16 1 mv would increase the separation between particles while at ph 6 and ph 7 the gap of zeta potentials between the flocs with without ha layer is smaller which caused lower difference of residual al in the supernatant also ha layer on the nanoparticle surface is ha al3 complex which probably contain less hydroxyl bridges on the edges therefore the adsorption of ha on nanoparticles surface would decrease the hydroxyl bridges but is will not change the crystalline process of nanoparticles as the nanoparticles adsorb the ha al3 complex their size would increase as demonstrated by the ha layer which causes nanoparticles with ha to escape more easily from settled flocs we can conclude that there is a strong correlation between the slow release of al from the settled al oh 3 precipitate and the transition from an amorphous to a crystalline state the released al is mainly in the form of aggregates of nanoparticles rather than in true solution this effect may cause higher than expected levels of dissolved al in lake waters treated with al salts 5 conclusions some interesting results could be found as follow 1 the dissolved al concentration in the supernatant became higher as the age of settled flocs and with increasing ph value as well as fe flocs also the existence of ha would induce the nano particles much easier to escape from the settled flocs 2 the al precipitate is composed of thousands of nano scale primary particles with near similar size the existence of ha would change the structure of flocs significantly not only increase the size of nano scale primary particles but also decrease the connection strength between the nano scale primary particles 3 the al precipitate and al ha flocs undergoes an aging process involving crystallization and the size of nano particles became smaller as aging process for both flocs with and without ha 4 it is confirmed that ha only adsorbed on the surface of nano particles during the coagulation process which shows precipitate nanoparticles formed firstly during sweep coagulation before the adsorption of ha or complexed al3 ha however the adsorbed outer layer of ha does not change the crystallization process for the inner part of nano particles acknowledgements this research was supported by a marie curie international incoming fellowship fp7 people 2012 iif 328867 within the

a better understanding of coagulation mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 material and general preparative methods 5 g humic acid sodium salt aldrich cat hi 675 2 was dissolved in deionized di water with ph adjusted to 7 5 and mixed by a magnetic stirrer for 24 h the solution was diluted to 1 l in a measuring flask and was stored in the dark aluminum sulfate hydrate al2 so4 3 18h2o analytical reagent alum and ferric chloride fecl3 were used as coagulants stock alum and fecl3 solutions were prepared at a concentration of 0 1 m as al or fe in di water all reagents were of analytical grade 2 2 preparation of settled flocs the equipment used in the jar test was a beaker capacity 1 2 l with a flocculator zr4 2 zhongrun china which enables mixing speed and duration to be preset coagulants were added to 1 l of di water containing 5 mm nahco3 with ph adjusted to the required final value by addition of 0 1 m hcl in some cases 5 mg l humic acid or 0 02 mm phosphate were added to the solution before coagulant dosing a certain dose of alum or fecl3 0 2 mm calculated as al3 or fe3 was added with a simultaneous increase of stirring speed to 200 rpm 184 s 1 the rapid mix speed of 200 rpm was maintained for 1 min and then reduced to 50 rpm 23 s 1 for 15 min to allow floc growth to occur after 15 min of slow stirring the flocs were settled then the jars were covered by parafilm to decrease the evaporation and make sure no co2 get into the water samples were taken from the supernatant 2 cm below the water surface after settlement for 30 min or after standing for several days zeta potentials of samples were measured with a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk 2 3 analytical methods dissolved al or dissolved fe concentrations after adjusting the sample ph to 2 and 0 45 μm membrane filtration were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes optima 2000dv perkin elmer usa absorbance spectra were acquired using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer u 3010 hitachi high technologies co japan and the absorption values were recorded at 1 nm resolution within the range 200 400 nm but only the readings at 275 nm are reported

supernatant were taken and drops were transferred were to 200 mesh copper grids covered with thin amorphous carbon films then ethanol was used to rapidly dry the samples which were examined by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100f jeol japan 3 results 3 1 variation of al and fe concentration in supernatants as settled flocs may release fe or al the residual concentrations in the supernatant were measured after different ageing periods and at different ph values the effects of phosphate 0 02 m and humic acid 5 mg l on al and fe release were also determined the results in fig 1 a show that fe concentration in the supernatant remained at a very low level if the flocs were aged for less than about 15 days however residual fe increased significantly after 15 days aging which was independent of the existence of ha and phosphate it is possible that the formed fe aggregates decomposed or that nanoparticles became detached as the mechanism of fe3 is similar to al3 only al3 was discussed later pizarro et al 1995 in contrast al concentration in the supernatant increased with age at ph 7 which suggests that some al could escape from the flocs after sedimentation it seems that al oh 3 nano particles see later started to detach and release to the supernatant after 2 days ageing of the precipitate the dissolved al concentration increased quickly with aging and about one third of the al had been released from the sediment after about 15 days the presence of ha caused a slightly greater increase in the dissolved al concentration implying that al ha complexes or nano particles are more readily released from the sediment which may be related to the strength of the bonds between amorphous primary nano particles the increase concentration of al3 in the water was found by previous research berkowitz et al 2006 there is no effect of 0 02 mm po4 3 on the al release compared to that without phosphate at ph 7 the effect of ph between 6 and 8 on al concentration in the suspension was also explored and the results are shown in fig 1b al concentration increased significantly with age for all ph values between 6 and 8 and the increase was greater at higher ph the presence of humic acid gave higher al concentration for all ph values and this effect was most apparent at ph 8 for the same conditions as in fig 1b the absorbance of the supernatant samples was measured at a wavelength of 275 nm the results are shown in fig 2 the reduction in intensity of a light beam passing through a particle suspension extinction is both due to the light scattered by particles and light absorbed by particles and solutes bohren and huffman 2007 the absorbance at 275 nm increased with time for all ph values and the increase was much greater in the presence of humic acid which strongly suggests that the measured absorbance was mainly due to humic acid either free or adsorbed rather than to light scattering by released particles the results in fig 2 are broadly in line with those in fig 1b although it is not possible to draw conclusions concerning the nature of the al and al humic species in the supernatant 3 2 characterization of settled al oh 3 precipitate the increase of residual al in the supernatant should be from the settled flocs therefore the variation of settled flocs with or without ha for different ageing periods was characterized by sem fig 3 and particle size distribution was derived using smileview software it can be seen that the precipitate is composed of thousands of nano scale primary particles with similar size however the average size of nano particles alum precipitate decreased from 48 nm to 41 nm and 35 nm after 5 days and 15 days respectively while for ha alum nano particles it decreased from 66 nm to 49 nm and 41 nm respectively thus the size of alum ha nano particles is larger than for alum nano particles with same age and the size of nano particles became smaller with ageing for both species of flocs the ageing crystallization process may induce these nano particles to escape from the precipitate flocs which become either soluble al species or free nano particles in the supernatant both of which would contribute to the apparent dissolved al concentration organic acids such as glycine acetic acid and adipic acid can suppress the attachment penn and banfield 1999 causing lower growth ability of aggregates therefore the presence of ha could change the structure of flocs significantly it not only increases the size of primary nano particles comprising a floc but also decreases the connection points between these nano particles fig 3b less connection points between these al ha nano particles would cause the particles to be more easily detached from the flocs causing higher dissolved al in the supernatant 3 3 tga ftir and xrd pattern of settled flocs during the ageing crystallization process for al oh 3 precipitate the size of nanoparticles became smaller fig 3 tga ftir and xrd were used to characterize the crystallization process of precipitate flocs there were xrd peaks at around 40 but only broad profiles existed for fresh flocs fig 4 a indicating the presence of either an amorphous phase small nanocrystals 10 nm or a semicrystalline mixture of both mossaad et al 2011 auer and frenkel 2001 found that precipitation at high supersaturations yields truly amorphous structure rather than nano crystalline forms which means fresh alum precipitate should be amorphous there seems to be little variation with ph from 6 to 8 fig 4a which means ph does not influence the amorphous structure of fresh flocs significantly in contrast it is clearly shown that there were many peaks for alum precipitate flocs after 15 days fig 4b demonstrating that the precipitate undergoes an ageing process involving crystallization perhaps forming microcrystalline gibbsite berkowitz et al 2005 the intensity of peaks increased as the ph increased from 6 to 8 fig 4b showing that increasing ph gives an easier transition from amorphous to crystalline forms the result was very similar to the effect observed with fresh amorphous aluminum hydroxide when the ph was changed from 9 4 to 11 chitrakar et al 2010 with humic acid in the water the xrd results are similar there were small amorphous peaks at all ph values for the fresh flocs fig 4c which were similar to the finding of furrer et al 2002 they also found no evidence for a crystalline phase in organic rich lake waters with high al content by x ray diffraction the peaks intensity increased a little after 15 days fig 4d with crystalline peaks especially at ph 8 therefore the existence of ha may impede the crystallization process of fresh flocs this result seems similar to the finding of dandekar and doherty 2014 who found that the effect of impurity or additive molecules can hinder crystal growth by in situ afm imaging comparing fig 4 with fig 1 it could be speculated that the crystallization process of settled flocs is related to an increase of the dissolved al concentration when there is no ha in the water the crystallization process became greater as ph increased from 6 to 8 and the dissolved al concentration increased at ph 6 only smaller crystalline peaks could be found and a lower concentration of dissolved al however at ph 8 sharp xrd peaks and much higher concentration of dissolved al are found more than 10 times higher than that at ph 6 although greater solubility of al would be expected at higher ph this is not sufficient to explain the higher observed concentration therefore the extent of crystallization is positively related to the increased quantity of al nanoparticles escaped from the settled flocs which appear as dissolved al in the supernatant also although the presence of ha gave a decrease in the xrd peaks there were still some peaks and there was a positive correlation with the dissolved al concentration the formation of soluble al ha complexes may decrease the xrd peak intensity and be partially responsible for the increased al concentration in the supernatant ftir and tga results also confirmed that the humic acid gives negligible change in the alum precipitate particles in the ftir region of oh vibration it is also evident in fig 5 a that a distinct shift of the band associated with the intermolecular hydrogen bonding around 3390 cm 1 to the relatively lower o h stretching wavenumber of 3280 cm 1 snehalatha et al 2008 also the bending mode of the adsorbed water on the surface of flocs can be found at 1640 cm 1 li et al 2010 for both fresh and aged flocs while the adsorption of ha decreases that peak in the ftir spectrum the medium band at 1520 cm 1 is associated with the oh in plane bending mode snehalatha et al 2008 in the region of 1200 1000 cm 1 higher peak intensities 1050 cm 1 are evident upon hydration which reflects the appearance of medium bands zaki et al 2001 the absorption at 530 cm 1 demonstrates that there is coordinated water in fresh flocs zhang et al 2006 in the same way a red shift happens from 530 cm 1 fresh flocs to 465 cm 1 aged flocs which indicates the same trend of dehydration as the above the existence of the peak of 465 cm 1 indicates that the al o alo6 bond has been generated hou et al 2005 feng et al 2008 tang et al 2012 the result further confirmed that crystallization occurs during ageing of settled flocs in order to further confirm that amorphous flocs can transform to nanocrystals thermogravimetric analysis tga was performed on the fresh settled alum precipitate al ha flocs and after 30 days ageing fig 5b the tg dta analysis revealed that fresh sediment lost around 46 wt and 50 wt for al precipitate and al ha flocs respectively while the 30 day aged residual flocs lost around 39 wt and 42 wt al precipitate and al ha flocs respectively the loss of crystal water with age seems to be the main reason for the release of al nano particles dissolved al from settled flocs ageing is accompanied by a progressive change of the local chemical order from amorphous towards the crystalline form raty et al 2015 the curves show that the weight loss of both fresh flocs samples was greater than that of the 30 day aged flocs with most of the weight loss occurring at a temperature of 125 c for the fresh flocs and 150 c for the aged samples the weight loss observed at temperatures 130 150 c was caused mainly by the loss of bound water dehydration at around 330 indicated possible re structuring of nano particles during ageing which showed that there is water loss from the inner nano particles and is similar to the reported dehydroxylation temperatures for well ordered gibbsite near 340 c berkowitz et al 2005 comparing the fresh and aged flocs the weight loss is greater at temperatures of 250 500 c for the aged than for the fresh samples for both al precipitate and al ha flocs therefore two species of aged flocs seem to undergo a similar crystallization process the slow dehydration at higher temperature around 400 c is probably due to the quasicrystalline nature of aged al precipitate or al ha flocs comparing to those with only amorphous structure banfield et al 2000 also reported that crystal growth in natural iron oxyhydroxide is accomplished by eliminating water molecules at interfaces and forming iron oxygen bonds hence crystallization of the nanoparticles in the flocs could decrease their average size and may allow the nanoparticles to escape from their parent flocs 3 4 tem of escaped nanoparticles in supernatant schwertmann et al 1999 showed that recrystallization and transformation were enhanced by particle aggregation from poorly crystalline fe iii oxyhydroxides therefore in order to further confirm the results that the crystalline nature of settled flocs would increase the dissolved al or nanoparticles in the supernatant tem was used to compare fresh and aged settled flocs the use of conventional high resolution transmission electron microscopy tem has directly confirmed nano particles with amorphous structure for fresh flocs binding of particles into chains can be achieved by chemical cross linking or physical attraction of ligands devries et al 2007 diffuse diffraction rings displayed in fig 6 a and b indicated the amorphous nature of the nano aggregates for both al flocs and al ha flocs because of their structural and chemical complexities the description of grain boundaries has lacked a satisfactory conceptual framework and grain boundaries tend to be viewed as disordered regions fig 6a which has also been found by harmer 2011 goethite can form from ferrihydrite largely by relocation of a subset of iron atoms into adjacent face sharing octahedral sites and small displacements of every fourth oxygen plane banfield et al 2000 and amorphous aluminum hydroxide could form similar structures during the crystallization process the structural metastability induces the amorphous to crystalline transition of the nanoparticles under mild conditions epifani et al 2008 as confirmed by fig 4 the weak diffraction effect is simply due to the fact that crystallization occurred for the nano scale primary particles with ageing the nanoparticles were mostly single crystals with a spherical structure as well as some small aggregates which consisted of hundreds of nano scale particles during the crystallization process the nano particles would detach from the flocs as nano particles or small clusters fig 6c and e for samples taken from suspension after 30 days ageing the tem images confirm the crystallization process of nano particles it was found that the crystal lattice spacing of the nanoparticle was about 0 32 nm it is clearly shown that the connection between the nano particles is not oriented attachment fig 6d and the attachment mode is the same as with amorphous fresh nano particles fig 6a the detachment of nanoparticles from flocs depends on the inter particle forces when the attraction between particles in the settled floc is weaker detachment of individual nanoparticles or small clusters would be more likely the detachment of nano particles from settled flocs is probably related to the crystallization process of nanoparticles and particles will escape from the flocs as a result of brownian motion when these nano particles became smaller when ha was coagulated with alum the formed nano particles were larger than those without ha from the lattice fringe image the formed fresh flocs are also amorphous fig 6b after 30 days ageing nano particles clusters from the supernatant were also found by tem however the structure of al ha nano particles was very different from that of the al nanoparticles note that lattice fringes in pure crystalline al oh 3 nanoparticles extend to within 1 2 nm of the surface of the sample without ha fig 6d while the outer layer of the sample with ha is amorphous to electron diffraction to depths of 5 15 nm fig 6g which indicates that ha was adsorbed on the surface of nanoparticles after al oh 3 precipitate formed however the adsorbed ha does not change the crystallization process for the inner nano particles the crystallization process became slow after the adsorption of ha violante and violante 1980 violante and huang 1985 which is probably because the adsorbed ha layer on the nano particles hinders water release 4 discussion when al or fe salts are added to water at around neutral ph very rapid hydrolysis takes place followed by nucleation and precipitation of nano scale primary particles of metal hydroxide the initial size distribution of the nanoparticles is rather broad but becomes narrower because smaller particles grow faster than larger ones puntes et al 2001 zheng et al 2009 the particles are found to be nearly spherical lupulescu and rimer 2014 which is confirmed by fig 6 after precipitation the nanoparticles have an amorphous nature and usually form aggregates flocs consisting of very many primary particles which settle to form a sediment the amorphous particles undergo a slow structural change leading to crystalline forms as seen from xrd and other data when sediments of al precipitates are allowed to stand for several days there is a slow release of al to the supernatant solution which seems to be correlated with crystallization the dissolved al levels in solution are significantly higher than those expected from the solubility of amorphous al oh 3 for example at ph 7 the total soluble al concentration in equilibrium with the amorphous precipitate should be about 1 5 μm whereas from fig 1a the total dissolved al rises to about 60 μm after 15 days the release of al increases with increasing ph fig 1b as does the solubility of amorphous al oh 3 but the higher solubility is not sufficient to account for increasing dissolved al levels the solubility of crystalline forms is much lower than that of amorphous hydroxide precipitate which means that most of the al released from the aged sediments cannot be in true solution it is apparent from tem pictures fig 6 that much of the released al is in the form of aggregated nanoparticles which is consistent with the previous arguments crystallization involves a loss of water from the amorphous precipitate and a reduction in size of the primary nanoparticles fig 3 this could occur by nucleation of crystals in solution but a solid state transformation of the amorphous phase is more likely liu et al 2010 baumgartner et al 2013 this process must result in a change in the binding between aggregated particles probably giving weaker attachment so that particles can be detached from the aggregates the detached particles could either be released from the sediment into the supernatant solution or become re attached after some time the binding between amorphous particles in hydroxide flocs is not only due to colloidal dlvo interactions but also to specific chemical bonds such as hydroxyl bridges yu et al 2016b these bonds can explain the fact that broken hydroxide flocs cannot fully regrow yukselen and gregory 2004 during the slow crystallization of the primary nanoparticles and the loss of water from their surfaces it is highly likely that many of the inter particle bonds would be broken and probably not reform this would allow the detachment of either single nanoparticles or small aggregates from the sediment many of which would escape into the supernatant with increasing ph the surface charge of the nanoparticles becomes more negative and this would reduce the chance of re attachment partly by electrostatic repulsion and also because hydroxyl bridges are less likely to reform this could explain the large increase in released al as the ph is increased from 6 to 8 fig 1b since most of the released al is in the form of small aggregates fig 6 these are probably detached in this form however released single particles might subsequently aggregate the effect of added humic acid is to increase the al release from the sediment fig 1 the increase is quite small at ph 6 and 7 but more significant about 25 at ph 8 after 15 days aging ha adsorbs on the precipitated amorphous nanoparticles and gives an increase in negative surface charge table 1 adsorbed ha does not seem to have a major effect on crystallization which occurs inside the adsorbed ha layer the connection between nanoparticles with ha layer are definitely different with the precipitated amorphous nanoparticles the zeta potential of nanoparticles with ha layer is 8 90 mv 2 36 mv and 16 1 mv at ph 6 7 and 8 while for the one without ha layer they were 10 4 mv 2 4 mv and 2 7 mv as the zeta potential for nanoparticles with ha layer at ph 8 is much far away from 0 mv it would be much easy for nanoparticles to escape from each other by the repulsive force the zeta potential determines the connection chance but it does not determine the strength of the flocs connection efficiency as we have published papers before the chemical bonds on the surface of nanoparticles determined the connection mechanism yu et al 2010 2016b too much oh on the surface of al3 caused the connection points between two nanoparticles decreased therefore van der waals force and hydroxyl bridges on ha al3 complex are the two attractive forces between nanoparticles containing ha layer and electrostatic repulsion 16 1 mv would increase the separation between particles while at ph 6 and ph 7 the gap of zeta potentials between the flocs with without ha layer is smaller which caused lower difference of residual al in the supernatant also ha layer on the nanoparticle surface is ha al3 complex which probably contain less hydroxyl bridges on the edges therefore the adsorption of ha on nanoparticles surface would decrease the hydroxyl bridges but is will not change the crystalline process of nanoparticles as the nanoparticles adsorb the ha al3 complex their size would increase as demonstrated by the ha layer which causes nanoparticles with ha to escape more easily from settled flocs we can conclude that there is a strong correlation between the slow release of al from the settled al oh 3 precipitate and the transition from an amorphous to a crystalline state the released al is mainly in the form of aggregates of nanoparticles rather than in true solution this effect may cause higher than expected levels of dissolved al in lake waters treated with al salts 5 conclusions some interesting results could be found as follow 1 the dissolved al concentration in the supernatant became higher as the age of settled flocs and with increasing ph value as well as fe flocs also the existence of ha would induce the nano particles much easier to escape from the settled flocs 2 the al precipitate is composed of thousands of nano scale primary particles with near similar size the existence of ha would change the structure of flocs significantly not only increase the size of nano scale primary particles but also decrease the connection strength between the nano scale primary particles 3 the al precipitate and al ha flocs undergoes an aging process involving crystallization and the size of nano particles became smaller as aging process for both flocs with and without ha 4 it is confirmed that ha only adsorbed on the surface of nano particles during the coagulation process which shows precipitate nanoparticles formed firstly during sweep coagulation before the adsorption of ha or complexed al3 ha however the adsorbed outer layer of ha does not change the crystallization process for the inner part of nano particles acknowledgements this research was supported by a marie curie international incoming fellowship fp7 people 2012 iif 328867 within the

19436,compared to autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification process the integrated autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification iahd has wider foreground of applications in the condition where the organic carbon nitrate and inorganic sulfur compounds usually co exist in the actual wastewaters as the most well known iahd process the denitrifying sulfide removal dsr could simultaneously convert sulfide nitrate and organic carbon into sulfur dinitrogen gas and carbon dioxide respectively thus systematical metabolic functions and contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers to the iahd dsr performance became an problem demanding to be promptly studied in this work three upflow anaerobic sludge bioreactors uasbs were individually started up in autotrophic a dsr heterotrophic h dsr and mixotrophic conditions m dsr then the operating conditions of each bioreactor were switched to different trophic conditions with low and high sulfide concentrations in the influent 200 and 400 mg l the removal efficiencies of sulfide nitrate and acetate all reached 100 in all three bioreactors throughout the operational stages however the sulfur transformation ratio ranged from 34 5 to 39 9 at the low sulfide concentration and from 76 8 to 86 7 at the high sulfide concentration in the mixotrophic conditions microbial community structure analyzed by the illumina sequencing indicated that thiobacillus which are autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb was the dominant genus 81 3 in the a dsr bioreactor with respect to the mixotrophic conditions at low sulfide concentration in the m dsr bioreactor thiobacillus a sonrb and thauera which are heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb were the dominant genera with percentages of 48 8 and 14 9 respectively when the sulfide concentration in the influent was doubled the percentage of thiobacillus decreased by approximately 9 fold from 48 8 to 5 4 and the total percentage of azoarcus and pseudomonas which are heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb increased by approximately 6 fold from 10 1 to 59 4 therefore the following interactions between functional groups and their functional mechanisms in the dsr process were proposed 1 a sonrb thiobacillus and hnrb thauera worked together to maintain the performance under the low sulfide concentration 2 h sonrb azoarcus and pseudomonas took the place of a sonrb and worked together with hnrb thauera and allidiomarina under the high sulfide concentration and 3 a sonrb such as thiobacillus were possibly the key bacteria and may have contributed to the low sulfur transformation and h sonrb may be responsible for the high sulfur transformation in the dsr process graphical

sulfur transformation 1 introduction the discharge of nitrate containing wastewater into the environment can cause serious problems such as the eutrophication and deterioration of water sources and is hazardous to human health xu et al 2014 thus the development of wastewater treatment techniques for reducing nitrogen containing pollutants in wastewater has attracted considerable attention focht and chang 1975 park and yoo 2009 wang et al 2017 biological denitrification is preferable over the physical chemistry method because it is cost economical and eco friendly autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification systems are typically employed in nitrogen removal heterotrophic denitrification has been widely used in the treatment of domestic sewage in which heterotrophic denitrifiers use organic carbon as an electron donor to reduce nitrate with adequate amounts of organic carbon for example acetate as shown in eq 1 ra et al 2000 1 2no3 1 25ch3coo 2 5co2 n2 0 25h2o 3 25oh rg m ө 955 0kj reaction nevertheless the high carbon demand and large amount of sludge produced hinder the application of heterotrophic denitrification systems in the treatment of industrial wastewaters eg pharmaceutical and tannery wastewaters with low c n molar ratios sun et al 2010 for this reason autotrophic denitrification especially that based on sulfur compounds has been developed and couples the conversion of either sulfide sulfur or thiosulfate to sulfate with the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas under autotrophic conditions eqs 2 4 souza and foresti 2013 2 s2 1 6no3 1 6 h so4 2 0 8 n2

denitrification nitrification integrated sani process which was developed based on the concepts of autotrophic denitrification as in eq 2 and sulfur recycling has potential for application in the treatment of saline sewage from seawater toilets lau et al 2006 wang et al 2009 due to its technical advantages of biological sludge minimization and energy saving sani has become one of the most valuable technologies in recent years the notable advantage of all autotrophic denitrification processes is the reduced production of sludge but an adverse consequence is the increased hydraulic retention time hrt caused by the low growth rate of autotrophic denitrifiers which limits the application of autotrophic denitrification in the treatment of industrial wastewaters with a high organic load vaishali and subrata 2015 furthermore purely heterotrophic or autotrophic conditions rarely exist in natural or artificial bioprocesses the co existence of organic carbon sulfur and nitrogen in the aquatic environment match the actual conditions well thus mixotrophic denitrification which integrates autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification iahd processes has been receiving increasing attention because it can overcome the shortcomings of autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification organic carbon was first introduced in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification to create mixotrophic conditions in a fluidized bed reactor in that experiment sulfate was detected in the effluent as the terminal oxidation product of sulfide and the efficient removal of sulfide 2 3 kgs m 3d 1 acetate 4 6 kgc m 3 d 1 and nitrate 5 kgn m 3 d 1 was observed gommers et al 1988 reyes avila et al 2004 employed a mixotrophic system to conduct denitrification and achieved 100 removal of no3 and acetate and successfully converted s2 to s0 the highlight of that study was the generation of recyclable and harmless terminal products s0 co2 and n2 many scientific terms have been given to the mixotrophic process such as heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification had xu et al 2015a and mixotrophic denitrification desulfurization mdd li et al 2016b chen et al 2008 utilized expanded granular sludge bed egsb bioreactors to simultaneously remove sulfide nitrate and acetate and termed this process denitrifying sulfide removal dsr the possible functional mechanisms of mixotrophic denitrification have also been proposed in the first proposed mechanism the autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers functioned individually without competition xu et al 2015b in the second mechanism the autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers worked together to perform the denitrifying process in the following two steps chen et al 2017 fig 1 1 sulfide was oxidized to s0 coupled with the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by the autotrophic denitrifiers and 2 the accumulated nitrite was subsequently converted to n2 with the electrons provided by organic carbon like acetate by the heterotrophic denitrifiers as a result sulfide nitrate and organic carbon were simultaneously converted to sulfur dinitrogen gas and dioxide carbon in our previous study the egsb bioreactor exhibited good performance with nearly 100 removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate at 0 8 kgs m 3d 1 0 4 kgn m 3d 1 and 0 8 kgc m 3d 1 under mixotrophic conditions when the bioreactor was converted to autotrophic conditions the nitrate removal gradually decreased with increasing load eventually declining to 20 3 at 2 8 kgs m 3d 1 and 1 4 kgn m 3d 1 where the sulfide removal ratio also decreased to approximately 40 1 indicating that the bioreactor could not sustain such a high loading under autotrophic conditions however when acetate was added into the bioreactor during the switch of the autotrophic conditions to mixotrophic conditions at the same sulfur and nitrogen loading the removal efficiencies of both sulfide and nitrate recovered to 99 4 and 98 7 removal of acetate was achieved this phenomenon may demonstrate the important role that heterotrophic denitrifiers play in the dsr process meanwhile some heterotrophic denitrifiers capable of oxidizing sulfide under heterotrophic denitrifying conditions were isolated from the mixotrophic conditions lee et al 2014 chen et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 lee and wong 2014 to the best of our knowledge those strains possess the highest sulfide oxidation rate of 14 3 mg l 1h 1 among the other sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria reported in the literature chen et al 2013 thus this kind of bacteria might be the key functional group that mediates the relationship between autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers to sustain the performance however limited research is available on the function of the heterotrophic denitrifiers including the special heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria that contribute to the removal capability in the dsr process in the present work we started up three upflow anaerobic sludge bioreactors uasb in parallel under three different trophic conditions autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic then each bioreactor was individually switched to different trophic conditions the aims of this work were to i determine the impact of the switch in the trophic conditions on the removal efficiency and elemental sulfur transformation the proportion of generated sulfur of the dsr process ii identify the compositions and dynamics of the microbial community that accompanied the shift in the trophic conditions and iii eventually determine the microbial relationships between the autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers and reveal the key roles that the functional groups play in the stability and performance of dsr bioreactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and influent the seed sludge was collected from the anaerobic sludge thickener at the wenchang municipal wastewater treatment plant harbin china the suspended solids ss and volatile suspended solids vss of the seed sludge after screening through 0 2 mm tyler mesh were determined to be 83 2 g l and 40 7 g l respectively three types of synthetic wastewater were used in this study inorganic wastewater

all contaminants are calculated according to the s n c n and s n c molar ratios respectively 2 2 lab scale uasb bioreactor setup and operation the three identical lab scale uasb bioreactors used in the continuous experiment were made of plexiglas and had an effective volume of 580 ml height of 40 cm and internal diameter of 30 mm the bioreactors were continuously operated for 165 days with hrt of 9 h at room temperature and were equipped with devices for collecting the h2s gas that overflowed from the top of the column initially synthetic wastewaters containing s n c n and s n c were pumped into the bioreactors from the bottom by a peristaltic pump bs100 1a signal china and these bioreactors were termed a utotrophic start up dsr a dsr h eterotrophic start up dsr h dsr and m ixotrophic start up dsr m dsr bioreactors respectively after the start up stage the three bioreactors were operated for another five stages during which the trophic conditions were switched the steady state of each bioreactor was regarded as the point at which the fluctuations in the removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate were within 5 for 5 days the six switch stages for a dsr h dsr and m dsr were as follows a m ratio change m doubled load h a m h m ratio change m doubled load a h m and m m ratio change m doubled load a h m respectively table 1 2 3 chemical and physical analysis during the

analysis sludge samples 36 were collected from the middle and bottom sampling ports of the three uasb bioreactors during the steady state of each stage and immediately stored in a 80 c freezer until use table s1 total genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and purity of the extracted dna were measured with a nanophotometer p class implen germany the 16s rrna gene fragments were amplified through pcr using universal forward barcoding primer 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and reverse

obtained 16s rrna gene sequence was deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under accession number srp124409 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioreactor performance under different trophic conditions in this study apart from stage i the s2 no3 n ac c molar ratio in the mixotrophic conditions was fixed at 5 6 5 to ensure the transformations of s2 to s0 no3 to n2 and ac to co2 the s2 no3 n and ac c no3 n molar ratios were 5 6 and 5 6 in the autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions respectively during the operation of the three bioreactors the trophic conditions were altered to identify the functional bacteria autotrophic and or heterotrophic denitrifiers that might play the key role in dsr and to establish a relationship between the dynamics of the microbial community structure and the efficiency of the bioreactors the specific operation parameters and bioreactor performance in each stage of a dsr h dsr and m dsr are summarized in table 2 during the start up of the three bioreactors in stage i the s n autotrophic conditions c n heterotrophic conditions and s n c mixotrophic conditions molar ratios were maintained at 1 1 1 1 and 1 1 1 respectively unlike in the a dsr bioreactor 22 3 nitrite accumulated no nitrite accumulated in the start up stage of the m dsr bioreactor in stage ii all the bioreactors were converted to mixotrophic conditions with a s2 concentration of 200 mg l and the corresponding sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies were 100 as shown in figs 2 4 the s0 transformation ratio increased from 14 7 to 37 0 after the addition of acetate to the a dsr bioreactor however the toxicity of sulfide did not deteriorate the performance of h dsr instead the sulfide removal efficiency was maintained at 100 and the s0 transformation ratio sharply increased to 60 2 after dosing with 200 mg l sulfide in m dsr bioreactor the increased nitrate feeding s n c molar ratio change form 1 1 1 to 5 6 5 in stage ii led to a small decline of sulfur transformation ratio 34 5 the increasing amount of electron acceptors made the sulfide oxidation hard to stop at elemental sulfur and this has been wildly reported in autotrophic denitrification process dolejs et al 2015 yang et al 2016 however in iahd process the sulfur transformation ratio not only depended on s n molar ratio but also closely related to c n molar ratio huang et al 2015 employed a cstr bioreactor with fixed c n molar ratio of 1 2 to explore the impact of different s n molar ratios range from 5 2 to 5 9 on sulfur transformation ratio in iahd process and obtain the peak value of 84 4 7 7 with s n molar ratio of 5 6 cardoso et al 2006 reported the sulfur transformation ratio was gradually decreased with the increase of s n molar ratio under the fixed c n molar ratio of 1 1 in a uasb bioreactor this means that the insufficient or overloaded amount of acetate and nitrate resulted in the low sulfur transformation ratio and large amount of sulfate generation in iahd process the sulfide load was doubled in stage iii m with a fixed s n c molar ratio of 5 6 5 only 23 4 18 2 and 14 2 of the influent sulfide was oxidized to so4 2 s and s2o3 2 s in a dsr h dsr and m dsr respectively the s0 transformation ratios in a dsr h dsr and m dsr were 76 8 82 2 and 86 7 respectively which were almost twice those of stage ii the three bioreactors were subjected to a fourth switch in the trophic conditions during stage iv almost 80 4 of the influent nitrate was converted to nitrite throughout the operation of the a dsr bioreactor in stage iv h the h dsr and m dsr bioreactors were shifted to autotrophic conditions in stage iv and the performance of these reactors exhibited similar plateaus in these plateaus the effluent so4 2 s and influent sulfide do not match after the mixotrophic operation stages in the h dsr and m dsr bioreactors the color of the sludge changed from dark gray to white picture not shown which agreed with chen et al 2016 we propose that this color originated from the deposition of elemental sulfur on the sludge which then supplied an extra sulfur source that acted as an electron donor during autotrophic denitrification in the bioreactors in stage v the a dsr bioreactor was returned to autotrophic conditions and after a short adaptation period 3 days after the heterotrophic condition the sulfide and nitrate removal ratios reached 100 sulfate was the main oxidation product of sulfide and no nitrite accumulated in the effluent the h dsr and m dsr bioreactors exhibited nearly the same performance during stage v so4 2 s was detected at concentrations as high as 8 mmol l and 8 6 mmol l respectively in the effluents without a s2 feed no sulfide nitrate or acetate was detected in the effluents of the three bioreactors during stage vi m the final s0 transformation ratios for the a dsr h dsr and m dsr bioreactors were all approximately 80 and the corresponding nitrite accumulation ratios were 19 0 14 4 and 15 7 respectively 3 2 diversity and shift in the microbial community composition as shown in fig s1 after filtering the low quality reads approximately 15000 raw reads of the 16s rrna gene were obtained from the 36 sludge samples all the sequences were extracted to conduct otu analysis at 0 97 similarity and the slower gradually rarefaction curves indicating that the recovered sequences represented the diversity of the microbial communities in the 36 samples well the estimated species diversity of a sample was determined by the simpson and shannon diversity estimator table s1 in total 29 bacterial phyla were recovered from the 36 samples fig s2 approximately 98 of the bacterial reads were associated with the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes proteobacteria was the predominant phylum which accounted for 89 1 bacteroidetes and firmicutes accounted for 4 9 and 3 9 respectively on a finer scale 46 genera within the 29 phyla were identified and are shown in fig 5 obviously different microbial structures were observed for the samples from the middle and bottom sampling ports of the a dsr h dsr and m dsr bioreactors subjected to switches in the trophic conditions a dsr bioreactor in start up stage i a the predominant species was thiobacillus which accounted for 71 5 of the bacteria in the middle sample and 90 9 in the bottom sample thiobacillus is a typical autotrophic denitrifier that can oxidize sulfide to s0 sulfate with nitrate as the electron acceptor baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 capua et al 2016 after the addition of acetate during stage ii m the abundance of thiobacillus decreased from 51 4 to 39 4 meanwhile another sulfide oxidizer acrobacter accounted for 7 3 in ra ii b azoarcus had an abundance of 23 6 in the bottom sample which was 7 3 fold higher than that in the middle sample thauera a known heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb etchebehere and tiedje 2005 liu et al 2006 accounted for 4 7 and 6 1 in ra ii m and ra ii b respectively when the sulfide concentration was increased to 400 mg l in stage iii m the bacterial community in the entire bioreactor was dominated by thiobacillus azoarcus pseudomonas thauera and aliidiomarina aliidiomarina has always been isolated in lake and coastal surface seawater with heterotrophic growth on organic carbon huang et al 2012 chiu et al 2014 in stage iii m fig 5 a the middle sample ra iii m had a higher microbial richness than the bottom sample ra iii b the relative abundances of the six predominant genera in ra iii m were in order 6 8 31 7 18 1 6 6 and 9 1 pseudomonas and azoarcus accounted for 75 7 of the total while thauera and allidiomarina accounted for 1 6 and 7 8 in ra iii b respectively the microbial community structure during stage iv h was quite different between the middle and bottom samples interestingly thiobacillus was not completely outcompeted by the heterotrophic denitrifiers during this stage compared to sample ra iii m the abundance of thiobacillus increased to 28 4 in sample ra m iv this increase might be attributed to the accumulation of generated s0 in the a dsr bioreactor which stimulated the oxidation of sulfur to sulfate by thiobacillus as expected ra b iv was occupied by the following heterotrophic denitrifiers thauera 46 9 acinetobacter 12 8 pseudomonas 8 9 and flavobacterium 7 9 in stage v a the autotrophic conditions rejuvenated the thiobacillus population giving abundances of 53 2 and 59 7 in ra v m and ra v b respectively some heterotrophic denitrifiers such as thauera and pseudomonas were still present in the bioreactor the microbial community structures of the bottom samples in stages vi m and iii m which had the same operating conditions were also similar to each other in contrast while azoarcus was dominant in ra iii m thiobacillus 37 1 was the predominant genus in ra vi m h dsr bioreactor the heterotrophic conditions of stage i resulted in the enrichment of azoarcus pseudomonas thauera and simplicispira in rh i m and rh i b fig 5 b where azoarcus 39 4 and thauera 25 3 were predominant in rh i b and pseudomonas 27 6 and azoarcus 35 7 were predominant in rh i m in stage ii m the operation of the h dsr bioreactor was switched to mixotrophic conditions thiobacillus which had a relative abundance of 52 3 in rh ii b might be responsible for the observed sulfide oxidation the introduction of sulfide led to an increase in the richness of the microbial community in rh ii m thiobacillus accounted for 19 7 while other genera such as thauera simplicispira and azoarcus with abundances of 11 9 7 9 and 3 9 respectively were predominant in rh ii m in stage iii m the concentrations of sulfide nitrate and acetate were all doubled to give a fixed molar ratio of 5 6 5 the higher sulfide concentration decreased the abundance of thiobacillus to 10 2 and 2 8 in rh iii m and rh iii b respectively note that azoarcus became the predominant genus accounting for over 55 and aliidiomarina had abundances of 2 1 and 12 7 in rh iii m and rh iii b respectively when the conditions were switched to autotrophic in stage iv a the main change in the microbial community structure of rh iv b was observed between azoarcus 29 7 and thiobacillus 31 2 when the heterotrophic conditions were returned in stage v thauera which had an abundance of 48 1 in rh v b conducted the heterotrophic denitrification process whereas sulfurimonas and thiobacillus 59 2 in total became the dominant genera instead of the heterotrophic denitrifiers in rh v m the high abundance of autotrophic denitrifiers was believed to be responsible for the sulfate observed in the effluent of the h dsr bioreactor and the oxidation of s0 to sulfate likely occurred in the middle of the bioreactor column in the last stage sulfide was added to the influent and the h dsr bioreactor was operated under parameters identical to those of stage iii the characteristics of the microbial community structure in rh vi b were completely different from those in rh v b psedomonas and azoarcus substituted for thauera as the dominant genera accounting for 31 4 and 47 0 of the total bacterial community respectively however no obvious difference was observed between the microbial community structures of rh vi m and rh v m as thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were the dominant genera in both samples m dsr bioreactor the m dsr bioreactor was started up in mixotrophic conditions with a s2 concentration of 200 mg l and a s n c molar ratio of 1 1 1 the predominant genera in rm i m and rm i b were thiobacillus 36 6 and 33 1 respectively azoarcus 11 2 and 33 9 respectively and thauera 14 2 and 19 5 respectively compared to stage i the higher dosage of nitrate achieved by changing the s n c ratio to 5 6 5 with a fixed sulfide concentration in stage ii mainly influenced the thiobacillus increased from 34 6 to 48 7 and azoarcus decreased from 24 3 to 9 9 genera in both rm ii m and rm ii b in stage iii s2 400 mg l the observed change in the microbial community structure did not follow our expected trend azoarcus 53 2 pseudomonas 21 3 and aliidiomarina 11 6 were predominant in rm iii b while thauera and thiobacillus accounted for 5 5 of the total bacterial community the m dsr bioreactor was subjected to the same trophic conditions as the h dsr bioreactor in stages iv a v h and vi m in stage iv the absence of acetate caused autotrophic denitrification to become the only pathway of denitrification the proportion of thiobacillus increased from 8 2 to 53 9 in rm iv m and from 2 5 to 27 2 in rm iv b corresponding to decreases in the proportion of azoarcus from 37 2 to 13 7 and from 53 2 to 19 1 respectively as shown in fig 5 c the heterotrophic conditions in stage v completely changed the microbial community structure in rm v b the abundances of thauera flavobacterium thiobacillus chryseobacterium and thermomonas were 30 1 19 3 9 7 7 8 and 6 4 respectively however thiobacillus which can oxidize sulfur to sulfate accounted for up to 65 of the total reads in rm v m which provides a possible explanation for the observation of sulfate in the effluent despite the absence of a sulfide feed in this stage in the last stage 400 mg l sulfide was added and the m dsr bioreactor was operated under mixotrophic conditions for the fourth time compared to the first two mixotrophic stages which had sulfide loadings of 200 mg l rm vi b s2 400 mg l was dominated by pseudomonas 51 7 and azoarcus 25 9 with lower proportions of thauera 4 0 and aliidiomarina 4 9 3 3 the response of functional bacteria to different trophic conditions in the start up stage of the a dsr bioreactor thiobacillus were the predominant autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb 81 2 on average and clearly conducted autotrophic denitrification a substantial amount of research has focused on the microbial community structure in the dsr process and demonstrated that azoarcus might play an important role in the simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate adav et al 2010 q ma et al 2015a xu et al 2015b even through azoarcus bacteria are commonly regarded as autotrophic denitrifiers li et al 2016a liu et al 2017 in the start up stage of our h dsr bioreactor azoarcus accounted for 37 6 of the total bacterial community and made up the dominant genera together with pseudomonas 15 2 and thauera 19 3 therefore these three genera were considered to the be the main heterotrophic denitrifiers responsible for the removal of acetate and nitrate in this study as shown in table 2 the three bioreactors achieved 100 removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate during mixotrophic stage ii s2 200 mg l with s n c 5 6 5 which indicated that the different trophic conditions of the start up stage had little impact on the dsr efficiency especially the s0 transformation ratio 37 1 to guarantee high removal ratios of sulfur nitrogen and carbon in three bioreactors the sulfide concentration was increased to 400 mg l in stage iii and the average s0 transformation ratio of each bioreactor increased to 81 9 with a no2 accumulation of 36 7 in the last stage with mixotrophic conditions stage vi the three bioreactors exhibited similar performance with sulfide nitrate and acetate removal ratios of 100 furthermore 16 3 of the no3 was converted to no2 and the s0 transformation ratio hovered at approximately 78 in the general dynamics of the microbial community structure under the switches between autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions thiobacillus azoarcus pseudomonas thauera and allidiomarina were the commonly predominant genera in the a dsr h dsr and m dsr bioreactors during the six operational stages table 3 the similar microbial community structures of the three bioreactors could explain their nearly identical efficiencies under the same trophic conditions 3 4 the important role and contribution of hnrb to the performance of the dsr process in this study the two sulfide concentrations examined 200 mg l and 400 mg l led to different performances in the dsr process in stage ii m the three bioreactors were operated under a s2 concentration of 200 mg l and exhibited s0 transformation ratios of 37 0 39 9 and 34 5 however the s0 transformation ratios doubled when the s2 concentration was increased to 400 mg l stages iii and vi thus the characteristics of the microbial community structures in those stages were worth further examination as shown in fig 5 during stage ii m the a dsr h dsr and m dsr bioreactors were occupied by thiobacillus 45 3 as the dominant autotrophic denitrifiers which was accompanied by azoarcus 12 6 as the dominant heterotrophic denitrifiers nevertheless azoarcus and pseudomonas 54 4 exceeded the proportion of thiobacillus 13 3 and became the predominant genera when the concentration of s2 was increased 400 mg l in the three bioreactors meanwhile thauera and allidiomarina maintained relative abundances of 10 1 18 5 table 3 the higher abundances of azoarcus and pseudomonas were closely related to the high dsr performance observed under a high s2 concentration which caused us to rethink the function of those types of bacteria and their interactions under the different influent sulfide concentrations during the dsr process in conventional sewage treatment plants azoarcus and pseudomonas are frequently associated with the heterotrophic denitrification process as the heterotrophic denitrifiers ma et al 2015b however the potential sulfide oxidizing ability of some species in those genera was reported previously for example pseudomonas sp crs1 lee and wong 2014 and pseudomonas stutzeri dq1 zhao et al 2015 were both isolated from hot springs and could perform both sulfide oxidation and heterotrophic denitrification under anaerobic conditions a few researchers have focused on the metabolism of sulfide oxidation by azoarcus azoarcus taiwanensis nsc3t which can couple the oxidation of sulfide with the reduction of nitrate by using acetate as an electron donor was reported to be a facultative autotrophic bacterium fab lee et al 2014 many researchers have observed similar microbial community structures in the dsr process that is a relatively high proportion of heterotrophic denitrifiers some researchers achieved a maximum s0 transformation ratio of 84 4 7 7 with a high abundance of thauera 10 2 under a s n molar ratio of 5 6 huang et al 2015 whereas the s0 transformation ratio was below 58 6 8 1 with a much lower abundance of thauera 2 6 under other s n molar ratios in another study clone libraries prepared using the 16s rrna gene demonstrated that 43 of the total clones were closely related to thauera 16 8 in the sequencing batch reactor sbr dsr bioreactor meanwhile azoarcus 3 2 species were regarded as the main heterotrophic denitrifiers in that system xu et al 2015b another report also employed the clone library technique to investigate the microbial community structure within the dsr process and azoarcus and thauera accounted for 8 0 and 29 5 of the total bacterial community in that dsr system thereby acting as the main heterotrophic denitrifiers li et al 2016b in addition many heterotrophic bacteria have been demonstrated to contain sqr sulfide quinone oxidoreductase and pdo persulfide dioxygenase genes liu et al 2014 further studies used recombinant e coli cells with those genes to analyze the cooperation between specific enzymes duf442 domain and rhodanese and the molecular levels determined from those studies provided strong evidence for the important role of heterotrophic bacteria in the sulfide oxidizing process xin et al 2016 in our previous study a denitrifying bacterium was isolated and named pseudomonas sp c27 and this bacterium could oxidize sulfide to sulfur under heterotrophic denitrifying conditions chen et al 2013 twelve proteins were reported to be involved in sulfur metabolism based on the analysis of the proteome of pseudomonas sp c27 guo et al 2013 here we define this unique type of heterotrophic denitrifier as heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb although thauera was mainly responsible for heterotrophic denitrification azoarcus and pseudomonas were also present in stage i h of the h dsr bioreactor which is why the change in the trophic conditions from heterotrophic stage i to mixotrophic stage ii immediately provided highly efficient sulfide removal in the h dsr bioreactor the higher concentration of influent sulfide s2 400 mg l in the mixotrophic conditions corresponded to higher abundances of these two genera indicating that they were significantly enriched when the trophic conditions were converted to mixotrophic conditions stages iii and vi in the three bioreactors based on the present work a sonrb such as thiobacillus were responsible for the removal of sulfide and nitrate under autotrophic conditions whereas hnrb thauera and aliidiomarina and h sonrb pseudomonas and azoarcus were responsible for the removal of nitrate and organic carbon under mixotrophic conditions the autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers may work together in two functional mechanisms fig 6 under a low sulfide concentration 200 mg l the cooperation between a sonrb and hnrb facilitates the high performance of the dsr process in contrast under a high sulfide concentration 400 mg l h sonrb took the place of a sonrb and worked with hnrb to maintain high performance in the dsr process according to figs 2 5 63 of sulfide was oxidized to sulfate under a low sulfide concentration in the dsr process the predominance of thiobacillus might be responsible for this low s0 transformation ratio under those conditions furthermore a high sulfur transformation 76 8 86 7 was observed under a high sulfide concentration which is consistent with the high abundance of h sonrb indicating that h sonrb could have a lower ability to compete with nitrate as an electron acceptor in the oxidation of sulfide relative to a sonrb under a low sulfide concentration a low s0 transformation ratio can lead to a high sulfide concentration in the bioreactor resulting in low performance of the dsr process when the sulfide concentration is high enough to inhibit the heterotrophic denitrifiers furthermore the sulfide in the effluent could produce serious environmental problems including a high oxygen demand corrosion and deterioration of the working environment based on the discovery of the essential roles of h sonrb in dsr we can enhance the performance of dsr and sulfur transformation by changing or reconstructing the microbial community composition to give a high abundance of h sonrb or by using bioaugmentation techniques with pure cultures of h sonrb such as pseudomonas sp c27 thus the physiological biochemical characteristics and metabolic pathways of pure cultures belonging to h sonrb are worth further exploration 4 conclusion for the first time this study elaborated the dynamic of microbial community structure in response to the switch of trophic conditions to explore the interactions of functional bacteria and demonstrate the possible metabolic mechanisms involved in dsr process the trophic conditions had no obvious consequence on the removal rate of sulfide nitrate and acetate all achieved 100 no matter under low or high sulfide concentration in influent s0 transformation ratio was 37 1 on average under low sulfide concentration however it is increased by two times 79 9 on average under high sulfide concentration thiobacillus allidiomarina and thauera azoarcus and pseudomonas are the predominant a sonrb hnrb and h sonrb in dsr process the co work of a sonrb and hnrb support the simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate under low sulfide concentration under high sulfide concentration the h sonrb substituted of a sonrb as key functional bacteria for sulfide oxidation and cooperated with hnrb to support dsr process acknowledgment this research was supported by the national key research and development program no 2016yfc0401102 2 the national

19436,compared to autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification process the integrated autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification iahd has wider foreground of applications in the condition where the organic carbon nitrate and inorganic sulfur compounds usually co exist in the actual wastewaters as the most well known iahd process the denitrifying sulfide removal dsr could simultaneously convert sulfide nitrate and organic carbon into sulfur dinitrogen gas and carbon dioxide respectively thus systematical metabolic functions and contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers to the iahd dsr performance became an problem demanding to be promptly studied in this work three upflow anaerobic sludge bioreactors uasbs were individually started up in autotrophic a dsr heterotrophic h dsr and mixotrophic conditions m dsr then the operating conditions of each bioreactor were switched to different trophic conditions with low and high sulfide concentrations in the influent 200 and 400 mg l the removal efficiencies of sulfide nitrate and acetate all reached 100 in all three bioreactors throughout the operational stages however the sulfur transformation ratio ranged from 34 5 to 39 9 at the low sulfide concentration and from 76 8 to 86 7 at the high sulfide concentration in the mixotrophic conditions microbial community structure analyzed by the illumina sequencing indicated that thiobacillus which are autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb was the dominant genus 81 3 in the a dsr bioreactor with respect to the mixotrophic conditions at low sulfide concentration in the m dsr bioreactor thiobacillus a sonrb and thauera which are heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb were the dominant genera with percentages of 48 8 and 14 9 respectively when the sulfide concentration in the influent was doubled the percentage of thiobacillus decreased by approximately 9 fold from 48 8 to 5 4 and the total percentage of azoarcus and pseudomonas which are heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb increased by approximately 6 fold from 10 1 to 59 4 therefore the following interactions between functional groups and their functional mechanisms in the dsr process were proposed 1 a sonrb thiobacillus and hnrb thauera worked together to maintain the performance under the low sulfide concentration 2 h sonrb azoarcus and pseudomonas took the place of a sonrb and worked together with hnrb thauera and allidiomarina under the high sulfide concentration and 3 a sonrb such as thiobacillus were possibly the key bacteria and may have contributed to the low sulfur transformation and h sonrb may be responsible for the high sulfur transformation in the dsr process graphical

sulfur transformation 1 introduction the discharge of nitrate containing wastewater into the environment can cause serious problems such as the eutrophication and deterioration of water sources and is hazardous to human health xu et al 2014 thus the development of wastewater treatment techniques for reducing nitrogen containing pollutants in wastewater has attracted considerable attention focht and chang 1975 park and yoo 2009 wang et al 2017 biological denitrification is preferable over the physical chemistry method because it is cost economical and eco friendly autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification systems are typically employed in nitrogen removal heterotrophic denitrification has been widely used in the treatment of domestic sewage in which heterotrophic denitrifiers use organic carbon as an electron donor to reduce nitrate with adequate amounts of organic carbon for example acetate as shown in eq 1 ra et al 2000 1 2no3 1 25ch3coo 2 5co2 n2 0 25h2o 3 25oh rg m ө 955 0kj reaction nevertheless the high carbon demand and large amount of sludge produced hinder the application of heterotrophic denitrification systems in the treatment of industrial wastewaters eg pharmaceutical and tannery wastewaters with low c n molar ratios sun et al 2010 for this reason autotrophic denitrification especially that based on sulfur compounds has been developed and couples the

denitrification nitrification integrated sani process which was developed based on the concepts of autotrophic denitrification as in eq 2 and sulfur recycling has potential for application in the treatment of saline sewage from seawater toilets lau et al 2006 wang et al 2009 due to its technical advantages of biological sludge minimization and energy saving sani has become one of the most valuable technologies in recent years the notable advantage of all autotrophic denitrification processes is the reduced production of sludge but an adverse consequence is the increased hydraulic retention time hrt caused by the low growth rate of autotrophic denitrifiers which limits the application of autotrophic denitrification in the treatment of industrial wastewaters with a high organic load vaishali and subrata 2015 furthermore purely heterotrophic or autotrophic conditions rarely exist in natural or artificial bioprocesses the co existence of organic carbon sulfur and nitrogen in the aquatic environment match the actual conditions well thus mixotrophic denitrification which integrates autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification iahd processes has been receiving increasing attention because it can overcome the shortcomings of autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification organic carbon was first introduced in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification to create mixotrophic conditions in a fluidized bed reactor in that experiment sulfate was detected in the effluent as the terminal oxidation product of sulfide and the efficient removal of sulfide 2 3 kgs m 3d 1 acetate 4 6 kgc m 3 d 1 and nitrate 5 kgn m 3 d 1 was observed gommers et al 1988 reyes avila et al 2004 employed a mixotrophic system to conduct denitrification and achieved 100 removal of no3 and acetate and successfully converted s2 to s0 the highlight of that study was the generation of recyclable and harmless terminal products s0 co2 and n2 many scientific terms have been given to the mixotrophic process such as heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification had xu et al 2015a and mixotrophic denitrification desulfurization mdd li et al 2016b chen et al 2008 utilized expanded granular sludge bed egsb bioreactors to simultaneously remove sulfide nitrate and acetate and termed this process denitrifying sulfide removal dsr the possible functional mechanisms of mixotrophic denitrification have also been proposed in the first proposed mechanism the autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers functioned individually without competition xu et al 2015b in the second mechanism the autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers worked together to perform the denitrifying process in the following two steps chen et al 2017 fig 1 1 sulfide was oxidized to s0 coupled with the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by the autotrophic denitrifiers and 2 the accumulated nitrite was subsequently converted to n2 with the electrons provided by organic carbon like acetate by the heterotrophic denitrifiers as a result sulfide nitrate and organic carbon were simultaneously converted to sulfur dinitrogen gas and dioxide carbon in our previous study the egsb bioreactor exhibited good performance with nearly 100 removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate at 0 8 kgs m 3d 1 0 4 kgn m 3d 1 and 0 8 kgc m 3d 1 under mixotrophic conditions when the bioreactor was converted to autotrophic conditions the nitrate removal gradually decreased with increasing load eventually declining to 20 3 at 2 8 kgs m 3d 1 and 1 4 kgn m 3d 1 where the sulfide removal ratio also decreased to approximately 40 1 indicating that the bioreactor could not sustain such a high loading under autotrophic conditions however when acetate was added into the bioreactor during the switch of the autotrophic conditions to mixotrophic conditions at the same sulfur and nitrogen loading the removal efficiencies of both sulfide and nitrate recovered to 99 4 and 98 7 removal of acetate was achieved this phenomenon may demonstrate the important role that heterotrophic denitrifiers play in the dsr process meanwhile some heterotrophic denitrifiers capable of oxidizing sulfide under heterotrophic denitrifying conditions were isolated from the mixotrophic conditions lee et al 2014 chen et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 lee and wong 2014 to the best of our knowledge those strains possess the highest sulfide oxidation rate of 14 3 mg l 1h 1 among the other sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria reported in the literature chen et al 2013 thus this kind of bacteria might be the key functional group that mediates the relationship between autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers to sustain the performance however limited research is available on the function of the heterotrophic denitrifiers including the special heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria that contribute to the removal capability in the dsr process in the present work we started up three upflow anaerobic sludge bioreactors uasb in parallel under three different trophic conditions autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic then each bioreactor was individually switched to different trophic conditions the aims of this work were to i determine the impact of the switch in the trophic conditions on the removal efficiency and elemental sulfur transformation the proportion of generated sulfur of the dsr process ii identify the compositions and dynamics of the microbial community that accompanied the shift in the trophic conditions and iii eventually determine the microbial relationships between the autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers and reveal the key roles that the functional groups play in the stability and performance of dsr bioreactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and influent the seed sludge was collected from the anaerobic sludge thickener at the wenchang municipal wastewater treatment plant harbin china the suspended solids ss and volatile suspended solids vss of the seed sludge after screening through 0 2 mm tyler mesh were determined to be 83 2 g l and 40 7 g l respectively three types of synthetic wastewater were used in this study inorganic wastewater for autotrophic denitrification organic wastewater for heterotrophic denitrification and wastewater with inorganic and organic carbon sources for mixotrophic denitrification the only nitrogen source in those three influents was potassium nitrate sulfide and acetate were introduced by dosing with sodium sulfide and sodium acetate respectively to achieve the desired influent s n c n and s n c molar ratios the ph of the sulfide containing influent was adjusted to 8 0 0 4 with hydrochloric acid the chemical composition of trace elements in the solution was described as follows huang et al 2016a 2016b 22 mg of znso4 55 mg of cacl2 50 6 mg of mncl2 4h2o 11 mg of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 15 7 mg of cuso4 5h2o and 16 1 mg of cocl2 6h2o the sulfide concentrations are listed in table 1 and the loadings of all contaminants are calculated according to the s n c n and s n c molar ratios respectively 2 2 lab scale uasb bioreactor setup and operation the three identical lab scale uasb bioreactors used in the continuous experiment were made of plexiglas and had an effective volume of 580 ml height of 40 cm and internal diameter of 30 mm the bioreactors were continuously operated for 165 days with hrt of 9 h at room temperature and were equipped with devices for collecting the h2s gas that overflowed from the top of the column initially synthetic wastewaters containing s n c n and s n c were pumped into the bioreactors from the bottom by a peristaltic pump bs100 1a signal china and these bioreactors were termed a utotrophic start up dsr a dsr h eterotrophic start up dsr h dsr and m ixotrophic start up dsr m dsr bioreactors respectively after the start up stage the three bioreactors were operated for another five stages during which the trophic conditions were switched the steady state of each bioreactor was regarded as the point at which the fluctuations in the removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate were within 5 for 5 days the six switch stages for a dsr h dsr and m dsr were as follows a m ratio change m doubled load h a m h m ratio change m doubled load a h m and m m ratio change m doubled load a h m respectively table 1 2 3 chemical and physical analysis during the operation of the three bioreactors both the influent and effluent were sampled 4 12 ml every 24 h for the analysis of sulfide acetate nitrite sulfate nitrate and thiosulfate the total concentration of sulfide h2s aq s2 and hs under alkaline conditions was determined by the methylene blue method trueper and schlegel 1964 immediately after sampling all samples were centrifuged at 12000 r min for 3 min tg16 yingtai china and then filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane pes pall usa to obtain the supernatant for subsequent measurement gas chromatography 7890 agilent usa equipped with db ffap 30 m 250 μm 0 25 μm capillary column was employed to measure the acetate concentration nitrogen was used as the carrier gas with flowing rate of 45 ml min the flame ionization detector temperature was set at 280 c and supplied with hydrogen 40 ml min and air 400 ml min the concentrations of nitrite sulfate nitrate and thiosulfate were determined using an ion chromatograph ics 3000 dionex usa equipped with an ionpac ag4aas4a sc 4 mm analytical column with carbonate bicarbonate eluent 1 8 mmol dm3 na2co3 1 7 mmol l nahco3 at 1 cm3 min and sulfuric regeneration h2so4 25 mmol l at 5 cm3 min 1 the ph of the

influent so4 2 influent s2o3 2 effluent s2 effluent so4 2 effluent s2o3 2 the s0 transformation ratio was the proportion of the generated s0 in the removed sulfide and the calculation formula was as

analysis sludge samples 36 were collected from the middle and bottom sampling ports of the three uasb bioreactors during the steady state of each stage and immediately stored in a 80 c freezer until use table s1 total genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration and purity of the extracted dna were measured with a nanophotometer p class implen germany the 16s rrna gene fragments were amplified through pcr using universal forward barcoding primer 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and reverse primer 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 3 targeting the v4 and v5 hypervariable regions the pcr products were gel purified using the axyprep dna purification kit axygen usa and quantified with a nanodrop device the purified pcr amplicons from each sample were pooled and subjected to high sequencing using illumina miseq pe250 after filtering the low quality sequences fasta files were generated from the resultant sequences according to the barcodes of the individual samples the sequences were classified by operational taxonomic unit otu at a level of 97 similarity based on the silva rrna database project release119 https www arb silva de the diversity indices simpson and shannon of the sequences were determined based on the calculated otus using the mothur ver 1 30 1 software package the obtained 16s rrna gene sequence was deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under accession number srp124409 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioreactor performance under different trophic conditions in this study apart from stage i the s2 no3 n ac c molar ratio in the mixotrophic conditions was fixed at 5 6 5 to ensure the transformations of s2 to s0 no3 to n2 and ac to co2 the s2 no3 n and ac c no3 n molar ratios were 5 6 and 5 6 in the autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions respectively during the operation of the three bioreactors the trophic conditions were altered to identify the functional bacteria autotrophic and or heterotrophic denitrifiers that might play the key role in dsr and to establish a relationship between the dynamics of the microbial community structure and the efficiency of the bioreactors the specific operation parameters and bioreactor performance in each stage of a dsr h dsr and m dsr are summarized in table 2 during the start up of the three bioreactors in stage i the s n autotrophic conditions c n heterotrophic conditions and s n c mixotrophic conditions molar ratios were maintained at 1 1 1 1 and 1 1 1 respectively unlike in the a dsr bioreactor 22 3 nitrite accumulated no nitrite accumulated in the start up stage of the m dsr bioreactor in stage ii all the bioreactors were converted to mixotrophic conditions with a s2 concentration of 200 mg l and the corresponding sulfide nitrate and acetate removal efficiencies were 100 as shown in figs 2 4 the s0 transformation ratio increased from 14 7 to 37 0 after the addition of acetate to the a dsr bioreactor however the toxicity of sulfide did not deteriorate the performance of h dsr instead the sulfide removal efficiency was maintained at 100 and the s0 transformation ratio sharply increased to 60 2 after dosing with 200 mg l sulfide in m dsr bioreactor the increased nitrate feeding s n c molar ratio change form 1 1 1 to 5 6 5 in stage ii led to a small decline of sulfur transformation ratio 34 5 the increasing amount of electron acceptors made the sulfide oxidation hard to stop at elemental sulfur and this has been wildly reported in autotrophic denitrification process dolejs et al 2015 yang et al 2016 however in iahd process the sulfur transformation ratio not only depended on s n molar ratio but also closely related to c n molar ratio huang et al 2015 employed a cstr bioreactor with fixed c n molar ratio of 1 2 to explore the impact of different s n molar ratios range from 5 2 to 5 9 on sulfur transformation ratio in iahd process and obtain the peak value of 84 4 7 7 with s n molar ratio of 5 6 cardoso et al 2006 reported the sulfur transformation ratio was gradually decreased with the increase of s n molar ratio under the fixed c n molar ratio of 1 1 in a uasb bioreactor this means that the insufficient or overloaded amount of acetate and nitrate resulted in the low sulfur transformation ratio and large amount of sulfate generation in iahd process the sulfide load was doubled in stage iii m with a fixed s n c molar ratio of 5 6 5 only 23 4 18 2 and 14 2 of the influent sulfide was oxidized to so4 2 s and s2o3 2 s in a dsr h dsr and m dsr respectively the s0 transformation ratios in a dsr h dsr and m dsr were 76 8 82 2 and 86 7 respectively which were almost twice those of stage ii the three bioreactors were subjected to a fourth switch in the trophic conditions during stage iv almost 80 4 of the influent nitrate was converted to nitrite throughout the operation of the a dsr bioreactor in stage iv h the h dsr and m dsr bioreactors were shifted to autotrophic conditions in stage iv and the performance of these reactors exhibited similar plateaus in these plateaus the effluent so4 2 s and influent sulfide do not match after the mixotrophic operation stages in the h dsr and m dsr bioreactors the color of the sludge changed from dark gray to white picture not shown which agreed with chen et al 2016 we propose that this color originated from the deposition of elemental sulfur on the sludge which then supplied an extra sulfur source that acted as an electron donor during autotrophic denitrification in the bioreactors in stage v the a dsr bioreactor was returned to autotrophic conditions and after a short adaptation period 3 days after the heterotrophic condition the sulfide and nitrate removal ratios reached 100 sulfate was the main oxidation product of sulfide and no nitrite accumulated in the effluent the h dsr and m dsr bioreactors exhibited nearly the same performance during stage v so4 2 s was detected at concentrations as high as 8 mmol l and 8 6 mmol l respectively in the effluents without a s2 feed no sulfide nitrate or acetate was detected in the effluents of the three bioreactors during stage vi m the final s0 transformation ratios for the a dsr h dsr and m dsr bioreactors were all approximately 80 and the corresponding nitrite accumulation ratios were 19 0 14 4 and 15 7 respectively 3 2 diversity and shift in the microbial community composition as shown in fig s1 after filtering the low quality reads approximately 15000 raw reads of the 16s rrna gene were obtained from the 36 sludge samples all the sequences were extracted to conduct otu analysis at 0 97 similarity and the slower gradually rarefaction curves indicating that the recovered sequences represented the diversity of the microbial communities in the 36 samples well the estimated species diversity of a sample was determined by the simpson and shannon diversity estimator table s1 in total 29 bacterial phyla were recovered from the 36 samples fig s2 approximately 98 of the bacterial reads were associated with the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes proteobacteria was the predominant phylum which accounted for 89 1 bacteroidetes and firmicutes accounted for 4 9 and 3 9 respectively on a finer scale 46 genera within the 29 phyla were identified and are shown in fig 5 obviously different microbial structures were observed for the samples from the middle and bottom sampling ports of the a dsr h dsr and m dsr bioreactors subjected to switches in the trophic conditions a dsr bioreactor in start up stage i a the predominant species was thiobacillus which accounted for 71 5 of the bacteria in the middle sample and 90 9 in the bottom sample thiobacillus is a typical autotrophic denitrifier that can oxidize sulfide to s0 sulfate with nitrate as the electron acceptor baalsrud and baalsrud 1954 capua et al 2016 after the addition of acetate during stage ii m the abundance of thiobacillus decreased from 51 4 to 39 4 meanwhile another sulfide oxidizer acrobacter accounted for 7 3 in ra ii b azoarcus had an abundance of 23 6 in the bottom sample which was 7 3 fold higher than that in the middle sample thauera a known heterotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria hnrb etchebehere and tiedje 2005 liu et al 2006 accounted for 4 7 and 6 1 in ra ii m and ra ii b respectively when the sulfide concentration was increased to 400 mg l in stage iii m the bacterial community in the entire bioreactor was dominated by thiobacillus azoarcus pseudomonas thauera and aliidiomarina aliidiomarina has always been isolated in lake and coastal surface seawater with heterotrophic growth on organic carbon huang et al 2012 chiu et al 2014 in stage iii m fig 5 a the middle sample ra iii m had a higher microbial richness than the bottom sample ra iii b the relative abundances of the six predominant genera in ra iii m were in order 6 8 31 7 18 1 6 6 and 9 1 pseudomonas and azoarcus accounted for 75 7 of the total while thauera and allidiomarina accounted for 1 6 and 7 8 in ra iii b respectively the microbial community structure during stage iv h was quite different between the middle and bottom samples interestingly thiobacillus was not completely outcompeted by the heterotrophic denitrifiers during this stage compared to sample ra iii m the abundance of thiobacillus increased to 28 4 in sample ra m iv this increase might be attributed to the accumulation of generated s0 in the a dsr bioreactor which stimulated the oxidation of sulfur to sulfate by thiobacillus as expected ra b iv was occupied by the following heterotrophic denitrifiers thauera 46 9 acinetobacter 12 8 pseudomonas 8 9 and flavobacterium 7 9 in stage v a the autotrophic conditions rejuvenated the thiobacillus population giving abundances of 53 2 and 59 7 in ra v m and ra v b respectively some heterotrophic denitrifiers such as thauera and pseudomonas were still present in the bioreactor the microbial community structures of the bottom samples in stages vi m and iii m which had the same operating conditions were also similar to each other in contrast while azoarcus was dominant in ra iii m thiobacillus 37 1 was the predominant genus in ra vi m h dsr bioreactor the heterotrophic conditions of stage i resulted in the enrichment of azoarcus pseudomonas thauera and simplicispira in rh i m and rh i b fig 5 b where azoarcus 39 4 and thauera 25 3 were predominant in rh i b and pseudomonas 27 6 and azoarcus 35 7 were predominant in rh i m in stage ii m the operation of the h dsr bioreactor was switched to mixotrophic conditions thiobacillus which had a relative abundance of 52 3 in rh ii b might be responsible for the observed sulfide oxidation the introduction of sulfide led to an increase in the richness of the microbial community in rh ii m thiobacillus accounted for 19 7 while other genera such as thauera simplicispira and azoarcus with abundances of 11 9 7 9 and 3 9 respectively were predominant in rh ii m in stage iii m the concentrations of sulfide nitrate and acetate were all doubled to give a fixed molar ratio of 5 6 5 the higher sulfide concentration decreased the abundance of thiobacillus to 10 2 and 2 8 in rh iii m and rh iii b respectively note that azoarcus became the predominant genus accounting for over 55 and aliidiomarina had abundances of 2 1 and 12 7 in rh iii m and rh iii b respectively when the conditions were switched to autotrophic in stage iv a the main change in the microbial community structure of rh iv b was observed between azoarcus 29 7 and thiobacillus 31 2 when the heterotrophic conditions were returned in stage v thauera which had an abundance of 48 1 in rh v b conducted the heterotrophic denitrification process whereas sulfurimonas and thiobacillus 59 2 in total became the dominant genera instead of the heterotrophic denitrifiers in rh v m the high abundance of autotrophic denitrifiers was believed to be responsible for the sulfate observed in the effluent of the h dsr bioreactor and the oxidation of s0 to sulfate likely occurred in the middle of the bioreactor column in the last stage sulfide was added to the influent and the h dsr bioreactor was operated under parameters identical to those of stage iii the characteristics of the microbial community structure in rh vi b were completely different from those in rh v b psedomonas and azoarcus substituted for thauera as the dominant genera accounting for 31 4 and 47 0 of the total bacterial community respectively however no obvious difference was observed between the microbial community structures of rh vi m and rh v m as thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were the dominant genera in both samples m dsr bioreactor the m dsr bioreactor was started up in mixotrophic conditions with a s2 concentration of 200 mg l and a s n c molar ratio of 1 1 1 the predominant genera in rm i m and rm i b were thiobacillus 36 6 and 33 1 respectively azoarcus 11 2 and 33 9 respectively and thauera 14 2 and 19 5 respectively compared to stage i the higher dosage of nitrate achieved by changing the s n c ratio to 5 6 5 with a fixed sulfide concentration in stage ii mainly influenced the thiobacillus increased from 34 6 to 48 7 and azoarcus decreased from 24 3 to 9 9 genera in both rm ii m and rm ii b in stage iii s2 400 mg l the observed change in the microbial community structure did not follow our expected trend azoarcus 53 2 pseudomonas 21 3 and aliidiomarina 11 6 were predominant in rm iii b while thauera and thiobacillus accounted for 5 5 of the total bacterial community the m dsr bioreactor was subjected to the same trophic conditions as the h dsr bioreactor in stages iv a v h and vi m in stage iv the absence of acetate caused autotrophic denitrification to become the only pathway of denitrification the proportion of thiobacillus increased from 8 2 to 53 9 in rm iv m and from 2 5 to 27 2 in rm iv b corresponding to decreases in the proportion of azoarcus from 37 2 to 13 7 and from 53 2 to 19 1 respectively as shown in fig 5 c the heterotrophic conditions in stage v completely changed the microbial community structure in rm v b the abundances of thauera flavobacterium thiobacillus chryseobacterium and thermomonas were 30 1 19 3 9 7 7 8 and 6 4 respectively however thiobacillus which can oxidize sulfur to sulfate accounted for up to 65 of the total reads in rm v m which provides a possible explanation for the observation of sulfate in the effluent despite the absence of a sulfide feed in this stage in the last stage 400 mg l sulfide was added and the m dsr bioreactor was operated under mixotrophic conditions for the fourth time compared to the first two mixotrophic stages which had sulfide loadings of 200 mg l rm vi b s2 400 mg l was dominated by pseudomonas 51 7 and azoarcus 25 9 with lower proportions of thauera 4 0 and aliidiomarina 4 9 3 3 the response of functional bacteria to different trophic conditions in the start up stage of the a dsr bioreactor thiobacillus were the predominant autotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria a sonrb 81 2 on average and clearly conducted autotrophic denitrification a substantial amount of research has focused on the microbial community structure in the dsr process and demonstrated that azoarcus might play an important role in the simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate adav et al 2010 q ma et al 2015a xu et al 2015b even through azoarcus bacteria are commonly regarded as autotrophic denitrifiers li et al 2016a liu et al 2017 in the start up stage of our h dsr bioreactor azoarcus accounted for 37 6 of the total bacterial community and made up the dominant genera together with pseudomonas 15 2 and thauera 19 3 therefore these three genera were considered to the be the main heterotrophic denitrifiers responsible for the removal of acetate and nitrate in this study as shown in table 2 the three bioreactors achieved 100 removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate during mixotrophic stage ii s2 200 mg l with s n c 5 6 5 which indicated that the different trophic conditions of the start up stage had little impact on the dsr efficiency especially the s0 transformation ratio 37 1 to guarantee high removal ratios of sulfur nitrogen and carbon in three bioreactors the sulfide concentration was increased to 400 mg l in stage iii and the average s0 transformation ratio of each bioreactor increased to 81 9 with a no2 accumulation of 36 7 in the last stage with mixotrophic conditions stage vi the three bioreactors exhibited similar performance with sulfide nitrate and acetate removal ratios of 100 furthermore 16 3 of the no3 was converted to no2 and the s0 transformation ratio hovered at approximately 78 in the general dynamics of the microbial community structure under the switches between autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions thiobacillus azoarcus pseudomonas thauera and allidiomarina were the commonly predominant genera in the a dsr h dsr and m dsr bioreactors during the six operational stages table 3 the similar microbial community structures of the three bioreactors could explain their nearly identical efficiencies under the same trophic conditions 3 4 the important role and contribution of hnrb to the performance of the dsr process in this study the two sulfide concentrations examined 200 mg l and 400 mg l led to different performances in the dsr process in stage ii m the three bioreactors were operated under a s2 concentration of 200 mg l and exhibited s0 transformation ratios of 37 0 39 9 and 34 5 however the s0 transformation ratios doubled when the s2 concentration was increased to 400 mg l stages iii and vi thus the characteristics of the microbial community structures in those stages were worth further examination as shown in fig 5 during stage ii m the a dsr h dsr and m dsr bioreactors were occupied by thiobacillus 45 3 as the dominant autotrophic denitrifiers which was accompanied by azoarcus 12 6 as the dominant heterotrophic denitrifiers nevertheless azoarcus and pseudomonas 54 4 exceeded the proportion of thiobacillus 13 3 and became the predominant genera when the concentration of s2 was increased 400 mg l in the three bioreactors meanwhile thauera and allidiomarina maintained relative abundances of 10 1 18 5 table 3 the higher abundances of azoarcus and pseudomonas were closely related to the high dsr performance observed under a high s2 concentration which caused us to rethink the function of those types of bacteria and their interactions under the different influent sulfide concentrations during the dsr process in conventional sewage treatment plants azoarcus and pseudomonas are frequently associated with the heterotrophic denitrification process as the heterotrophic denitrifiers ma et al 2015b however the potential sulfide oxidizing ability of some species in those genera was reported previously for example pseudomonas sp crs1 lee and wong 2014 and pseudomonas stutzeri dq1 zhao et al 2015 were both isolated from hot springs and could perform both sulfide oxidation and heterotrophic denitrification under anaerobic conditions a few researchers have focused on the metabolism of sulfide oxidation by azoarcus azoarcus taiwanensis nsc3t which can couple the oxidation of sulfide with the reduction of nitrate by using acetate as an electron donor was reported to be a facultative autotrophic bacterium fab lee et al 2014 many researchers have observed similar microbial community structures in the dsr process that is a relatively high proportion of heterotrophic denitrifiers some researchers achieved a maximum s0 transformation ratio of 84 4 7 7 with a high abundance of thauera 10 2 under a s n molar ratio of 5 6 huang et al 2015 whereas the s0 transformation ratio was below 58 6 8 1 with a much lower abundance of thauera 2 6 under other s n molar ratios in another study clone libraries prepared using the 16s rrna gene demonstrated that 43 of the total clones were closely related to thauera 16 8 in the sequencing batch reactor sbr dsr bioreactor meanwhile azoarcus 3 2 species were regarded as the main heterotrophic denitrifiers in that system xu et al 2015b another report also employed the clone library technique to investigate the microbial community structure within the dsr process and azoarcus and thauera accounted for 8 0 and 29 5 of the total bacterial community in that dsr system thereby acting as the main heterotrophic denitrifiers li et al 2016b in addition many heterotrophic bacteria have been demonstrated to contain sqr sulfide quinone oxidoreductase and pdo persulfide dioxygenase genes liu et al 2014 further studies used recombinant e coli cells with those genes to analyze the cooperation between specific enzymes duf442 domain and rhodanese and the molecular levels determined from those studies provided strong evidence for the important role of heterotrophic bacteria in the sulfide oxidizing process xin et al 2016 in our previous study a denitrifying bacterium was isolated and named pseudomonas sp c27 and this bacterium could oxidize sulfide to sulfur under heterotrophic denitrifying conditions chen et al 2013 twelve proteins were reported to be involved in sulfur metabolism based on the analysis of the proteome of pseudomonas sp c27 guo et al 2013 here we define this unique type of heterotrophic denitrifier as heterotrophic sulfide oxidizing nitrate reducing bacteria h sonrb although thauera was mainly responsible for heterotrophic denitrification azoarcus and pseudomonas were also present in stage i h of the h dsr bioreactor which is why the change in the trophic conditions from heterotrophic stage i to mixotrophic stage ii immediately provided highly efficient sulfide removal in the h dsr bioreactor the higher concentration of influent sulfide s2 400 mg l in the mixotrophic conditions corresponded to higher abundances of these two genera indicating that they were significantly enriched when the trophic conditions were converted to mixotrophic conditions stages iii and vi in the three bioreactors based on the present work a sonrb such as thiobacillus were responsible for the removal of sulfide and nitrate under autotrophic conditions whereas hnrb thauera and aliidiomarina and h sonrb pseudomonas and azoarcus were responsible for the removal of nitrate and organic carbon under mixotrophic conditions the autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers may work together in two functional mechanisms fig 6 under a low sulfide concentration 200 mg l the cooperation between a sonrb and hnrb facilitates the high performance of the dsr process in contrast under a high sulfide concentration 400 mg l h sonrb took the place of a sonrb and worked with hnrb to maintain high performance in the dsr process according to figs 2 5 63 of sulfide was oxidized to sulfate under a low sulfide concentration in the dsr process the predominance of thiobacillus might be responsible for this low s0 transformation ratio under those conditions furthermore a high sulfur transformation 76 8 86 7 was observed under a high sulfide concentration which is consistent with the high abundance of h sonrb indicating that h sonrb could have a lower ability to compete with nitrate as an electron acceptor in the oxidation of sulfide relative to a sonrb under a low sulfide concentration a low s0 transformation ratio can lead to a high sulfide concentration in the bioreactor resulting in low performance of the dsr process when the sulfide concentration is high enough to inhibit the heterotrophic denitrifiers furthermore the sulfide in the effluent could produce serious environmental problems including a high oxygen demand corrosion and deterioration of the working environment based on the discovery of the essential roles of h sonrb in dsr we can enhance the performance of dsr and sulfur transformation by changing or reconstructing the microbial community composition to give a high abundance of h sonrb or by using bioaugmentation techniques with pure cultures of h sonrb such as pseudomonas sp c27 thus the physiological biochemical characteristics and metabolic pathways of pure cultures belonging to h sonrb are worth further exploration 4 conclusion for the first time this study elaborated the dynamic of microbial community structure in response to the switch of trophic conditions to explore the interactions of functional bacteria and demonstrate the possible metabolic mechanisms involved in dsr process the trophic conditions had no obvious consequence on the removal rate of sulfide nitrate and acetate all achieved 100 no matter under low or high sulfide concentration in influent s0 transformation ratio was 37 1 on average under low sulfide concentration however it is increased by two times 79 9 on average under high sulfide concentration thiobacillus allidiomarina and thauera azoarcus and pseudomonas are the predominant a sonrb hnrb and h sonrb in dsr process the co work of a sonrb and hnrb support the simultaneous removal of sulfide nitrate and acetate under low sulfide concentration under high sulfide concentration the h sonrb substituted of a sonrb as key functional bacteria for

19437,in the field of capacitive deionization cdi it has become a common notion that constant current cc operation consumes significantly less energy than constant voltage operation cv arguments in support of this claim are that in cc operation the endpoint voltage is reached only at the end of the charging step and thus the average cell voltage during charging is lower than the endpoint voltage and that in cc operation we can recover part of the invested energy during discharge though these arguments are correct in the present work based on experiments and theory we conclude that in operation of a well defined cdi cycle this does not lead for the case we analyze to the general conclusion that cc operation is more energy efficient instead we find that without energy recovery there is no difference in energy consumption between cc and cv operation including 50 energy recovery we find that indeed cc is more energy efficient but also in cv much energy can be recovered important in the analysis is to precisely define the desalination objective function such as that per unit total operational time including both the charge and discharge steps a certain desalination quantity and water recovery must be achieved another point is that also in cv operation energy recovery is possible by discharge at a non zero cell voltage to aid the analysis we present a new method of data representation where energy consumption is plotted against desalination in addition we propose that one must analyze the full range of combinations of cycle times voltages and currents and only compare the best cycles to be able to conclude which operational mode is optimal for a given desalination objective we discuss three methods to make this analysis in a rigorous way two experimental and one combining experiments and theory we use the last method and present results of this analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization constant current and constant voltage

removed during the charging step temporarily held inside the electrodes and released again during discharge biesheuvel et al 2017 hawks et al 2018 during charging there is an input of electrical

kim and choi 2010 li and zou 2011 the most commonly used cdi architecture is the flow by cell which employs film electrodes with a spacer channel placed in between through which the solution flows along the electrodes suss et al 2015 cdi has mainly been applied as a desalination technology for brackish water while other applications include water softening seo et al 2010 and water reuse for cooling towers lee et al 2006 van limpt and van der wal 2014 for cdi with film electrodes an important choice that must be made is whether operation will be at constant voltage cv or constant current cc there can be various criteria to base this choice on such as the aim for a constant effluent concentration cc in membrane cdi or a low energy consumption of the process note that this choice does not need to be made for steady state operation of cdi with flowing electrodes but is only necessary for cyclic processes for carbon electrodes which we consider from this point onward in literature it is often reported that cc operation leads to a lower energy consumption than cv operation kang et al 2014 2016 choi 2015 han et al 2015 andelman 2011 qu et al 2016 kang et al 2014 show that cc cdi consumes approximately 30 less energy than cv cdi for identical electrical charge storage or identical ion removal without considering energy recovery similar differences in energy consumption between cc and cv modes without considering energy recovery were reported by choi 2015 and by han et al 2015 a much higher advantage of cc over cv implied by andelman 2011 where on theoretical grounds cc was considered to have a twice lower energy use than cv operation in another study qu et al 2016 show that in cc operation with complete energy recovery the energy consumption can be as low as 28 of cv operation i e about a factor of three less and kang et al 2016 conclude that energy recovery in cc operation is much more favorable than in cv operation arguments brought forward to explain the lower energy use in cc operation are as follows first it is argued that during cc charging the charging voltage is only reached at the end of a charging step thus on average the cell voltage during charging is lower in cc operation and thus the electrical energy consumption is lower in the ideal case and with the same endpoint voltage this difference amounts to a factor of two the other argument is that in cc operation it is possible to recover energy which it is implied is not possible during cv operation this is indeed true when cv is operated at zero discharge voltage as has been the classical approach in cv cdi however also in cv operation it is possible to discharge at a non zero cell voltage and thus energy recovery is possible kim et al 2015 to compare cc and cv operation one must precisely define the desalination objective such that per unit total operational time a certain water recovery and desalination quantity must be achieved water recovery wr is the ratio of the volume flow of desalinated water diluate over the volume of feedwater 1 1 the volume of desalinated water i e the diluate stream is in the present work calculated by multiplying the water flow rate with the duration of the desalination step which we define as the period when the salt concentration of the effluent of the cell is lower than the concentration of the feed water zhao et al 2013 desalination quantity will be defined below for a certain objective function defined by these the parameters we must find conditions of operation with lowest energy consumption which can thereafter be compared for different modes of operation this is not as straightforward as it may seem though it is often attempted to compare cc and cv for identical conditions of operation it is not sufficiently checked whether these conditions result in the same desalination quantity and wr choi 2015 compares data for cc and cv operation for identical charging voltages that is data are compared where the charging voltage applied in cv operation is the same as the endpoint charging voltage in cc operation however for this comparison between any two data points at the same voltage various other operational properties are different such as wr cycle time and salt removal kang et al 2014 compare cv and cc operation as function of the salt adsorption capacity of a cycle data points are compared at the same value of salt adsorption capacity and wr of 50 however for each data point used in the comparison the cycle time the duration of the full charge discharge cycle is different thus kang et al 2014 compare the performance of a single cycle but not the performance per time period of system operation and therefore the cycle averaged salt adsorption rates are not equal whereas these papers consider flow by cdi qu et al 2016 perform experiments with flow through cdi and compare data as function of charge transferred they show inset picture fig 4 in qu et al 2016 that in their case the amount of charge is close to proportional to salt removal furthermore data were obtained at the same duration of the charging either cv or cc and discharge step cc in all cases this approach is in line with the proposal of the present paper which is that one must compare data with the same salt removal rate when averaged over the full cycle they show that without energy recovery cc has 35 less energy consumption and including energy recovery cc has up to a factor of three lower energy consumption different to our protocol qu et al 2016 only analyze a first cycle and not the dynamic steady state but for the longer cycles this should not matter much energy consumption was analyzed for flow by cdi by zhao et al 2012 and compared for cc vs cv operation cdi vs membrane cdi and for different salt concentrations conclusions in that paper however were based on comparing data with different average salt adsorption rates and thus the conclusions do not rigorously follow recently for membrane cdi wang and lin 2018 conclude that it depends on the desalination objective whether cc is to be favored over cv or vice versa in order to compare cc and cv operation in a fair manner one has to make sure that the desalination objective of the cycles subject to comparison is the same the objective is always defined by two parameters first the water recovery wr 1 and second a measure of the amount of salt removed the latter can be expressed as the average salt adsorption rate asar which is based on the molar quantity of salt removed from the diluate stream per unit operational time suss et al 2015 instead one can use the average difference in salt concentration between the diluate and feed streams we call this difference desalination δ c in this paper we will use δ c not asar as our measure for the amount of salt removed from the diluate stream in a cdi cycle for each operational mode cv or cc an infinite number of charging discharging schemes is possible which are all defined by different operational parameters each scheme results in a desalination cycle with a certain desalination objective and energy consumption thus to reach a certain objective several operational schemes are possible and for each scheme the energy consumption can be different in order to conclude whether cc or cv operation performs better one has to compare for each operational mode the scheme resulting in the desired objective with the lowest energy consumption this means that one has to conduct in principle an infinite number of experiments because the desalination objective defined by wr and δ c reached by a certain scheme can only be determined after running the cdi cycle many experiments must be discarded if we are only interested in one value of wr and δ c to compare cc and cv operation instead we propose that it is better to use all data that are obtained and thus to compare cc to cv operation for a range of values of wr and δ c this method would result in a 3d representation of energy use versus wr and δ c this method which we refer to as experimental 3d see fig 1 allows for a fair comparison between the operational modes another method which we refer to as experimental 2d is based on fixing one of the parameters defining the desalination objective e g wr at a constant value and to compare the energy consumption of both operational modes as function of δ c this means that experiments should be conducted using an operational scheme that results in a pre defined value of wr which is not easy because according to our definition 1 water recovery is not a parameter that can be imposed directly in an experiment i e it is not an input but an output of an experiment indeed as we will show wr can be markedly different from what would be expected based on a calculation involving charging and discharging times therefore experiments have to be designed making use of a control loop a desalination cycle is conducted with several parameters defining a cycle then the output of a cycle is analyzed and wr calculated thereafter the parameters are adapted and this loop is run through until wr reaches the pre defined value also in this case a very large number of experiments are required to find conditions of minimum energy in a plot of energy consumption versus δ c instead of these two experimental methods we make use of a method which combines experiment and theory see fig 1 this method consists of performing a limited number of experiments to validate a dynamic cdi model dykstra et al 2016a 2017 hemmatifar et al 2015 this model is then used to generate a very large number of calculated outputs of energy use all at a constant pre defined value of wr achieved by a numerical search routine and these model results are compared in a plot for energy consumption versus desalination δ c at fixed values of wr we refer to this method as theoretical 2d the objective of the present manuscript is to outline a methodology to assess the energy consumption of a certain operational mode of a certain cdi technology in the present work we apply this methodology to the example case of comparing cc and cv operation in cdi in this method we make use of a computer model of a cdi cell and run a very large number of calculations with varying values of cycle times current voltages etc all for the same input and device in this way we find for each operational mode cv or cc the optimum cycle characteristics and we can control wr exactly without requiring experiments using a control loop optimum values are read off as the lower boundary in a plot of energy versus desalination δ c at fixed values of wr these optimum values i e the lower boundaries can then be compared to derive information on the merit of cc versus cv operation with respect to energy use for conditions where the overall performance of the process is the same the comparison is made at two values of the energy recovery during discharge 2 theoretical framework theoretical calculations are made using a dynamic cdi model of a single cell which describes ion electromigration across the spacer channel and through the porous electrode combined with a suitable edl model for the theoretical equations we refer the reader to refs dykstra et al 2016b in the flow direction only a single sub cell is assumed to describe the edl structure for mathematical simplicity the improved modified donnan model is used in the calculations which was compared with the amphoteric donnan model gao et al 2016 dykstra et al 2017 mubita et al 2018 and was shown to give similar predictions for salt adsorption charge and charge efficiency in the relevant range of salinities of this study see supplementary information s i section 1 values for relevant parameters in this dynamic cdi model are reported in s i section 2 calculations are always made for the dynamic steady state dss or limit cycle by running through at least three cycles and taking results from the third cycle salt adsorption is calculated as the number of moles removed from the diluate stream based on the difference in inflow and effluent salt concentration which is also equal to the molar quantity of salt that is added to the concentrate stream energy consumption ec is equal to the energy input during the charging step minus the energy that is recovered during the discharge step energy input is calculated as the integral of current and cell voltage during the charging step the energy that is recovered during discharge is the product of current cell voltage and an energy recovery factor integrated over the discharge step in our calculations this factor is taken as either 0 or 50 when this factor is 0 we do not recover energy and ec is equal to the energy input when a factor of 50 is used energy recovery is included and ec is lower than with a recovery factor of 0 energy consumption can be presented in many different ways such as energy per volume of diluate produced or energy per unit time alternatively an inverse measure can be used such as energy normalized adsorbed salt hemmatifar et al 2016 in this paper we use the metric of energy per molar quantity of salt removed with unit kj mol 3 energy consumption as function of desalination comparing theory and data our experimental program is based on the cdi stack described in detail in dykstra et al 2016a the stack consists of four cells each cell containing two porous activated carbon electrodes materials methods pacmmtm 203 irvine ca usa a spacer keeps the electrodes apart and allows for fluid flow the salt solution is pumped from a vessel with a volume of 10 l through the cell thereafter passes a conductivity sensor that records a value each second and recirculates back to the vessel the solution in the vessel is purged with n 2 gas to minimize the concentration of dissolved oxygen in solution and thus to minimize the occurrence of faradaic reactions that can result in the reduction of desalination performance during the experiments for more details on the experimental design we refer the reader to s i section 3 the aim of these experiments was to validate the dynamic cdi model as presented in section 2 experimental results are presented in fig 2 as function of desalination δ c which is the decrease in salt concentration of the diluate stream compared to the feed stream averaged over the duration of the desalination step the time period that the device produces diluate i e that the water leaving the cell has a lower salinity than the feed for cv operation δ c increases when we reduce the discharge voltage at the very right v disch 0 in fig 2a b while for cc operation moving to the right data points correspond to higher and higher current densities as discussed we do not use these data to directly come to a conclusion about energy in optimized cc or cv cycles but use these data to validate the dynamic cdi model as fig 2 shows the fit of model to data is reasonable but certainly not perfect though a better fit would have been preferred still for the present work which has the aim to outline a method how to analyze operational modes in cdi the quality of the fit between the model and data is sufficient we should note that to fit the model to the data somewhat unrealistic values had to be used for certain parameters in the model see s i section 2 for the data shown in fig 2 one would perhaps expect that in all cases the water recovery wr is 50 as the charging time was equal to the discharge time both for cc and cv operation indeed fig 3 shows that for most cv data this is the case but fig 3 also shows that for some cv data and all cc data wr is less than 50 thus although the charging time is equal to the discharge time in all experiments we find that the adsorption time which we define as the period when the salt concentration of the effluent is lower than in the feedwater that this period is considerably shorter than the desorption time which is the period when the effluent has a higher salt concentration than in the feedwater this difference in adsorption and desorption time results with constant flow rate in wr 50 thus we cannot simply compare a set of cc and cv experiments for the reasons outlined before first that for a certain operational setting we cannot be sure that we are at the lowest energy for a given desalination objective and second in most cases the desalination objective is different both δ c and wr will be different between the cc and cv data points therefore we use a different approach where the validated cdi model is used to generate many data points of energy use at different values of wr and δ c for the different operational modes as will be discussed in the next section 4 optimizing desalination performance as function of desalination and wr comparing constant voltage and constant current operational modes in section 3 we validated our dynamic model with experimental data and discussed that we use this model to compare the energy consumption ec of cv and cc operational modes in the present section we discuss this methodology in more detail and present the results of the comparison between cv and cc charging in cdi to be able to compare cdi cycles for different operational modes three types of constraints must be the same the flow rate and composition of the inflowing water the cell itself mass of electrodes dimensions and the desalination objective with all of these constraints the same we can analyze whether one mode of operation has a higher energy consumption than another mode for a different input cell or objective the conclusion can be quite different calculations are based on the same input water and cell design as in the experimental and theoretical program discussed above furthermore the calculations are limited to the following conditions one level of inflow salinity single salt solution nacl either cc during charge and discharge or only cv thus no mixed modes and pump rate constant no variation in pump flow rate such as in stop flow mode bouhadana et al 2011 for cv operation four parameters are required to define a cycle charging voltage v ch discharge voltage v dch charging time t ch and discharge time t dch for cc operation again four parameters define a cycle endpoint voltage during charging v up charging current i ch endpoint voltage during discharge v down and discharge current i dch for both cv and cc we discussed in section 3 that with equal charging and discharge times water recovery wr is not necessarily 50 and can be different for each calculation in order to compare cc and cv one should control the desalination objective and thus fix wr at a constant value we make calculations using these four parameters according to the calculation procedure described in box 1 fig 4 shows calculation results for energy consumption ec in cv and cc operational modes for er 0 panel a and er 50 panel b where the latter means that 50 of the energy released during discharge is recovered and is thus subtracted from the energy input to calculate ec results are shown for wr 50 as expected there are many ways to run a cycle to achieve a certain value of δ c and all have a different energy consumption because we are primarily interested in the lowest values of energy for any given δ c we care most about the lower boundary of the calculation results which we present in fig 5 fig 5 shows calculation results not only for wr 50 but also for wr 40 60 and 70 and for each set of calculations we plot the lower boundary of energy consumption to select the datapoints that mark the boundary out of the full cloud of calculation results a well defined procedure is required which we describe in box 2 an important assumption to make this procedure work is that the lower boundary increases concavely upward with δ c now with lower boundaries plotted in fig 5 for different values of wr with and without 50 energy recovery we can compare the energy consumption in cc and cv operation making this comparison we see that without energy recovery our procedure predicts not much difference in energy consumption between the two operational modes however with 50 energy recovery cc shows a 5 15 lower energy consumption than cv this moderate difference between energy consumption in cv and cc operation is in line with recent observations by wang and lin 2018 for membrane cdi one may wonder how fig 5c and d would be with 100 energy recovery instead of 50 in fact calculations with 100 recovery were made but resulted in many lb points and only a very limited number of optlb points this is because with 100 recovery the calculation procedure predicts that we can increase the upper voltage cc and the charging and discharge voltages cv to high values in fact to the maximum values we set because most of the input energy will be fully recovered anyway thus in case we use an energy recovery factor of 100 it was not possible to obtain a sufficient number of data points to reliably construct the lower boundary in an energy vs δ c plot furthermore in our view a recovery factor of 50 is more realistic than of 100 a few studies that describe the development and optimization of a back boost converter for cdi to recover energy during discharge report a maximum recovery factor of 50 alkuran and orabi 2008 kang et al 2016 although other studies also report an efficiency 80 pern et al 2012 and even 100 prieto et al 2014 for the optimal points as plotted in fig 5 we listed in s i section 4 all values for v ch v dch t ch and t dch cv and i ch i dch t ch and v down cc interestingly we find that for cv cycles with optimum desalination performance have a discharge voltage of v disch 0 3 v or higher which is in line with results reported by kim et al 2015 where it was concluded that increasing the discharge voltage from 0 v to 0 3 v results in a higher charge efficiency for cc operation we find a similar result but only for calculations based on 50 energy recovery without recovery there is no clear dependence on the endpoint voltage during discharge finally we analyze why without energy recovery our procedure predicts not much difference in energy consumption between the two modes of operation and why with 50 energy recovery cc consumes less energy than cv to that end for both operational modes we make a detailed calculation of the various contributions to the energy see fig 6 we compare here a cc cycle with a cv cycle and both cycles have the same δ c and wr and without energy recovery have almost the same energy consumption without energy recovery cv ec 89 2 kj mol cc ec 93 4 kj mol with 50 energy recovery cv ec 65 6 kj mol cc ec 56 3 kj mol both cycles are at the lower boundary in fig 5 for both modes of operation we study the energy in the separate elements of the cell the edls donnan and stern potential ionic resistances in spacer and macropores and electronic resistances in cables and current collectors the equations required for this analysis are described in s i section 5 fig 6 first of all shows the energy stored in the stern and donnan layers in the electrodes during charging note how for cv operation the energy stored in the stern layer is much lower than for cc operation cv 56 3 kj mol cc 68 2 kj mol during discharge the energy stored in the stern layer is released again but for the donnan layer not all energy that was stored is again released which can be explained as follows during charging the donnan layer is charged while the salt concentration in the macropores is low resulting in a high donnan potential between macropores and micropores instead during discharge the salt concentration in the macropores is much higher and thus the donnan potential is lower consequently the energy released from the donnan layer during discharge is less than the energy required to charge the layer fig 6 also shows that both during charging and discharge energy is dissipated due to the ionic resistances in the spacer and electrodes ma and due to electronic resistances in cables and current collectors eer comparing cv and cc we observe that the energy dissipation due to resistances is higher in cv than in cc both during charging and discharge which can probably be explained by the high currents directly at the start of a cv charging step and consequently by the low salt concentrations in the spacer and electrodes resulting in a high resistance although the energy dissipation due to resistances is much higher in cv mode than in cc mode we find that the total energy input sum of all bars for end of charging equal to energy consumption in case of 0 energy recovery is slightly lower for cv than for cc as fig 5 shows this is because for cv the stern layer in the edl needs to be charged less to reach the required δ c and wr 56 kj mol for cv vs 68 kj mol for cc finally we like to note that as figs 2 and 3 showed the cdi transport model did not perfectly describe experimental data for all values of δ c the level of fit of the model to the data of course directly impacts the correctness of our observations such as for the relative level of energy consumption in cc and cv operation thus to come to more solid conclusions it is useful to find a cdi model and its parameter settings which describes data more precisely nevertheless for the objective of our work which is to present a method of cdi cycle analysis and energy use the cdi model used has been an essential tool 5 conclusions in this manuscript we presented a methodology to assess the energy consumption of a certain operational mode of cdi operation and we apply this methodology to compare constant current and constant voltage charging in cdi constant voltage cv and constant current cc in this methodology we use a validated cdi model that can be used in both operational modes we define several constraints and parameters describing desalination cycles for both cc and cv and we calculate for a range of parameter combinations the energy consumption with and without 50 energy recovery during discharge water recovery wr and the decrease in salt concentration of the diluate averaged over the salt adsorption period δ c thereafter we plot the lowest values of energy consumption as function of δ c and wr this robust methodology showed that in our example calculation without energy recovery the lowest values of energy consumption of cv and cc operation are approximately the same if 50 of the energy released during discharge can be recovered and reused in cdi cc has a somewhat lower energy consumption than cv the methodology can be extended to analyze mixed modes of operation e g cc charging and cv discharge or vice versa and operation with a water flow rate that has different values during the cycle which can be useful to increase wr furthermore the methodology can be used to find parameter combinations for optimum desalination performance in membrane cdi and in other cell designs it must be noted that the cdi transport model we make use of in our methodology did not perfectly describe experimental data for all values of δ c if the aim is to find exact values for parameter settings of cdi operation to reach the lowest energy consumption at a certain desalination objective then a better fit between data and theory and consequently a better model is required acknowledgement this work was performed in the cooperation framework of wetsus european centre of excellence for sustainable water technology www wetsus eu

different modes of operation this is not as straightforward as it may seem though it is often attempted to compare cc and cv for identical conditions of operation it is not sufficiently checked whether these conditions result in the same desalination quantity and wr choi 2015 compares data for cc and cv operation for identical charging voltages that is data are compared where the charging voltage applied in cv operation is the same as the endpoint charging voltage in cc operation however for this comparison between any two data points at the same voltage various other operational properties are different such as wr cycle time and salt removal kang et al 2014 compare cv and cc operation as function of the salt adsorption capacity of a cycle data points are compared at the same value of salt adsorption capacity and wr of 50 however for each data point used in the comparison the cycle time the duration of the full charge discharge cycle is different thus kang et al 2014 compare the performance of a single cycle but not the performance per time period of system operation and therefore the cycle averaged salt adsorption rates are not equal whereas these papers consider flow by cdi qu et al 2016 perform experiments with flow through cdi and compare data as function of charge transferred they show inset picture fig 4 in qu et al 2016 that in their case the amount of charge is close to proportional to salt removal furthermore data were obtained at the same duration of the charging either cv or cc and discharge step cc in all cases this approach is in line with the proposal of the present paper which is that one must compare data with the same salt removal rate when averaged over the full cycle they show that without energy recovery cc has 35 less energy consumption and including energy recovery cc has up to a factor of three lower energy consumption different to our protocol qu et al 2016 only analyze a first cycle and not the dynamic steady state but for the longer cycles this should not matter much energy consumption was analyzed for flow by cdi by zhao et al 2012 and compared for cc vs cv operation cdi vs membrane cdi and for different salt concentrations conclusions in that paper however were based on comparing data with different average salt adsorption rates and thus the conclusions do not rigorously follow recently for membrane cdi wang and lin 2018 conclude that it depends on the desalination objective whether cc is to be favored over cv or vice versa in order to compare cc and cv operation in a fair manner one has to make sure that the desalination objective of the cycles subject to comparison is the same the objective is always defined by two parameters first the water recovery wr 1 and second a measure of the amount of salt removed the latter can be expressed as the average salt adsorption rate asar which is based on the molar quantity of salt removed from the diluate stream per unit operational time suss et al 2015 instead one can use the average difference in salt concentration between the diluate and feed streams we call this difference desalination δ c in this paper we will use δ c not asar as our measure for the amount of salt removed from the diluate stream in a cdi cycle for each operational mode cv or cc an infinite number of charging discharging schemes is possible which are all defined by different operational parameters each scheme results in a desalination cycle with a certain desalination objective and energy consumption thus to reach a certain objective several operational schemes are possible and for each scheme the energy consumption can be different in order to conclude whether cc or cv operation performs better one has to compare for each operational mode the scheme resulting in the desired objective with the lowest energy consumption this means that one has to conduct in principle an infinite number of experiments because the desalination objective defined by wr and δ c reached by a certain scheme can only be determined after running the cdi cycle many experiments must be discarded if we are only interested in one value of wr and δ c to compare cc and cv operation instead we propose that it is better to use all data that are obtained and thus to compare cc to cv operation for a range of values of wr and δ c this method would result in a 3d representation of energy use versus wr and δ c this method which we refer to as experimental 3d see fig 1 allows for a fair comparison between the operational modes another method which we refer to as experimental 2d is based on fixing one of the parameters defining the desalination objective e g wr at a constant value and to compare the energy consumption of both operational modes as function of δ c this means that experiments should be conducted using an operational scheme that results in a pre defined value of wr which is not easy because according to our definition 1 water recovery is not a parameter that can be imposed directly in an experiment i e it is not an input but an output of an experiment indeed as we will show wr can be markedly different from what would be expected based on a calculation involving charging and discharging times therefore experiments have to be designed making use of a control loop a desalination cycle is conducted with several parameters defining a cycle then the output of a cycle is analyzed and wr calculated thereafter the parameters are adapted and this loop is run through until wr reaches the pre defined value also in this case a very large number of experiments are required to find conditions of minimum energy in a plot of energy consumption versus δ c instead of these two experimental methods we make use of a method which combines experiment and theory see fig 1 this method consists of performing a limited number of experiments to validate a dynamic cdi model dykstra et al 2016a 2017 hemmatifar et al 2015 this model is then used to generate a very large number of calculated outputs of energy use all at a constant pre defined value of wr achieved by a numerical search routine and these model results are compared in a plot for energy consumption versus desalination δ c at fixed values of wr we refer to this method as theoretical 2d the objective of the present manuscript is to outline a methodology to assess the energy consumption of a certain operational mode of a certain cdi technology in the present work we apply this methodology to the example case of comparing cc and cv operation in cdi in this method we make use of a computer model of a cdi cell and run a very large number of calculations with varying values of cycle times current voltages etc all for the same input and device in this way we find for each operational mode cv or cc the optimum cycle characteristics and we can control wr exactly without requiring experiments using a control loop optimum values are read off as the lower boundary in a plot of energy versus desalination δ c at fixed values of wr these optimum values i e the lower boundaries can then be compared to derive information on the merit of cc versus cv operation with respect to energy use for conditions where the overall performance of the process is the same the comparison is made at two values of the energy recovery during discharge 2 theoretical framework theoretical calculations are made using a dynamic cdi model of a single cell which describes ion electromigration across the spacer channel and through the porous electrode combined with a suitable edl model for the theoretical equations we refer the reader to refs dykstra et al 2016b in the flow direction only a single sub cell is assumed to describe the edl structure for mathematical simplicity the improved modified donnan model is used in the calculations which was compared with the amphoteric donnan model gao et al 2016 dykstra et al 2017 mubita et al 2018 and was shown to give similar predictions for salt adsorption charge and charge efficiency in the relevant range of salinities of this study see supplementary information s i section 1 values for relevant parameters in this dynamic cdi model are reported in s i section 2 calculations are always made for the dynamic steady state dss or limit cycle by running through at least three cycles and taking results from the third cycle salt adsorption is calculated as the number of moles removed from the diluate stream based on the difference in inflow and effluent salt concentration which is also equal to the molar quantity of salt that is added to the concentrate stream energy consumption ec is equal to the energy input during the charging step minus the energy that is recovered during the discharge step energy input is calculated as the integral of current and cell voltage during the charging step the energy that is recovered during discharge is the product of current cell voltage and an energy recovery factor integrated over the discharge step in our calculations this factor is taken as either 0 or 50 when this factor is 0 we do not recover energy and ec is equal to the energy input when a factor of 50 is used energy recovery is included and ec is lower than with a recovery factor of 0 energy consumption can be presented in many different ways such as energy per volume of diluate produced or energy per unit time alternatively an inverse measure can be used such as energy normalized adsorbed salt hemmatifar et al 2016 in this paper we use the metric of energy per molar quantity of salt removed with unit kj mol 3 energy consumption as function of desalination comparing theory and data our experimental program is based on the cdi stack described in detail in dykstra et al 2016a the stack consists of four cells each cell containing two porous activated carbon electrodes materials methods pacmmtm 203 irvine ca usa a spacer keeps the electrodes apart and allows for fluid flow the salt solution is pumped from a vessel with a volume of 10 l through the cell thereafter passes a conductivity sensor that records a value each second and recirculates back to the vessel the solution in the vessel is purged with n 2 gas to minimize the concentration of dissolved oxygen in solution and thus to minimize the occurrence of faradaic reactions that can result in the reduction of desalination performance during the experiments for more details on the experimental design we refer the reader to s i section 3 the aim of these experiments was to validate the dynamic cdi model as presented in section 2 experimental results are presented in fig 2 as function of desalination δ c which is the decrease in salt concentration of the diluate stream compared to the feed stream averaged over the duration of the desalination step the time period that the device produces diluate i e that the water leaving the cell has a lower salinity than the feed for cv operation δ c increases when we reduce the discharge voltage at the very right v disch 0 in fig 2a b while for cc operation moving to the right data points correspond to higher and higher current densities as discussed we do not use these data to directly come to a conclusion about energy in optimized cc or cv cycles but use these data to validate the dynamic cdi model as fig 2 shows the fit of model to data is reasonable but certainly not perfect though a better fit would have been preferred still for the present work which has the aim to outline a method how to analyze operational modes in cdi the quality of the fit between the model and data is sufficient we should note that to fit the model to the data somewhat unrealistic values had to be used for certain parameters in the model see s i section 2 for the data shown in fig 2 one would perhaps expect that in all cases the water recovery wr is 50 as the charging time was equal to the discharge time both for cc and cv operation indeed fig 3 shows that for most cv data this is the case but fig 3 also shows that for some cv data and all cc data wr is less than 50 thus although the charging time is equal to the discharge time in all experiments we find that the adsorption time which we define as the period when the salt concentration of the effluent is lower than in the feedwater that this period is considerably shorter than the desorption time which is the period when the effluent has a higher salt concentration than in the feedwater this difference in adsorption and desorption time results with constant flow rate in wr 50 thus we cannot simply compare a set of cc and cv experiments for the reasons outlined before first that for a certain operational setting we cannot be sure that we are at the lowest energy for a given desalination objective and second in most cases the desalination objective is different both δ c and wr will be different between the cc and cv data points therefore we use a different approach where the validated cdi model is used to generate many data points of energy use at different values of wr and δ c for the different operational modes as will be discussed in the next section 4 optimizing desalination performance as function of desalination and wr comparing constant voltage and constant current operational modes in section 3 we validated our dynamic model with experimental data and discussed that we use this model to compare the energy consumption ec of cv and cc operational modes in the present section we discuss this methodology in more detail and present the results of the comparison between cv and cc charging in cdi to be able to compare cdi cycles for different operational modes three types of constraints must be the same the flow rate and composition of the inflowing water the cell itself mass of electrodes dimensions and the desalination objective with all of these constraints the same we can analyze whether one mode of operation has a higher energy consumption than another mode for a different input cell or objective the conclusion can be quite different calculations are based on the same input water and cell design as in the experimental and theoretical program discussed above furthermore the calculations are limited to the following conditions one level of inflow salinity single salt solution nacl either cc during charge and discharge or only cv thus no mixed modes and pump rate constant no variation in pump flow rate such as in stop flow mode bouhadana et al 2011 for cv operation four parameters are required to define a cycle charging voltage v ch discharge voltage v dch charging time t ch and discharge time t dch for cc operation again four parameters define a cycle endpoint voltage during charging v up charging current i ch endpoint voltage during discharge v down and discharge current i dch for both cv and cc we discussed in section 3 that with equal charging and discharge times water recovery wr is not necessarily 50 and can be different for each calculation in order to compare cc and cv one should control the desalination objective and thus fix wr at a constant value we make calculations using these four parameters according to the calculation procedure described in box 1 fig 4 shows calculation results for energy consumption ec in cv and cc operational modes for er 0 panel a and er 50 panel b where the latter means that 50 of the energy released during discharge is recovered and is thus subtracted from the energy input to calculate ec results are shown for wr 50 as expected there are many ways to run a cycle to achieve a certain value of δ c and all have a different energy consumption because we are primarily interested in the lowest values of energy for any given δ c we care most about the lower boundary of the calculation results which we present in fig 5 fig 5 shows calculation results not only for wr 50 but also for wr 40 60 and 70 and for each set of calculations we plot the lower boundary of energy consumption to select the datapoints that mark the boundary out of the full cloud of calculation results a well defined procedure is required which we describe in box 2 an important assumption to make this procedure work is that the lower boundary increases concavely upward with δ c now with lower boundaries plotted in fig 5 for different values of wr with and without 50 energy recovery we can compare the energy consumption in cc and cv operation making this comparison we see that without energy recovery our procedure predicts not much difference in energy consumption between the two operational modes however with 50 energy recovery cc shows a 5 15 lower energy consumption than cv this moderate difference between energy consumption in cv and cc operation is in line with recent observations by wang and lin 2018 for membrane cdi one may wonder how fig 5c and d would be with 100 energy recovery instead of 50 in fact calculations with 100 recovery were made but resulted in many lb points and only a very limited number of optlb points this is because with 100 recovery the calculation procedure predicts that we can increase the upper voltage cc and the charging and discharge voltages cv to high values in fact to the maximum values we set because most of the input energy will be fully recovered anyway thus in case we use an energy recovery factor of 100 it was not possible to obtain a sufficient number of data points to reliably construct the lower boundary in an energy vs δ c plot furthermore in our view a recovery factor of 50 is more realistic than of 100 a few studies that describe the development and optimization of a back boost converter for cdi to recover energy during discharge report a maximum recovery factor of 50 alkuran and orabi 2008 kang et al 2016 although other studies also report an efficiency 80 pern et al 2012 and even 100 prieto et al 2014 for the optimal points as plotted in fig 5 we listed in s i section 4 all values for v ch v dch t ch and t dch cv and i ch i dch t ch and v down cc interestingly we find that for cv cycles with optimum desalination performance have a discharge voltage of v disch 0 3 v or higher which is in line with results reported by kim et al 2015 where it was concluded that increasing the discharge voltage from 0 v to 0 3 v results in a higher charge efficiency for cc operation we find a similar result but only for calculations based on 50 energy recovery without recovery there is no clear dependence on the endpoint voltage during discharge finally we analyze why without energy recovery our procedure predicts not much difference in energy consumption between the two modes of operation and why with 50 energy recovery cc consumes less energy than cv to that end for both operational modes we make a detailed calculation of the various contributions to the energy see fig 6 we compare here a cc cycle with a cv cycle and both cycles have the same δ c and wr and without energy recovery have almost the same energy consumption without energy recovery cv ec 89 2 kj mol cc ec 93 4 kj mol with 50 energy recovery cv ec 65 6 kj mol cc ec 56 3 kj mol both cycles are at the lower boundary in fig 5 for both modes of operation we study the energy in the separate elements of the cell the edls donnan and stern potential ionic resistances in spacer and macropores and electronic resistances in cables and current collectors the equations required for this analysis are described in s i section 5 fig 6 first of all shows the energy stored in the stern and donnan layers in the electrodes during charging note how for cv operation the energy stored in the stern layer is much lower than for cc operation cv 56 3 kj mol cc 68 2 kj mol during discharge the energy stored in the stern layer is released again but for the donnan layer not all energy that was stored is again released which can be explained as follows during charging the donnan layer is charged while the salt concentration in the macropores is low resulting in a high donnan potential between macropores and micropores instead during discharge the salt concentration in the macropores is much higher and thus the donnan potential is lower consequently the energy released from the donnan layer during discharge is less than the energy required to charge the layer fig 6 also shows that both during charging and discharge energy is dissipated due to the ionic resistances in the spacer and electrodes ma and due to electronic resistances in cables and current collectors eer comparing cv and cc we observe that the energy dissipation due to resistances is higher in cv than in cc both during charging and discharge which can probably be explained by the high currents directly at the start of a cv charging step and consequently by the low salt concentrations in the spacer and electrodes resulting in a high resistance although the energy dissipation due to resistances is much higher in cv mode than in cc mode we find that the total energy input sum of all bars for end of charging equal to energy consumption in case of 0 energy recovery is slightly lower for cv than for cc as fig 5 shows this is because for cv the stern layer in the edl needs to be charged less to reach the required δ c and wr 56 kj mol for cv vs 68 kj mol for cc finally we like to note that as figs 2 and 3 showed the cdi transport model did not perfectly describe experimental data for all values of δ c the level of fit of the model to the data of course directly impacts the correctness of our observations such as for the relative level of energy consumption in cc and cv operation thus to come to more solid conclusions it is useful to find a cdi model and its parameter settings which describes data more precisely nevertheless for the objective of our work which is to present a method of cdi cycle analysis and energy use the cdi model used has been an essential tool 5 conclusions in this manuscript we presented a methodology to assess the energy consumption of a certain operational mode of cdi operation and we apply this methodology to compare constant current and constant voltage charging in cdi constant voltage cv and constant current cc in this methodology we use a validated cdi model that can be used in both operational modes we define several constraints and parameters describing desalination cycles for both cc and cv and we calculate for a range of parameter combinations the energy consumption with and without 50 energy recovery during discharge water recovery wr and the decrease in salt concentration of the diluate averaged over the salt adsorption period δ c thereafter we plot the lowest values of energy consumption as function of δ c and wr this robust methodology showed that in our example calculation without energy recovery the lowest values of energy consumption of cv and cc operation are approximately the same if 50 of the energy released during discharge can be recovered and reused in cdi cc has a somewhat lower energy consumption than cv the methodology can be extended to analyze mixed modes of operation e g cc charging and cv discharge or vice versa and operation with a water flow rate that has different values during the cycle which can be useful to increase wr furthermore the methodology can be used to find parameter combinations for optimum desalination performance in membrane cdi and in other cell designs it must be noted that the cdi transport model we make use of in our methodology did not perfectly describe experimental data for all values of δ c if the aim is to find exact values for parameter settings of cdi operation to reach the lowest energy consumption at a certain desalination objective then a better fit between data and theory and consequently a better model is required acknowledgement this work was performed in the cooperation framework of wetsus european centre of excellence for sustainable water technology www wetsus eu

19438,resilience has been increasingly pursued in the management of water distribution systems wdss such that a system can adapt to and rapidly recover from potential failures in face of a deep uncertain and unpredictable future topology has been assumed to have a great impact on resilience of wdss and is the basis of many studies on assessing and building resilience however this fundamental assumption has not been justified and requires investigation to address this a novel framework for mapping between resilience performance and network topological attributes is proposed it is applied to wdss here but can be adaptable to other network systems in the framework resilience is comprehensively assessed using stress strain tests which measure system performance on six metrics corresponding to system resistance absorption and restoration capacities six key topological attributes of wdss connectivity efficiency centrality diversity robustness and modularity are studied by mathematical abstraction of wdss as graphs and measured by eight statistical metrics in graph theory the interplay between resilience and topological attributes is revealed by the correlations between their corresponding metrics based on 85 wdss with different sizes and topological features further network variants from a single wds are generated to uncover the value of topological attribute metrics in guiding the extension rehabilitation design of wdss towards resilience results show that only certain aspects of resilience performance i e spatial and temporal scales of failure impacts are strongly influenced by some not all topological attributes i e network connectivity efficiency modularity and centrality metrics for describing the topological attributes of wdss need to be carefully selected for example clustering coefficient is found to be weakly correlated with resilience performance compared to other metrics of network connectivity due to the grid like structures of wdss topological attribute metrics alone are not sufficient to guide the design of resilient wdss and key details such as the location of water sources also need to be considered graphical abstract image 1 keywords correlation graph theory network generation resilience stress strain test topology 1 introduction water distribution systems wdss are critical infrastructures for the safe and secure provision of drinking water and are vital to our society and economics they span over long distances more than 25 of the road length in the u s a awwa 2006 the world factbook 2018 and are subject to various threats e g drastic temperature precipitation water pressure changes contamination power outrage corrosions farmani et al 2005 leuven 2011 yet they are buried underground which hinders timely diagnosis maintenance and repair wds failures are reported to occur regularly 0 21 0 27 pipe breaks mile year kirmeyer et al 1994 awwa 2007 and the associated economic loss was estimated to be 93 198 capita day in the u s a aubuchon and morley 2013 under climate change and urbanisation wdss are becoming increasingly vulnerable to unusual and unforeseeable yet often unavoidable failures amarasinghe 2014 as such conventional risk management that deals with known and quantifiable hazards and aims for failure prevention is no longer sufficient paul et al 2011 butler et al 2016 resilience management is an emerging and complementary concept of anticipating failures and minimising their impacts and a body of research has explored its definition and measurement despite the differences in detailed definitions resilience is widely interpreted as the capacity of a system to resist preparation phase absorb and withstand responding phase and rapidly recover from restoration phase exceptional conditions johansson 2010 butler et al 2016 hosseini et al 2016 as the level of resilience only manifests under disturbances stress strain tests have been used for its assessment by evaluating the performance of the system i e strain when it is subject to varying levels of perturbation i e stress in particular methods that simulate stress by degree of system malfunction are a pragmatic and valuable approach since it is daunting if not impossible to enumerate and represent all threats but the failure modes of infrastructure systems are more easily identifiable doerr and hernandez 2010 chopra et al 2016 porse et al 2016 for example pipe breaks are simulated rather than their causal threat e g water hammer or traffic load on the ground the idea of introducing stress to test the performance of wdss has been widely applied for the evaluation of reliability i e the likelihood of a system functioning properly within a specified period ostfeld et al 2002 gheisi and naser 2014 and in recent years for resilience assessment zhuang et al 2013 shuang et al 2014 klise et al 2017 however the exerted stress is often within a limited low impact range and or is generated based on the probability of failure of components which is unlikely to capture the occurrence of unusual failures and the resulting system performance is usually assessed in a simplistic manner by single performance metrics global resilience analysis gra mugume et al 2015 first proposed for resilience analysis of sewer systems is a form of stress strain test especially suited for network analysis that incorporates random sampling and considers a wide range of failure scenarios including extreme levels of system malfunction diao et al 2016 applied gra to assess resilience of wdss in a detailed manner and performance metrics such as time to strain failure duration and failure magnitude have been used however the rate of change degradation or recovery in system performance which is a key aspect of resilience was not considered and needs to be explicitly measured to understand system absorption and recovery capacities for a deep understanding and building of resilience in wdss it is essential to explore its underlying mechanisms i e the link between system performance and inherent properties such as topological characteristics butler et al 2016 graph theory bondy and murty 1982 is a valuable mathematical tool for the study of network topology geometric representation of connections relations between elements of a system by which a wds is abstracted as a graph of nodes and links and details of the physical system and processes are omitted the graph can be drawn differently e g the position of nodes and length of links can vary as long as the pairwise relations between nodes links are unchanged it has been widely applied in the study of social newman 2002 newman et al 2002 biological rubinov and sporns 2010 gao et al 2016 business hearnshaw and wilson 2013 kim et al 2015 communication albert et al 2000 doerr and hernandez 2010 and transportation chopra et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 networks where topological attributes such as network connectivity centrality the degree to which one node is more central than others and diversity in nodal degree number of links a node has to other nodes are shown to have strong impacts on system resilience however resilience has generally been evaluated in a simplistic manner by single performance indicators moreover most of the investigated networks are non spatial networks where links between nodes represent relations rather than physical connections thus resulting in different topological features compared to water distribution networks e g well connected hubs rarely exist in wdss as such it is questionable if the aforementioned topological attributes are critical for resilient wdss there have been limited topological studies on wdss jacobs and goulter 1989 tricarico et al 2012 yazdani and jeffrey 2012 torres et al 2017 and graph theory has mainly been applied to establish simplified system models for pressure water quality management e g design of district metering areas ferrari et al 2014 wright et al 2014 laucelli et al 2017 reliability assessment e g existence of alternative paths from users to water sources ostfeld 2012 trifunovic 2012 yannopoulos and spiliotis 2013 and vulnerability analysis e g identification of critical pipes diao et al 2014 agathokleous et al 2017 shuang et al 2017 statistical topological metrics for complex networks in graph theory have been used in previous research as surrogate indicators of resilience of wdss yazdani and jeffrey 2011 yazdani et al 2011 perelman et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 pandit and crittenden 2016 however no comprehensive studies have been reported on the interplay between resilience and various topological attributes of wdss and the appropriateness of the topological metrics for resilience assessment is unknown these knowledge gaps need to be addressed so that effective measures can be developed to build resilience into practice the aim of this paper is to propose a comprehensive analysis framework for examining the resilience pattern of wdss against topological characteristics i e the correlations between resilience and topological features it is based on a detailed and systematic assessment of resilience and topological attributes selection of representative wdss and generation of network variants to find out the implications for system design though the framework is employed for and illustrated by the study of wdss in this paper it should be readily applicable to other network systems 2 methodology the proposed framework fig 1 consists of three modules for assessing resilience and topological attributes and their correlations a detailed description is presented as follows 2 1 resilience assessment resilience is assessed using gra mugume et al 2015 diao et al 2016 a method which can be applied for assessment of resilience to any type of system malfunction for example pipe break excess water demand and contaminant intrusion for any specified period in the simulation supported by the hydraulic modelling platform epanet2 u s epa 2000 brief descriptions provided in section s1 of the supporting information a wds is probed by introducing stress e g pipe breakage for three hours starting from a very low level near zero e g breakage of one pipe and measuring the loss in system service that follows at every node i e strain such as quantity or quality of water supplied six metrics are used to describe the resulting strain and represent different aspects of resilience which are introduced later in this section the average or sum of strain metric values at all nodes is used to show the performance of the network when subject to the applied stress a set of simulations are run whereby stress is incrementally increased to the highest level and the strain values incurred are assessed though extreme levels of system malfunction are of very low probability they can happen in certain circumstances e g earthquakes yoo et al 2016 or breakdown of valves causing more pipes to be closed to isolate one multiple pipe malfunction walski 1993 liu et al 2017 and are indeed a distinctive topic of resilience study in contrast to conventional risk management as there are different possible scenarios at each level of stress e g c y x possible scenarios if x out of y pipes break all or a subset of them selected by random sampling if it is time prohibitive to run all scenarios are appraised and the minimum mean and maximum network strain values for each stress magnitude are calculated to produce three stress strain curves as illustrated in fig 1 the area under each curve when stress magnitude is presented as the fraction of pipes in the network failed indicates the resilience of the network to all levels of stress as resilience addresses dynamic system performance under stress i e the ability of the system to resist respond to and recover from failure rather than solely the occurrence of failure strain is represented by the following metrics to explicitly measure system resistance absorption and restoration capacities respectively time to strain failure magnitude and failure rate and recovery rate in addition failure duration and severity despite being lumped indicators are assessed due to their wide application in literature definitions of the six metrics are provided below and illustrated in fig 1 1 time to strain time between the application of stress and the start of service failure i e when the level of service at a node drops below a predefined performance threshold qlos 2 failure duration time taken from the occurrence of service failure triggered by stress to recovery to normal performance 3 failure magnitude the most severe drop in system service at a node following the application of stress 4 failure rate this measures the rate of degradation of system service under stress and is calculated as failure magnitude divided by the time between the start of failure and occurrence of the worst system performance 5 recovery rate this shows the speed of system bouncing back to normal performance after stress and is calculated as failure magnitude divided by the time between the worst performance and return to qlos 6 severity the area between the quality of performance response curve and the qlos line during the period of service failure as illustrated in fig 1 each strain measure defined above is computed for every node the value of which is zero if no failure occurs at a node referred to un failed node hereafter and then summed or averaged to derive the metric value for the whole network severity is obtained by summing severity values at each node across the network as it is in essence a measure of aggregation of failure impacts while the other metrics are calculated by taking mean values as the recovery rate of nodes at the un failed node cannot be assigned a number results for the network are based on average strain values of failed nodes only it is also difficult to assign values of time to strain to un failed nodes as it should be infinite in theory however it is assigned as zero in this study to measure the spatial scale of failure indicative of system resistance capacity as time to strain is found to be very similar close to 1 hr at the failed nodes in the investigated wdss for comparison of results from different networks normalisation of metric failure magnitude failure rate recovery rate and severity values is made if they are affected by the scale of the wds e g in water demand 2 2 topological attribute assessment the topological properties of wdss are characterised by statistical indicators in complex network theory boccaletti et al 2006 which is a new and active research area based on graph theory and statistical physics using this approach a wds is represented mathematically as a graph with nodes vertices e g customers junctions and reservoirs connected by links edges e g pipes pumps and valves mathematically expressed as g v e in which v is the set of nodes with n elements and e is the set of links with m elements giustolisi and savic 2010 hwang and lansey 2017 a 0 1 adjacency matrix a is developed to represent the pairwise relations between nodes links a i j a j i 1 if there is a link connecting node i and node j and is the basis for the calculation of topological attribute metrics based on literature review six attributes connectivity efficiency centrality diversity robustness and modularity are assessed as key topological properties of networks they are mathematical concepts in complex networks and hence should not be confused with those in water engineering for example efficiency refers to how efficient it is if information is to be exchanged in a network rather than energy efficiency for the transportation of water in pipes or efficiency in the use of resources assuming information transmission always follows the shortest path and robustness is the system ability to withstand perturbations under node link removal each attribute is assessed using one or more representative metrics link density algebraic connectivity and clustering coefficient for connectivity average path length for efficiency central point dominance for centrality heterogeneity for diversity spectral gap for robustness and modularity indicator for modularity detailed definitions of the metrics are provided in table s1 some widely used metrics are not employed due to lack of suitability in wdss e g the common tree like branches especially towards the end of a wds make indicators like density of bridges links whose deletion causes disconnection of a graph not as useful and informative as in many other networks also a preliminary analysis is made to examine the correlations between metrics describing the same attribute e g graph radius and average path length both provide a measure of efficiency based on the studied networks so that only one metric is used if two or more metrics are strongly correlated details on the selection of metrics are provided in section s2 despite the intuitive appeal of connectivity it encompasses multiple aspects of system topology such as to what extent and how nodes are connected as such three metrics are chosen to describe the different facets of network connectivity as defined in table s1 link density measures how close the number of links in a network is to the maximum possible number for a given number of nodes algebraic connectivity is strongly correlated with link density r 0 74 based on the 85 wdss used in section 3 1 but is still used here as it is an indicator of structural robustness and failure tolerance against efforts to cut a network into isolated parts also it can distinguish differences in the connectivity of networks with the same number of nodes and links but different ways of connecting the nodes where link density would be the same the clustering coefficient measures network redundancy by the degree to which neighbours form a clique i e two nodes connected to a node are connected to each other more complex mathematical models can be used to represent wds in more detail for example links in a graph can be directed to describe flow directions in pipes and the links and nodes can be weighted to represent characteristics of pipes e g diameter length and nodes e g water demand nodal degree yazdani and jeffrey 2012 undirected and unweighted graphs are sufficient for the calculation of the eight statistical metrics selected for this study however inclusion of directions and weights can be very useful in system design as discussed in section 4 2 2 3 correlation analysis 2 3 1 network generation 1 networks of various sizes and topologies benchmark networks based on existing wdss are used for the correlation analysis however to increase the data set and ensure a more comprehensive analysis many realistic virtual networks have also been developed these are example networks produced by the hydrogen corte and sorensen 2014 model which generates wdss automatically according to a pre defined algorithm with user defined settings for network size and characteristics the virtual networks are generated independently and vary in size total volume of water supply number of pipes and node junctions total length of pipes etc distribution of customers water demands and layout representing the diverse nature of real wdss two example virtual networks networks a and b are shown in fig 1 2 network variants by pipe addition a wds generation model is developed to produce different designs of pipe addition to the same wds by performing a similar correlation analysis between resilience and topology based on the network variants insights can be gained on the appropriateness of using topological attribute metrics as surrogate resilience indicators in guiding the rehabilitation extension of an existing wds as shown in fig 1 networks d 1 and d 2 are variants of network d with two added pipes to generate a network variant by the model two nodes are randomly chosen in the network and a pipe is added if it does not intersect with other pipes in the network as wdss are near planar networks which means pipes usually don t cross without an intersecting node this procedure is repeated until the given number of pipes to be added is reached further constraints can be made on the addition of pipes for a specific network if sufficient information is available on the case study area such as where it is or isn t convenient to lay pipes due to the land use and compatibility interference with existing infrastructures 2 3 2 correlation analysis based on wdss generated in section 2 3 1 the significance of correlations are quantified by the linear correlation coefficient r between each pair of resilience metric r i i 1 5 and topological attribute metric t j j 1 8 described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 recovery rate is excluded from the correlation analysis as the value is based on performance of failed nodes only explained in section 2 1 hence results are not comparable between different wdss 3 case studies 3 1 benchmark and virtual wdss five benchmark wdss net3 obcl 1 d town ky14 and ky3 wds research database 2018 and 80 virtual wdss are used for the correlation analysis the virtual networks are of various sizes covering that of the benchmark wdss as shown in table s2 their topological attribute metrics are calculated and presented in fig 2 along with the layouts of four benchmark wdss obcl 1 is not shown as node coordinate data is not available it can be seen from fig 2 that the topological attributes of the benchmarks largely fall within the value bounds of the virtual networks with only three wdss having larger smaller values on single attribute metrics i e slightly lower central point dominance for ky14 larger heterogeneity for obcl 1 and slightly lower modularity for net3 this suggests that the topological features of the virtual networks are realistic hence they are suitable for this study 3 2 network variants by pipe addition the benchmark network net3 is used to generate network variants due to its relatively small size for validation purposes two sets of 85 wdss consistent with the number of wdss employed in section 3 1 to allow for valid comparison of correlation results with different topologies are developed by randomly adding 5 pipes equivalent to an additional 4 and 10 pipes additional 8 to net3 no further restrictions are applied with regards to where the pipes can be added as no ground information is available on net3 the diameter and roughness coefficient of all added pipes are assumed to be 100 inches and 130 respectively 3 3 failure simulation and gra settings gra is performed on all wdss to evaluate their resilience performance under the same type and all levels of system malfunction mechanical failure due to pipe pump breakage is the single failure type studied in this work but the methodology is readily applicable to other failure types stress is modelled here as pipe pump closure for three peak hours i e the three hour period with the highest sum of water demand at all nodes diao et al 2016 in the predefined period of simulation varying from 24 h to 168 h for different networks representing system malfunction caused by pipe burst leakage or maintenance among others for a wds with m pipes a series of simulations are run to increase the stress level from closure of one pipe to m 1 pipes and the evaluation at each stress level includes all possible scenarios of pipe closures or 600 random samples if c m x is larger than 600 determined by a sensitivity analysis whereby only minor variations in resilience results are observed with larger sample sizes given x pipes are closed by randomly sampling system failure scenarios it is hoped that the worst case extreme scenarios will be captured however this cannot be guaranteed and the influence of targeted attacks failures on resilience pattern should be examined in future studies for the gra on the network variants described in section 3 2 the same set of pipe failure scenarios are used as in the resilience assessment of net3 i e the applied stress ranges from breakage of one pipe to 118 pipes and there are 600 random samples or less if the number of all possible failure scenarios are lower than 600 for each level of stress in each simulation of failure scenario on epanet2 the actual amount of water supplied to a node is determined as a function of nodal pressure as shown in equation s1 wagner et al 1988 based on the demand driven hydraulic model pressure driven hydraulic models of wdss such as epanetpdd morley and tricarico 2014 and wntr klise et al 2017 also includes a package for resilience analysis can be employed in future studies to produce more accurate results on water supply a failure occurs if the water demand at a node is not met by the supply for valid comparison between wdss results of failure magnitude failure rate and recovery rate for each wds are normalised with respect to the average nodal demand and severity results are normalised with respect to the total water demand in the network 3 4 pre analysis for correlation assessment link density algebraic connectivity average path length and modularity are found to be strongly influenced by network size measured by number of nodes with linear correlation coefficients being 0 91 0 59 0 78 and 0 90 respectively as the sizes of the investigated wdss cluster around 100 200 200 and 400 nodes the investigated wdss are divided into four groups with 21 20 21 and 23 wdss respectively according to the network size analysis of the correlations between the topological attribute metrics and resilience metrics is performed for each group separately and the mean correlation coefficient values are used to better understand the relationships anderson et al 1999 the related correlation coefficient values presented in the results section therefore are mean correlation coefficients for the four network groups 4 results and discussion 4 1 resilience patterns identified on benchmark and virtual networks as mentioned earlier recovery rate is excluded from the correlation analysis nevertheless it is found to be strongly correlated with failure magnitude r 0 83 when recalculating failure magnitude of all wdss in the same manner as recovery rate i e omitting un failed nodes this may be because in the investigated failure scenarios recovery largely happens when the pipe malfunction is repaired which is rapid within 1 2 h among all wdss determined by the hydraulic processes in pipes hence failure magnitude is the dominating factor influencing recovery rate of wdss the findings can be different if longer system malfunction is simulated hence recovery at many nodes starts before the pipe malfunctions are fixed and need further studies the correlation results between all topological attribute metrics and five resilience metrics are presented in colour maps in fig 3 for a clear comparison of their relative significance the colour of a grid cell shows the strength of correlation between the topological attribute metric displayed on the left of the corresponding row and the resilience metric shown at the bottom of the corresponding column positive correlation is shown in red and negative correlation in blue and the darker the colour the stronger the correlation those with strong correlations r 0 5 or r 0 5 are marked with s in the corresponding cell results based on the mean minimum and maximum stress strain curves are presented separately in fig 3a to c respectively it can be seen that the correlations based on the maximum stress strain curves are slightly weaker than the other two this may be because wdss can fail with the worst possible results even at very low stress levels due to the lack of connectivity of reservoirs to the main body of the network in most cases hence providing weaker differentiation between systems with different topological features nevertheless the resilience patterns presented in fig 3a to c are very similar therefore the following sections of this work focus only on results obtained from the mean stress strain curves for system resilience as shown in fig 3a link density and modularity show strong correlations with two metrics of system resilience i e time to strain indicator of resistance capacity and failure duration a time related lump indicator of system absorption and restoration capacities this demonstrates that the more connected and less modular a wds is the lower the failure impacts in terms of the spatial and temporal scales of affected nodes the pattern observed between connectivity and resilience here is different from many other types of networks for example higher connectivity is found to boost the spread of diseases in social networks pastor satorras et al 2015 this may be because the failures tested in wdss here are passive results of system malfunction which tend to sprawl to more surrounding nodes if fewer alternative pathways exist for re routing water supply i e there is lower connectivity although modularity is found to be a positive attribute in some systems such as biological or technological networks e g it may be a source of specialization it has different implications for wdss the investigated wdss are found to be most easily segmented into 10 to 20 communities which is much more than the number of reservoirs water tanks available in the networks shown in table s2 given the essential role of water sources for each community to function higher modularity indicates higher vulnerability of communities to disconnection of water supply besides the four pairs of strong correlations as discussed a few other correlations are close to being strong also it is found that the gradient of the stress strain curves an example shown in fig s3 in the supporting information approaches zero under high stress magnitudes hence the differences in resilience of various wdss become smaller if the area under the entire stress strain curve is used for resilience assessment which may mask the interplay between resilience and network topology as such a sensitivity analysis is conducted to re assess the correlations based on the response to a restricted maximum stress magnitude considering maximum values of 1 to 100 with a 1 interval i e using only part of the areas under the stress strain curves for the correlation analysis with topological attribute metrics this produces 100 sets of correlation coefficient values one for every maximum stress magnitude between each pair of resilience and topological attribute metrics which are summarised in boxplots in fig 4 the minimum maximum 25th percentile 75th percentile and median values are shown by the left and right whiskers left and right bounds of the box and the line within the box respectively the results corresponding to a maximum stress magnitude of 100 as shown in fig 3a are identified in fig 4 with red diamonds for comparison fig 4 shows that the correlations between time to strain failure duration and algebraic connectivity average path length central point dominance become strong when certain values of maximum stress levels are used in the derivation of resilience values details on the range of maximum stress levels where strong correlations are observed are presented in table s3 network efficiency described by average path length is greatly affected by connectivity and the existence of long range connections e g water sources are usually located at distant ends of a wds which highlights the importance of connectivity between water sources and user nodes and among the nodes themselves though scale free networks consisting of a star like topology with well connected hubs such as the internet and social networks have very high centrality and are found to be robust to random failures albert et al 2000 the positive correlations between central point dominance and time to strain failure duration under random pipe malfunction suggest that higher centrality tends to decrease the resilience of lattice networks like wdss the clustering coefficient despite being a measure of network connectivity is still only weakly correlated with resilience metrics in the sensitivity analysis this may be because triangular loops which are a key element in calculating the clustering coefficient are not common in grid like wdss yazdani et al 2011 compared to time to strain and failure duration the influence of network topology on other system dynamic related resilience metrics is much weaker as can be seen in fig 4 failure magnitude is strongly correlated with connectivity link density and algebraic connectivity efficiency average path length and modularity under a limited range of maximum stress magnitude around 5 20 as shown in table s3 this shows that the influence of these three topological attributes in mitigating worsening failure magnitude is less evident under higher stress levels as more nodes are failing in the network hence the differences in the average failure magnitude become smaller similar relationships with the topological attribute metrics are observed on severity but the range of maximum stress magnitude showing strong correlations are wider about 5 30 except for the correlation with link density being 1 50 as presented in table s3 in comparison failure rate which measures the dynamic process of performance degradation cannot easily be estimated from a single topological attribute although strong correlations with link density and average path length are observed under a very narrow range of stress levels 7 13 as presented in table s3 spectral gap which is considered an indicator of system robustness against node link removal and has been widely used in prior literature yazdani et al 2011 perelman et al 2015 has the weakest correlations with all resilience metrics as shown in fig 4 this may result from the fact that spectral gap is greatly affected by the existence of bottleneck links i e links that will disconnect a graph into two large connected components if removed estrada 2006 linial 2018 yet their malfunction may not lead to significant drop in service in wdss as there are usually water sources in each big cluster heterogeneity is another key attribute affecting resilience identified in previous studies for example by enhancing the spread of diseases yang et al 2015 or improving ecological system resilience against the extinction of species gao et al 2016 though heterogeneity is negatively correlated with the five resilience metrics among the investigated wdss the correlations are not strong i e 0 5 r 0 5 this may be due to the grid like structures and rare existence of hubs in wdss which result in low heterogeneity values compared to other network systems especially non spatial ones for example the heterogeneity values of the 14 ecological networks investigated in gao et al 2016 range from approximately 5 to 100 while those of the 85 investigated wdss are in the range 0 11 0 34 it is also worth noting that the correlations between resilience metrics and the five topological attribute metrics are weak when only very small maximum stress magnitudes 5 or less are considered this raises an interesting point as in the traditional regime of water system management relatively high probability system malfunctions dealt with are often of low magnitude yet the weak correlations shown here indicate that modifying the topological properties of a system are more likely to enhance system capability under severe system malfunctions rather than events of low magnitude 4 2 resilience patterns identified by network variants the changes in the values of the topological attribute resilience metrics of the two sets of network variants with respect to the original wds are summarised in fig 5 in red and cyan boxplots values of link density are the same for wdss in each set hence are not presented in the figure the trend of change in system topology performance can be determined from the median values and the ranges between the maximum and minimum values and between the 25th percentile and 75th percentile values as shown in fig 5 addition of 5 or 10 links provides an evident improvement in algebraic connectivity maximum 360 and 416 respectively and clustering coefficient maximum 122 and 158 respectively although link density values only increase by 4 and 8 respectively the increase in network efficiency measured by maximum average path length reductions of 28 and 35 respectively and heterogeneity maximum 32 and 44 respectively are also clear although not as great as connectivity spectral gap like the other examined spectral metric algebraic connectivity is very sensitive to link addition and shows the most evident changes yet the direction of change is not predictable as more than 25 of the generated wdss have negative results similarly variation in centrality is obvious but it can increase or decrease depending on where the added links are laid changes in modularity are negligible compared to other topological attribute metrics despite the relatively small variations in resilience results compared with some topological attribute metrics pipe addition is demonstrated to be effective in reducing failure impacts e g time to strain failure duration failure magnitude failure rate and severity can be abated by 33 17 21 22 and 21 respectively by increasing the number of pipes in the system by 4 the benefits are shown to diminish with more pipe additions as the corresponding results are 42 22 34 30 and 34 respectively when the number of pipes in the system is increased by 8 recovery rate and failure magnitude are strongly correlated in both sets of wdss correlation coefficients of 0 95 and 0 98 for sets with 4 and 8 added pipe respectively which is consistent with the findings in section 3 1 it should be noted that the observed trends are not indicative for single cases as there are great overlaps in the results of the two sets of networks hence adding more pipes will not necessarily increase system connectivity efficiency failure impacts unless carefully designed fig 6 shows the comparison between the correlation values based on the two sets of network variants in blue and red lines and the 85 networks in section 3 1 in black lines no correlation results of many wdss are presented in fig 6e as the correlation was not performed between topological attribute metrics and recovery rate in sections 3 1 for reasons explained in sections 2 1 and 2 3 2 results suggest that no strong correlations exist between the topological properties and resilience performance among the two sets of modified wdss these conclusions are unchanged after performing a sensitivity analysis results presented in figs s1 and s2 similar to that in fig 4 where resilience is determined based on partial strain results obtained from the gra the weaker correlations for the sets of modified wdss can be explained by the smaller metric value ranges compared with those of the wdss in section 3 1 especially for the resilience results three wdss with similar average path lengths but different resilience results are shown in fig 7 in the order of decreasing failure impacts many of the pipes added in the wdss in fig 7a and b are of trivial importance while most of the pipes added in the wds in fig 7c are effective in reducing the system vulnerability to failures of trunk mains or decreasing the reliance of nodes on local or nearby water sources this suggests that it is crucial to differentiate water sources from other nodes in analysis for the extension rehabilitation of wdss and it can be misleading if only the topological attribute metrics are used future work can be conducted to explore the potential of modifying the topological metrics e g based on graphs with weights assigned on nodes to highlight the location of water sources for resilience assessment 5 framework application beyond water distribution systems the proposed analytical framework is applicable to other network systems such as sewer systems or even systems in other fields e g electricity distribution networks transportation networks if numerical models are available for detailed resilience assessment of the network systems the method of gra is suitable for any network systems the six attributes examined in this study are key topological aspects of any networks and the recommend metrics can be applied for the quantification of each attribute subject to a correlation analysis as suggested in this work the use of many networks supports reliable statistical analysis of the correlations between the topological attributes and resilience the idea of developing network variants from a single network can be followed in future studies to examine the usefulness of using topological attribute metrics in guiding resilient system design 6 conclusions despite topological attribute metrics having been used in many studies as surrogate resilience indicators for wds management a crucial fundamental question remains to be answered that is does network topology greatly influence the resilience of wdss if yes what topological attributes are key contributing factors to bridge the knowledge gap a novel and logical analytical framework was developed for a deep analysis of their relationships the framework provided a detailed assessment of wds resilience as all key aspects of resilience i e resistance absorption and restoration capacities were considered and measured by stress strain tests the framework also enabled a systematic study of wds topology by a comprehensive review of network attributes and their descriptive metrics the mapping between resilience and topological attributes was achieved by correlation analysis between their descriptive metrics based on a large number of benchmark and virtual wdss the value of the resilience patterns on the rehabilitation extension design of wdss was uncovered by developing network variants from a single wds and conducting similar correlation assessment between resilience and topological attribute metrics the methods and thinking provided in the framework are not specific to wdss hence should be readily adaptable to other networks of environmental and social significance such as drainage and or sewerage systems the resilience patterns identified in wdss are summarised and discussed as follows it is crucial that the concept of resilience is comprehensively understood and assessed before the analysis of its interplay with topology resilience is a term that encompasses multiple aspects of system performance which are too complex to be represented by a single performance indicator for example a trade off was found between absorption and restoration capacities measured by failure magnitude and recovery rate respectively of the investigated wdss under the failure scenarios simulated i e a wds that fails badly is also likely to recover quickly strong correlations were only observed between certain not all metrics of resilience time to strain failure duration and topological attributes connectivity network efficiency and modularity this suggests that topology strongly affects the spatial and temporal scales of failure impacts while other metrics that are closely linked to physical processes and system dynamics i e failure rate failure magnitude recovery rate and severity are influenced to a lesser extent due to the unique characteristics of wdss e g lattice grid like structures and existence of water sources in big clusters some network attributes such as diversity in nodal degree measured by heterogeneity and robustness measured by spectral gap are not critical for wds resilience unlike some other systems reported in literature e g social internet networks ecological systems not all topological attribute metrics are suitable for the description of the topological features of wdss for example clustering coefficient was found to be a poor indicator of connectivity of wdss which can be explained by the uncommon triangular loops in wdss no strong correlations were shown between wds performance and topological attributes at very low stress levels suggesting that the study of topological properties is more meaningful for resilience management than the traditional risk management results suggest that it can be misleading to use topological attribute metrics as surrogate resilience indicators in the design of wdss this is supported by the study on network variants where the extent of value changes in topological attribute metrics were shown to be much larger than resilience metrics subject to pipe additions and weak correlations were found between the values of all topological attribute and resilience metrics performance of the three typical network variants indicated the importance of considering details of a wds e g the location of water resources in system design which was not captured by the statistical topological metrics it should be noted that the resilience patterns identified in this study are only applicable to mechanical failures of wdss the findings are expected to be different for water quality related failures as it is likely that higher connectivity promotes the spread of contaminants and recovery of wdss from contamination would not be as rapid as pipe failures hence the water quality related resilience and its potential conflict with mechanical resilience should be investigated in future research as only random failures are investigated in this paper it is also worth considering targeted attacks in future studies and examining their impacts on resilience nevertheless the resilience patterns revealed from wdss in this paper are different from many other types of networks reported in the literature suggesting the

19438,resilience has been increasingly pursued in the management of water distribution systems wdss such that a system can adapt to and rapidly recover from potential failures in face of a deep uncertain and unpredictable future topology has been assumed to have a great impact on resilience of wdss and is the basis of many studies on assessing and building resilience however this fundamental assumption has not been justified and requires investigation to address this a novel framework for mapping between resilience performance and network topological attributes is proposed it is applied to wdss here but can be adaptable to other network systems in the framework resilience is comprehensively assessed using stress strain tests which measure system performance on six metrics corresponding to system resistance absorption and restoration capacities six key topological attributes of wdss connectivity efficiency centrality diversity robustness and modularity are studied by mathematical abstraction of wdss as graphs and measured by eight statistical metrics in graph theory the interplay between resilience and topological attributes is revealed by the correlations between their corresponding metrics based on 85 wdss with different sizes and topological features further network variants from a single wds are generated to uncover the value of topological attribute metrics in guiding the extension rehabilitation design of wdss towards resilience results show that only certain aspects of resilience performance i e spatial and temporal scales of failure impacts are strongly influenced by some not all topological attributes i e network connectivity efficiency modularity and centrality metrics for describing the topological attributes of wdss need to be carefully selected for example clustering coefficient is found to be weakly correlated with resilience performance compared to other metrics of network connectivity due to the grid like structures of wdss topological attribute metrics alone are not sufficient to guide the design of resilient wdss and key details such as the location of water sources also need to be considered graphical abstract image 1 keywords correlation graph theory network generation resilience stress strain test topology 1 introduction water distribution systems wdss are critical infrastructures for the safe and secure provision of drinking water and are vital to our society and economics they span over long distances more than 25 of the road length in the u s a awwa 2006 the world factbook 2018 and are subject to various threats e g drastic temperature precipitation water pressure changes contamination power outrage corrosions farmani et al 2005 leuven 2011 yet they are buried underground which hinders timely diagnosis maintenance and repair wds failures are reported to occur regularly 0 21 0 27 pipe breaks mile year kirmeyer et al 1994 awwa 2007 and the associated economic loss was estimated to be 93 198 capita day in the u s a aubuchon and morley 2013 under climate change and urbanisation wdss are becoming increasingly vulnerable to unusual and unforeseeable yet often unavoidable failures amarasinghe 2014 as such conventional risk management that deals with known and quantifiable hazards and aims for failure prevention is no longer sufficient paul et al 2011 butler et al 2016 resilience management is an emerging and complementary concept of anticipating failures and minimising their impacts and a body of research has explored its definition and measurement despite the differences in detailed definitions resilience is widely interpreted as the capacity of a system to resist preparation phase absorb and withstand responding phase and rapidly recover from restoration phase exceptional conditions johansson 2010 butler et al 2016 hosseini et al 2016 as the level of resilience only manifests under disturbances stress strain tests have been used for its assessment by evaluating the performance of the system i e strain when it is subject to varying levels of perturbation i e stress in particular methods that simulate stress by degree of system malfunction are a pragmatic and valuable approach since it is daunting if not impossible to enumerate and represent all threats but the failure modes of infrastructure systems are more easily identifiable doerr and hernandez 2010 chopra et al 2016 porse et al 2016 for example pipe breaks are simulated rather than their causal threat e g water hammer or traffic load on the ground the idea of introducing stress to test the performance of wdss has been widely applied for the evaluation of reliability i e the likelihood of a system functioning properly within a specified period ostfeld et al 2002 gheisi and naser 2014 and in recent years for resilience assessment zhuang et al 2013 shuang et al 2014 klise et al 2017 however the exerted stress is often within a limited low impact range and or is generated based on the probability of failure of components which is unlikely to capture the occurrence of unusual failures and the resulting system performance is usually assessed in a simplistic manner by single performance metrics global resilience analysis gra mugume et al 2015 first proposed for resilience analysis of sewer systems is a form of stress strain test especially suited for network analysis that incorporates random sampling and considers a wide range of failure scenarios including extreme levels of system malfunction diao et al 2016 applied gra to assess resilience of wdss in a detailed manner and performance metrics such as time to strain failure duration and failure magnitude have been used however the rate of change degradation or recovery in system performance which is a key aspect of resilience was not considered and needs to be explicitly measured to understand system absorption and recovery capacities for a deep understanding and building of resilience in wdss it is essential to explore its underlying mechanisms i e the link between system performance and inherent properties such as topological characteristics butler et al 2016 graph theory bondy and murty 1982 is a valuable mathematical tool for the study of network topology geometric representation of connections relations between elements of a system by which a wds is abstracted as a graph of nodes and links and details of the physical system and processes are omitted the graph can be drawn differently e g the position of nodes and length of links can vary as long as the pairwise relations between nodes links are unchanged it has been widely applied in the study of social newman 2002 newman et al 2002 biological rubinov and sporns 2010 gao et al 2016 business hearnshaw and wilson 2013 kim et al 2015 communication albert et al 2000 doerr and hernandez 2010 and transportation chopra et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 networks where topological attributes such as network connectivity centrality the degree to which one node is more central than others and diversity in nodal degree number of links a node has to other nodes are shown to have strong impacts on system resilience however resilience has generally been evaluated in a simplistic manner by single performance indicators moreover most of the investigated networks are non spatial networks where links between nodes represent relations rather than physical connections thus resulting in different topological features compared to water distribution networks e g well connected hubs rarely exist in wdss as such it is questionable if the aforementioned topological attributes are critical for resilient wdss there have been limited topological studies on wdss jacobs and goulter 1989 tricarico et al 2012 yazdani and jeffrey 2012 torres et al 2017 and graph theory has mainly been applied to establish simplified system models for pressure water quality management e g design of district metering areas ferrari et al 2014 wright et al 2014 laucelli et al 2017 reliability assessment e g existence of alternative paths from users to water sources ostfeld 2012 trifunovic 2012 yannopoulos and spiliotis 2013 and vulnerability analysis e g identification of critical pipes diao et al 2014 agathokleous et al 2017 shuang et al 2017 statistical topological metrics for complex networks in graph theory have been used in previous research as surrogate indicators of resilience of wdss yazdani and jeffrey 2011 yazdani et al 2011 perelman et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 pandit and crittenden 2016 however no comprehensive studies have been reported on the interplay between resilience and various topological attributes of wdss and the appropriateness of the topological metrics for resilience assessment is unknown these knowledge gaps need to be addressed so that effective measures can be developed to build resilience into practice the aim of this paper is to propose a comprehensive analysis framework for examining the resilience pattern of wdss against topological characteristics i e the correlations between resilience and topological features it is based on a detailed and systematic assessment of resilience and topological attributes selection of representative wdss and generation of network variants to find out the implications for system design though the framework is employed for and illustrated by the study of wdss in this paper it should be readily applicable to other network systems 2 methodology the proposed framework fig 1 consists of three modules for assessing resilience and topological attributes and their correlations a detailed description is presented as follows 2 1 resilience assessment resilience is assessed using gra mugume et al 2015 diao et al 2016 a method which can be applied for assessment of resilience to any type of system malfunction for example pipe break excess water demand and contaminant intrusion for any specified period in the simulation supported by the hydraulic modelling platform epanet2 u s epa 2000 brief descriptions provided in section s1 of the supporting information a wds is probed by introducing stress e g pipe breakage for three hours starting from a very low level near zero e g breakage of one pipe and measuring the loss in system service that follows at every node i e strain such as quantity or quality of water supplied six metrics are used to describe the resulting strain and represent different aspects of resilience which are introduced later in this section the average or sum of strain metric values at all nodes is used to show the performance of the network when subject to the applied stress a set of simulations are run whereby stress is incrementally increased to the highest level and the strain values incurred are assessed though extreme levels of system malfunction are of very low probability they can happen in certain circumstances e g earthquakes yoo et al 2016 or breakdown of valves causing more pipes to be closed to isolate one multiple pipe malfunction walski 1993 liu et al 2017 and are indeed a distinctive topic of resilience study in contrast to conventional risk management as there are different possible scenarios at each level of stress e g c y x possible scenarios if x out of y pipes break all or a subset of them selected by random sampling if it is time prohibitive to run all scenarios are appraised and the minimum mean and maximum network strain values for each stress magnitude are calculated to produce three stress strain curves as illustrated in fig 1 the area under each curve when stress magnitude is presented as the fraction of pipes in the network failed indicates the resilience of the network to all levels of stress as resilience addresses dynamic system performance under stress i e the ability of the system to resist respond to and recover from failure rather than solely the occurrence of failure strain is represented by the following metrics to explicitly measure system resistance absorption and restoration capacities respectively time to strain failure magnitude and failure rate and recovery rate in addition failure duration and severity despite being lumped indicators are assessed due to their wide application in literature definitions of the six metrics are provided below and illustrated in fig 1 1 time to strain time between the application of stress and the start of service failure i e when the level of service at a node drops below a predefined performance threshold qlos 2 failure duration time taken from the occurrence of service failure triggered by stress to recovery to normal performance 3 failure magnitude the most severe drop in system service at a node following the application of stress 4 failure rate this measures the rate of degradation of system service under stress and is calculated as failure magnitude divided by the time between the start of failure and occurrence of the worst system performance 5 recovery rate this shows the speed of system bouncing back to normal performance after stress and is calculated as failure magnitude divided by the time between the worst performance and return to qlos 6 severity the area between the quality of performance response curve and the qlos line during the period of service failure as illustrated in fig 1 each strain measure defined above is computed for every node the value of which is zero if no failure occurs at a node referred to un failed node hereafter and then summed or averaged to derive the metric value for the whole network severity is obtained by summing severity values at each node across the network as it is in essence a measure of aggregation of failure impacts while the other metrics are calculated by taking mean values as the recovery rate of nodes at the un failed node cannot be assigned a number results for the network are based on average strain values of failed nodes only it is also difficult to assign values of time to strain to un failed nodes as it should be infinite in theory however it is assigned as zero in this study to measure the spatial scale of failure indicative of system resistance capacity as time to strain is found to be very similar close to 1 hr at the failed nodes in the investigated wdss for comparison of results from different networks normalisation of metric failure magnitude failure rate recovery rate and severity values is made if they are affected by the scale of the wds e g in water demand 2 2 topological attribute assessment the topological properties of wdss are characterised by statistical indicators in complex network theory boccaletti et al 2006 which is a new and active research area based on graph theory and statistical physics using this approach a wds is represented mathematically as a graph with nodes vertices e g customers junctions and reservoirs connected by links edges e g pipes pumps and valves mathematically expressed as g v e in which v is the set of nodes with n elements and e is the set of links with m elements giustolisi and savic 2010 hwang and lansey 2017 a 0 1 adjacency matrix a is developed to represent the pairwise relations between nodes links a i j a j i 1 if there is a link connecting node i and node j and is the basis for the calculation of topological attribute metrics based on literature review six attributes connectivity efficiency centrality diversity robustness and modularity are assessed as key topological properties of networks they are mathematical concepts in complex networks and hence should not be confused with those in water engineering for example efficiency refers to how efficient it is if information is to be exchanged in a network rather than energy efficiency for the transportation of water in pipes or efficiency in the use of resources assuming information transmission always follows the shortest path and robustness is the system ability to withstand perturbations under node link removal each attribute is assessed using one or more representative metrics link density algebraic connectivity and clustering coefficient for connectivity average path length for efficiency central point dominance for centrality heterogeneity for diversity spectral gap for robustness and modularity indicator for modularity detailed definitions of the metrics are provided in table s1 some widely used metrics are not employed due to lack of suitability in wdss e g the common tree like branches especially towards the end of a wds make indicators like density of bridges links whose deletion causes disconnection of a graph not as useful and informative as in many other networks also a preliminary analysis is made to examine the correlations between metrics describing the same attribute e g graph radius and average path length both provide a measure of efficiency based on the studied networks so that only one metric is used if two or more metrics are strongly correlated details on the selection of metrics are provided in section s2 despite the intuitive appeal of connectivity it encompasses multiple aspects of system topology such as to what extent and how nodes are connected as such three metrics are chosen to describe the different facets of network connectivity as defined in table s1 link density measures how close the number of links in a network is to the maximum possible number for a given number of nodes algebraic connectivity is strongly correlated with link density r 0 74 based on the 85 wdss used in section 3 1 but is still used here as it is an indicator of structural robustness and failure tolerance against efforts to cut a network into isolated parts also it can distinguish differences in the connectivity of networks with the same number of nodes and links but different ways of connecting the nodes where link density would be the same the clustering coefficient measures network redundancy by the degree to which neighbours form a clique i e two nodes connected to a node are connected to each other more complex mathematical models can be used to represent wds in more detail for example links in a graph can be directed to describe flow directions in pipes and the links and nodes can be weighted to represent characteristics of pipes e g diameter length and nodes e g water demand nodal degree yazdani and jeffrey 2012 undirected and unweighted graphs are sufficient for the calculation of the eight statistical metrics selected for this study however inclusion of directions and weights can be very useful in system design as discussed in section 4 2 2 3 correlation analysis 2 3 1 network generation 1 networks of various sizes and topologies benchmark networks based on existing wdss are used for the correlation analysis however to increase the data set and ensure a more comprehensive analysis many realistic virtual networks have also been developed these are example networks produced by the hydrogen corte and sorensen 2014 model which generates wdss automatically according to a pre defined algorithm with user defined settings for network size and characteristics the virtual networks are generated independently and vary in size total volume of water supply number of pipes and node junctions total length of pipes etc distribution of customers water demands and layout representing the diverse nature of real wdss two example virtual networks networks a and b are shown in fig 1 2 network variants by pipe addition a wds generation model is developed to produce different designs of pipe addition to the same wds by performing a similar correlation analysis between resilience and topology based on the network variants insights can be gained on the appropriateness of using topological attribute metrics as surrogate resilience indicators in guiding the rehabilitation extension of an existing wds as shown in fig 1 networks d 1 and d 2 are variants of network d with two added pipes to generate a network variant by the model two nodes are randomly chosen in the network and a pipe is added if it does not intersect with other pipes in the network as wdss are near planar networks which means pipes usually don t cross without an intersecting node this procedure is repeated until the given number of pipes to be added is reached further constraints can be made on the addition of pipes for a specific network if sufficient information is available on the case study area such as where it is or isn t convenient to lay pipes due to the land use and compatibility interference with existing infrastructures 2 3 2 correlation analysis based on wdss generated in section 2 3 1 the significance of correlations are quantified by the linear correlation coefficient r between each pair of resilience metric r i i 1 5 and topological attribute metric t j j 1 8 described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 recovery rate is excluded from the correlation analysis as the value is based on performance of failed nodes only explained in section 2 1 hence results are not comparable between different wdss 3 case studies 3 1 benchmark and virtual wdss five benchmark wdss net3 obcl 1 d town ky14 and ky3 wds research database 2018 and 80 virtual wdss are used for the correlation analysis the virtual networks are of various sizes covering that of the benchmark wdss as shown in table s2 their topological attribute metrics are calculated and presented in fig 2 along with the layouts of four benchmark wdss obcl 1 is not shown as node coordinate data is not available it can be seen from fig 2 that the topological attributes of the benchmarks largely fall within the value bounds of the virtual networks with only three wdss having larger smaller values on single attribute metrics i e slightly lower central point dominance for ky14 larger heterogeneity for obcl 1 and slightly lower modularity for net3 this suggests that the topological features of the virtual networks are realistic hence they are suitable for this study 3 2 network variants by pipe addition the benchmark network net3 is used to generate network variants due to its relatively small size for validation purposes two sets of 85 wdss consistent with the number of wdss employed in section 3 1 to allow for valid comparison of correlation results with different topologies are developed by randomly adding 5 pipes equivalent to an additional 4 and 10 pipes additional 8 to net3 no further restrictions are applied with regards to where the pipes can be added as no ground information is available on net3 the diameter and roughness coefficient of all added pipes are assumed to be 100 inches and 130 respectively 3 3 failure simulation and gra settings gra is performed on all wdss to evaluate their resilience performance under the same type and all levels of system malfunction mechanical failure due to pipe pump breakage is the single failure type studied in this work but the methodology is readily applicable to other failure types stress is modelled here as pipe pump closure for three peak hours i e the three hour period with the highest sum of water demand at all nodes diao et al 2016 in the predefined period of simulation varying from 24 h to 168 h for different networks representing system malfunction caused by pipe burst leakage or maintenance among others for a wds with m pipes a series of simulations are run to increase the stress level from closure of one pipe to m 1 pipes and the evaluation at each stress level includes all possible scenarios of pipe closures or 600 random samples if c m x is larger than 600 determined by a sensitivity analysis whereby only minor variations in resilience results are observed with larger sample sizes given x pipes are closed by randomly sampling system failure scenarios it is hoped that the worst case extreme scenarios will be captured however this cannot be guaranteed and the influence of targeted attacks failures on resilience pattern should be examined in future studies for the gra on the network variants described in section 3 2 the same set of pipe failure scenarios are used as in the resilience assessment of net3 i e the applied stress ranges from breakage of one pipe to 118 pipes and there are 600 random samples or less if the number of all possible failure scenarios are lower than 600 for each level of stress in each simulation of failure scenario on epanet2 the actual amount of water supplied to a node is determined as a function of nodal pressure as shown in equation s1 wagner et al 1988 based on the demand driven hydraulic model pressure driven hydraulic models of wdss such as epanetpdd morley and tricarico 2014 and wntr klise et al 2017 also includes a package for resilience analysis can be employed in future studies to produce more accurate results on water supply a failure occurs if the water demand at a node is not met by the supply for valid comparison between wdss results of failure magnitude failure rate and recovery rate for each wds are normalised with respect to the average nodal demand and severity results are normalised with respect to the total water demand in the network 3 4 pre analysis for correlation assessment link density algebraic connectivity average path length and modularity are found to be strongly influenced by network size measured by number of nodes with linear correlation coefficients being 0 91 0 59 0 78 and 0 90 respectively as the sizes of the investigated wdss cluster around 100 200 200 and 400 nodes the investigated wdss are divided into four groups with 21 20 21 and 23 wdss respectively according to the network size analysis of the correlations between the topological attribute metrics and resilience metrics is performed for each group separately and the mean correlation coefficient values are used to better understand the relationships anderson et al 1999 the related correlation coefficient values presented in the results section therefore are mean correlation coefficients for the four network groups 4 results and discussion 4 1 resilience patterns identified on benchmark and virtual networks as mentioned earlier recovery rate is excluded from the correlation analysis nevertheless it is found to be strongly correlated with failure magnitude r 0 83 when recalculating failure magnitude of all wdss in the same manner as recovery rate i e omitting un failed nodes this may be because in the investigated failure scenarios recovery largely happens when the pipe malfunction is repaired which is rapid within 1 2 h among all wdss determined by the hydraulic processes in pipes hence failure magnitude is the dominating factor influencing recovery rate of wdss the findings can be different if longer system malfunction is simulated hence recovery at many nodes starts before the pipe malfunctions are fixed and need further studies the correlation results between all topological attribute metrics and five resilience metrics are presented in colour maps in fig 3 for a clear comparison of their relative significance the colour of a grid cell shows the strength of correlation between the topological attribute metric displayed on the left of the corresponding row and the resilience metric shown at the bottom of the corresponding column positive correlation is shown in red and negative correlation in blue and the darker the colour the stronger the correlation those with strong correlations r 0 5 or r 0 5 are marked with s in the corresponding cell results based on the mean minimum and maximum stress strain curves are presented separately in fig 3a to c respectively it can be seen that the correlations based on the maximum stress strain curves are slightly weaker than the other two this may be because wdss can fail with the worst possible results even at very low stress levels due to the lack of connectivity of reservoirs to the main body of the network in most cases hence providing weaker differentiation between systems with different topological features nevertheless the resilience patterns presented in fig 3a to c are very similar therefore the following sections of this work focus only on results obtained from the mean stress strain curves for system resilience as shown in fig 3a link density and modularity show strong correlations with two metrics of system resilience i e time to strain indicator of resistance capacity and failure duration a time related lump indicator of system absorption and restoration capacities this demonstrates that the more connected and less modular a wds is the lower the failure impacts in terms of the spatial and temporal scales of affected nodes the pattern observed between connectivity and resilience here is different from many other types of networks for example higher connectivity is found to boost the spread of diseases in social networks pastor satorras et al 2015 this may be because the failures tested in wdss here are passive results of system malfunction which tend to sprawl to more surrounding nodes if fewer alternative pathways exist for re routing water supply i e there is lower connectivity although modularity is found to be a positive attribute in some systems such as biological or technological networks e g it may be a source of specialization it has different implications for wdss the investigated wdss are found to be most easily segmented into 10 to 20 communities which is much more than the number of reservoirs water tanks available in the networks shown in table s2 given the essential role of water sources for each community to function higher modularity indicates higher vulnerability of communities to disconnection of water supply besides the four pairs of strong correlations as discussed a few other correlations are close to being strong also it is found that the gradient of the stress strain curves an example shown in fig s3 in the supporting information approaches zero under high stress magnitudes hence the differences in resilience of various wdss become smaller if the area under the entire stress strain curve is used for resilience assessment which may mask the interplay between resilience and network topology as such a sensitivity analysis is conducted to re assess the correlations based on the response to a restricted maximum stress magnitude considering maximum values of 1 to 100 with a 1 interval i e using only part of the areas under the stress strain curves for the correlation analysis with topological attribute metrics this produces 100 sets of correlation coefficient values one for every maximum stress magnitude between each pair of resilience and topological attribute metrics which are summarised in boxplots in fig 4 the minimum maximum 25th percentile 75th percentile and median values are shown by the left and right whiskers left and right bounds of the box and the line within the box respectively the results corresponding to a maximum stress magnitude of 100 as shown in fig 3a are identified in fig 4 with red diamonds for comparison fig 4 shows that the correlations between time to strain failure duration and algebraic connectivity average path length central point dominance become strong when certain values of maximum stress levels are used in the derivation of resilience values details on the range of maximum stress levels where strong correlations are observed are presented in table s3 network efficiency described by average path length is greatly affected by connectivity and the existence of long range connections e g water sources are usually located at distant ends of a wds which highlights the importance of connectivity between water sources and user nodes and among the nodes themselves though scale free networks consisting of a star like topology with well connected hubs such as the internet and social networks have very high centrality and are found to be robust to random failures albert et al 2000 the positive correlations between central point dominance and time to strain failure duration under random pipe malfunction suggest that higher centrality tends to decrease the resilience of lattice networks like wdss the clustering coefficient despite being a measure of network connectivity is still only weakly correlated with resilience metrics in the sensitivity analysis this may be because triangular loops which are a key element in calculating the clustering coefficient are not common in grid like wdss yazdani et al 2011 compared to time to strain and failure duration the influence of network topology on other system dynamic related resilience metrics is much weaker as can be seen in fig 4 failure magnitude is strongly correlated with connectivity link density and algebraic connectivity efficiency average path length and modularity under a limited range of maximum stress magnitude around 5 20 as shown in table s3 this shows that the influence of these three topological attributes in mitigating worsening failure magnitude is less evident under higher stress levels as more nodes are failing in the network hence the differences in the average failure magnitude become smaller similar relationships with the topological attribute metrics are observed on severity but the range of maximum stress magnitude showing strong correlations are wider about 5 30 except for the correlation with link density being 1 50 as presented in table s3 in comparison failure rate which measures the dynamic process of performance degradation cannot easily be estimated from a single topological attribute although strong correlations with link density and average path length are observed under a very narrow range of stress levels 7 13 as presented in table s3 spectral gap which is considered an indicator of system robustness against node link removal and has been widely used in prior literature yazdani et al 2011 perelman et al 2015 has the weakest correlations with all resilience metrics as shown in fig 4 this may result from the fact that spectral gap is greatly affected by the existence of bottleneck links i e links that will disconnect a graph into two large connected components if removed estrada 2006 linial 2018 yet their malfunction may not lead to significant drop in service in wdss as there are usually water sources in each big cluster heterogeneity is another key attribute affecting resilience identified in previous studies for example by enhancing the spread of diseases yang et al 2015 or improving ecological system resilience against the extinction of species gao et al 2016 though heterogeneity is negatively correlated with the five resilience metrics among the investigated wdss the correlations are not strong i e 0 5 r 0 5 this may be due to the grid like structures and rare existence of hubs in wdss which result in low heterogeneity values compared to other network systems especially non spatial ones for example the heterogeneity values of the 14 ecological networks investigated in gao et al 2016 range from approximately 5 to 100 while those of the 85 investigated wdss are in the range 0 11 0 34 it is also worth noting that the correlations between resilience metrics and the five topological attribute metrics are weak when only very small maximum stress magnitudes 5 or less are considered this raises an interesting point as in the traditional regime of water system management relatively high probability system malfunctions dealt with are often of low magnitude yet the weak correlations shown here indicate that modifying the topological properties of a system are more likely to enhance system capability under severe system malfunctions rather than events of low magnitude 4 2 resilience patterns identified by network variants the changes in the values of the topological attribute resilience metrics of the two sets of network variants with respect to the original wds are summarised in fig 5 in red and cyan boxplots values of link density are the same for wdss in each set hence are not presented in the figure the trend of change in system topology performance can be determined from the median values and the ranges between the maximum and minimum values and between the 25th percentile and 75th percentile values as shown in fig 5 addition of 5 or 10 links provides an evident improvement in algebraic connectivity maximum 360 and 416 respectively and clustering coefficient maximum 122 and 158 respectively although link density values only increase by 4 and 8 respectively the increase in network efficiency measured by maximum average path length reductions of 28 and 35 respectively and heterogeneity maximum 32 and 44 respectively are also clear although not as great as connectivity spectral gap like the other examined spectral metric algebraic connectivity is very sensitive to link addition and shows the most evident changes yet the direction of change is not predictable as more than 25 of the generated wdss have negative results similarly variation in centrality is obvious but it can increase or decrease depending on where the added links are laid changes in modularity are negligible compared to other topological attribute metrics despite the relatively small variations in resilience results compared with some topological attribute metrics pipe addition is demonstrated to be effective in reducing failure impacts e g time to strain failure duration failure magnitude failure rate and severity can be abated by 33 17 21 22 and 21 respectively by increasing the number of pipes in the system by 4 the benefits are shown to diminish with more pipe additions as the corresponding results are 42 22 34 30 and 34 respectively when the number of pipes in the system is increased by 8 recovery rate and failure magnitude are strongly correlated in both sets of wdss correlation coefficients of 0 95 and 0 98 for sets with 4 and 8 added pipe respectively which is consistent with the findings in section 3 1 it should be noted that the observed trends are not indicative for single cases as there are great overlaps in the results of the two sets of networks hence adding more pipes will not necessarily increase system connectivity efficiency failure impacts unless carefully designed fig 6 shows the comparison between the correlation values based on the two sets of network variants in blue and red lines and the 85 networks in section 3 1 in black lines no correlation results of many wdss are presented in fig 6e as the correlation was not performed between topological attribute metrics and recovery rate in sections 3 1 for reasons explained in sections 2 1 and 2 3 2 results suggest that no strong correlations exist between the topological properties and resilience performance among the two sets of modified wdss these conclusions are unchanged after performing a sensitivity analysis results presented in figs s1 and s2 similar to that in fig 4 where resilience is determined based on partial strain results obtained from the gra the weaker correlations for the sets of modified wdss can be explained by the smaller metric value ranges compared with those of the wdss in section 3 1 especially for the resilience results three wdss with similar average path lengths but different resilience results are shown in fig 7 in the order of decreasing failure impacts many of the pipes added in the wdss in fig 7a and b are of trivial importance while most of the pipes added in the wds in fig 7c are effective in reducing the system vulnerability to failures of trunk mains or decreasing the reliance of nodes on local or nearby water sources this suggests that it is crucial to differentiate water sources from other nodes in analysis for the extension rehabilitation of wdss and it can be misleading if only the topological attribute metrics are used future work can be conducted to explore the potential of modifying the topological metrics e g based on graphs with weights assigned on nodes to highlight the location of water sources for resilience assessment 5 framework application beyond water distribution systems the proposed analytical framework is applicable to other network systems such as sewer systems or even systems in other fields e g electricity distribution networks transportation networks if numerical models are available for detailed resilience assessment of the network systems the method of gra is suitable for any network systems the six attributes examined in this study are key topological aspects of any networks and the recommend metrics can be applied for the quantification of each attribute subject to a correlation analysis as suggested in this work the use of many networks supports reliable statistical analysis of the correlations between the topological attributes and resilience the idea of developing network variants from a single network can be followed in future studies to examine the usefulness of using topological attribute metrics in guiding resilient system design 6 conclusions despite topological attribute metrics having been used in many studies as surrogate resilience indicators for wds management a crucial fundamental question remains to be answered that is does network topology greatly influence the resilience of wdss if yes what topological attributes are key contributing factors to bridge the knowledge gap a novel and logical analytical framework was developed for a deep analysis of their relationships the framework provided a detailed assessment of wds resilience as all key aspects of resilience i e resistance absorption and restoration capacities were considered and measured by stress strain tests the framework also enabled a systematic study of wds topology by a comprehensive review of network attributes and their descriptive metrics the mapping between resilience and topological attributes was achieved by correlation analysis between their descriptive metrics based on a large number of benchmark and virtual wdss the value of the resilience patterns on the rehabilitation extension design of wdss was uncovered by developing network variants from a single wds and conducting similar correlation assessment between resilience and topological attribute metrics the methods and thinking provided in the framework are not specific to wdss hence should be readily adaptable to other networks of environmental and social significance such as drainage and or sewerage systems the resilience patterns identified in wdss are summarised and discussed as follows it is crucial that the concept of resilience is comprehensively understood and assessed before the analysis of its interplay with topology resilience is a term that encompasses multiple aspects of system performance which are too complex to be represented by a single performance indicator for example a trade off was found between absorption and restoration capacities measured by failure magnitude and recovery rate respectively of the investigated wdss under the failure scenarios simulated i e a wds that fails badly is also likely to recover quickly strong correlations were only observed between certain not all metrics of resilience time to strain failure duration and topological attributes connectivity network efficiency and modularity this suggests that topology strongly affects the spatial and temporal scales of failure impacts while other metrics that are closely linked to physical processes and system dynamics i e failure rate failure magnitude recovery rate and severity are influenced to a lesser extent due to the unique characteristics of wdss e g lattice grid like structures and existence of water sources in big clusters some network attributes such as diversity in nodal degree measured by heterogeneity and robustness measured by spectral gap are not critical for wds resilience unlike some other systems reported in literature e g social internet networks ecological systems not all topological attribute metrics are suitable for the description of the topological features of wdss for example clustering coefficient was found to be a poor indicator of connectivity of wdss which can be explained by the uncommon triangular loops in wdss no strong correlations were shown between wds performance and topological attributes at very low stress levels suggesting that the study of topological properties is more meaningful for resilience management than the traditional risk management results suggest that it can be misleading to use topological attribute metrics as surrogate resilience indicators in the design of wdss this is supported by the study on network variants where the extent of value changes in topological attribute metrics were shown to be much larger than resilience metrics subject to pipe additions and weak correlations were found between the values of all topological attribute and resilience metrics performance of the three typical network variants indicated the importance of considering details of a wds e g the location of water resources in system design which was not captured by the statistical topological metrics it should be noted that the resilience patterns identified in this study are only applicable to mechanical failures of wdss the findings are expected to be different for water quality related failures as it is likely that higher connectivity promotes the spread of contaminants and recovery of wdss from contamination would not be as rapid as pipe failures hence the water quality related resilience and its potential conflict with mechanical resilience should be investigated in future research as only random failures are investigated in this paper it is also worth considering targeted attacks in future studies and examining their impacts on resilience nevertheless the resilience patterns revealed from wdss in this paper are different from many other types of networks reported in the literature suggesting the

19439,the low yield of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox biomass has attracted great attention because of its difficulty to be abundantly enriched patterns of substrate supply greatly influence microbial metabolism and behavior the present study proposed that low nitrogen strength was beneficial to anammox biomass yield and nitrogen removal when comparing a membrane bioreactor mbr operated at low nitrogen strength with short hydraulic retention time hrt r low influent fixed at 100 mg n l 1 and one operated at high nitrogen strength with long hrt r stepwise influent 100 700 mg n l 1 different nitrite concentrations in the two mbrs would indicate discrepant environments and inevitably resulted in the discrepant microbial responses for anammox community in particular we found that at low nitrogen strength increased activities of purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways provided more abundant nucleic acids for bacterial proliferation more active reaction of lipid and protein synthesis favored the synthesis of cellular structure importantly the metabolism of cheaper amino acids was more active under low nitrogen strength which was coupled with higher metabolic flux and potentially more active exchange of costly amino acids as public goods in this way more energy could be saved and applied to biomass yield higher active bacterial diversity and more positive interactions among bacterial species in r low further favored biomass yield and nitrogen removal the present study highlighted the significant effect of substrate supply patterns on anammox which is meaningful to overcome the current bottleneck of deficient anammox biomass for application in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox 16s rrna transcript metabolomics nitrogen

continuous supply of low nitrogen nutrients tang et al 2011 tsushima et al 2007a 2007b although this phenomenon has been shown previously a metabolomic view of whether or how low nitrogen strength

effect of growth with excess substrates and of energy limited growth is dramatic first threshold concentrations for microbial growth and utilization of carbon substrates have frequently been studied in pure and mixed culture systems alexander 1994 egli 1995 such threshold concentrations for growth of pure cultures with a single substrate typically appear to be in the range of 1 100 μg l 1 it was assumed that most of the free living microorganisms were in a dormant state and only those attached to or in close vicinity of substrates were metabolically active and growing jannasch 1967 second the restricted availability of nutrient sources is very common for bacteria in oligotrophic waters under such hunger situations bacteria would need express as many of their transporters and enzymes of

different nitrogen strengths two identical anammox membrane bioreactors mbrs were operated for two months we utilized 16s rna transcript sequencing and metabolomics to explore the responses of the metabolically active community and their metabolism to high and low nitrogen strength moreover we further utilized the pathway activity profiling papi algorithm to calculate metabolic pathway activities based on the metabolomics results and thus determine the potential microbial behaviors under different nitrogen strengths the present study provided a meaningful insight into the metabolic effect of nutrient supply on anammox biomass yield and performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr operation two identical mbrs r stepwise and r low with a working volume of 5 0 l equipped with poly vinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membranes were operated as different strategies both mbrs were inoculated with 0 23 gvss l 1 anammox consortia dominated with candidatus jettenia caeni guo et al 2017 the unchangeable hydraulic retention time hrt of r stepwise was set as 36 h and the nitrogen load increased regularly by increasing influent ammonium nh4 and nitrite no2 concentrations when no2 n in effluent was below 10 mg n l 1 for r low the nitrogen load was gradually increased by decreasing the hrt whilst keeping influent nitrogen concentration at 50 mg no2 n l 1 and 50 mg nh4 n l 1 the medium solution used in the mbrs mainly consisted of ammonium and nitrite in the form of nh4 2so4 and nano2 respectively the detailed composition of the trace mineral media has been described previously by van de graaf 1996 and is shown in supplementary materials and methods the ph of the mbrs was not controlled but it was always within the range of 7 5 8 0 and the temperature was maintained at 37 1 c the mbrs were flushed with a gas mixture of n2 co2 95 5 to maintain anaerobic conditions the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were measured with uv visible spectrophotometry uv 1750 shimadzu every two days according to the standard methods from the american public health association apha 1998 bacteria samples were taken from the mbrs every two weeks for the determination of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides and their sums eps and intracellular heme c content at day of 60 anammox biomass measurements were taken for determination of anammox activities of the two mbrs dna and rna extraction and metabolite extraction 2 2 eps extraction and chemical analysis eps was extracted using the cation exchange resin method proposed by hou et al 2015 the polysaccharides and proteins in the eps were determined using the anthrone method with glucose as the standard loewus 2002 and the bicinchoninic acid bca assay osnes et al 2009 respectively each was performed in triplicate to obtain the average value 2 3 heme c analysis heme c content was determined based on the protocols described by sinclair et al 2001 briefly pyridine in alkali replaced the nitrogen ligands from the protein bound heme and the resultant heme c was quantified by calculating the difference between spectra of the reduced sodium dithionite crystals and oxidized potassium ferricyanide compounds the heme c concentration was calculated based on the extinction coefficient of 23 97 mm cm 1 for the difference in absorption between the peak at 550 nm and the trough at 535 nm the absorption spectrum was analyzed by uv visible spectrophotometry uv 1750 shimadzu in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm 2 4 16s rrna transcript sequencing total genomic dna was isolated from each

sequences from miseq sequencing were processed by filtering the sequences with ns or lengths shorter than 200 bp or average quality scores less than 25 using qiime v 1 7 0 caporaso et al 2010 and uparse pipeline edgar 2013 the remaining sequences were clustered according to the similarity level and statistical analysis of biological information under a 97 similarity level for operational taxonomic unites otus the 16s rrna gene sequences and transcript sequences from miseq sequencing have been deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession number srp132025 and srp132023 respectively 2 5 lc ms based metabolomic analysis the anammox biomass were harvested at 6000 g at 4 c for 3 min washed with 1 pbs for three times quenched in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c immediately metabolite samples were resuspended in 1 5 ml of cold ultrapure water 4 c and immediately sonicated using a tip sonicator on ice 3 s intervals between 3 s pulses 30 min 195 w scientz jy 92 iin 6 ml of methanol previously cooled at 80 c were subsequently added to the samples then the samples were stored at 80 c for 2 h to precipitate the cellular proteins after centrifugation 20 min at 10 000 g the supernatants were collected and evaporated until dryness at room temperature under a gentle steam of nitrogen gas the residues were prepared for intracellular metabolite determination using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms all tests were repeated three times the precipitate bacterial proteins after c di gmp extraction were harvested and then dissolved with 1 ml aliquots of 0 1 m naoh heated at 95 c for 15 min and conducted for the protein determination with the bca method osnes et al 2009 untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed using q exactive orbitrap thermo ca first 1 μl of supernatant was loaded on a normal phase chromatography column and the sample was eluted to an orbitrap mass spectrometer with 50 acn containing 10 mm ammonium formate as the eluent the data in the mass range 70 1050 m z were acquired using data dependent msms acquisition the full scan and fragment spectra were collected at a resolution of 70 000 and 17 500 respectively the source parameters were as follows spray voltage 3000 v capillary temperature 320 c heater temperature 300 c sheath gas flow rate 35 and auxiliary gas flow rate 10 metabolite identification was based on a tracefinder search with a home built database containing 740 compounds 2 6 metabolic pathway activity profiling metabolic pathway activity analysis using the papi package was undertaken to compare activities using the normalized and transformed metabolite data following the methods described in aggio et al 2010 briefly using the normalized abundance data for each treatment as the input the papi package calculated activity scores of individual pathways from the kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genomes kegg database these activity scores were based on the relative changes in compounds treatment vs control associated with each pathway of interest this algorithm is based on two main assumptions i if a given metabolic pathway is more active in a given condition a larger number of metabolic intermediates from that pathway is likely to be detected by metabolomics and ii the greater the activity of a metabolic pathway the lower the abundance of the metabolic intermediates from that pathway because the metabolic flux throughout the pathway is expected to be higher aggio et al 2010 the resulting activity scores therefore serves as an indicator of the likelihood that a pathway is active within a cell or organism under a given condition without the requirement for absolute quantitation independent sample t tests one tailed were applied to test for differences among activity scores between treatment groups with equal variance assumed 2 7 data analysis student s t tests were conducted using pasw spss version 18 0 to test the significance and differences between various results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant prior to analysis data sets of 16s rrna transcripts sequencing results as percentage abundance format were normalized by pareto scaling the analysis was carried out using r as for the metabolomics analysis intensity data files were imported into the web based program metaboanalyst for the statistical univariate and multivaritate analysis http www metaboanalyst ca xia and wishart 2016 mesorhizobium loti was chosen as reference species in kegg database for pathway analysis features that vary significantly between the two samples sets were evaluated by univariate statistical analysis and significance was defined as 2 fold change with p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 higher nitrogen removal rates nrr and biomass yield under low nitrogen strength the performances of the mbrs with different operational strategies r stepwise gradually increasing influent concentrations 100 700 mg n l 1 with unchangeable hrt r low gradually decreasing hrt with unchangeable lower influent concentrations 100 mg n l 1 are shown in fig 1 two identical mbrs were operated with the same amounts of original anammox consortia importantly a higher bomass growth was obtained in r low at the end of the process the biomass of r low was 1 56 times greater than that of r stepwise r low vs r stepwise 10 58 vs 6 77 gvss l 1 table 1 indicating the multiplied higher biomass yield in r low during operation of the mbrs total nrrs presented increasing trends for both strategies during the initial phase for 19 days the nrr of r stepwise was slightly higher than r low which was likely because the steady hrt of r stepwise contributed to a more stable environment for anammox biomass especially when the mbrs were originally established after the initial phase the nrr of r low showed a strong increasing trend from 0 25 to 1 51 kg n m 3 d 1 whereas the nrr of r stepwise presented only a slight increase from 0 21 to 0 36 kg n m 3 d 1 consequently at the end of the mbr operation day 60 the nrr of r low was 4 25 times higher than that of r stepwise fig 1c the no2 concentrations of bulk liquid in the mbrs were 55 mg l 1 r stepwise and 13 mg l 1 r low at day 60 the specific activities of anammox biomass at the end of the mbr development were analyzed in situ which showed a relatively higher anammox activity table 1 accordingly higher values of 0 14 kg n kgvss 1 d 1 were detected in r low when r low presented a significantly high nrr of 1 51 kg n m 3 d 1 to determine the difference of nitrogen transformation functional gene activities under different nitrogen concentrations real time reverse transcription pcr qrt pcr detected hzsa based on batch assays details in supplementary data significantly higher transcription level of hzsa was found in relatively lower nitrogen concentrations fig 1d the high activity was an important factor leading to a higher biomass growth and concurrently higher nrr of the mbr 3 2 biomass characteristics 3 2 1 higher levels of eps under low nitrogen strength in the present study eps were determined during the operation of mbrs as shown in fig 2 a similar overall trends of eps components changes are shown an obvious decline appeared at the beginning of the operation which was probably due to adaptation to the new environments for anammox biomass during the initial stage day 15 vs day 0 fig 2a subsequently eps contents of both r stepwise and r low increased with increasing nrr when the nrr of r low surpassed r stepwise the eps components especially for extracellular proteins of r low were significantly higher than r stepwise t tests p 0 05 for all tests after day 15 fig 2a at the end of the mbr operation the eps components increased to the peak during the operational period with significant discrepancy between the two mbrs proteins 172 73 7 25 vs 142 88 8 24 mg gvss 1 p 0 01 sums 189 69 7 26 vs 161 18 8 10 mg gvss 1 p 0 01 t tests 3 2 2 faster increase in heme c content under low nitrogen strength the heme c contents of mbrs with different strategies were investigated as shown in fig 2b the heme c levels obviously increased with increasing nrr the heme c content was 0 90 0 07 mmol gvss 1 at the initial point for both mbrs and then significantly increased to 3 81 0 17 mmol gvss 1 for r stepwise and 4 15 0 03 mmol gvss 1 for r low at the end of the mbr operation day 60 additionally during the loading increase period the heme c levels of r low were significantly higher than that of r stepwise day 45 p 0 0334 day 60 p 0 0238 t tests in addition the color of the high load anammox sludge was uniquely carmine because of the presence of heme c as evident from fig s1 the carmine color dominated in r low at day 60 3 3 metabolically active community structure in response to different nitrogen strength a 16s rrna data set was generated from reverse transcribed rna to provide insight into the discrepancy in the metabolically active community structure in response to different feed strategies to compare community structures a scatter plot based on principal component analysis pca scores were obtained from the sequences at otu levels with 97 similarity fig 3 a samples from the groups separated clearly indicating an obvious difference of the community compositions between the two mbrs this was also observed by hierarchical clustering performed using the community data based on phylum level fig 3b approximately 99 of the metabolically active community abundance was classified into 10 phyla of which planctomycetes was the most abundant phylum in all samples accounting for 45 8 r stepwise and 38 0 r low on average fig 3c which showed differences close to significance p value 0 055 t tests in this phylum between two groups other dominant phyla 1 in abundance were proteobacteria chloroflexi and chlorobi fig 3c a detailed overview of individual profiles of each 16s rrna transcript sequencing sample is presented at the phylum level fig 3d in the present study the dominant phyla including proteobacteria chloroflexi and chlorobi showed significant differences between groups fig 3c higher abundances of proteobacteria and chlorobi were detected in r low than in r stepwise p value 0 012 and 0 016 respectively t tests whereas lower abundance of chloroflexi was observed in r low p value 0 026 t tests detailed abundances and significances of other phyla are summarized in table s1 a phylogenetic tree based on the 16s rrna sequences of otus was inferred as shown in fig 4 a total of 18 otus with greater than 1 abundance at least within one sample were emphasized of which the majority of members were shown to be significantly higher in r low samples than in r stepwise samples details are shown in table s2 significant increases in abundance were found in r low for example otu 76 within genus of vogesella 94 of identity with v alkaliphila 493 60 fold change p value 0 020 t tests otu 161 within genus nitrosomonas with n europaea closest identity of 96 otu138 identity of 99 to mesorhizobium sp m3 otu130 identity of 95 to ignavibacterium album and otu223 identity of 99 to hyphomicrobium aestuarii the relative abundance of otu 128 with the closest relative to comamonas sp rs m7pp2013 identity of 99 was also significantly higher than in r stepwise 107 28 fold change p value 0 014 t tests 3 4 discrepant metabolic pathway activities under different nitrogen strength 3 4 1 alterations in metabolite profiles and free metabolite pools in the present study a lc ms based metabolomics analysis of the samples harvested on the final day of operation was performed to analyze the microbiota functional status in total 288 metabolites were detected and are summarized in supplementary data s1 marked alterations to free metabolite pools collections of all the cellular free metabolites were observed in each sample in response to different nitrogen strengths which was apparent in the spatial separation of treatment groups in the partial least squares discriminate analysis pls da plot in the first three dimensions fig 5 a the differentiation between the two mbrs was also observed by hierarchical clustering performed using the intensity of the detected metabolites in each sample fig s5a in the volcano plot metabolites that increased or decreased by twofold or more and had a p 0 05 are shown in red fig s5b in total 189 metabolites with significant differences were found of which increased levels of 89 metabolites were detected in r low samples and the remainder 100 metabolites were higher in r stepwise samples for individual metabolites variable importance of projection vip scores were used to rank the contribution of metabolites to the discrimination between r stepwise and r low metabolomics groups which are based on the weighed coefficients of the pls da model fig 5b most notably in the r low sample large accumulations of cyclic nucleotide second messengers cyclic amp camp 105 7 fold up change p value 0 0001 t tests and cyclic gmp cgmp 41 2 fold up change p value 0 0001 t tests occurred fig 5b these were coupled to an accumulation in pools of intermediates including xmp xanthosine monophosphate agmatine d ribose 5 phosphate d ribulose 5 phosphate and p hydroxyphenylacetic acid for r low in contrast when comparing to r stepwise decreases in pools of multiple compounds were found in r low including nad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 44 2 fold down change p value 0 0001 t tests myristic acid uridine 5 diphosphate and other intermediates from nucleic acid metabolism like dcdp deoxycytidine diphosphate 10 1 fold down change p value 0 0001 t tests and dump deoxyuridine monophosphate 9 8 fold down change p value 0 0001 t tests in particular an overall decline in pools of amino acids was found in r low samples 17 out of 20 essential amino acids fig 5c 3 4 2 metabolic pathway analysis to gain insight into the metabolic differences between the two mbrs metabolic pathway activities were calculated based on the metabolome data using metaboanalyst online programming xia and wishart 2016 and the papi algorithm see materials and methods fig 6 from the results of metaboanalyst five pathways with the most significant effect for the discrimination of the two sets of samples impact 0 6 and log p value 5 are shown in fig 6 interestingly of the five pathways above four pathways were concerned with amino acid metabolism which are alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism phenylalanine metabolism arginine and proline metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism the fifth one was the pyrimidine metabolism pathway pathway activity calculated from papi was useful to support and further explore the results from metaboanalyst overall 61 pathways were analyzed of which 27 pathways with significantly different activity levels were discovered in pairwise comparisons p 0 05 t tests between the two sample sets fig 6b we first found that the predicted amino acid metabolism pathway activities were dramatically different for r low the activities of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis were significantly higher than r stepwise r low r stepwise by contrast the activities of arginine and proline metabolism phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were significantly lower r low r stepwise additionally the pathway nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism concerning the energy metabolism and pathway ether lipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid concerning the lipid metabolism for r low presented significantly higher activities interestingly opposite trends of nucleotide metabolism were estimated increase in activity of pyrimidine metabolism for r low was coupled with a reduction in activity associated with purine metabolism fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 increased anammox metabolic activity and energy supply in low nitrogen strength nutrient supply has a great influence on bacterial growth and metabolism polz and cordero 2016 roller et al 2016 although many previous studies have reported that the anammox process is suitable for the treatment of ammonium rich wastewater ganigué et al 2009 kartal et al 2010 van dongen et al 2001 we found that substrate supply with low concentrations was more beneficial for growth and anammox activity of anammox biomass the present study underlined the metabolic characteristics and community behaviors to explore the high anammox biomass yield and anammox performance under low nitrogen strength these attempts undoubtedly improved our understanding of the metabolic response to different substrate supply strategies for anammox consortia for the purpose of exploring whether the concentration of substrate was a critical factor responsible for different anammox activities of the two mbrs or not gene hzsa transcription was detected because of the quick responses of mrna levels to changes in environmental conditions ali et al 2014 feng et al 2018 park et al 2010 wang et al 2016 higher in situ anammox activity was found in r low at day 60 which was coupled with higher level of hzsa transcripts from the qrt pcr results fig 1d hydrazine synthase hzs is an important enzyme in the hypothetical metabolic pathway of anammox bacteria for nitrogen transformation in which the hzs pathway produces hydrazine by combining ammonium with nitric oxide and hydrazine is oxidized to dinitrogen gas kartal et al 2011 the higher transcript levels of gene hzsa indicated potential higher levels of nitrogen transformation the results of the qrt pcr seemed contradictory to the results that higher hzsa mrna levels were consistent with higher no2 concentrations under no2 inhibition as discussed in wang et al 2016 in which the higher transcription levels of functional genes were likely a stress response to detoxify no2 when the bacteria were subjected to no2 inhibition however closer analysis showed that the substrate concentrations used in batch assays were 50 and 15 mg no2 n l 1 which are lower than the inhibition threshold jin et al 2012 therefore when under the relatively suitable conditions with no inhibition for anammox bacteria the lower substrate concentrations would induce higher anammox activity plus at day 60 the water exchange ratios were defined as the volumes of water exchange per hour and calculated as 0 14 l h 1 for r stepwise and 5 l h 1 for r low respectively the external mass transfer was enhanced at a higher flow rate leitao et al 2006 nicolella et al 2000 zaiat et al 1996 meanwhile some self inhibitory by products such as dissolved organic carbon derived from anammox mbrs could be washed out at shorter hrts tang et al 2010 tsushima et al 2007a metabolomics provided further insight into the more active anammox consortia under low nitrogen strength abundant energy is an essential factor for microorganisms to perform more efficient work we found that more energetic status was achieved in r low than in r stepwise a dramatically lower level of nad in r low was detected which indicated more active metabolic transition and flux for nad participated pathways of which the higher pathway activities of nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism in r low were estimated by papi fig 6 further the overall higher activity could also be reflected by the results of the heme c content heme c can serve as a redox site for intramolecular or intermolecular electron transfer reactions or both and indirectly reflects the cytochrome c levels bowman and bren 2008 fuerst 2005 van niftrik et al 2008 therefore the augmentation of heme c implied an increase in cytochrome c which would further indicate the enhancement of electron transfer during the anammox process when combining greater levels of heme c and a more favorable environment for anammox a higher anammox activity and nrr could be expected 4 2 metabolic evidence for increased biomass yield at low nitrogen strength activated purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways were likely linked to the active levels of dna or rna synthesis metabolism which were responsible for higher levels of growth or transcription in r low as the papi results showed in the r low mbr up regulated status was determined in pyrimidine metabolism pathways fig 6b which was also a more significant pathway for the discrimination of r stepwise and r low as shown in fig 6a this result indicated that more nucleic acids could be supplied from higher activity of pyrimidine metabolism however it should be noted that purine metabolism activity was lower in r low fig 6b which might seem contradictory to a greater demand of nucleic acids for bacterial growth a closer study of papi revealed that when a pathway appears as being active it does not mean that the whole pathway is active but rather specific reactions within that pathway are occurring aggio et al 2010 as fig s6 shows the intermediates located upstream of dna synthesis were found in overall lower levels which suggested that more active metabolic flux occurred during the process of dna synthesis here substantially higher levels of cellular nucleic acids were the essential molecule evidence for more rapid bacterial growth under low nitrogen strength the more active state of lipid and protein synthesis promoted the construction of cellular structure at low nitrogen strength inspired by a dramatically lower level of myristic acid in r low fig 5 we found that it could react with glycerol to form lipids required for the cellular membrane structure villas bôas et al 2005 its lower level revealed that the lipid formation reaction was more active in r low than in r stepwise additionally increases in activities of other lipid metabolism pathways ether lipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid were estimated by papi in r low fig 6 which also contributed to the more active lipid synthesis as for protein synthesis although there was no direct evidence to support the process overall lower levels in pools of amino acids found in r low samples 17 out of 20 essential amino acids fig 5c could be an indirect signal that a higher consumption of amino acids occurred in r low than in r stepwise which was likely for protein synthesis this was supported by the fact that higher activity of pathway aminoacyl trna biosynthesis was calculated in r low samples which indicated higher activity of protein synthesis because the aminoacyl trna together with some elongation factors delivered the amino acids to the ribosome for incorporation into the polypeptide chain that was being produced berg et al 2006 in addition protein is an abundant macromolecule in bacterial cells it is expensive to make proteins 50 60 of adenosine triphosphate atp is used to polymerize amino acids into protein during balanced growth stouthamer 1973 and thus a high energy supply is necessary a more energetic status was found in r low which could be identified to be more competent to provide energy for protein synthesis and benefit higher levels of biomass yield 4 3 strategies of amino acids utilization under different nitrogen strength based on the results from the metaboanalyst online programming amino acid metabolism pathways had the most significant impact on the discrimination between r stepwise and r low indicating that the strategies of amino acid utilization for anammox community under different nitrogen strength were different according to papi higher activities of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis were shown for r low samples fig 6 in contrast the activities of arginine and proline metabolism phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were significantly lower r low r stepwise fig 6 when we analyzed amino acids with the metabolic cost of amino acid biosynthesis based on values reported by akashi and gojobori 2002 higher pathway activities of relatively cheaper amino acids e g alanine aspartate glutamate valine and leucine biosynthesis were found in r low whereas relatively costly amino acids e g phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan were found in r stepwise this phenomenon likely occurred because bacteria in r low preferred to utilize the cheaper amino acids and members in r stepwise were more inclined to use the costly amino acids for metabolism to determine the possible reason underlying the phenomenon it was deduced that different survival strategies were adopted by anammox consortia in different mbrs under different nitrogen strength as discussed in section 4 1 a more favorable environment was created in r low which was more suitable for bacterial to live therefore more bacteria were activated in r low than r stepwise and were more likely to adopt specific strategies to guarantee their own population success in bacterial growth this phenomenon has been found and discussed previously for pure cultures and natural environment polz and cordero 2016 roller et al 2016 based on this strategy cheaper amino acids would be an ideal source of protein synthesis energy generation and or any other metabolic pathways lawson et al 2017 therefore this could be the possible reason for the higher activity of pathways of cheaper amino acid biosynthesis and their metabolic flux for r low in addition the costly amino acids biosynthesis activity in r low was lower than in r stepwise and at the same time there were lower levels of costly amino acids in r low this indicated that bacteria in r low could more likely obtain these costly amino acids by trading among the anammox community lawson et al 2017 during that process the costly amino acids acted as public goods to be used by the community members embree et al 2015 amino acid biosynthesis is an energy intensive process akashi and gojobori 2002 embree et al 2015 and supplementation by bacteria might enable microbes to focus their metabolism on the uptake of reducing equivalents rather than biosynthesis the luxury of amino acid supplementation would ease the energetic burden on nitrogen transition that in turn would allow the entire community to benefit under low nitrogen strength in summary the higher metabolic flux of cheaper amino acids and strategy of costly amino acids exchange for anammox consortia in r low benefited the faster growth and more active metabolism under low nitrogen strength 4 4 more positive bacterial interactions under low nitrogen strength low nitrogen strength created a more favorable environment for the anammox community no2 supply is one of the most critical aspects in the anammox process as it is the electron acceptor in the process undertaken by anammox bacteria on the contrary it is also a potential toxic compound for other bacteria in the anammox community rowe et al 1979 weon et al 2002 therefore lower levels of no2 could be responsible for the favorable environment created under low nitrogen strength this was reflected by the higher abundance of these members and a greater diversity in samples from r low table 1 under such favorable conditions in r low the interactions between anammox bacteria and the species with functions complementary to anammox bacteria were found to be potentially more active for example anammox bacteria could provide some useful metabolites for other species correspondingly some species like aob could provide nitrite for anammox species and heterotrophic bacteria could degrade the organic molecules which was benefit for anammox bacteria when these species showed more metabolically active in abundance figs 3 and 4 more positive interactions could be expected in detail community member otu138 belonged to genus mesorhizobium mesorhizobium is not only considered to be a nitrogen fixing bacterium but is also reportedly able to reduce no2 to nitrous oxide n2o under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions okada et al 2005 song et al 2014 in addition we could also infer that ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob otu161 consumed the trace oxygen denitrifiers vogesella otu 76 and hyphomicrobium otu223 could reduce no3 to no2 moreover otu128 was shown to belong to the genus comamonas which has been previously reported to be able to degrade phenanthrene 4 chloronitrobenzene and 3 chloroaniline which are often inhibitors for common microorganisms boon et al 2000 goyal and zylstra 1996 wu et al 2006 the maintenance of hyphomicrobium otu223 in this community is important because of its ability to degrade c 1 compounds such as methanol which is often toxic to other members layton et al 2000 these species were found to be more active in r low indicating that coexistence and metabolism could form positive interactions between members that benefited the overall community more active signal communication was also responsible for the favorable conditions for the anammox consortia in r low significant accumulation in pools of camp and cgmp were detected in r low which had the highest vip scores according to the pls da fig 5 bacterial intracellular camp and cgmp are synthesized from atp and gtp by adenylyl cyclases and guanylyl cyclases respectively francis et al 2011 as mentioned above the increased activity of nucleotide metabolism under low nitrogen strength would induce relatively higher levels of atp and gtp which could provide sufficient supply for camp and cgmp synthesis these are two of the most common and universal second messengers and regulate a broad array of physiological processes gomelsky 2011 kalia et al 2013 particularly camp appears to play a central role in biofilm regulation type iii secretion and virulence gene expression in many bacteria kalia et al 2013 for example during glucose limitation in v cholerae camp crp regulates biofilm formation both directly by down regulating cdga a protein that produces c di gmp and indirectly by up regulating genes required for the biosynthesis of hapr the major quorum sensing regulator the higher levels of camp could be coupled to greater levels of eps in r low meanwhile higher levels of eps were found for anammox sludge under low nitrogen strength fig 2 which suggested a more obvious aggregation many benefits from aggregation could be expected first it could enhance the tolerance to several unfavorable conditions like nutrient fluctuation guo et al 2017 antimicrobial agents van acker et al 2014 competitors schluter et al 2015 heavy metal teitzel and parsek 2003 temperature di et al 2008 and no2 inhibition in anammox culture second aggregation could provide an ideal physical structure for microbial interaction spatial distance between bacteria was abridged some small molecules like amino acids and signal molecules were more likely to be located in eps and nearby bacteria feng et al 2014 furthermore it has been reported that qs molecules have a specific binding affinity to a functional amyloid abundant in natural biofilms and their transient interactions allow the qs molecules bioavailable and at the same time secure within the eps matrix seviour et al 2015 as a result closer members used handy amino acids or signal molecules to implement the process of amino acid cross feeding or quorum sensing 4 5 perspective of metabolomics application to anammox process from this study metabolomics is a useful tool to insight into the metabolic state under certain environments which provides huge metabolic information of microbial community besides that metabolomics has been applied in other areas including metabolic responses to environmental stressors and biomarker development and risk assessment of toxicant exposure lin et al 2006 similarly metabolomics could also be a potentially useful avenue for biological wastewater treatment we found tremendously higher levels of camp 105 7 fold up change and cgmp 41 2 fold up change in anammox biomass under low nitrogen strength supplementary data s1 the increase in levels of the two metabolites as intracellular signal molecules could be potential biomarkers or signals that anammox community was under active communication or interactions for example higher levels of camp could be coupled to enhanced biofilm formation as mentioned above kalia et al 2013 which would lead to higher reactor performance tang et al 2011 the significantly lower levels of nad 44 2 fold down change supplementary data s1 could indicate more energy metabolism for anammox community fig 6 which is another key signal for higher anammox performance dramatically lower level of myristic acid in r low 6 1 fold down change supplementary data s1 suggested more active formation of lipid required for the cellular membrane structure villas bôas et al 2005 which could be a signal of higher biomass growth for anammox community these metabolites above could thus be potential biomarkers when anammox reactors were operated at the similar conditions especially at low nitrogen strength wang et al 2015 furthermore it could also be an alternative to regulate these key metabolites to improve the reactor performance the application of metabolomics to biological wastewater treatment has a meaningful perspective and needs further work to explore 5 conclusion patterns of substrate supply have a marked effect on the anammox process and biomass yield in the present study a higher performance rate for nrr of 1 51 kg n m 3 d 1 4 25 times higher and 1 56 times more biomass yield was achieved in the laboratory scale anammox mbr using low nitrogen strength r low than conventional high nitrogen strength r stepwise first a more favorable environment for overall anammox community in r low laid the foundation for the more active status of microbial members which was coupled with more energetic status from the active energy metabolism pathway and higher levels of heme c contents importantly the higher transcript levels of gene hzsa indicated potentially higher levels of nitrogen transformation more active nucleic acids metabolism lipid biosynthesis and protein synthesis contributed together to produce higher biomass yield under low nitrogen strength furthermore under low nitrogen strength the anammox community adopted survival strategies and was more likely to use amino acids as public goods to trade with other members when combined with the intrinsic features of different bacteria it was inferred that more active interactions between anammox community members were achieved under low nitrogen strength the operation strategy of low nitrogen strength was identified as a useful method for the anammox process plus our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for better understanding the functional characterization of anammox process acknowledgments the financial support from shenzhen science and technology

19439,the low yield of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox biomass has attracted great attention because of its difficulty to be abundantly enriched patterns of substrate supply greatly influence microbial metabolism and behavior the present study proposed that low nitrogen strength was beneficial to anammox biomass yield and nitrogen removal when comparing a membrane bioreactor mbr operated at low nitrogen strength with short hydraulic retention time hrt r low influent fixed at 100 mg n l 1 and one operated at high nitrogen strength with long hrt r stepwise influent 100 700 mg n l 1 different nitrite concentrations in the two mbrs would indicate discrepant environments and inevitably resulted in the discrepant microbial responses for anammox community in particular we found that at low nitrogen strength increased activities of purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways provided more abundant nucleic acids for bacterial proliferation more active reaction of lipid and protein synthesis favored the synthesis of cellular structure importantly the metabolism of cheaper amino acids was more active under low nitrogen strength which was coupled with higher metabolic flux and potentially more active exchange of costly amino acids as public goods in this way more energy could be saved and applied to biomass yield higher active bacterial diversity and more positive interactions among bacterial species in r low further favored biomass yield and nitrogen removal the present study highlighted the significant effect of substrate supply patterns on anammox which is meaningful to overcome the current bottleneck of deficient anammox biomass for application in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox 16s rrna transcript metabolomics nitrogen removal biomass yield 1 introduction the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process is a biologically mediated reaction in which ammonium is oxidized to nitrogen gas using nitrite no2 as the electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions mulder et al 1995 van de graaf et al 1995 although the process has been developed as one of the most promising wastewater treatment approaches kartal et al 2010 lancet 2013 pathak et al 2007 very low biomass yield rate of functional anammox consortia is an important limitation for the practical application of the anammox process ali and okabe 2015 lotti et al 2015 trigo et al 2006 previous studies have revealed that anammox biomass yield was greatly increased and thus a considerably higher nitrogen removal capability was accomplished under a continuous supply of low nitrogen nutrients tang et al 2011 tsushima et al 2007a 2007b although this phenomenon has been shown previously a metabolomic view of whether or how low nitrogen strength favors anammox biomass yield and nitrogen removal capability is still required nutrient supply has a great influence on bacterial growth and metabolism polz and cordero 2016 roller et al 2016 the effect of growth with excess substrates and of energy limited growth is dramatic first threshold concentrations for microbial growth and utilization of carbon substrates have frequently been studied in pure and mixed culture systems alexander 1994 egli 1995 such threshold concentrations for growth of pure cultures with a single substrate typically appear to be in the range of 1 100 μg l 1 it was assumed that most of the free living microorganisms were in a dormant state and only those attached to or in close vicinity of substrates were metabolically active and growing jannasch 1967 second the restricted availability of nutrient sources is very common for bacteria in oligotrophic waters under such hunger situations bacteria would need express as many of their transporters and enzymes of catabolic pathways as possible even if they were not required at the time in e coli the succinate catabolic pathway has been almost fully induced in glucose limited chemostat cultures and the highest diversity of periplasmic proteins was expressed in carbon limited luria bertani lb chemostat cultures ihssen and egli 2005 therefore bacteria could survive to tap the available nutrient pool as efficiently as possible and to respond to changing environmental conditions and stresses from the scarce availability of energy and building blocks egli 1995 in addition to the effect of substrate concentrations on microbes the substrate supply patterns have an important influence on the bacterial metabolic state in anaerobic digestion sludge the codigester long chain fatty acids feeding frequency was found to influence the methane conversion and with pulse feeding led to higher bioconversion kinetics ziels et al 2017a 2017b metabolites originate from a complex network of chemical and biochemical pathways and offer a chemical fingerprint of microbiota functional status metabolomics combined with community structure analysis has been demonstrated as an ideal method to further explore anammox communities feng et al 2018 guo et al 2017 to achieve the aim of the present study which was to reveal the reason behind anammox nitrogen removal capability and biomass yield at different nitrogen strengths two identical anammox membrane bioreactors mbrs were operated for two months we utilized 16s rna transcript sequencing and metabolomics to explore the responses of the metabolically active community and their metabolism to high and low nitrogen strength moreover we further utilized the pathway activity profiling papi algorithm to calculate metabolic pathway activities based on the metabolomics results and thus determine the potential microbial behaviors under different nitrogen strengths the present study provided a meaningful insight into the metabolic effect of nutrient supply on anammox biomass yield and performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr operation two identical mbrs r stepwise and r low with a working volume of 5 0 l equipped with poly vinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membranes were operated as different strategies both mbrs were inoculated with 0 23 gvss l 1 anammox consortia dominated with candidatus jettenia caeni guo et al 2017 the unchangeable hydraulic retention time hrt of r stepwise was set as 36 h and the nitrogen load increased regularly by increasing influent ammonium nh4 and nitrite no2 concentrations when no2 n in effluent was below 10 mg n l 1 for r low the nitrogen load was gradually increased by decreasing the hrt whilst keeping influent nitrogen concentration at 50 mg no2 n l 1 and 50 mg nh4 n l 1 the medium solution used in the mbrs mainly consisted of ammonium and nitrite in the form of nh4 2so4 and nano2 respectively the detailed composition of the trace mineral media has been described previously by van de graaf 1996 and is shown in supplementary materials and methods the ph of the mbrs was not controlled but it was always within the range of 7 5 8 0 and the temperature was maintained at 37 1 c the mbrs were flushed with a gas mixture of n2 co2 95 5 to maintain anaerobic conditions the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were measured with uv visible spectrophotometry uv 1750 shimadzu every two days according to the standard methods from the american public health association apha 1998 bacteria samples were taken from the mbrs every two weeks for the determination of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides and their sums eps and intracellular heme c content at day of 60 anammox biomass measurements were taken for determination of anammox activities of the two mbrs dna and rna extraction and metabolite extraction 2 2 eps extraction and chemical analysis eps was extracted using the cation exchange resin method proposed by hou et al 2015 the polysaccharides and proteins in the eps were determined using the anthrone method with glucose as the standard loewus 2002 and the bicinchoninic acid bca assay osnes et al 2009 respectively each was performed in triplicate to obtain the average value 2 3 heme c analysis heme c content was determined based on the protocols described by sinclair et al 2001 briefly pyridine in alkali replaced the nitrogen ligands from the protein bound heme and the resultant heme c was quantified by calculating the difference between spectra of the reduced sodium dithionite crystals and oxidized potassium ferricyanide compounds the heme c concentration was calculated based on the extinction coefficient of 23 97 mm cm 1 for the difference in absorption between the peak at 550 nm and the trough at 535 nm the absorption spectrum was analyzed by uv visible spectrophotometry uv 1750 shimadzu in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm 2 4 16s rrna transcript sequencing total genomic dna was isolated from each sample using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biotechnology solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s protocol total rna was extracted from anammox sludge using a ribopure rna purification kit ambion life technologies lithuania according to the manufacturer s guidelines then the extracted rna was subjected to dna removal and complimentary dna cdna synthesis tiangen beijing china the quality and quantity of rna and cdna were checked using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa the genomic dna with 16s rrna gene and the cdna with bacterial 16s rrna transcripts were amplified with the primers 338f and 806r targeting the v3 v4 region high throughput sequencing was conducted at majorbio co ltd shanghai china using the illumina miseq platform according to the manufacturer s instructions polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification was conducted using specific primers 338f 806r with barcode and high fidelity trashstart fastpfu dna polymerase transgen biotech china pcr amplification was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 4 μl 5 fastpfu buffer 2 μl 2 5 mm dntps 0 8 μl 5 μm primers 0 4 μl fastpfu polymerase and 10 ng dna template the bacterial 16s rrna gene pcr thermal cycle profile was as follows 2 min at 95 c 28 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 61 c 45 s at 72 c and a final 10 min at 72 c followed by cooling at 10 c the raw 16s rrna sequences from miseq sequencing were processed by filtering the sequences with ns or lengths shorter than 200 bp or average quality scores less than 25 using qiime v 1 7 0 caporaso et al 2010 and uparse pipeline edgar 2013 the remaining sequences were clustered according to the similarity level and statistical analysis of biological information under a 97 similarity level for operational taxonomic unites otus the 16s rrna gene sequences and transcript sequences from miseq sequencing have been deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession number srp132025 and srp132023 respectively 2 5 lc ms based metabolomic analysis the anammox biomass were harvested at 6000 g at 4 c for 3 min washed with 1 pbs for three times quenched in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c immediately metabolite samples were resuspended in 1 5 ml of cold ultrapure water 4 c and immediately sonicated using a tip sonicator on ice 3 s intervals between 3 s pulses 30 min 195 w scientz jy 92 iin 6 ml of methanol previously cooled at 80 c were subsequently added to the samples then the samples were stored at 80 c for 2 h to precipitate the cellular proteins after centrifugation 20 min at 10 000 g the supernatants were collected and evaporated until dryness at room temperature under a gentle steam of nitrogen gas the residues were prepared for intracellular metabolite determination using high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms all tests were repeated three times the precipitate bacterial proteins after c di gmp extraction were harvested and then dissolved with 1 ml aliquots of 0 1 m naoh heated at 95 c for 15 min and conducted for the protein determination with the bca method osnes et al 2009 untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed using q exactive orbitrap thermo ca first 1 μl of supernatant was loaded on a normal phase chromatography column and the sample was eluted to an orbitrap mass spectrometer with 50 acn containing 10 mm ammonium formate as the eluent the data in the mass range 70 1050 m z were acquired using data dependent msms acquisition the full scan and fragment spectra were collected at a resolution of 70 000 and 17 500 respectively the source parameters were as follows spray voltage 3000 v capillary temperature 320 c heater temperature 300 c sheath gas flow rate 35 and auxiliary gas flow rate 10 metabolite identification was based on a tracefinder search with a home built database containing 740 compounds 2 6 metabolic pathway activity profiling metabolic pathway activity analysis using the papi package was undertaken to compare activities using the normalized and transformed metabolite data following the methods described in aggio et al 2010 briefly using the normalized abundance data for each treatment as the input the papi package calculated activity scores of individual pathways from the kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genomes kegg database these activity scores were based on the relative changes in compounds treatment vs control associated with each pathway of interest this algorithm is based on two main assumptions i if a given metabolic pathway is more active in a given condition a larger number of metabolic intermediates from that pathway is likely to be detected by metabolomics and ii the greater the activity of a metabolic pathway the lower the abundance of the metabolic intermediates from that pathway because the metabolic flux throughout the pathway is expected to be higher aggio et al 2010 the resulting activity scores therefore serves as an indicator of the likelihood that a pathway is active within a cell or organism under a given condition without the requirement for absolute quantitation independent sample t tests one tailed were applied to test for differences among activity scores between treatment groups with equal variance assumed 2 7 data analysis student s t tests were conducted using pasw spss version 18 0 to test the significance and differences between various results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant prior to analysis data sets of 16s rrna transcripts sequencing results as percentage abundance format were normalized by pareto scaling the analysis was carried out using r as for the metabolomics analysis intensity data files were imported into the web based program metaboanalyst for the statistical univariate and multivaritate analysis http www metaboanalyst ca xia and wishart 2016 mesorhizobium loti was chosen as reference species in kegg database for pathway analysis features that vary significantly between the two samples sets were evaluated by univariate statistical analysis and significance was defined as 2 fold change with p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 higher nitrogen removal rates nrr and biomass yield under low nitrogen strength the performances of the mbrs with different operational strategies r stepwise gradually increasing influent concentrations 100 700 mg n l 1 with unchangeable hrt r low gradually decreasing hrt with unchangeable lower influent concentrations 100 mg n l 1 are shown in fig 1 two identical mbrs were operated with the same amounts of original anammox consortia importantly a higher bomass growth was obtained in r low at the end of the process the biomass of r low was 1 56 times greater than that of r stepwise r low vs r stepwise 10 58 vs 6 77 gvss l 1 table 1 indicating the multiplied higher biomass yield in r low during operation of the mbrs total nrrs presented increasing trends for both strategies during the initial phase for 19 days the nrr of r stepwise was slightly higher than r low which was likely because the steady hrt of r stepwise contributed to a more stable environment for anammox biomass especially when the mbrs were originally established after the initial phase the nrr of r low showed a strong increasing trend from 0 25 to 1 51 kg n m 3 d 1 whereas the nrr of r stepwise presented only a slight increase from 0 21 to 0 36 kg n m 3 d 1 consequently at the end of the mbr operation day 60 the nrr of r low was 4 25 times higher than that of r stepwise fig 1c the no2 concentrations of bulk liquid in the mbrs were 55 mg l 1 r stepwise and 13 mg l 1 r low at day 60 the specific activities of anammox biomass at the end of the mbr development were analyzed in situ which showed a relatively higher anammox activity table 1 accordingly higher values of 0 14 kg n kgvss 1 d 1 were detected in r low when r low presented a significantly high nrr of 1 51 kg n m 3 d 1 to determine the difference of nitrogen transformation functional gene activities under different nitrogen concentrations real time reverse transcription pcr qrt pcr detected hzsa based on batch assays details in supplementary data significantly higher transcription level of hzsa was found in relatively lower nitrogen concentrations fig 1d the high activity was an important factor leading to a higher biomass growth and concurrently higher nrr of the mbr 3 2 biomass characteristics 3 2 1 higher levels of eps under low nitrogen strength in the present study eps were determined during the operation of mbrs as shown in fig 2 a similar overall trends of eps components changes are shown an obvious decline appeared at the beginning of the operation which was probably due to adaptation to the new environments for anammox biomass during the initial stage day 15 vs day 0 fig 2a subsequently eps contents of both r stepwise and r low increased with increasing nrr when the nrr of r low surpassed r stepwise the eps components especially for extracellular proteins of r low were significantly higher than r stepwise t tests p 0 05 for all tests after day 15 fig 2a at the end of the mbr operation the eps components increased to the peak during the operational period with significant discrepancy between the two mbrs proteins 172 73 7 25 vs 142 88 8 24 mg gvss 1 p 0 01 sums 189 69 7 26 vs 161 18 8 10 mg gvss 1 p 0 01 t tests 3 2 2 faster increase in heme c content under low nitrogen strength the heme c contents of mbrs with different strategies were investigated as shown in fig 2b the heme c levels obviously increased with increasing nrr the heme c content was 0 90 0 07 mmol gvss 1 at the initial point for both mbrs and then significantly increased to 3 81 0 17 mmol gvss 1 for r stepwise and 4 15 0 03 mmol gvss 1 for r low at the end of the mbr operation day 60 additionally during the loading increase period the heme c levels of r low were significantly higher than that of r stepwise day 45 p 0 0334 day 60 p 0 0238 t tests in addition the color of the high load anammox sludge was uniquely carmine because of the presence of heme c as evident from fig s1 the carmine color dominated in r low at day 60 3 3 metabolically active community structure in response to different nitrogen strength a 16s rrna data set was generated from reverse transcribed rna to provide insight into the discrepancy in the metabolically active community structure in response to different feed strategies to compare community structures a scatter plot based on principal component analysis pca scores were obtained from the sequences at otu levels with 97 similarity fig 3 a samples from the groups separated clearly indicating an obvious difference of the community compositions between the two mbrs this was also observed by hierarchical clustering performed using the community data based on phylum level fig 3b approximately 99 of the metabolically active community abundance was classified into 10 phyla of which planctomycetes was the most abundant phylum in all samples accounting for 45 8 r stepwise and 38 0 r low on average fig 3c which showed differences close to significance p value 0 055 t tests in this phylum between two groups other dominant phyla 1 in abundance were proteobacteria chloroflexi and chlorobi fig 3c a detailed overview of individual profiles of each 16s rrna transcript sequencing sample is presented at the phylum level fig 3d in the present study the dominant phyla including proteobacteria chloroflexi and chlorobi showed significant differences between groups fig 3c higher abundances of proteobacteria and chlorobi were detected in r low than in r stepwise p value 0 012 and 0 016 respectively t tests whereas lower abundance of chloroflexi was observed in r low p value 0 026 t tests detailed abundances and significances of other phyla are summarized in table s1 a phylogenetic tree based on the 16s rrna sequences of otus was inferred as shown in fig 4 a total of 18 otus with greater than 1 abundance at least within one sample were emphasized of which the majority of members were shown to be significantly higher in r low samples than in r stepwise samples details are shown in table s2 significant increases in abundance were found in r low for example otu 76 within genus of vogesella 94 of identity with v alkaliphila 493 60 fold change p value 0 020 t tests otu 161 within genus nitrosomonas with n europaea closest identity of 96 otu138 identity of 99 to mesorhizobium sp m3 otu130 identity of 95 to ignavibacterium album and otu223 identity of 99 to hyphomicrobium aestuarii the relative abundance of otu 128 with the closest relative to comamonas sp rs m7pp2013 identity of 99 was also significantly higher than in r stepwise 107 28 fold change p value 0 014 t tests 3 4 discrepant metabolic pathway activities under different nitrogen strength 3 4 1 alterations in metabolite profiles and free metabolite pools in the present study a lc ms based metabolomics analysis of the samples harvested on the final day of operation was performed to analyze the microbiota functional status in total 288 metabolites were detected and are summarized in supplementary data s1 marked alterations to free metabolite pools collections of all the cellular free metabolites were observed in each sample in response to different nitrogen strengths which was apparent in the spatial separation of treatment groups in the partial least squares discriminate analysis pls da plot in the first three dimensions fig 5 a the differentiation between the two mbrs was also observed by hierarchical clustering performed using the intensity of the detected metabolites in each sample fig s5a in the volcano plot metabolites that increased or decreased by twofold or more and had a p 0 05 are shown in red fig s5b in total 189 metabolites with significant differences were found of which increased levels of 89 metabolites were detected in r low samples and the remainder 100 metabolites were higher in r stepwise samples for individual metabolites variable importance of projection vip scores were used to rank the contribution of metabolites to the discrimination between r stepwise and r low metabolomics groups which are based on the weighed coefficients of the pls da model fig 5b most notably in the r low sample large accumulations of cyclic nucleotide second messengers cyclic amp camp 105 7 fold up change p value 0 0001 t tests and cyclic gmp cgmp 41 2 fold up change p value 0 0001 t tests occurred fig 5b these were coupled to an accumulation in pools of intermediates including xmp xanthosine monophosphate agmatine d ribose 5 phosphate d ribulose 5 phosphate and p hydroxyphenylacetic acid for r low in contrast when comparing to r stepwise decreases in pools of multiple compounds were found in r low including nad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 44 2 fold down change p value 0 0001 t tests myristic acid uridine 5 diphosphate and other intermediates from nucleic acid metabolism like dcdp deoxycytidine diphosphate 10 1 fold down change p value 0 0001 t tests and dump deoxyuridine monophosphate 9 8 fold down change p value 0 0001 t tests in particular an overall decline in pools of amino acids was found in r low samples 17 out of 20 essential amino acids fig 5c 3 4 2 metabolic pathway analysis to gain insight into the metabolic differences between the two mbrs metabolic pathway activities were calculated based on the metabolome data using metaboanalyst online programming xia and wishart 2016 and the papi algorithm see materials and methods fig 6 from the results of metaboanalyst five pathways with the most significant effect for the discrimination of the two sets of samples impact 0 6 and log p value 5 are shown in fig 6 interestingly of the five pathways above four pathways were concerned with amino acid metabolism which are alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism phenylalanine metabolism arginine and proline metabolism and glycine serine and threonine metabolism the fifth one was the pyrimidine metabolism pathway pathway activity calculated from papi was useful to support and further explore the results from metaboanalyst overall 61 pathways were analyzed of which 27 pathways with significantly different activity levels were discovered in pairwise comparisons p 0 05 t tests between the two sample sets fig 6b we first found that the predicted amino acid metabolism pathway activities were dramatically different for r low the activities of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis were significantly higher than r stepwise r low r stepwise by contrast the activities of arginine and proline metabolism phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were significantly lower r low r stepwise additionally the pathway nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism concerning the energy metabolism and pathway ether lipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid concerning the lipid metabolism for r low presented significantly higher activities interestingly opposite trends of nucleotide metabolism were estimated increase in activity of pyrimidine metabolism for r low was coupled with a reduction in activity associated with purine metabolism fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 increased anammox metabolic activity and energy supply in low nitrogen strength nutrient supply has a great influence on bacterial growth and metabolism polz and cordero 2016 roller et al 2016 although many previous studies have reported that the anammox process is suitable for the treatment of ammonium rich wastewater ganigué et al 2009 kartal et al 2010 van dongen et al 2001 we found that substrate supply with low concentrations was more beneficial for growth and anammox activity of anammox biomass the present study underlined the metabolic characteristics and community behaviors to explore the high anammox biomass yield and anammox performance under low nitrogen strength these attempts undoubtedly improved our understanding of the metabolic response to different substrate supply strategies for anammox consortia for the purpose of exploring whether the concentration of substrate was a critical factor responsible for different anammox activities of the two mbrs or not gene hzsa transcription was detected because of the quick responses of mrna levels to changes in environmental conditions ali et al 2014 feng et al 2018 park et al 2010 wang et al 2016 higher in situ anammox activity was found in r low at day 60 which was coupled with higher level of hzsa transcripts from the qrt pcr results fig 1d hydrazine synthase hzs is an important enzyme in the hypothetical metabolic pathway of anammox bacteria for nitrogen transformation in which the hzs pathway produces hydrazine by combining ammonium with nitric oxide and hydrazine is oxidized to dinitrogen gas kartal et al 2011 the higher transcript levels of gene hzsa indicated potential higher levels of nitrogen transformation the results of the qrt pcr seemed contradictory to the results that higher hzsa mrna levels were consistent with higher no2 concentrations under no2 inhibition as discussed in wang et al 2016 in which the higher transcription levels of functional genes were likely a stress response to detoxify no2 when the bacteria were subjected to no2 inhibition however closer analysis showed that the substrate concentrations used in batch assays were 50 and 15 mg no2 n l 1 which are lower than the inhibition threshold jin et al 2012 therefore when under the relatively suitable conditions with no inhibition for anammox bacteria the lower substrate concentrations would induce higher anammox activity plus at day 60 the water exchange ratios were defined as the volumes of water exchange per hour and calculated as 0 14 l h 1 for r stepwise and 5 l h 1 for r low respectively the external mass transfer was enhanced at a higher flow rate leitao et al 2006 nicolella et al 2000 zaiat et al 1996 meanwhile some self inhibitory by products such as dissolved organic carbon derived from anammox mbrs could be washed out at shorter hrts tang et al 2010 tsushima et al 2007a metabolomics provided further insight into the more active anammox consortia under low nitrogen strength abundant energy is an essential factor for microorganisms to perform more efficient work we found that more energetic status was achieved in r low than in r stepwise a dramatically lower level of nad in r low was detected which indicated more active metabolic transition and flux for nad participated pathways of which the higher pathway activities of nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism in r low were estimated by papi fig 6 further the overall higher activity could also be reflected by the results of the heme c content heme c can serve as a redox site for intramolecular or intermolecular electron transfer reactions or both and indirectly reflects the cytochrome c levels bowman and bren 2008 fuerst 2005 van niftrik et al 2008 therefore the augmentation of heme c implied an increase in cytochrome c which would further indicate the enhancement of electron transfer during the anammox process when combining greater levels of heme c and a more favorable environment for anammox a higher anammox activity and nrr could be expected 4 2 metabolic evidence for increased biomass yield at low nitrogen strength activated purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways were likely linked to the active levels of dna or rna synthesis metabolism which were responsible for higher levels of growth or transcription in r low as the papi results showed in the r low mbr up regulated status was determined in pyrimidine metabolism pathways fig 6b which was also a more significant pathway for the discrimination of r stepwise and r low as shown in fig 6a this result indicated that more nucleic acids could be supplied from higher activity of pyrimidine metabolism however it should be noted that purine metabolism activity was lower in r low fig 6b which might seem contradictory to a greater demand of nucleic acids for bacterial growth a closer study of papi revealed that when a pathway appears as being active it does not mean that the whole pathway is active but rather specific reactions within that pathway are occurring aggio et al 2010 as fig s6 shows the intermediates located upstream of dna synthesis were found in overall lower levels which suggested that more active metabolic flux occurred during the process of dna synthesis here substantially higher levels of cellular nucleic acids were the essential molecule evidence for more rapid bacterial growth under low nitrogen strength the more active state of lipid and protein synthesis promoted the construction of cellular structure at low nitrogen strength inspired by a dramatically lower level of myristic acid in r low fig 5 we found that it could react with glycerol to form lipids required for the cellular membrane structure villas bôas et al 2005 its lower level revealed that the lipid formation reaction was more active in r low than in r stepwise additionally increases in activities of other lipid metabolism pathways ether lipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid were estimated by papi in r low fig 6 which also contributed to the more active lipid synthesis as for protein synthesis although there was no direct evidence to support the process overall lower levels in pools of amino acids found in r low samples 17 out of 20 essential amino acids fig 5c could be an indirect signal that a higher consumption of amino acids occurred in r low than in r stepwise which was likely for protein synthesis this was supported by the fact that higher activity of pathway aminoacyl trna biosynthesis was calculated in r low samples which indicated higher activity of protein synthesis because the aminoacyl trna together with some elongation factors delivered the amino acids to the ribosome for incorporation into the polypeptide chain that was being produced berg et al 2006 in addition protein is an abundant macromolecule in bacterial cells it is expensive to make proteins 50 60 of adenosine triphosphate atp is used to polymerize amino acids into protein during balanced growth stouthamer 1973 and thus a high energy supply is necessary a more energetic status was found in r low which could be identified to be more competent to provide energy for protein synthesis and benefit higher levels of biomass yield 4 3 strategies of amino acids utilization under different nitrogen strength based on the results from the metaboanalyst online programming amino acid metabolism pathways had the most significant impact on the discrimination between r stepwise and r low indicating that the strategies of amino acid utilization for anammox community under different nitrogen strength were different according to papi higher activities of alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis were shown for r low samples fig 6 in contrast the activities of arginine and proline metabolism phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were significantly lower r low r stepwise fig 6 when we analyzed amino acids with the metabolic cost of amino acid biosynthesis based on values reported by akashi and gojobori 2002 higher pathway activities of relatively cheaper amino acids e g alanine aspartate glutamate valine and leucine biosynthesis were found in r low whereas relatively costly amino acids e g phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan were found in r stepwise this phenomenon likely occurred because bacteria in r low preferred to utilize the cheaper amino acids and members in r stepwise were more inclined to use the costly amino acids for metabolism to determine the possible reason underlying the phenomenon it was deduced that different survival strategies were adopted by anammox consortia in different mbrs under different nitrogen strength as discussed in section 4 1 a more favorable environment was created in r low which was more suitable for bacterial to live therefore more bacteria were activated in r low than r stepwise and were more likely to adopt specific strategies to guarantee their own population success in bacterial growth this phenomenon has been found and discussed previously for pure cultures and natural environment polz and cordero 2016 roller et al 2016 based on this strategy cheaper amino acids would be an ideal source of protein synthesis energy generation and or any other metabolic pathways lawson et al 2017 therefore this could be the possible reason for the higher activity of pathways of cheaper amino acid biosynthesis and their metabolic flux for r low in addition the costly amino acids biosynthesis activity in r low was lower than in r stepwise and at the same time there were lower levels of costly amino acids in r low this indicated that bacteria in r low could more likely obtain these costly amino acids by trading among the anammox community lawson et al 2017 during that process the costly amino acids acted as public goods to be used by the community members embree et al 2015 amino acid biosynthesis is an energy intensive process akashi and gojobori 2002 embree et al 2015 and supplementation by bacteria might enable microbes to focus their metabolism on the uptake of reducing equivalents rather than biosynthesis the luxury of amino acid supplementation would ease the energetic burden on nitrogen transition that in turn would allow the entire community to benefit under low nitrogen strength in summary the higher metabolic flux of cheaper amino acids and strategy of costly amino acids exchange for anammox consortia in r low benefited the faster growth and more active metabolism under low nitrogen strength 4 4 more positive bacterial interactions under low nitrogen strength low nitrogen strength created a more favorable environment for the anammox community no2 supply is one of the most critical aspects in the anammox process as it is the electron acceptor in the process undertaken by anammox bacteria on the contrary it is also a potential toxic compound for other bacteria in the anammox community rowe et al 1979 weon et al 2002 therefore lower levels of no2 could be responsible for the favorable environment created under low nitrogen strength this was reflected by the higher abundance of these members and a greater diversity in samples from r low table 1 under such favorable conditions in r low the interactions between anammox bacteria and the species with functions complementary to anammox bacteria were found to be potentially more active for example anammox bacteria could provide some useful metabolites for other species correspondingly some species like aob could provide nitrite for anammox species and heterotrophic bacteria could degrade the organic molecules which was benefit for anammox bacteria when these species showed more metabolically active in abundance figs 3 and 4 more positive interactions could be expected in detail community member otu138 belonged to genus mesorhizobium mesorhizobium is not only considered to be a nitrogen fixing bacterium but is also reportedly able to reduce no2 to nitrous oxide n2o under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions okada et al 2005 song et al 2014 in addition we could also infer that ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob otu161 consumed the trace oxygen denitrifiers vogesella otu 76 and hyphomicrobium otu223 could reduce no3 to no2 moreover otu128 was shown to belong to the genus comamonas which has been previously reported to be able to degrade phenanthrene 4 chloronitrobenzene and 3 chloroaniline which are often inhibitors for common microorganisms boon et al 2000 goyal and zylstra 1996 wu et al 2006 the maintenance of hyphomicrobium otu223 in this community is important because of its ability to degrade c 1 compounds such as methanol which is often toxic to other members layton et al 2000 these species were found to be more active in r low indicating that coexistence and metabolism could form positive interactions between members that benefited the overall community more active signal communication was also responsible for the favorable conditions for the anammox consortia in r low significant accumulation in pools of camp and cgmp were detected in r low which had the highest vip scores according to the pls da fig 5 bacterial intracellular camp and cgmp are synthesized from atp and gtp by adenylyl cyclases and guanylyl cyclases respectively francis et al 2011 as mentioned above the increased activity of nucleotide metabolism under low nitrogen strength would induce relatively higher levels of atp and gtp which could provide sufficient supply for camp and cgmp synthesis these are two of the most common and universal second messengers and regulate a broad array of physiological processes gomelsky 2011 kalia et al 2013 particularly camp appears to play a central role in biofilm regulation type iii secretion and virulence gene expression in many bacteria kalia et al 2013 for example during glucose limitation in v cholerae camp crp regulates biofilm formation both directly by down regulating cdga a protein that produces c di gmp and indirectly by up regulating genes required for the biosynthesis of hapr the major quorum sensing regulator the higher levels of camp could be coupled to greater levels of eps in r low meanwhile higher levels of eps were found for anammox sludge under low nitrogen strength fig 2 which suggested a more obvious aggregation many benefits from aggregation could be expected first it could enhance the tolerance to several unfavorable conditions like nutrient fluctuation guo et al 2017 antimicrobial agents van acker et al 2014 competitors schluter et al 2015 heavy metal teitzel and parsek 2003 temperature di et al 2008 and no2 inhibition in anammox culture second aggregation could provide an ideal physical structure for microbial interaction spatial distance between bacteria was abridged some small molecules like amino acids and signal molecules were more likely to be located in eps and nearby bacteria feng et al 2014 furthermore it has been reported that qs molecules have a specific binding affinity to a functional amyloid abundant in natural biofilms and their transient interactions allow the qs molecules bioavailable and at the same time secure within the eps matrix seviour et al 2015 as a result closer members used handy amino acids or signal molecules to implement the process of amino acid cross feeding or quorum sensing 4 5 perspective of metabolomics application to anammox process from this study metabolomics is a useful tool to insight into the metabolic state under certain environments which provides huge metabolic information of microbial community besides that metabolomics has been applied in other areas including metabolic responses to environmental stressors and biomarker development and risk assessment of toxicant exposure lin et al 2006 similarly metabolomics could also be a potentially useful avenue for biological wastewater treatment we found tremendously higher levels of camp 105 7 fold up change and cgmp 41 2 fold up change in anammox biomass under low nitrogen strength supplementary data s1 the increase in levels of the two metabolites as intracellular signal molecules could be potential biomarkers or signals that anammox community was under active communication or interactions for example higher levels of camp could be coupled to enhanced biofilm formation as mentioned above kalia et al 2013 which would lead to higher reactor performance tang et al 2011 the significantly lower levels of nad 44 2 fold down change supplementary data s1 could indicate more energy metabolism for anammox community fig 6 which is another key signal for higher anammox performance dramatically lower level of myristic acid in r low 6 1 fold down change supplementary data s1 suggested more active formation of lipid required for the cellular membrane structure villas bôas et al 2005 which could be a signal of higher biomass growth for anammox community these metabolites above could thus be potential biomarkers when anammox reactors were operated at the similar conditions especially at low nitrogen strength wang et al 2015 furthermore it could also be an alternative to regulate these key metabolites to improve the reactor performance the application of metabolomics to biological wastewater treatment has a meaningful perspective and needs further work to explore 5 conclusion patterns of substrate supply have a marked effect on the anammox process and biomass yield in the present study a higher performance rate for nrr of 1 51 kg n m 3 d 1 4 25 times higher and 1 56 times more biomass yield was achieved in the laboratory scale anammox mbr using low nitrogen strength r low than conventional high nitrogen strength r stepwise first a more favorable environment for overall anammox community in r low laid the foundation for the more active status of microbial members which was coupled with more energetic status from the active energy metabolism pathway and higher levels of heme c contents importantly the higher transcript levels of gene hzsa indicated potentially higher levels of nitrogen transformation more active nucleic acids metabolism lipid biosynthesis and protein synthesis contributed together to produce higher biomass yield under low nitrogen strength furthermore under low nitrogen strength the anammox community adopted survival strategies and was more likely to use amino acids as public goods to trade with other members when combined with the intrinsic features of different bacteria it was inferred that more active interactions between anammox community members were achieved under low nitrogen strength the operation strategy of low nitrogen strength was identified as a useful method for the anammox process plus our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for better understanding the functional characterization of anammox process acknowledgments the financial support from shenzhen science and technology
