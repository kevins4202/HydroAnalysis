10260,sugarcane is a high biomass crop which requires large amounts of water in a semiarid environment deficit irrigation is inevitable to produce acceptable yields the field experiments were conducted for two seasons 2015 and 2016 on sugarcane saccharum officinarum l by applying water deficit in three regimes 0 30 and 60 water deficit during three phenological stage tillering grand growth and maturity such that the effect of a specified water deficit during a specified phenological stage can be investigated separately the experiment formed 27 irrigation schedules replicated twice in randomized block design the irrigations were provided based on water deficit underlined in each irrigation schedule during different phenological stages on the basis of actual soil moisture in root zone the demonstrated data indicated that the net increase in growth characters with net water used within a phenological stage was to great extent affected by the grand growth stage the yield contributing characters and cane yield reduced with increase in water deficit imposed mainly in grand growth followed by tillering stage a water deficit imposed in maturity stage only marginal affected the yield the highest yield of sugarcane obtained underwater deficit free schedule 181 5 tha 1 30 and 60 water deficit throughout season noticed with significantly lower cane yield as 157 1 and 107 4 tha 1 respectively the relative cane yield reduction over water deficit free schedule registered between 0 7 and 40 6 with relative decrease in the water use by 2 5 33 4 a deficit irrigation strategy with 0 water deficit at tillering 30 at grand growth and 60 at maturity stage was found appropriate as it represents the non significant reduction in yield over water deficit free condition beside it leads to a 13 3 lesser water use based on soil moisture the total water use of sugarcane underwater deficit free and best deficit conditions were estimated as 1339 and 1160 mm respectively the study recommends to practice appropriate irrigation scheduling under water shortage situation for maximizing water use by providing irrigations as per requirement applying less water than required such that the overall productions are optimized keywords deficit irrigation sugarcane yield grand growth stage maturity stage tillering stage 0 30 60 water deficit schedules 1 introduction sugarcane saccharum spp is a tropical and subtropical crop which produces a large amount of biomass and requires substantial input of water to produce maximum yields wiedenfeld 2000 in semi arid regions of the world sugarcane is considered an important crop contributing to the respective national economy but water availability and its utilization scenario represents the unfavorable perspective for example semi arid india where large scale sugarcane cultivation is completely depends upon irrigation and water resources availability is a crucial limiting factor for sugarcane production monsoon variation and over exploited aquifer storage have resulted in shortage of fresh water supplies for irrigation use pawar et al 2013 the current share of water allocated for sugarcane which is a major consumer of water is low that it may not be possible to provide the irrigation water to sugarcane as per its water requirement during different growth stages it implies effective strategies for substantial agricultural water saving with optimized irrigation plan in this region under such circumstances we need to provide less water than required effecting forced paradigm deficit irrigation however in case the most critical stage of sugarcane is matched with the higher degree deficit irrigation there is possibility of greater yield reduction compared to the less critical growth stage matching with same degree of deficit irrigation based on the knowledge of crop sensitivity to water deficit for different phenological stages it is possible to develop irrigation scheduling recommendations to meet water requirements during deficit sensitive phenological stages and to impose deficits during less deficit sensitive stages win et al 2014 several investigations have been carried out in many growing regions of the world in order to develop an efficient deficit irrigation scheduling for sugarcane roberts et al 1990 singh and mohan 1994 robertson and donaldson 1998 singels et al 2000 inman bamber and smith 2005 jangpromma et al 2012 zhao et al 2010 2013 these studies indicate that when properly practiced deficit irrigation may maximize water productivity while maintaining sugarcane yields and quality at acceptable economic levels however most previous research on water deficit in sugarcane has concentrated only on imposing uniform water deficit in any phenological stage particularly with respect to drying off management under full irrigation and its consequences for yield it is necessary to have a full understanding of trade offs between yield and water deficit applied in a particular phenological stage and its consequences on next phenological stage to formulate proper deficit irrigation management strategies this indicates the need of systematic study on deficit irrigation management for sugarcane in terms of estimating the yield when different water deficit is applied during different phenological stages of sugarcane hence objective proposed in this study is to generate the appropriate information on deficit irrigation for sugarcane cultivated under semiarid environment 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were carried out during the annual seasons of 2015 and 2016 at experimental farm of mahatma phule krishi vidyapeeth rahuri located in the western part of maharashtra india latitude 19 48 n longitude 190 57 e altitude 657 m agro climatically the region falls under the semiarid and sub tropical zone with average annual rainfall of 555 mm the distribution of rain is uneven and is distributed over 15 45 rainy days the daily measurements of meteorological variables were recorded from an automated meteorological station situated at sugarcane experimental field and monthly mean are summarized in table 1 the maximum and minimum temperature ranged from 27 6 c to 39 5 c and 10 4 c to 24 1 c respectively the maximum and minimum relative humidity ranged between 38 to 80 3 and 20 5 68 6 respectively the sunshine hours ranged between 1 7 to 9 9 h days 1 while the pan evaporation ranged between 4 to 10 9 mm day 1 the wind speed ranged between 0 5 to 9 kmhr 1 the reference evapotranspiration ranged between 2 3 and 6 1 mm day 1 the highest rainfall of 124 1 mm observed during may month of second season with highest rainfall event of 71 mm fig 1 2 2 soil moisture constants the textural class of the soil of experimental site was clay the soil was medium alkaline in reaction ph 8 36 with electrical conductivity 0 40 ds m 1 the depth of soil was 1 8 m the layer wise volumetric field capacity and permanent wilting point available moisture and allowable deficit are given in table 2 the average field capacity and permanent wilting point was 52 7 cm cm 1 and 21 6 cm cm 1 respectively with bulk density was 1 27 mgm 3 the average allowable depletion depth was 32 5 cm cm 1 2 3 experimental details experiments were carried out in randomized block design rbd with 27 irrigation schedules replicated twice based on different combinations of the quantity of water deficit 0 deficit 0 00d 30 deficit 0 30d and 60 deficit 0 60d applied during different crop phenological stages viz tillering stage ts 0 90 days after transplanting dat grand growth stage ggs 91 255 dat and maturity stage ms 256 315 dat sugarcane seedlings cultivar com 265 were prepared for transplanting in field after forty days of raising nursery the sugarcane seedlings were transplanted at single row of 1 50 0 60 m spacing the growth period was divided into three stages tillering grand growth and maturity the tillering stage was just after transplanting the seedlings when tillers are starts to emerge from mother shoot and ends when tiller starts to elongate at the beginning of grand growth the grand growth stage was from then up to the timing when cane has achieved its full growth the maturity stage continued from then until harvest these three phenological stages corresponds to those defined in fao 56 allen et al 1998 respectively as development mid season and end season the irrigation schedule comprising different water deficit and different crop phenological stage were made in such a way that effect of specific water deficit during specific crop phenological stage can be studied independently the combinations of the irrigation schedules with water quantity used are given in table 3 the 27 irrigation schedules were arranged randomly in a field of 110 m x 70 m the length and width of each net plot was 13 5 m x 6 m the irrigation schedules were separated by a distance of 3 m while the replication plots in each irrigation schedule were separated by a distance of 1 5 m which serves as buffer to minimize lateral movement of water from one plot to another one additional plot was provided for recording observations on root zone depth the layout of experiment and an individual plot are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively 2 4 irrigation scheduling there are several methods for imposing water deficit both in terms of timing and amount of water to be applied to sugarcane including direct soil water monitoring and calculated crop water use based on weather data volumetric water content can be determined using a neutron probe or time domain reflectometry tdr soil water tensiometers and electrical resistance sensors however these methods do not consider measurement of rainfall or soil moisture storage in this study soil moisture estimates are done gravimetrically including soil water holding capacity and rooting depth to impose water deficit a soil water replenishment approach is then utilized to estimate irrigation water requirement of crop the irrigation scheduling was based on available soil moisture content of respective irrigation schedules the water deficit was imposed on the basis of available soil moisture content in the root zone the soil moisture measurements were made for each 0 15 m layer in the soil proﬁle to the depth of root zone the effective root zone was determined by carefully digging and then uprooting one healthy plant the depth of water applied for irrigation was calculated according to the following formula michael 2010 d i 1 n fc i mc i 100 x bd i x d i fci field capacity for ith layer mci moisture content at the time of irrigation bdi bulk density of soil for ith layer gm cc 1 di effective root zone depth for ith layer cm n number of soil layers sampled in the root zone depth the actual depths of irrigation water were applied according to the irrigation schedules the actual irrigation depth i relative to each irrigation schedule was calculated before irrigation according to the following formula i d dxkdt where i irrigation depth of respective irrigation schedule mm kdt target deficit coefficient relative to each irrigation schedule 0 0 3 and 0 6 for 0 30 and 60 deficit respectively the irrigations were scheduled at every 8 10 days interval by drip irrigation as per water deficit underlined in each irrigation schedule the drip irrigation system was installed only to meet out crop water requirement in exact manner the drip system configured with the single row planting of sugarcane where distance between two laterals and emitters was 1 5 m and 0 4 m respectively fig 3 the irrigation schedule starts after 15 dat in field and stopped before 15 days of harvesting the effective rainfall was computed by criteria mentioned in fao document no 25 dastane 1974 2 5 growth and yield contributing characters the periodical growth characters plant height number of tiller or millable canes leaf area and dry matter accumulation and yield contributing characters height of millable cane internode number internode length internode circumference cane weight per clump 1 and single cane weight were recorded initially five sugarcane clumps from each replication were selected randomly labeled with pegs and red cloth and subsequently used for recording biometric observations at different phenological stages the periodical growth observation started from 75 dat and were taken at 60 days interval upto harvest of 315 dat crop the observation of yield and yield contributing characters were taken at harvest the yield was recorded for individual plot and expressed as t ha 1 the other agronomic practice viz weeding off barring earthing up and fertigation schedule were followed as per recommended by parent agricultural university mahatma phule krishi vidyapeeth rahuri 2 6 statistical analysis the data obtained from the experimentation analyzed for individual year and pooled for 2 years analysis of variance anova was carried out using f test panse and sukhatme 1995 least significant difference lsd method was used to determine whether differences existed between certain comparisons using software drysoft the standard error of mean se m was worked out whenever the results were found to be significant the critical difference cd at 5 level of significance p 0 05 was worked out and presented the pooled analysis was done for all important growth and yield characters of the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth contributing characters 3 1 1 plant height the plant heights linearly increased with increase in water used by sugarcane fig 4a significantly taller plant height observed in water deficit free irrigation schedules throughout season as a fact of maintaining the soil moisture at a higher level fig 3a and b olivier and singels 2012 and kumar et al 2014 reported water use match with the crop growth demand along with the good soil aeration favours the faster cell division and cell elongation the difference of water caused significantly difference in plant heights of irrigation schedules the full season water deficit of 0 t1 the plant height increased with full water use at the order of 1338 9 mm and reach high values of 406 7 cm the full season 30 water deficit t14 plant height remains low 326 2 cm which exercised a low water use of 1139 2 mm the full season 60 water deficit t27 was applied with lower water depth of 891 mm therefore plant heights decreased at its shortest as 258 cm fig 4a in tillering stage 75 dat 30 deficit irrigation schedules t10 t18 received water in range of 210 215 mm that was greater over 60 deficit t19 t27 with range as 157 167 mm but in grand growth 135 195 and 255 dat 30 t4 t6 t13 t15 and t22 t24 and 60 deficit irrigation schedules t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 did not differed significantly this was probably due to concurrent of monsoon rainfall with grand growth stage that diminished the plant heights difference in 30 and 60 deficit irrigation schedules taking into account the net water use during particular phonological stage and considering the net increase in plant height there was greater plant height noticed for grand growth than for maturity and tillering stages fig 4b as a function of cane elongation in grand growth stage the net increase in plant heights has the higher values of 274 cm with respect to higher water use 958 mm this also indicates that water deficit for sugarcane in this stage is not advisable in tillering stage the net increase in water use recorded was 192 mm and net increases in plant heights to reach values of 74 5 cm the maturity stage with net increase in water use of 138 mm the net increase in plant height was around 27 8 cm 3 1 2 number of tiller or millable canes at all days of observation greater tillers obtained in 0 water deficit schedules fig 5a mainly due to early vigorous growth of the plant with the adequate availability of water irrespective of irrigation schedules the tillers number increased up to 135 dat and then decreased at 195 dat attributed to the mortality of shoots with crop age kannan et al 2007 the numbers of tillers millable cane further reduced at 255 dat and then at harvest as a part of survival strategy of plant during cane formation and development process the average mortality of tillers was 6 tillers plant 1 for all treatments however treatments under 0 water deficit was found least affected because of high tillers count at 135 dat fig 5a the highest number of tillers in crop season for deficit irrigation schedules of 0 t1 30 t14 and 60 t27 were 17 6 15 and 11 2respectively the water use under grand growth stage had large depths 600 887 mm and higher trends of tillers number for 0 deficit ranging from a minimum of 10 1 to a maximum 17 6 while at the 30 deficit of 9 3 and 15 1 tiller number varied for 60 water deficit from 6 8 to 13 fig 5a the decrement in irrigation depths during grand growth stage in 60 water deficit was considerable which directly affected the water uptake and adversely attributed to the mortality of shoots in these treatments scarpari and beauclair 2004 significantly the least number of tillers were recorded under most water deficit schedule t27 due to reduced soil moisture therefore reducing nutrient uptake which in turn resulted into a smaller number of millable at harvest table 4 to study how much water that utilized for tiller number variation in particular phenological stage the net increase decrease of tiller number with net increase in water amount was demonstrated in fig 5b in telliring stage the higher tiller production with higher survival capacity under water deficit free condition t1 t9 resulted into greater millable canes than 30 water deficit schedules t10 t18 this strongly recommends to avoid 30 water deficit in tillering stage for 0 water deficit schedules in tillering stage t1 t9 the net water use varies between 183 to 192 mm likewise in grand growth 0 water deficit irrigation schedules t1 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 significantly produced higher number of millable canes clump 1 than other irrigation schedules for grand growth stage major net increase of 907 958 mm water high increase in tiller number of about 1 8 2 6 due to formation of canes has been registered in 30 water deficit there is a moderate increase in tiller number of about 2 2 4 with net increase in water ranged between 800 and 841 mm in 60 water deficit the water use was too low of about 627 648 mm and tiller number ends up between 1 5 and 1 9 however there was a negligible loss in cane number between grand growth and maturity stage this was mainly because of marginal difference of water used in irrigation schedules of maturity stage due to reduction in crop evapotranspiration dingre and gorantiwar 2020 3 1 3 leaf area leaf area between observation days for all irrigation schedules exhibited in a way similar to that previously discussed for number of tillers where there was an increase in leaf area from 75 to 195 dat and then decreased at 255 dat and at harvest fig 6a this was chiefly because of expedite vegetative growth of tillers as a typical character of sugarcane during grand growth stage 75 195 dat the results revealed that at 75 dat 0 deficit schedules t1 t9 were significantly higher than 30 t10 t18 and 60 deficit schedules t19 t27 the irrigation schedules other than adequate watered caused more deficit to the plants that lead to the reduction in number of leaves leaf area and less production of chlorophyll carr and knox 2011 however the leaf area decreased slightly at 135 dat in all irrigation schedules mainly due to damage of few bottom leaves in earthing up operation at grand growth 195 dat the leaf area again increased due to higher crop growth and reached to its highest value in addition monsoon rainfall during grand growth stage fig 1 compensated the water deficit effect in leaf area for 30 t13 t15 and t22 t24 and 60 deficit schedules t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 nevertheless adequate water used in 0 deficit schedules t1 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 found with higher values of leaf area fig 6a notably there was a decrease in leaf area of all irrigation schedules at 255 dat mainly due falling of old leaves with crop age likewise leaf area further declined thereafter at harvest due to senescene of leaves at 255 dat and at harvest the leaf area followed a trend was identical to that for 195 dat that is adequate irrigation schedules in grand growth stage continued with higher leaf area fig 6a the inadequate soil moisture in 60 deficit schedules had negative effect such as reduction in leaf size and leaf curling that resulted in reduced leaf area roberts et al 1990 from pooled results relating three investigated phenological stages the net increase in leaf area varied with variation in net water used during particular phenological stage fig 6b at tillering stage where 0 deficit schedules at 183 192 mm water depth the net leaf area increase showed a value 53 7 61 2 dm2 but with gradual reduction in the water use of 30 water deficit schedules 161 165 mm the range reduced to 46 9 48 9 dm2 regarding the 60 water deficit schedules 107 117 mm water the net increase in leaf area moving downward with drastic decrement in its values reaching the range 31 8 34 8 dm2 fig 6b such reduction of net increase in leaf area in 60 water deficit schedules can be mainly attributed to the low tiller number as well as leaves there was a net decrease in leaf area value by increase in crop age fig 6b in grand growth stage net leaf area reaching the value 13 3 19 dm2 at 907 958 mm water use for 0 water deficit schedules at schedules of 30 water deficit it followed the same trend of net decrease between 10 and 13 1 dm2with reduced water use values 800 841 4 mm the 60 water deficit where water use depth was lower 627 3 648 2 mm the net decrease in leaf area was greater as 9 1 14 1 dm2 this leads to the conclusion that higher water deficit should be avoided under grand growth stage due to peak transpiration rate from the leaves which is expected to be relatively higher under the higher leaf area irrespective of deficit schedules a uniform gradual net decrease in leaf area occurred due to drying or falling of leaves in maturity stage inman bamber 1994 moreover the net water used also showed its value minimum with saturated soil layers attributing to low crop evapotranspiration in maturity stage thompson 1976 3 1 4 dry matter production the dry matter production is an index of potential crop yield which was favorably influenced under different water deficits the dry matter production values were low at 75 dat attributing to slow process of establishment of crop during initial period fig 7a however thereafter dry matter production increased with advancement in crop growth and reached its peak 1275 8 g plant 1 at harvest at 135 dat the trend of dry matter was similar to leaf area as mostly leaves represents the dry matter production at 135 195 and 255 dat 0 water deficit schedules t1 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 observed with significant more dry matter production values against remaining schedules the total dry matter production increased with increasing the irrigation level due to more nutrients uptake and higher photosynthesis rates pawar et al 2014 the notable reduction in dry matter production under 30 t13 t15 andt22 t24 and 60 water deficit schedules t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 of grand growth stage was also observed robertson and donaldson 1998 affirmed grand growth stage as most critical for water demand and the deficit during this period affects dry matter production and finally the cane yield nevertheless the water deficit schedules under continue 60 water deficit from tillering to grand stage t25 t27 gave significantly lowest values the pooled data also showed that there were not much increases in dry matter production during 255 dat to harvest because of slow down the cane elongation process towards maturity inman bamber and smith 2005 at harvest the like trend of dry matter production was obtained except high water deficit schedules of grand growth t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 were significantly lowest net increase of dry matter production over the phenological stage was common to all irrigation schedules but significantly larger values were noticed for grand growth stage fig 7b at tillering stage where adequate irrigation schedules used water approximately equal to each other 183 1 191 9 mm the dry matter productions reached to greater range of 109 2 126 3 g plant 1 however 30 water deficit schedules with 159 6 164 5 mm water the dry matter value reached 93 7 98 3 g plant 1 the lower water used in 60 water deficit schedules 106 5 117 mm dry matter range declined to 59 3 66 3 g plant 1 peak crop water demand at grand growth stage observed with variation in net increase in dry matter due to different water deficit depths applied the water deficit free schedules were found to be within 367 3 443 4 g plant 1 but with moderate values for 30 water deficit ranging between 328 9 and 353 6 g plant 1 the corresponding water use for 0 water deficit schedules t1 t3 t10 t12 t19 t21 was also greater in range of 907 2 958 3 mm then water depth moderately decreasing reaching to 799 7 841 4 mm for 30 schedules biomass accumulation in stalks is affected when the water deficit is greater than 120 mm inman bamber 1994 the measurements at 60 water deficit indicated that lowest net increase in dry matter 299 2 322 g plant 1 with lowest water used 627 648 2 mm water stress caused by low soil water availability influences the photosynthetic rate causing severe reduction in carbohydrate synthesis leaf expansion and internode elongation cardozo and sentelhas 2013 concerning the lower rate of cane elongation in maturity stage as a function of ripening process the net increase in dry matter for maturity stage behaved in a way similar to that previously discussed for tillers number and leaf area 3 2 yield contributing characters the pooled mean of two years of data showed that yield contributing characters decreased with increased in water deficit applied during sugarcane growth period table 4 at harvest the height of millable cane number of canes internode length internode circumference millable cane clump weight and single cane weight were remarkably high in 0 water deficit throughout the season t1 table 5 3 2 1 height of millable cane the deficit free irrigation schedule t1 consumed highest water 1338 9 mm and produced significantly tallest millable cane 350 5 cm however it was statistically on par with schedules those also had 0 water deficit in grand growth stage t2 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 though depth of total water used under these schedules was varying between 1154 5 and 1306 6 mm that was lesser that t1 table 6 it is clearly seen that net water use in grand growth stage was quite close in these schedules of the depth between 907 2 and 958 3 mm table 3 comparing the effect of water deficit on milliable cane heights it can be observed that for 30 deficit schedules t4 t6 t13 t15 and t22 t24 at grand growth stage the values always below the ones under 0 water deficit schedules significantly shorter millable cane heights attained in 60 water deficit irrigation schedules of grand growth stage t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 due to the inadequate soil moisture poor nutrient uptake that lowered the millable cane height roberts et al 1990 also reported the reduction in millable cane height under moisture deficit condition when compared to normal irrigated condition 3 2 2 number of internodes greater number of internodes noticed when deficit free environment was provided throughout the season 21 8 beneficial edge over effect of grand growth may be attributed to its positive effect on water uptake root growth and transpiration olivier and singels 2012 however internode number measured for 0 and 30 water deficit in grand growth stage had values very near to each other but relatively higher than those measured at 60 water deficit peak crop water demand during grand growth stages significantly decreased the number of internodes in 60 deficit irrigation schedules interestingly when 30 water deficit schedules switched over to 60 deficit in maturity stage t6 t15 and t24 their difference with 30 deficit irrigation schedules t5 t14 and t23 was noteworthy this revealed the need of adequate water supply during grand growth in maturity stage which increases the number of internodes so as yield inman bamber 1994 and shukla and lal 2003 also reported a smaller number of internodes in lower irrigation level the data also indicated that long duration of 60 water deficit in grand growth as well as in maturity stage the internode number drastically reduced corresponds to lower irrigation water amounts such schedules t9 t18 t27 had internode number values below the ones observed at 30 water deficit at maturity stage 3 2 3 internodes length the effect of water deficit for internode length followed a trend was identical to that previously discussed for milliable cane height where 0 water deficit schedules in grand growth t1 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 showed the significantly higher values the cell division and cell expansion under adequate water led to increase plant elongation rate in higher irrigation regimes roberts et al 1990 however the internodes length in 30 t4 t6 t13 t15 and t22 t24 and 60 t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 deficit schedules of grand growth was not so differentiable at harvest this was chiefly due to coinciding of monsoon period with grand growth period which favored soil water replenishment in 60 deficit schedules to some extent nevertheless the most water deficit throughout season schedule t27 with lowest water use 891 mm had smaller internode length as 12 6 cm robertson and donaldson 1998 reported that the moisture deficit reduces internodes length and occurrence of severe moisture deficit at grand growth stage drastically reduces the size of internodes 3 2 4 internodes circumference the most water deficit free throughout season t1 recorded significantly larger internode circumference 12 89 cm with higher water use of 1338 9 mm the effect of water deficit on cane circumference was alike as that of internode length however data presented demonstrated non significant variation in internode circumferences under 0 and 30 water deficit schedules applied in grand growth stage t1 t6 t10 t15 t19 t24 this may be due to contribution of rainfall to some extent in 30 deficit irrigation schedule the 60 water deficit schedules still noted with significantly lesser circumferences the irrigation schedules t25 t27 which are subjected to high water deficit right from transplanting to 255 dat for 8 5 months noted with lesser improvement in circumferences at harvest among all irrigation schedules wiedenfeld 2000 3 2 5 millable cane clump weight in this regard it was of interest to reveal the difference in milliable cane number and its weight as a function of changing water deficit under different water deficit schedules investigated the schedules of 0 water deficit during tillering stage followed by either 0 water deficit t1 t3 or 30 water deficit t4 t6 in grand growth stage attained statistically superior millable cane clump 1weight similarly schedules had 30 water deficit during tillering stage followed by 0 water deficit t10 t12 in grand growth stage was also statistically superior the effects of water deficit on growth can be compensated by an increase in the cane elongation because the plants are exposed to satisfactory soil water availability roberts et al 1990 ethan et al 2016 interestingly irrigation schedules had 60 water deficit during tillering stage followed by 0 water deficit in grand growth stage t19 t20 was also found significant this revealed that though 60 water deficit imposed during tillering stage sugarcane bears the capacity to add weight of clump 1if moisture deficit free environment is given during grand growth stage inman bamber 1994 the effect of irrigation was also pronounced in maturity stage the irrigation schedules which were subjected to 60 water deficit in grand growth stage followed by 0 water deficit in maturity stage t7 t16 improved the weights of millable canes clump 1 these results are in line of findings of wiedenfeld 2000 toor et al 1999 and schroedar et al 2000 the cane weight is related with weight of millable canes clump 1and thus showed similar trend except that 60 water deficit schedules in grand growth stage t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 yielded significantly lower cane weights significantly least number of single cane weight noted under high water deficit throughout the season irrigation schedule t27 3 3 yield response under different water deficits since sugarcane is a yearlong crop and required much quantity of water for its full growth significant effect of different water deficit imposed during different phenological stages was observed in both the seasons table 5 in first season the yield of sugarcane ranged between 96 6 and 187 2 t ha 1 whereas it ranged 118 2 to 175 8 t ha 1in second season the higher yield observed in irrigation schedule t1 0 no water deficit throughout the season in first season than second but yields of 60 deficit irrigation schedules improved in second season to some extent due to more rainfall as expected the increase in growth attributes and yield components under deficit free schedules of grand growth resulted into greater cane yields in both seasons as well as in pooled data earlier ramesh and mahadevaswamy 1999 inman bamber and smith 2005 mentioned grand growth stage as the most critical to water deficit since the most of sugarcane biomass is produced during this period owing to adequate soil moisture throughout the crop growth period without water deficit throughout season schedule t1 gave significantly maximum yield in both seasons and when the data pooled over the seasons 181 5 t ha 1 however pooled mean showed that t1yield was statistically on par with yield received in t2 t3 t10 t11 t12 t4 t5 t6 t19 and t20 irrigation schedules this revealed sugarcane is highly sensitive to high water deficit in grand growth moderate sensitive in tillering and low sensitive in maturity stage ramesh and mahadevaswamy 1999 wiedenfeld 2000 inman bamber and smith 2005 among these statistically non differed schedules t6 gave 161 5 t ha 1 yield with 13 3 less water use table 6 and hence considered as the best strategy for adopting deficit irrigation management under semi arid environments the sugarcane yields were minimum one at t27 in both the season 60 water deficit at all stages this was due to low availability of water in root zone which affected plant growth and yield contributing characters so as yield 3 3 1 yield response under uniform water deficit throughout season the pooled yield for t1 181 5 t ha 1 was statistically superior over t14 155 7 t ha 1 and t27 107 4 t ha 1 this strongly revealed that sugarcane cannot not tolerate continuous 30 water deficit throughout the season though it needs 15 less water 199 7 mm compared to t1 but it come out with 14 3 drop in yield 25 8 t ha 1 thus only in case of water scarcity the 30 water deficit throughout the season t14 is to be preferred on the same line 60 water deficit throughout the season t27 irrigation schedule gave significantly lowest yield in both the season indicating that severe moisture water deficit during tillering and grand growth stages caused drastic yield reduction mathew and varughese 2005 reported the drastic reduction in yield due to formative stage moisture water deficit 3 3 2 yield response under water deficit at tillering stage the water deficit amount and duration of phenological stage for which it was applied had profound effect on sugarcane yields the results emphasized that tillering stage is sensitive to water deficit next to grand growth stage and thus full irrigation is to be given under adequate water availability condition in this stage however under small water scarcity 30 water deficit may be imposed as irrigation schedule t10 resulted into 3 6 water saving 47 mm and 5 2 yield reduction 9 3 t ha 1 compared to t1 table 6 the corresponding values of water saving and yield reduction in 60 water deficit applied in tillering stage t19 were 9 8 130 6 mm and 11 7 20 9 t ha 1 respectively statistically the yields of these treatments were not superior to each other but schedule t19 had inferior yield thus 60 water deficit in tillering stage should be strictly avoided in semi arid environments as considerable reduction in tillers number is expected 3 3 3 yield response under water deficit at grand growth stage the grand growth stage has come out as most intolerant stage for water deficit in both the season as well as in pooled analysis table 5 however due to coincident with monsoon rainfall it became fairly sensitive for 30 deficit but still most sensitive stage for 60 water deficit in pooled analysis the irrigation schedule t4 resulted into 10 1 less water use 135 2 mm with 8 9 yield reduction 16 4 t ha 1 compared to t1 table 6 statistically the yields of treatment t1 and t4 are at par with each other this highlights that the soil moisture in 30 deficit stress was no longer the limiting factor for plant growth and crop yield increases under other factors of production it responded progressively to increased water levels dias and sentelhas 2019 under 60 water deficit the yield gap of t7 increase dropped down to 46 3 t ha 1 which was about 25 3 yield decrease over 0 water deficit no stress treatment t1 though there was 24 2 water saving 325 1 mm over t1 but yield is not affordable the grand growth stage attributed to peak water demand and low water application adversely dropped the available moisture in root zone so as yield 3 3 4 yield response under water deficit at maturity stage the sugarcane yields observed under 0 t1 30 t2 and 60 water deficit t3 at maturity stage were 181 5 180 3 and 177 9 t ha 1 respectively table 6 statistically the t1yield was not superior over yields of t2 and t3 in maturity stage due to decline in sugarcane water use the difference in irrigation depths of 0 and 60 schedules was not potential dingre and gorantiwar 2020 thompson and boyce 1971 this pointed out maturity stage as least sensitive to water deficit as irrigation schedule t2 resulted in 2 5 less water 32 3 mm with 0 7 decrease in yield 1 2 t ha 1 compared to t1 thus under small water scarcity during maturity stage 30 water deficit may be applied similarly irrigation schedule t3 was subjected to 60 water deficit at maturity stage resulted in water saving of 5 0 66 mm and yield reduction by 2 3 6 t ha 1 compared to t1 hence 60 water deficit at maturity stage can be considered when there is severe water scarcity 3 3 5 yield response under 30 water deficit the pooled yields obtained in 30 water deficit at tillering stage t10 at grand growth stage t4 and at maturity stage t2 were 172 2 165 1 and 180 3 t ha 1 respectively but the yields of these irrigation schedules were not statistically superior with each other these irrigation schedules registered 5 2 9 3 t ha 1 8 9 16 4 t ha 1 and 0 7 1 2 t ha 1 less yield compared to t1 respectively table 6 the corresponding water saving compared to no water deficit irrigation schedule t1 was 3 5 47 mm 10 1 135 2 mm and 2 5 32 3 mm respectively it clearly indicates that the 30 water deficit had least effect in maturity stage followed by tillering and grand growth stage of sugarcane dias and sentelhas 2018 3 3 6 yield response under 60 water deficit according to what discussed above it showed that 60 water deficit applied in more or less amounts in three phonological stages had adverse effect on growth and yield parameters as well as cane yield almost all the processes of plant require sufficient amount of water and its deficit in any process adversely affect the growth development as well as cane yield as most of the processes are interlinked pires et al 2014 pooled yield data of 60 water deficit at tillering stage t19 at grand growth stage t7 and at maturity stage t3 were 160 6 135 2 and 177 9 t ha 1 respectively the data come out from this investigation stated that these irrigation schedules registered 11 7 20 9 t ha 1 25 3 46 3 t ha 1 and 2 3 6 t ha 1 less yield compared to without water deficit irrigation schedule t1 respectively table 6 the corresponding water saving compared to t1 was 9 9 130 6 mm 24 2 325 1 mm and 5 0 66 mm respectively it is clear from above that 60 water deficit had profound negative effect on grand growth stage followed by tillering stage and maturity stage 3 4 crop water use the relationship between water deficit and crop yield is important for scheduling deficit irrigation the quantity water applied based on soil moisture content varied with different water deficit schedules and phonological stages table 6 the most deficit free schedule t1observed highest irrigation depth 990 8 mm whereas lowest one was found with most deficit schedule t27 573 8 mm the effective rain amount for all the irrigation schedules was same as 423 8 mm the water saving over highest water use schedule t1 was noticed in range of 2 5 33 4 comparing the water used for total growth season and its corresponding cane yields from two years pooled data it can be observed that irrigation schedules those obtained statistically at par yield were having water use as t1 1338 9 mm t2 1306 6 mm t3 1272 9 mm t10 1291 9 mm t11 1271 4 mm t12 1234 6 mm t4 1203 7 mm t5 1183 8 mm and t6 1160 2 mm respectively the irrigation schedule t6 gave 161 5 t ha 1yield with 13 3 less water use without significant reduction in yield as compared to high yielded irrigation schedule t1 4 conclusions irrigation is necessary in order to produce sugarcane in semiarid environments but water supplies are becoming increasing limited the use of water saving irrigation methods such as drip is being increasingly advocated and but other aspects especially the irrigation scheduling are largely ignored in such circumstances there could be the periods when less water than the required can be applied resulting in deficit irrigation it is therefore necessary to generate the knowledge of deficit irrigation strategies and this investigation specially emphasized on this aspect the huge experimentation carried out under combinations of water deficits imposed on different phenological stages to study the effect of each deficit on particular phenological stage the growth and yield contributing characters were totally depending on the variation of water deficit from one phenological stage to the other in the crop season the growth contributing characters were higher under 0 water deficit than that at 30 and 60 due to intensive water demand of yearlong sugarcane the net water use in different phenological stages was the factor that dominantly affected the net increase decrease in growth contributing characters trend under the studied schedules the highest water use was found to be in the grand growth stage the tillering stage was the next water sensitive stage after grand growth for sugarcane followed by maturity stage the yield contributing characters with 60 water deficit both in tillering stage where tillers survives and in grand growth where they converted into elongated millable cane showed to be statistically inferior values the cane yield influenced by different quantum of water deficit induced at different phenological stage of sugarcane there was a gradual yield decrement ranging 8 9 25 6 with decreasing the water use by 30 in grand growth where there was a contribution of rainfall 423 8 mm covering water deficit the 60 water deficit in grand growth showed to be drastic decrement in yield with a range of 25 3 40 6 a deficit irrigation strategy with 0 water deficit at tillering 30 water deficit at grand growth and 60 water deficit at maturity stage was found appropriate for optimum utilization of irrigation water in semi arid conditions the water use of sugarcane by field water balance was estimated as 1339 mm for water deficit free condition the water use of best deficit irrigation schedule t6 was estimated as 1160 mm conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest for this study declaration of competing interest the

10260,sugarcane is a high biomass crop which requires large amounts of water in a semiarid environment deficit irrigation is inevitable to produce acceptable yields the field experiments were conducted for two seasons 2015 and 2016 on sugarcane saccharum officinarum l by applying water deficit in three regimes 0 30 and 60 water deficit during three phenological stage tillering grand growth and maturity such that the effect of a specified water deficit during a specified phenological stage can be investigated separately the experiment formed 27 irrigation schedules replicated twice in randomized block design the irrigations were provided based on water deficit underlined in each irrigation schedule during different phenological stages on the basis of actual soil moisture in root zone the demonstrated data indicated that the net increase in growth characters with net water used within a phenological stage was to great extent affected by the grand growth stage the yield contributing characters and cane yield reduced with increase in water deficit imposed mainly in grand growth followed by tillering stage a water deficit imposed in maturity stage only marginal affected the yield the highest yield of sugarcane obtained underwater deficit free schedule 181 5 tha 1 30 and 60 water deficit throughout season noticed with significantly lower cane yield as 157 1 and 107 4 tha 1 respectively the relative cane yield reduction over water deficit free schedule registered between 0 7 and 40 6 with relative decrease in the water use by 2 5 33 4 a deficit irrigation strategy with 0 water deficit at tillering 30 at grand growth and 60 at maturity stage was found appropriate as it represents the non significant reduction in yield over water deficit free condition beside it leads to a 13 3 lesser water use based on soil moisture the total water use of sugarcane underwater deficit free and best deficit conditions were estimated as 1339 and 1160 mm respectively the study recommends to practice appropriate irrigation scheduling under water shortage situation for maximizing water use by providing irrigations as per requirement applying less water than required such that the overall productions are optimized keywords deficit irrigation sugarcane yield grand growth stage maturity stage tillering stage 0 30 60 water deficit schedules 1 introduction sugarcane saccharum spp is a tropical and subtropical crop which produces a large amount of biomass and requires substantial input of water to produce maximum yields wiedenfeld 2000 in semi arid regions of the world sugarcane is considered an important crop contributing to the respective national economy but water availability and its utilization scenario represents the unfavorable perspective for example semi arid india where large scale sugarcane cultivation is completely depends upon irrigation and water resources availability is a crucial limiting factor for sugarcane production monsoon variation and over exploited aquifer storage have resulted in shortage of fresh water supplies for irrigation use pawar et al 2013 the current share of water allocated for sugarcane which is a major consumer of water is low that it may not be possible to provide the irrigation water to sugarcane as per its water requirement during different growth stages it implies effective strategies for substantial agricultural water saving with optimized irrigation plan in this region under such circumstances we need to provide less water than required effecting forced paradigm deficit irrigation however in case the most critical stage of sugarcane is matched with the higher degree deficit irrigation there is possibility of greater yield reduction compared to the less critical growth stage matching with same degree of deficit irrigation based on the knowledge of crop sensitivity to water deficit for different phenological stages it is possible to develop irrigation scheduling recommendations to meet water requirements during deficit sensitive phenological stages and to impose deficits during less deficit sensitive stages win et al 2014 several investigations have been carried out in many growing regions of the world in order to develop an efficient deficit irrigation scheduling for sugarcane roberts et al 1990 singh and mohan 1994 robertson and donaldson 1998 singels et al 2000 inman bamber and smith 2005 jangpromma et al 2012 zhao et al 2010 2013 these studies indicate that when properly practiced deficit irrigation may maximize water productivity while maintaining sugarcane yields and quality at acceptable economic levels however most previous research on water deficit in sugarcane has concentrated only on imposing uniform water deficit in any phenological stage particularly with respect to drying off management under full irrigation and its consequences for yield it is necessary to have a full understanding of trade offs between yield and water deficit applied in a particular phenological stage and its consequences on next phenological stage to formulate proper deficit irrigation management strategies this indicates the need of systematic study on deficit irrigation management for sugarcane in terms of estimating the yield when different water deficit is applied during different phenological stages of sugarcane hence objective proposed in this study is to generate the appropriate information on deficit irrigation for sugarcane cultivated under semiarid environment 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were carried out during the annual seasons of 2015 and 2016 at experimental farm of mahatma phule krishi vidyapeeth rahuri located in the western part of maharashtra india latitude 19 48 n longitude 190 57 e altitude 657 m agro climatically the region falls under the semiarid and sub tropical zone with average annual rainfall of 555 mm the distribution of rain is uneven and is distributed over 15 45 rainy days the daily measurements of meteorological variables were recorded from an automated meteorological station situated at sugarcane experimental field and monthly mean are summarized in table 1 the maximum and minimum temperature ranged from 27 6 c to 39 5 c and 10 4 c to 24 1 c respectively the maximum and minimum relative humidity ranged between 38 to 80 3 and 20 5 68 6 respectively the sunshine hours ranged between 1 7 to 9 9 h days 1 while the pan evaporation ranged between 4 to 10 9 mm day 1 the wind speed ranged between 0 5 to 9 kmhr 1 the reference evapotranspiration ranged between 2 3 and 6 1 mm day 1 the highest rainfall of 124 1 mm observed during may month of second season with highest rainfall event of 71 mm fig 1 2 2 soil moisture constants the textural class of the soil of experimental site was clay the soil was medium alkaline in reaction ph 8 36 with electrical conductivity 0 40 ds m 1 the depth of soil was 1 8 m the layer wise volumetric field capacity and permanent wilting point available moisture and allowable deficit are given in table 2 the average field capacity and permanent wilting point was 52 7 cm cm 1 and 21 6 cm cm 1 respectively with bulk density was 1 27 mgm 3 the average allowable depletion depth was 32 5 cm cm 1 2 3 experimental details experiments were carried out in randomized block design rbd with 27 irrigation schedules replicated twice based on different combinations of the quantity of water deficit 0 deficit 0 00d 30 deficit 0 30d and 60 deficit 0 60d applied during different crop phenological stages viz tillering stage ts 0 90 days after transplanting dat grand growth stage ggs 91 255 dat and maturity stage ms 256 315 dat sugarcane seedlings cultivar com 265 were prepared for transplanting in field after forty days of raising nursery the sugarcane seedlings were transplanted at single row of 1 50 0 60 m spacing the growth period was divided into three stages tillering grand growth and maturity the tillering stage was just after transplanting the seedlings when tillers are starts to emerge from mother shoot and ends when tiller starts to elongate at the beginning of grand growth the grand growth stage was from then up to the timing when cane has achieved its full growth the maturity stage continued from then until harvest these three phenological stages corresponds to those defined in fao 56 allen et al 1998 respectively as development mid season and end season the irrigation schedule comprising different water deficit and different crop phenological stage were made in such a way that effect of specific water deficit during specific crop phenological stage can be studied independently the combinations of the irrigation schedules with water quantity used are given in table 3 the 27 irrigation schedules were arranged randomly in a field of 110 m x 70 m the length and width of each net plot was 13 5 m x 6 m the irrigation schedules were separated by a distance of 3 m while the replication plots in each irrigation schedule were separated by a distance of 1 5 m which serves as buffer to minimize lateral movement of water from one plot to another one additional plot was provided for recording observations on root zone depth the layout of experiment and an individual plot are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively 2 4 irrigation scheduling there are several methods for imposing water deficit both in terms of timing and amount of water to be applied to sugarcane including direct soil water monitoring and calculated crop water use based on weather data volumetric water content can be determined using a neutron probe or time domain reflectometry tdr soil water tensiometers and electrical resistance sensors however these methods do not consider measurement of rainfall or soil moisture storage in this study soil moisture estimates are done gravimetrically including soil water holding capacity and rooting depth to impose water deficit a soil water replenishment approach is then utilized to estimate irrigation water requirement of crop the irrigation scheduling was based on available soil moisture content of respective irrigation schedules the water deficit was imposed on the basis of available soil moisture content in the root zone the soil moisture measurements were made for each 0 15 m layer in the soil proﬁle to the depth of root zone the effective root zone was determined by carefully digging and then uprooting one healthy plant the depth of water applied for irrigation was calculated according to the following formula michael 2010 d i 1 n fc i mc i 100 x bd i x d i fci field capacity for ith layer mci moisture content at the time of irrigation bdi bulk density of soil for ith layer gm cc 1 di effective root zone depth for ith layer cm n number of soil layers sampled in the root zone depth the actual depths of irrigation water were applied according to the irrigation schedules the actual irrigation depth i relative to each irrigation schedule was calculated before irrigation according to the following formula i d dxkdt where i irrigation depth of respective irrigation schedule mm kdt target deficit coefficient relative to each irrigation schedule 0 0 3 and 0 6 for 0 30 and 60 deficit respectively the irrigations were scheduled at every 8 10 days interval by drip irrigation as per water deficit underlined in each irrigation schedule the drip irrigation system was installed only to meet out crop water requirement in exact manner the drip system configured with the single row planting of sugarcane where distance between two laterals and emitters was 1 5 m and 0 4 m respectively fig 3 the irrigation schedule starts after 15 dat in field and stopped before 15 days of harvesting the effective rainfall was computed by criteria mentioned in fao document no 25 dastane 1974 2 5 growth and yield contributing characters the periodical growth characters plant height number of tiller or millable canes leaf area and dry matter accumulation and yield contributing characters height of millable cane internode number internode length internode circumference cane weight per clump 1 and single cane weight were recorded initially five sugarcane clumps from each replication were selected randomly labeled with pegs and red cloth and subsequently used for recording biometric observations at different phenological stages the periodical growth observation started from 75 dat and were taken at 60 days interval upto harvest of 315 dat crop the observation of yield and yield contributing characters were taken at harvest the yield was recorded for individual plot and expressed as t ha 1 the other agronomic practice viz weeding off barring earthing up and fertigation schedule were followed as per recommended by parent agricultural university mahatma phule krishi vidyapeeth rahuri 2 6 statistical analysis the data obtained from the experimentation analyzed for individual year and pooled for 2 years analysis of variance anova was carried out using f test panse and sukhatme 1995 least significant difference lsd method was used to determine whether differences existed between certain comparisons using software drysoft the standard error of mean se m was worked out whenever the results were found to be significant the critical difference cd at 5 level of significance p 0 05 was worked out and presented the pooled analysis was done for all important growth and yield characters of the study 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth contributing characters 3 1 1 plant height the plant heights linearly increased with increase in water used by sugarcane fig 4a significantly taller plant height observed in water deficit free irrigation schedules throughout season as a fact of maintaining the soil moisture at a higher level fig 3a and b olivier and singels 2012 and kumar et al 2014 reported water use match with the crop growth demand along with the good soil aeration favours the faster cell division and cell elongation the difference of water caused significantly difference in plant heights of irrigation schedules the full season water deficit of 0 t1 the plant height increased with full water use at the order of 1338 9 mm and reach high values of 406 7 cm the full season 30 water deficit t14 plant height remains low 326 2 cm which exercised a low water use of 1139 2 mm the full season 60 water deficit t27 was applied with lower water depth of 891 mm therefore plant heights decreased at its shortest as 258 cm fig 4a in tillering stage 75 dat 30 deficit irrigation schedules t10 t18 received water in range of 210 215 mm that was greater over 60 deficit t19 t27 with range as 157 167 mm but in grand growth 135 195 and 255 dat 30 t4 t6 t13 t15 and t22 t24 and 60 deficit irrigation schedules t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 did not differed significantly this was probably due to concurrent of monsoon rainfall with grand growth stage that diminished the plant heights difference in 30 and 60 deficit irrigation schedules taking into account the net water use during particular phonological stage and considering the net increase in plant height there was greater plant height noticed for grand growth than for maturity and tillering stages fig 4b as a function of cane elongation in grand growth stage the net increase in plant heights has the higher values of 274 cm with respect to higher water use 958 mm this also indicates that water deficit for sugarcane in this stage is not advisable in tillering stage the net increase in water use recorded was 192 mm and net increases in plant heights to reach values of 74 5 cm the maturity stage with net increase in water use of 138 mm the net increase in plant height was around 27 8 cm 3 1 2 number of tiller or millable canes at all days of observation greater tillers obtained in 0 water deficit schedules fig 5a mainly due to early vigorous growth of the plant with the adequate availability of water irrespective of irrigation schedules the tillers number increased up to 135 dat and then decreased at 195 dat attributed to the mortality of shoots with crop age kannan et al 2007 the numbers of tillers millable cane further reduced at 255 dat and then at harvest as a part of survival strategy of plant during cane formation and development process the average mortality of tillers was 6 tillers plant 1 for all treatments however treatments under 0 water deficit was found least affected because of high tillers count at 135 dat fig 5a the highest number of tillers in crop season for deficit irrigation schedules of 0 t1 30 t14 and 60 t27 were 17 6 15 and 11 2respectively the water use under grand growth stage had large depths 600 887 mm and higher trends of tillers number for 0 deficit ranging from a minimum of 10 1 to a maximum 17 6 while at the 30 deficit of 9 3 and 15 1 tiller number varied for 60 water deficit from 6 8 to 13 fig 5a the decrement in irrigation depths during grand growth stage in 60 water deficit was considerable which directly affected the water uptake and adversely attributed to the mortality of shoots in these treatments scarpari and beauclair 2004 significantly the least number of tillers were recorded under most water deficit schedule t27 due to reduced soil moisture therefore reducing nutrient uptake which in turn resulted into a smaller number of millable at harvest table 4 to study how much water that utilized for tiller number variation in particular phenological stage the net increase decrease of tiller number with net increase in water amount was demonstrated in fig 5b in telliring stage the higher tiller production with higher survival capacity under water deficit free condition t1 t9 resulted into greater millable canes than 30 water deficit schedules t10 t18 this strongly recommends to avoid 30 water deficit in tillering stage for 0 water deficit schedules in tillering stage t1 t9 the net water use varies between 183 to 192 mm likewise in grand growth 0 water deficit irrigation schedules t1 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 significantly produced higher number of millable canes clump 1 than other irrigation schedules for grand growth stage major net increase of 907 958 mm water high increase in tiller number of about 1 8 2 6 due to formation of canes has been registered in 30 water deficit there is a moderate increase in tiller number of about 2 2 4 with net increase in water ranged between 800 and 841 mm in 60 water deficit the water use was too low of about 627 648 mm and tiller number ends up between 1 5 and 1 9 however there was a negligible loss in cane number between grand growth and maturity stage this was mainly because of marginal difference of water used in irrigation schedules of maturity stage due to reduction in crop evapotranspiration dingre and gorantiwar 2020 3 1 3 leaf area leaf area between observation days for all irrigation schedules exhibited in a way similar to that previously discussed for number of tillers where there was an increase in leaf area from 75 to 195 dat and then decreased at 255 dat and at harvest fig 6a this was chiefly because of expedite vegetative growth of tillers as a typical character of sugarcane during grand growth stage 75 195 dat the results revealed that at 75 dat 0 deficit schedules t1 t9 were significantly higher than 30 t10 t18 and 60 deficit schedules t19 t27 the irrigation schedules other than adequate watered caused more deficit to the plants that lead to the reduction in number of leaves leaf area and less production of chlorophyll carr and knox 2011 however the leaf area decreased slightly at 135 dat in all irrigation schedules mainly due to damage of few bottom leaves in earthing up operation at grand growth 195 dat the leaf area again increased due to higher crop growth and reached to its highest value in addition monsoon rainfall during grand growth stage fig 1 compensated the water deficit effect in leaf area for 30 t13 t15 and t22 t24 and 60 deficit schedules t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 nevertheless adequate water used in 0 deficit schedules t1 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 found with higher values of leaf area fig 6a notably there was a decrease in leaf area of all irrigation schedules at 255 dat mainly due falling of old leaves with crop age likewise leaf area further declined thereafter at harvest due to senescene of leaves at 255 dat and at harvest the leaf area followed a trend was identical to that for 195 dat that is adequate irrigation schedules in grand growth stage continued with higher leaf area fig 6a the inadequate soil moisture in 60 deficit schedules had negative effect such as reduction in leaf size and leaf curling that resulted in reduced leaf area roberts et al 1990 from pooled results relating three investigated phenological stages the net increase in leaf area varied with variation in net water used during particular phenological stage fig 6b at tillering stage where 0 deficit schedules at 183 192 mm water depth the net leaf area increase showed a value 53 7 61 2 dm2 but with gradual reduction in the water use of 30 water deficit schedules 161 165 mm the range reduced to 46 9 48 9 dm2 regarding the 60 water deficit schedules 107 117 mm water the net increase in leaf area moving downward with drastic decrement in its values reaching the range 31 8 34 8 dm2 fig 6b such reduction of net increase in leaf area in 60 water deficit schedules can be mainly attributed to the low tiller number as well as leaves there was a net decrease in leaf area value by increase in crop age fig 6b in grand growth stage net leaf area reaching the value 13 3 19 dm2 at 907 958 mm water use for 0 water deficit schedules at schedules of 30 water deficit it followed the same trend of net decrease between 10 and 13 1 dm2with reduced water use values 800 841 4 mm the 60 water deficit where water use depth was lower 627 3 648 2 mm the net decrease in leaf area was greater as 9 1 14 1 dm2 this leads to the conclusion that higher water deficit should be avoided under grand growth stage due to peak transpiration rate from the leaves which is expected to be relatively higher under the higher leaf area irrespective of deficit schedules a uniform gradual net decrease in leaf area occurred due to drying or falling of leaves in maturity stage inman bamber 1994 moreover the net water used also showed its value minimum with saturated soil layers attributing to low crop evapotranspiration in maturity stage thompson 1976 3 1 4 dry matter production the dry matter production is an index of potential crop yield which was favorably influenced under different water deficits the dry matter production values were low at 75 dat attributing to slow process of establishment of crop during initial period fig 7a however thereafter dry matter production increased with advancement in crop growth and reached its peak 1275 8 g plant 1 at harvest at 135 dat the trend of dry matter was similar to leaf area as mostly leaves represents the dry matter production at 135 195 and 255 dat 0 water deficit schedules t1 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 observed with significant more dry matter production values against remaining schedules the total dry matter production increased with increasing the irrigation level due to more nutrients uptake and higher photosynthesis rates pawar et al 2014 the notable reduction in dry matter production under 30 t13 t15 andt22 t24 and 60 water deficit schedules t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 of grand growth stage was also observed robertson and donaldson 1998 affirmed grand growth stage as most critical for water demand and the deficit during this period affects dry matter production and finally the cane yield nevertheless the water deficit schedules under continue 60 water deficit from tillering to grand stage t25 t27 gave significantly lowest values the pooled data also showed that there were not much increases in dry matter production during 255 dat to harvest because of slow down the cane elongation process towards maturity inman bamber and smith 2005 at harvest the like trend of dry matter production was obtained except high water deficit schedules of grand growth t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 were significantly lowest net increase of dry matter production over the phenological stage was common to all irrigation schedules but significantly larger values were noticed for grand growth stage fig 7b at tillering stage where adequate irrigation schedules used water approximately equal to each other 183 1 191 9 mm the dry matter productions reached to greater range of 109 2 126 3 g plant 1 however 30 water deficit schedules with 159 6 164 5 mm water the dry matter value reached 93 7 98 3 g plant 1 the lower water used in 60 water deficit schedules 106 5 117 mm dry matter range declined to 59 3 66 3 g plant 1 peak crop water demand at grand growth stage observed with variation in net increase in dry matter due to different water deficit depths applied the water deficit free schedules were found to be within 367 3 443 4 g plant 1 but with moderate values for 30 water deficit ranging between 328 9 and 353 6 g plant 1 the corresponding water use for 0 water deficit schedules t1 t3 t10 t12 t19 t21 was also greater in range of 907 2 958 3 mm then water depth moderately decreasing reaching to 799 7 841 4 mm for 30 schedules biomass accumulation in stalks is affected when the water deficit is greater than 120 mm inman bamber 1994 the measurements at 60 water deficit indicated that lowest net increase in dry matter 299 2 322 g plant 1 with lowest water used 627 648 2 mm water stress caused by low soil water availability influences the photosynthetic rate causing severe reduction in carbohydrate synthesis leaf expansion and internode elongation cardozo and sentelhas 2013 concerning the lower rate of cane elongation in maturity stage as a function of ripening process the net increase in dry matter for maturity stage behaved in a way similar to that previously discussed for tillers number and leaf area 3 2 yield contributing characters the pooled mean of two years of data showed that yield contributing characters decreased with increased in water deficit applied during sugarcane growth period table 4 at harvest the height of millable cane number of canes internode length internode circumference millable cane clump weight and single cane weight were remarkably high in 0 water deficit throughout the season t1 table 5 3 2 1 height of millable cane the deficit free irrigation schedule t1 consumed highest water 1338 9 mm and produced significantly tallest millable cane 350 5 cm however it was statistically on par with schedules those also had 0 water deficit in grand growth stage t2 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 though depth of total water used under these schedules was varying between 1154 5 and 1306 6 mm that was lesser that t1 table 6 it is clearly seen that net water use in grand growth stage was quite close in these schedules of the depth between 907 2 and 958 3 mm table 3 comparing the effect of water deficit on milliable cane heights it can be observed that for 30 deficit schedules t4 t6 t13 t15 and t22 t24 at grand growth stage the values always below the ones under 0 water deficit schedules significantly shorter millable cane heights attained in 60 water deficit irrigation schedules of grand growth stage t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 due to the inadequate soil moisture poor nutrient uptake that lowered the millable cane height roberts et al 1990 also reported the reduction in millable cane height under moisture deficit condition when compared to normal irrigated condition 3 2 2 number of internodes greater number of internodes noticed when deficit free environment was provided throughout the season 21 8 beneficial edge over effect of grand growth may be attributed to its positive effect on water uptake root growth and transpiration olivier and singels 2012 however internode number measured for 0 and 30 water deficit in grand growth stage had values very near to each other but relatively higher than those measured at 60 water deficit peak crop water demand during grand growth stages significantly decreased the number of internodes in 60 deficit irrigation schedules interestingly when 30 water deficit schedules switched over to 60 deficit in maturity stage t6 t15 and t24 their difference with 30 deficit irrigation schedules t5 t14 and t23 was noteworthy this revealed the need of adequate water supply during grand growth in maturity stage which increases the number of internodes so as yield inman bamber 1994 and shukla and lal 2003 also reported a smaller number of internodes in lower irrigation level the data also indicated that long duration of 60 water deficit in grand growth as well as in maturity stage the internode number drastically reduced corresponds to lower irrigation water amounts such schedules t9 t18 t27 had internode number values below the ones observed at 30 water deficit at maturity stage 3 2 3 internodes length the effect of water deficit for internode length followed a trend was identical to that previously discussed for milliable cane height where 0 water deficit schedules in grand growth t1 t3 t10 t12 and t19 t21 showed the significantly higher values the cell division and cell expansion under adequate water led to increase plant elongation rate in higher irrigation regimes roberts et al 1990 however the internodes length in 30 t4 t6 t13 t15 and t22 t24 and 60 t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 deficit schedules of grand growth was not so differentiable at harvest this was chiefly due to coinciding of monsoon period with grand growth period which favored soil water replenishment in 60 deficit schedules to some extent nevertheless the most water deficit throughout season schedule t27 with lowest water use 891 mm had smaller internode length as 12 6 cm robertson and donaldson 1998 reported that the moisture deficit reduces internodes length and occurrence of severe moisture deficit at grand growth stage drastically reduces the size of internodes 3 2 4 internodes circumference the most water deficit free throughout season t1 recorded significantly larger internode circumference 12 89 cm with higher water use of 1338 9 mm the effect of water deficit on cane circumference was alike as that of internode length however data presented demonstrated non significant variation in internode circumferences under 0 and 30 water deficit schedules applied in grand growth stage t1 t6 t10 t15 t19 t24 this may be due to contribution of rainfall to some extent in 30 deficit irrigation schedule the 60 water deficit schedules still noted with significantly lesser circumferences the irrigation schedules t25 t27 which are subjected to high water deficit right from transplanting to 255 dat for 8 5 months noted with lesser improvement in circumferences at harvest among all irrigation schedules wiedenfeld 2000 3 2 5 millable cane clump weight in this regard it was of interest to reveal the difference in milliable cane number and its weight as a function of changing water deficit under different water deficit schedules investigated the schedules of 0 water deficit during tillering stage followed by either 0 water deficit t1 t3 or 30 water deficit t4 t6 in grand growth stage attained statistically superior millable cane clump 1weight similarly schedules had 30 water deficit during tillering stage followed by 0 water deficit t10 t12 in grand growth stage was also statistically superior the effects of water deficit on growth can be compensated by an increase in the cane elongation because the plants are exposed to satisfactory soil water availability roberts et al 1990 ethan et al 2016 interestingly irrigation schedules had 60 water deficit during tillering stage followed by 0 water deficit in grand growth stage t19 t20 was also found significant this revealed that though 60 water deficit imposed during tillering stage sugarcane bears the capacity to add weight of clump 1if moisture deficit free environment is given during grand growth stage inman bamber 1994 the effect of irrigation was also pronounced in maturity stage the irrigation schedules which were subjected to 60 water deficit in grand growth stage followed by 0 water deficit in maturity stage t7 t16 improved the weights of millable canes clump 1 these results are in line of findings of wiedenfeld 2000 toor et al 1999 and schroedar et al 2000 the cane weight is related with weight of millable canes clump 1and thus showed similar trend except that 60 water deficit schedules in grand growth stage t7 t9 t16 t18 and t25 t27 yielded significantly lower cane weights significantly least number of single cane weight noted under high water deficit throughout the season irrigation schedule t27 3 3 yield response under different water deficits since sugarcane is a yearlong crop and required much quantity of water for its full growth significant effect of different water deficit imposed during different phenological stages was observed in both the seasons table 5 in first season the yield of sugarcane ranged between 96 6 and 187 2 t ha 1 whereas it ranged 118 2 to 175 8 t ha 1in second season the higher yield observed in irrigation schedule t1 0 no water deficit throughout the season in first season than second but yields of 60 deficit irrigation schedules improved in second season to some extent due to more rainfall as expected the increase in growth attributes and yield components under deficit free schedules of grand growth resulted into greater cane yields in both seasons as well as in pooled data earlier ramesh and mahadevaswamy 1999 inman bamber and smith 2005 mentioned grand growth stage as the most critical to water deficit since the most of sugarcane biomass is produced during this period owing to adequate soil moisture throughout the crop growth period without water deficit throughout season schedule t1 gave significantly maximum yield in both seasons and when the data pooled over the seasons 181 5 t ha 1 however pooled mean showed that t1yield was statistically on par with yield received in t2 t3 t10 t11 t12 t4 t5 t6 t19 and t20 irrigation schedules this revealed sugarcane is highly sensitive to high water deficit in grand growth moderate sensitive in tillering and low sensitive in maturity stage ramesh and mahadevaswamy 1999 wiedenfeld 2000 inman bamber and smith 2005 among these statistically non differed schedules t6 gave 161 5 t ha 1 yield with 13 3 less water use table 6 and hence considered as the best strategy for adopting deficit irrigation management under semi arid environments the sugarcane yields were minimum one at t27 in both the season 60 water deficit at all stages this was due to low availability of water in root zone which affected plant growth and yield contributing characters so as yield 3 3 1 yield response under uniform water deficit throughout season the pooled yield for t1 181 5 t ha 1 was statistically superior over t14 155 7 t ha 1 and t27 107 4 t ha 1 this strongly revealed that sugarcane cannot not tolerate continuous 30 water deficit throughout the season though it needs 15 less water 199 7 mm compared to t1 but it come out with 14 3 drop in yield 25 8 t ha 1 thus only in case of water scarcity the 30 water deficit throughout the season t14 is to be preferred on the same line 60 water deficit throughout the season t27 irrigation schedule gave significantly lowest yield in both the season indicating that severe moisture water deficit during tillering and grand growth stages caused drastic yield reduction mathew and varughese 2005 reported the drastic reduction in yield due to formative stage moisture water deficit 3 3 2 yield response under water deficit at tillering stage the water deficit amount and duration of phenological stage for which it was applied had profound effect on sugarcane yields the results emphasized that tillering stage is sensitive to water deficit next to grand growth stage and thus full irrigation is to be given under adequate water availability condition in this stage however under small water scarcity 30 water deficit may be imposed as irrigation schedule t10 resulted into 3 6 water saving 47 mm and 5 2 yield reduction 9 3 t ha 1 compared to t1 table 6 the corresponding values of water saving and yield reduction in 60 water deficit applied in tillering stage t19 were 9 8 130 6 mm and 11 7 20 9 t ha 1 respectively statistically the yields of these treatments were not superior to each other but schedule t19 had inferior yield thus 60 water deficit in tillering stage should be strictly avoided in semi arid environments as considerable reduction in tillers number is expected 3 3 3 yield response under water deficit at grand growth stage the grand growth stage has come out as most intolerant stage for water deficit in both the season as well as in pooled analysis table 5 however due to coincident with monsoon rainfall it became fairly sensitive for 30 deficit but still most sensitive stage for 60 water deficit in pooled analysis the irrigation schedule t4 resulted into 10 1 less water use 135 2 mm with 8 9 yield reduction 16 4 t ha 1 compared to t1 table 6 statistically the yields of treatment t1 and t4 are at par with each other this highlights that the soil moisture in 30 deficit stress was no longer the limiting factor for plant growth and crop yield increases under other factors of production it responded progressively to increased water levels dias and sentelhas 2019 under 60 water deficit the yield gap of t7 increase dropped down to 46 3 t ha 1 which was about 25 3 yield decrease over 0 water deficit no stress treatment t1 though there was 24 2 water saving 325 1 mm over t1 but yield is not affordable the grand growth stage attributed to peak water demand and low water application adversely dropped the available moisture in root zone so as yield 3 3 4 yield response under water deficit at maturity stage the sugarcane yields observed under 0 t1 30 t2 and 60 water deficit t3 at maturity stage were 181 5 180 3 and 177 9 t ha 1 respectively table 6 statistically the t1yield was not superior over yields of t2 and t3 in maturity stage due to decline in sugarcane water use the difference in irrigation depths of 0 and 60 schedules was not potential dingre and gorantiwar 2020 thompson and boyce 1971 this pointed out maturity stage as least sensitive to water deficit as irrigation schedule t2 resulted in 2 5 less water 32 3 mm with 0 7 decrease in yield 1 2 t ha 1 compared to t1 thus under small water scarcity during maturity stage 30 water deficit may be applied similarly irrigation schedule t3 was subjected to 60 water deficit at maturity stage resulted in water saving of 5 0 66 mm and yield reduction by 2 3 6 t ha 1 compared to t1 hence 60 water deficit at maturity stage can be considered when there is severe water scarcity 3 3 5 yield response under 30 water deficit the pooled yields obtained in 30 water deficit at tillering stage t10 at grand growth stage t4 and at maturity stage t2 were 172 2 165 1 and 180 3 t ha 1 respectively but the yields of these irrigation schedules were not statistically superior with each other these irrigation schedules registered 5 2 9 3 t ha 1 8 9 16 4 t ha 1 and 0 7 1 2 t ha 1 less yield compared to t1 respectively table 6 the corresponding water saving compared to no water deficit irrigation schedule t1 was 3 5 47 mm 10 1 135 2 mm and 2 5 32 3 mm respectively it clearly indicates that the 30 water deficit had least effect in maturity stage followed by tillering and grand growth stage of sugarcane dias and sentelhas 2018 3 3 6 yield response under 60 water deficit according to what discussed above it showed that 60 water deficit applied in more or less amounts in three phonological stages had adverse effect on growth and yield parameters as well as cane yield almost all the processes of plant require sufficient amount of water and its deficit in any process adversely affect the growth development as well as cane yield as most of the processes are interlinked pires et al 2014 pooled yield data of 60 water deficit at tillering stage t19 at grand growth stage t7 and at maturity stage t3 were 160 6 135 2 and 177 9 t ha 1 respectively the data come out from this investigation stated that these irrigation schedules registered 11 7 20 9 t ha 1 25 3 46 3 t ha 1 and 2 3 6 t ha 1 less yield compared to without water deficit irrigation schedule t1 respectively table 6 the corresponding water saving compared to t1 was 9 9 130 6 mm 24 2 325 1 mm and 5 0 66 mm respectively it is clear from above that 60 water deficit had profound negative effect on grand growth stage followed by tillering stage and maturity stage 3 4 crop water use the relationship between water deficit and crop yield is important for scheduling deficit irrigation the quantity water applied based on soil moisture content varied with different water deficit schedules and phonological stages table 6 the most deficit free schedule t1observed highest irrigation depth 990 8 mm whereas lowest one was found with most deficit schedule t27 573 8 mm the effective rain amount for all the irrigation schedules was same as 423 8 mm the water saving over highest water use schedule t1 was noticed in range of 2 5 33 4 comparing the water used for total growth season and its corresponding cane yields from two years pooled data it can be observed that irrigation schedules those obtained statistically at par yield were having water use as t1 1338 9 mm t2 1306 6 mm t3 1272 9 mm t10 1291 9 mm t11 1271 4 mm t12 1234 6 mm t4 1203 7 mm t5 1183 8 mm and t6 1160 2 mm respectively the irrigation schedule t6 gave 161 5 t ha 1yield with 13 3 less water use without significant reduction in yield as compared to high yielded irrigation schedule t1 4 conclusions irrigation is necessary in order to produce sugarcane in semiarid environments but water supplies are becoming increasing limited the use of water saving irrigation methods such as drip is being increasingly advocated and but other aspects especially the irrigation scheduling are largely ignored in such circumstances there could be the periods when less water than the required can be applied resulting in deficit irrigation it is therefore necessary to generate the knowledge of deficit irrigation strategies and this investigation specially emphasized on this aspect the huge experimentation carried out under combinations of water deficits imposed on different phenological stages to study the effect of each deficit on particular phenological stage the growth and yield contributing characters were totally depending on the variation of water deficit from one phenological stage to the other in the crop season the growth contributing characters were higher under 0 water deficit than that at 30 and 60 due to intensive water demand of yearlong sugarcane the net water use in different phenological stages was the factor that dominantly affected the net increase decrease in growth contributing characters trend under the studied schedules the highest water use was found to be in the grand growth stage the tillering stage was the next water sensitive stage after grand growth for sugarcane followed by maturity stage the yield contributing characters with 60 water deficit both in tillering stage where tillers survives and in grand growth where they converted into elongated millable cane showed to be statistically inferior values the cane yield influenced by different quantum of water deficit induced at different phenological stage of sugarcane there was a gradual yield decrement ranging 8 9 25 6 with decreasing the water use by 30 in grand growth where there was a contribution of rainfall 423 8 mm covering water deficit the 60 water deficit in grand growth showed to be drastic decrement in yield with a range of 25 3 40 6 a deficit irrigation strategy with 0 water deficit at tillering 30 water deficit at grand growth and 60 water deficit at maturity stage was found appropriate for optimum utilization of irrigation water in semi arid conditions the water use of sugarcane by field water balance was estimated as 1339 mm for water deficit free condition the water use of best deficit irrigation schedule t6 was estimated as 1160 mm conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest for this study declaration of competing interest the

p160 was conducted in the cotton growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 the results showed that γ pga application significantly increased the sws of root zone and decreased water consumption γ pga

profit functions of γ pga application we found that the highest water fertilizer productivity and net profit were achieved when γ pga application rate was 65 kg ha 1 therefore this study suggested that 65 kg ha 1 might be recommended as an appropriate γ pga application strategy to deal with water scarcity and improve economic benefit and water fertilizer productivity in barren desertified soils of northwest china keywords poly γ glutamic acid soil aggregates nitrogen and phosphorus uptake efficiency economic benefit cotton growth 1 introduction water shortage and soil degradation have been identified as the two major factors affecting agriculture production especially in arid and semi arid areas of northwest china fan et al 2012 li et al 2015 dai et al 2019 southern xinjiang is a typical arid region located in northwest china wang et al 2014a liang et al 2019 in the past 60 years the annual average rainfall in southern xinjiang was less than 60 mm and the annual average potential evaporation was more than 2800 mm according to analyzing the meteorological data from china meteorological data network http data cma cn the long term extreme climatic conditions such as rare rainfall strong evaporation and severe drought can result in severe environmental problems such as the conversion of arable lands into desertified soils and the reduction of freshwater resource vicente serrano et al 2015 under the dual pressure of water shortage and land desertification therefore exploring effective measures of improving the resilience of agro ecosystems to serious environmental problems has important practical significance a study reported by yang and cheng 2004 has indicated that the total amount of brackish water that can be used for agricultural production is approximately 13 billion m3 in china the development and utilization of available brackish water may be an efficient measure to alleviate the shortage of agriculture freshwater resources in arid regions of china letey et al 2011 selim et al 2013 in recent years brackish water with total dissolved solids tds between 2 g l 1 and 3 g l 1 has been widely used for agriculture production especially in southern xinjiang wang et al 2014a li et al 2015 tan et al 2017 chen et al 2018a for example some researchers have reported that shallow brackish water can be used as an available source for irrigation to make up for the shortage of freshwater resources and contribute to agriculture production in southern xinjiang chen et al 2010 wang et al 2011 2014a li et al 2015 chen et al 2018a in this study we only tried to use brackish water as an available source for irrigation but the effects of brackish water were not investigated because there was no freshwater control the desertified soils i e those with 10 clay and 80 sand in this experimental site have poor water holding capacity whc andry et al 2009 which can result in decreasing water use efficiency and increasing nutrient loss jovanovic et al 2009 liu et al 2012 haider et al 2017 haider et al 2017 also reported that the limited nutrient and poor whc are regarded as the two main reasons resulting in the low crop productivity of sandy soil moreover the fertility of desertified soils is mainly dependent on the stability of soil aggregates mulcahy et al 2013 this is due to the fact that the soils with well stabilized soil aggregate structure have the excellent ability to store soil water and nutrients elliott 1986 angers 1992 xu et al 2015 therefore how to improve the whc and aggregate stability of desertified soils will be a primary task to enhance crop yield water use efficiency and agricultural productivity oki and kanae 2006 mulcahy et al 2013 basso et al 2013 poly γ glutamic acid γ pga is a very promising environmentally friendly polymer with biodegradable non immunogenic and non toxic characteristics ogunleye et al 2015 liang et al 2019 it has been widely applied in food bhat et al 2013 medicine stephen and chen 2012 water treatment hajdu et al 2012 and agricultural industries yin et al 2018 pang et al 2018 and so on γ pga may have the great potential in enhancing agricultural productivity especially in the agricultural field for example many researchers have investigated the impacts of γ pga on soil whc and soil available water capacity liang et al 2019 crop growth xu et al 2013a lei et al 2015 2016 zhang et al 2017a yin et al 2018 pang et al 2018 n leaching loss zhang et al 2017b and microbial community structure xu et al 2013b yin et al 2018 these above studies have indicated that γ pga can effectively reduce no3 n and nh4 n leaching obviously improve whc of sandy loam promote crop growth and enhance crop yield and the drought resistance of maize seedlings it is worth noting that the results of these studies are only obtained through soil column experiments laboratory experiments and greenhouse experiments however the study of γ pga under field conditions is still not well understood therefore we hypothesize that adding γ pga into the desertified soils can promote the formation of soil aggregates enhance the stability of soil aggregates improve crop yield and water fertilizer productivity under field conditions in this study a consecutive two year field experiment is carried out in the southern xinjiang region with a typical continental desert climate the objectives of this research are therefore to 1 investigate if γ pga can improve the sws of root zone in the desertified soils 2 explore if γ pga can promote the formation of soil aggregates and enhance the stability of soil aggregates in the desertified soils 3 analyze the effects of different γ pga application rates on aboveground dry matter n and p uptake efficiency cotton yield iwp pfp for fertilizer n p and k and net profit and 4 propose an appropriate γ pga application strategy for maximizing water and fertilizer productivity and economic benefit in barren desertified soils of

treatments consisted of five γ pga application rates 0 20 40 80 and 160 kg ha 1 which were labeled as ck p20 p40 p80 and p160 respectively each treatment had three replicates randomly distributed within 15 plots each plot length 2 1 m width 1 4 m and depth 1 m was artificially built in the experimental field four 20 cm thickness polyethylene plates were installed on the boundary of each plot to limit the lateral migration of soil moisture and solutes then the soil in the cotton field was filled into each plot with a cotton field bulk density of 1 6 g cm 3 γ pga was manually spread in each plot and then evenly mixed into the soil with a spade to a depth of about 40 cm each plot was irrigated with an independent irrigation system which consisted of a plastic barrel 300 l a steel frame with a height of 1 8 m a main pipe a ball valve and two drip tapes to maintain adequate water pressure the steel frame was used to place plastic barrel for irrigation water moreover the ball valve installed on the barrel and main pipe was used to control the amount of irrigation 2 4 agronomic practices cotton was a main cash crop in the experimental region the cotton planting pattern and drip line arrangement were one mulch two drip lines and four rows of cotton plants in fig 1 cotton seeds were sowed on april 20th 2015 and april 25th 2016 respectively seed cotton was harvested in mid september 2015 and 2016 to meet the cotton plant nutrient requirements 450 kg ha 1 organic fertilizer organic matter content 45 was applied as the base fertilizers before plowing during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 652 kg ha 1 urea 228 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate and 52 kg ha 1 potassium sulphate were applied in each plot irrigation water comes from groundwater which was classified as brackish water with an electrical conductivity of 2 8 3 1 ms cm 1 during the two growing seasons a scientifically based irrigation schedule was implemented based on a scientific report suggested by liang et al 2019 for the same experimental site this was due to the fact that the local farmers applied too much irrigation water at each irrigation event irrigation date and irrigation amount for each irrigation event were shown in the irrigation schedule table 2 the irrigation schedule was identical for each plot total irrigation water amount was 435 mm in 2015 and 412 5 mm in 2016 2 5 measurements 2 5 1 soil water storage sws soil samples were collected from the no mulch zones wide row zones and narrow row zones with a manual auger at depths of 0 10 20 30 40 60 80 and 100 cm respectively these holes were backfilled with spare soil after taking soil samples the soil samples were dried in the oven at 105 to constant weight and then soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method soil water storage sws in the root zone 0 40 cm of cotton was calculated by the following equation 1 s w s 400 θ 0 40 c m where sws represents soil water storage sws in the root zone 0 40 cm of cotton mm θ 0 40 c m represents the average soil water content in 0 40 cm soil layer cm3 cm 3 2 5 2 aboveground dry matter n and p uptake amount and efficiency and seed cotton yield in 2015 and 2016 three representative cotton plants were randomly collected from each plot to determine aboveground dry matter at the seedling stage squaring and flowering stages and bolls and boll opening stages respectively the aboveground parts of fresh plant samples were dried in ovens at 105 for 2 h and afterwards at 75 until the weights were constant after drying these oven dried plant samples were milled into fine powder and passed through a 0 15 mm screen appropriate amounts of the milled fine powder 0 1 0 2 g accurate to 0 0001 g were subsequently digested with h2so4 h2o2 for chemical analysis wolf 1982 the plant n concentration was determined by the kjeldahl method kjeltec 2300 foss tecator sweden the plant p concentration gpc was measured by the ammonium molybdate method aa3 seal company germany nutrient n or p uptake was calculated by the weight of aboveground dry matter multiplied by the nutrient n or p concentration 2 n u t r i e n t u p t a k e a b o v e g r o u n

p supply in each plot however we should also take into account the effect of soil nutrient substrate on the uptake efficiency therefore nutrient n or p uptake efficiency was calculated by total nutrient n or p uptake divided by the sum of soil nutrient substrate n or p and nutrient n or p supply in each plot 3 n u t r i e n t u p t a k e e f f i c i e n c y t o t a l n u t r i e n t u p t a

gravimetrically at harvesting stage of 2015 and 2016 2 5 3 water stable aggregates and mean weight diameter mwd moreover at harvesting stage soil samples were collected from each plot with an auger in 0 15 cm soil layer and passed through a 2 mm screen the soil samples were used to determine water stable aggregates by the wet sieving method nie et al 2018 water stable aggregates were classified as the three different size fractions such as large macro aggregates 2 1 mm small macro aggregates 1 0 25 mm and micro aggregates 0 25 mm mean weight diameter mwd was obtained with the equation sheehy et al 2015 4 m w d i 1 n d i p d w i where d i is the mean diameter of each fraction mm pdw i is percentage of sample dry weight of each fraction 2 6 calculation methods 2 6 1 evapotranspiration et evapotranspiration et was calculated by the following equation 5 e t p i g d r δ s w s where p i g d r and δsws represents precipitation p mm irrigation amount i mm the groundwater recharge g mm deep drainage d mm runoff r mm and the difference between sws before sowing and sws growing period δsws mm seedling and squaring stage flowering and boll setting stage and bolls and boll opening stage respectively in the experiment groundwater recharge was neglected because of low rainfall moreover r and d were neglected zero due to rare rainfall and no un planned irrigation occurred in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons therefore the eq 5 could be described as 6 e t p i δ s w s 2 6 2 irrigation water productivity iwp irrigation water productivity iwp reflected the relationship between crop

cotton yield kg ha 1 i represents irrigation amount applied in each plot mm 2 6 3 partial factor productivity pfp partial factor productivity pfp was defined as the ratio of crop yield to the amount of fertilizer applied under a specific fertilizer cassman et al 1996 it was an important indicator that reflected the comprehensive effect of local soil basic nutrient levels and chemical fertilizer application rates cassman et al 1996 the pfp for n p and k fertilizer was expressed as the equation cassman et al 1996 zou et al 2020 8 p f p x y f x where pfp x represents partial factor productivity kg kg 1 f x represents the total applied n p and k fertilizer kg ha 1 and x represents the fertilizer type x represents n p and k fertilizer 2 6 4 cost benefit analysis the total cost consisted of materials fee water fee labor fee and the fee of harvesting cotton the input of materials fee consisted of γ pga fertilizer application urea diammonium phosphate and potassium sulphate cotton seed plastic film drip irrigation pipe farm machinery and pesticide γ pga 60 kg 1 was used in 2015 and 2016 urea diammonium phosphate and potassium sulphate were 2 2 5 and 1 8 kg 1 respectively total cost of other materials cotton seed plastic film drip irrigation pipe farm machinery and pesticide was 6800 ha 1 in 2015 and 6500 ha 1 in 2016 respectively labor cost was 5000 ha 1 100 man days 1 50 man days ha 1 in 2015 and 4800 ha 1 100 man days 1 48 man days ha 1 in 2016 respectively water fee was 3000 ha 1 in 2015 and 2016 the cost of harvesting cotton was 1 8 kg 1 in 2015 and 2016 the income of farmer was the selling of seed cotton the selling price of seed cotton 8 4 kg 1 in 2015 and 2016 net profit was calculated by the difference between total income and total cost 9 net profit total income total cost 2 7 statistical analysis all data were showed as the average value of three replicates spss statistics 17 0 software was used to conduct the analysis of variance anova least significant difference lsd tests at p 0 05 level was used to determine significant differences between the treatments excel 2016 and spss 17 0 were used for statistical analyses excel 2016 arcgis 10 2 and microsoft visio 2003 were used to create figures respectively 3 results 3 1 soil water storage sws before and after irrigation there were significant p 0 05 differences in the sws of root zone before and after irrigation among all treatments in 2015 and 2016 during the two growing seasons the sws after irrigation was significantly higher than that before irrigation this was mainly attributed to each irrigation event the amount of irrigation was identical for all experiment treatments during the two growing seasons however the sws of root zone before and after irrigation was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck furthermore after the irrigation event the increase of sws in the root zone was significantly p 0 05 higher in the γ pga treatments than that of the ck table 3 this was possibly attributed to the strong water holding capacity of γ pga 3 2 sws and et in different growing stages there were significant p 0 05 differences in the sws and evapotranspiration et of root zone among all treatments in the different growing stages of 2015 and 2016 tables s1 s2 before sowing the sws in all treatments was the same in 2015 and 2016 this was mainly due to the fact that same pre sowing irrigation management was applied in all treatments this was to ensure that there was sufficient soil moisture in the cotton field to promote cotton germination after cotton sowing the sws in different growth stages was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck tables s1 s2 therefore the sws the difference between sws before sowing and sws in the different growing seasons was significantly lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck precipitation and irrigation were identical for all treatments in the two growing seasons tables s1 s2 et was calculated with the soil water balance equation expressed as the sum of rainfall irrigation and sws in the eq 6 therefore the et was significantly p 0 05 lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck 3 3 water stable aggregates and mean weight diameter mwd there were significant p 0 05 differences in water stable aggregates and mwd of soil aggregates among all treatments in 2015 and 2016 table 4 the proportion of soil micro aggregates 0 25 mm was significantly p 0 05 lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck however compared with the ck γ pga treatments significantly p 0 05 increased the proportion of large soil macro aggregates 2 1 mm and small soil macro aggregates 1 0 25 mm in the two growing seasons this indicated that γ pga application promoted the formation of soil macro aggregates 0 25 2 mm furthermore the mwd of soil aggregates was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck indicating that γ pga application improved the stability of soil aggregates therefore the application of γ pga was very effective in improving the quality of desertified soil 3 4 aboveground dry matter n and p uptake amount and efficiency significant p 0 05 differences in aboveground dry matter were found among all treatments in the different growing stages of 2015 and 2016 fig 2 in the different growing stages the aboveground dry matter of cotton was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck fig 2 compared with the ck the aboveground dry matter in γ pga treatments significantly p 0 05 increased by 11 0 62 8 especially in bolls and boll opening stages of 2015 and 2016 furthermore γ pga treatments p20 p40 p80 and p160 also significantly p 0 05 affected n and p uptake amount and efficiency in 2015 and 2016 table 5 compared with the ck the γ pga treatments significantly p 0 05 enhanced n uptake amount 21 0 81 1 n uptake efficiency 20 7 82 8 p uptake amount 4 8 51 2 and p uptake efficiency 4 2 50 0 in 2015 and 2016 however compared with the p80 treatment the p160 treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased aboveground dry matter and n and p uptake amount and efficiency in 2015 and 2016 the largest aboveground dry matter and highest n and p uptake amount and efficiency were obtained at the p80 treatment in 2015 and 2016 therefore the application of γ pga had great advantages in crop production and promotion of nutrient n and p uptake 3 5 seed cotton yield iwp fpf for fertilizer n p and k and cost benefit analysis the water fertilizer productivity of cotton was evaluated in terms of seed cotton yield iwp and pfp for fertilizer n p and k table 6 there were significant p 0 05 differences in seed cotton yield iwp and pfp for fertilizer n p and k among all treatments in 2015 and 2016 table 6 compared with the ck γ pga treatments significantly p 0 05 enhanced seed cotton yield iwp and pfp for fertilizer n p and k in 2015 and 2016 however the highest seed cotton yield and iwp and the largest pfp for fertilizer n p and k were obtained in the p80 treatment in 2015 and the p40 treatment in 2016 respectively this indicated that the excessive application of γ pga did not increase water fertilizer productivity of cotton as expected economic benefit of γ pga application was evaluated by the cost benefit analysis table 7 significant p 0 05 differences in total income total cost and total net profit were found among all treatments in 2015 and 2016 table 7 total cost significantly p 0 05 increased with increasing γ pga application rates total income was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck the highest total income was obtained in the p80 treatment in 2015 and p40 treatment in 2016 respectively furthermore the p20 p40 and p80 treatments appeared to produce higher net profit than the ck although this effect was not statistically significant p 0 05 however the p160 treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased net profit compared with the ck suggesting that excessive γ pga application had negative effect on the increase of economic benefit 3 6 determining an appropriate γ pga application rate according to the above results we found that excessive γ pga application rates did not increase nutrient n and p uptake efficiency water fertilizer productivity and economic benefit as expected therefore we tried to find an appropriate γ pga application rate to maximize water and fertilizer productivity and economic benefit the relationships between γ pga application rates and n and p uptake efficiency were fitted by the quadratic curves fig 3a and b according to the two quadratic functions we found that the highest n and p uptake efficiency were obtained when the optimal γ pga application rate were 79 and 83 3 kg ha 1 respectively moreover the relationships between γ pga application rates and water fertilizer productivity seed cotton yield iwp and pfp of fertilizer n p and k were fitted by the quadratic curves fig s 4 and 5 according to the analysis of these quadratic functions we found that the highest seed cotton yield iwp and pfp for fertilizer n p and k were obtained when the optimal γ pga application rates were 90 8 99 3 93 7 84 5 and 92 3 kg ha 1 respectively therefore the highest nutrient n and p uptake efficiency and water fertilizer productivity might be achieved by calculating the average value 89 kg ha 1 of these optimal γ pga application rates in addition the relationship between γ pga application rates and net profit was also fitted by quadratic curves fig 6 according to the analysis of the quadratic function we found that the highest net profit was obtained when γ pga application rate was 42 1 kg ha 1 therefore based on comprehensive consideration of nutrient n and p uptake efficiency water fertilizer productivity and net profit we recommended that 65 kg ha 1 could be as used an appropriate γ pga application rate 4 discussions 4 1 effects of γ pga on sws et water stable aggregates distribution and stability γ pga could effectively improve soil water holding capacity and increase the sws liang et al 2019 which meant that γ pga had great water saving potential in agriculture production yin et al 2018 ho et al 2008 this was consistent with our finding in this present study this might be likely attributed to the following three mechanisms on the one hand from the molecular structure of γ pga γ pga was an anionic polymer which contained many peptide bonds and hydrophilic carboxyl groups and was easily cross linked with soil moisture thereby absorbing a large amount of irrigation water tarui et al 2005 on the other hand γ pga was a super water absorbable polymer that could absorb thousands of times more water than its own weight sung et al 2005 ho et al 2010 moreover γ pga formed a hydrogel after the saturation of water absorption ho et al 2008 sung et al 2005 the hydrogel could not only adjust soil moisture conditions yin et al 2018 but also effectively store irrigation water ho et al 2008 and reduce soil water loss caused by soil evaporation abedi koupai et al 2008 evapotranspiration et was the sum of soil evaporation e and crop transpiration t the desertified soil in this experimental field was classified as sandy soil with poor water holding capacity therefore high air temperature in this experimental site would result in strong soil evaporation in the desertified soil in this present study however et at the seedling stage of cotton was lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck this was attributed to the following two reasons on the one hand γ pga could efficiently improve water holding capacity of sandy soil liang et al 2019 which would help conserve more water or decrease water loss in the soil by inhibiting soil evaporation especially at early growth periods on the other hand et was mainly dependent on soil evaporation due to the fact that crop transpiration was negligible especially at early growth periods when the crop canopy was small this might imply that γ pga treatments could decrease unproductive soil evaporation γ pga was regarded as super absorbent polymer water retention agent ho et al 2008 2010 in this present study therefore γ pga treatments increased the sws in other growth stages of cotton compared with the ck however it was noteworthy that et in other growth stages of cotton was also lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck similar result reported by guo et al 2017 indicated that the super absorbent polymer could decrease et in the whole maize growing season by decreasing unproductive soil evaporation and luxury crop transpiration luxury transpiration was unproductive crop transpiration which meant that the water consumption by transpiration that exceeded crop physiology and biochemistry nutrient transfer photosynthesis and yield formation yang et al 2010 also reported that the water retaining agent could decreased et in different growth stages of winter wheat this was due to the fact that the water retaining agent could improve photosynthetic rate of winter wheat by adjusting water condition in soil which might further reduce the luxury crop transpiration yang et al 2009 therefore we speculated that γ pga might also decrease unproductive soil evaporation and luxury crop transpiration in the different growing stages of cotton this speculation might be a possible explanation for the reduction of et the soils with well stabilized soil aggregates structure had the excellent ability of storing nutrients and soil water elliott 1986 angers 1992 xu et al 2015 in this present study γ pga application significantly increased the proportion of soil macro aggregates which implied that γ pga promoted the formation of macro aggregates in the desertified soils similar result was also reported by chen et al 2018b six et al 2004 reported that the formation of macro aggregates was attributed to the fact that micro aggregates were bonded together by binding agents therefore we speculated that the increase of macro aggregates in the desertified soils was attributed to the fact that the micro aggregates might be bonded together by the hydrogel that formed by γ pga absorption of water and saturation this was a possible explanation that γ pga resulted in the increase of macro aggregates the mwd was an index to determine the stability of water stable aggregates the higher the mwd value the better the soil resistance to erosion and tillage kemper and chepil 1965 liu et al 2014 in this present study γ pga significantly enhanced the mwd of water stable aggregates the result implied that γ pga improved the stability of water stable aggregates this might likely depend on hydrogel property of γ pga 4 2 effects of γ pga on aboveground dry matter n and p uptake amount and efficiency cotton yield pfp for fertilizer n p and k some research indicated that γ pga could significantly improve root growth uptake capacity of plant nutrients n p and k crop productivity and nitrogen use efficiency chen et al 2005 inbaraj et al 2009 xu et al 2013a zhang et al 2017a chen et al 2018b liang et al 2019 wang et al 2014b also reported that γ pga significantly enhanced the root activity root growth leaf area aboveground dry matter and yield of rapeseed moreover yin et al 2018 reported that γ pga could enhance drought resistance of crop seedlings through adjusting water condition in soil in this present study we also obtained similar results where γ pga significantly increased aboveground dry matter n and p uptake amount and efficiency seed cotton yield iwp pfp for fertilizer n p and k and economic benefit this might be likely attributed to the following mechanisms firstly γ pga improved soil water holding capacity soil available water content and sws of root zone and thus further increasing water use efficiency and crop yield liang et al 2019 secondly γ pga formed a hydrogel after saturation with absorbed water gonzales et al 1996 ho et al 2008 montesano et al 2015 reported that the hydrogel had the function of storing irrigation water and improving water availability for plants and thus further enhancing dry matter accumulation and crop production thirdly γ pga promoted the formation of soil aggregates and enhanced the stability of soil aggregates and thus further improving cotton growth in addition γ pga could increase root activity of crop wang et al 2014b zhang et al 2017a enhance nutrient uptake capacity of crop zhang et al 2017b and improve nutrient utilization efficiency chen et al 2005 inbaraj et al 2009 this might be an explanation for the increase in aboveground dry matter nitrogen and phosphorus uptake amount and efficiency and water fertilizer productivity however it was noteworthy that n and p uptake efficiency and water fertilizer productivity could not maintain a trend of continuous increase with increasing γ pga application rates this result implied that the excessive application of γ pga did not increase water fertilizer productivity of cotton as expected this might be likely due to the fact that high concentrations of γ pga could affect the osmotic pressure of the crop root system itoh et al 1987 wang et al 2014b and further resulting in weakening the respiration of crop roots and root activity wang et al 2014b furthermore γ pga composed of many d l glutamic acid units was a nitrogen containing organic matter that was easily degraded by microorganisms ashiuchi et al 2003 chen et al 2008 the degradation product of γ pga mainly included glutamic acid molecular portilla arias et al 2007 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b which has a positive effect on the physiological functions of plant cells xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017a for example walch liu et al 2006a 2006b reported that the l glutamic acid could regulate root growth and root activity of crop moreover ho et al 2006 also reported that γ pga had the ability to absorb nh4 in soil results reported by bhattacharyya et al 1998 and ho et al 2008 indicated that the nh4 absorbed by γ pga could be released again to provide crop growth with the degradation of γ pga additionally γ pga could promote the transformation of urea in soil to nh4 n through activating urease activity in soil zhang et al 2017a and further resulting in a positive effect on soil n pool xu et al 2013b zhang et al 2017a therefore future studies should be conducted to investigate 1 the effect of degradation products of γ pga on physiological functions of crop roots 2 the effect of degradation products of γ pga on soil n pool 4 3 appropriate γ pga application strategy in crop production systems water and fertilizer productivity are expressed as crop production per unit volume of water and per kilogram of fertilizer input from the perspective of agriculture production we were interested in producing more with less water and fertilizer which meant that using per unit volume of water and per kilogram of fertilizer input produced more crop yields that is achieving higher water and fertilizer productivity the results in this present study showed that the maximum water fertilizer productivity of cotton and nutrient uptake efficiency could be obtained when γ pga application rate was 89 kg ha 1 liang et al 2019 also reported similar result where highest crop yield and water use efficiency were obtained when 80 kg ha 1 was recommended as an optimal γ pga application rate however the high doses of γ pga might not be economically feasible this was due to the fact that high doses of γ pga corresponded with high cost the high cost was unwillingly accepted by the local farmers which would become a main factor limiting the application of γ pga in agricultural production fortunately the results in this present study indicated that the maximum net profit was obtained when γ pga application rate was 42 kg ha 1 from the perspective of economic benefits the farmers were more interested to achieve largest net profit therefore in order to scientifically maximize nutrient uptake efficiency water fertilizer productivity and economic benefit we suggested farmers to apply γ pga with 65 kg ha 1 in barren desertified soils of northwest china 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that adding γ pga into the desertified soils could be regarded as an effective way to increase sws and decrease water consumption adding γ pga into the desertified soils had the great potential in promoting the formation of soil aggregates and enhancing the stability of soil aggregates moreover adding γ pga into the desertified soils could improve cotton growth n and p uptake amount and efficiency water fertilizer productivity and net profit compared with the ck however water fertilizer productivity and net profit could not maintain a trend of continuous increase with increasing γ pga application rates incorporating considerations of nutrient uptake efficiency water fertilizer productivity and net profit for farmer we recommended that 65 kg ha 1 might be used as an appropriate γ pga application strategy to improve agriculture production and economic benefit and deal with

10261,poly γ glutamic acid γ pga is proposed as an environmentally friendly super water absorbable agent and fertilizer synergist however the influences of γ pga on soil aggregates crop growth

p and k and cost benefit analysis in desertified soil of northwest china a field experiment which consisted of five γ pga application rates 0 20 40 80 and 160 kg ha 1 labeled as ck p20 p40 p80 and p160 was conducted in the cotton growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 the results showed that γ pga application significantly increased the sws of root zone and decreased water consumption γ pga application significantly enhanced the proportion of soil macro aggregates and the mean weight diameter mwd of water stable aggregates compared with the ck γ pga application significantly improved aboveground dry matter cotton yield n and p uptake amount and efficiency iwp and pfp for fertilizer n p and k moreover γ pga application significantly increased net profit of the farmer compared with the ck however water fertilizer productivity and net profit could not maintain a trend of continuous increase with increasing γ pga application rates according to analyzing the production and net profit functions of γ pga application we found that the highest water fertilizer productivity and net profit were achieved when γ pga application rate was 65 kg ha 1 therefore this study suggested that 65 kg ha 1 might be recommended as an appropriate γ pga application strategy to deal with water scarcity and improve economic benefit and water fertilizer productivity in barren desertified soils of northwest china keywords poly γ glutamic acid soil aggregates nitrogen and phosphorus uptake efficiency economic benefit cotton growth 1 introduction water shortage and soil degradation have been identified as the two major factors affecting agriculture production especially in arid and semi arid areas of northwest china fan et al 2012 li et al 2015 dai et al 2019 southern xinjiang is a typical arid region located in northwest china wang et al 2014a liang et al 2019 in the past 60 years the annual average rainfall in southern xinjiang was less than 60 mm and the annual average potential evaporation was more than 2800 mm according to analyzing the meteorological data from china meteorological data network http data cma cn the long term extreme climatic conditions such as rare rainfall strong evaporation and severe drought can result in severe environmental problems such as the conversion of arable lands into desertified soils and the reduction of freshwater resource vicente serrano et al 2015 under the dual pressure of water shortage and land desertification therefore exploring effective measures of improving the resilience of agro ecosystems to serious environmental problems has important practical significance a study reported by yang and cheng 2004 has indicated that the total amount of brackish water that can be used for agricultural production is approximately 13 billion m3 in china the development and utilization of available brackish water may be an efficient measure to alleviate the shortage of agriculture freshwater resources in arid regions of china letey et al 2011 selim et al 2013 in recent years brackish water with total dissolved solids tds between 2 g l 1 and 3 g l 1 has been widely used for agriculture production especially in southern xinjiang wang et al 2014a li et al 2015 tan et al 2017 chen et al 2018a for example some researchers have reported that shallow brackish water can be used as an available source for irrigation to make up for the shortage of freshwater resources and contribute to agriculture production in southern xinjiang chen et al 2010 wang et al 2011 2014a li et al 2015 chen et al 2018a in this study we only tried to use brackish water as an available source for irrigation but the effects of brackish water were not investigated because there was no freshwater control the desertified soils i e those with 10 clay and 80 sand in this experimental site have poor water holding capacity whc andry et al 2009 which can result in decreasing water use efficiency and increasing nutrient loss jovanovic et al 2009 liu et al 2012 haider et al 2017 haider et al 2017 also reported that the limited nutrient and poor whc are regarded as the two main reasons resulting in the low crop productivity of sandy soil moreover the fertility of desertified soils is mainly dependent on the stability of soil aggregates mulcahy et al 2013 this is due to the fact that the soils with well stabilized soil aggregate structure have the excellent ability to store soil water and nutrients elliott 1986 angers 1992 xu et al 2015 therefore how to improve the whc and aggregate stability of desertified soils will be a primary task to enhance crop yield water use efficiency and agricultural productivity oki and kanae 2006 mulcahy et al 2013 basso et al 2013 poly γ glutamic acid γ pga is a very promising environmentally friendly polymer with biodegradable non immunogenic and non toxic characteristics ogunleye et al 2015 liang et al 2019 it has been widely applied in food bhat et al 2013 medicine stephen and chen 2012 water treatment hajdu et al 2012 and agricultural industries yin et al 2018 pang et al 2018 and so on γ pga may have the great potential in enhancing agricultural productivity especially in the agricultural field for example many researchers have investigated the impacts of γ pga on soil whc and soil available water capacity liang et al 2019 crop growth xu et al 2013a lei et al 2015 2016 zhang et al 2017a yin et al 2018 pang et al 2018 n leaching loss zhang et al 2017b and microbial community structure xu et al 2013b yin et al 2018 these above studies have indicated that γ pga can effectively reduce no3 n and nh4 n leaching obviously improve whc of sandy loam promote crop growth and enhance crop yield and the drought resistance of maize seedlings it is worth noting that the results of these studies are only obtained through soil column experiments laboratory experiments and greenhouse experiments however the study of γ pga under field conditions is still not well understood therefore we hypothesize that adding γ pga into the desertified soils can promote the formation of soil aggregates enhance the stability of soil aggregates improve crop yield and water fertilizer productivity under field conditions in this study a consecutive two year field experiment is carried out in the southern xinjiang region with a typical continental desert climate the objectives of this research are therefore to 1 investigate if γ pga can improve the sws of root zone in the desertified soils 2 explore if γ pga can promote the formation of soil aggregates and enhance the stability of soil aggregates in the desertified soils 3 analyze the effects of different γ pga application rates on aboveground dry matter n and p uptake efficiency cotton yield iwp pfp for fertilizer n p and k and net profit and 4 propose an appropriate γ pga application strategy for maximizing water and fertilizer productivity and economic benefit in barren desertified soils of northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a consecutive two season field experiment was carried out in 2015 and 2016 at the bazhou iriigation experiment station 41 36 n 86 12 e xinier town korla city xinjiang province china fig s1 this experiment site has a continental desert climate the annual mean precipitation is less than 80 mm but annual mean potential evaporation is greater than 2700 mm in the experimental site tan et al 2017 the precipitation and daily mean air temperature from may to september in 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig s2 the precipitation is 62 2 mm in 2015 and 82 0 mm in 2016 respectively the daily mean air temperature is more than 22 and the highest temperature is above 32 during may september in 2015 and 2016 the physical and chemical properties of the topsoil 0 60 cm in the experimental field are briefly described in table 1 2 2 poly γ glutamic acid poly γ glutamic acid γ pga used in this study was a white powder with a molecular weight of 3 32 10 21 kg and was produced by xi an realin biotechnology co ltd γ pga was a nontoxic biodegradable water absorbing polymer inbaraj et al 2009 ho et al 2008 2 3 experiment design experiment treatments consisted of five γ pga application rates 0 20 40 80 and 160 kg ha 1 which were labeled as ck p20 p40 p80 and p160 respectively each treatment had three replicates randomly distributed within 15 plots each plot length 2 1 m width 1 4 m and depth 1 m was artificially built in the experimental field four 20 cm thickness polyethylene plates were installed on the boundary of each plot to limit the lateral migration of soil moisture and solutes then the soil in the cotton field was filled into each plot with a cotton field bulk density of 1 6 g cm 3 γ pga was manually spread in each plot and then evenly mixed into the soil with a spade to a depth of about 40 cm each plot was irrigated with an independent irrigation system which consisted of a plastic barrel 300 l a steel frame with a height of 1 8 m a main pipe a ball valve and two drip tapes to maintain adequate water pressure the steel frame was used to place plastic barrel for irrigation water moreover the ball valve installed on the barrel and main pipe was used to control the amount of irrigation 2 4 agronomic practices cotton was a main cash crop in the experimental region the cotton planting pattern and drip line arrangement were one mulch two drip lines and four rows of cotton plants in fig 1 cotton seeds were sowed on april 20th 2015 and april 25th 2016 respectively seed cotton was harvested in mid september 2015 and 2016 to meet the cotton plant nutrient requirements 450 kg ha 1 organic fertilizer organic matter content 45 was applied as the base fertilizers before plowing during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 652 kg ha 1 urea 228 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate and 52 kg ha 1 potassium sulphate were applied in each plot irrigation water comes from groundwater which was classified as brackish water with an electrical conductivity of 2 8 3 1 ms cm 1 during the two growing seasons a scientifically based irrigation schedule was implemented based on a scientific report suggested by liang et al 2019 for the same experimental site this was due to the fact that the local farmers applied too much irrigation water at each irrigation event irrigation date and irrigation amount for each irrigation event were shown in the irrigation schedule table 2 the irrigation schedule was identical for each plot total irrigation water amount was 435 mm in 2015 and 412 5 mm in 2016 2 5 measurements 2 5 1 soil water storage sws soil samples were collected from the no mulch zones wide row zones and narrow row zones with a manual auger at depths of 0 10 20 30 40 60 80 and 100 cm respectively these holes were backfilled with spare soil after taking soil samples the soil samples were dried in the oven at 105 to constant weight and then soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method soil water storage sws in the root zone 0 40 cm of cotton was calculated by the following equation 1 s w s 400 θ 0 40 c m where sws represents soil water storage sws in the root zone 0 40 cm of cotton mm θ 0 40 c m represents the average soil water content in 0 40 cm soil layer cm3 cm 3 2 5 2 aboveground dry matter n and p uptake amount and efficiency and seed cotton yield in 2015 and 2016 three representative cotton plants were randomly collected from each plot to determine aboveground dry matter at the seedling stage squaring and flowering stages and bolls and boll opening stages respectively the aboveground parts of fresh plant samples were dried in ovens at 105 for 2 h and afterwards at 75 until the weights were constant after drying these oven dried plant samples were milled into fine powder and passed through a 0 15 mm screen appropriate amounts of the milled fine powder 0 1 0 2 g accurate to 0 0001 g were subsequently digested with h2so4 h2o2 for chemical analysis wolf 1982 the plant n concentration was determined by the kjeldahl method kjeltec 2300 foss tecator sweden the plant p concentration gpc was measured by the ammonium molybdate method

p supply in each plot however we should also take into account the effect of soil nutrient substrate on the uptake efficiency therefore nutrient n or p uptake efficiency was calculated by total nutrient n or p uptake divided by the sum of soil nutrient substrate n or p and nutrient n or p supply in each plot 3 n u t r i e n t u p t a k e e f f i c i e n c y t o t a l n u t r i e n t u p t a

gravimetrically at harvesting stage of 2015 and 2016 2 5 3 water stable aggregates and mean weight diameter mwd moreover at harvesting stage soil samples were collected from each plot with an auger in 0 15 cm soil layer and passed through a 2 mm screen the soil samples were used to determine water stable aggregates by the wet sieving method nie et al 2018 water stable aggregates were classified as the three different size fractions such as large macro aggregates 2 1 mm small macro aggregates 1 0 25 mm and micro aggregates 0 25 mm mean weight diameter mwd was obtained with the equation sheehy et

drainage d mm runoff r mm and the difference between sws before sowing and sws growing period δsws mm seedling and squaring stage flowering and boll setting stage and bolls and boll opening stage respectively in the experiment groundwater recharge was neglected because of low rainfall moreover r and d were neglected zero due to rare rainfall and no un planned irrigation occurred in the 2015

materials fee water fee labor fee and the fee of harvesting cotton the input of materials fee consisted of γ pga fertilizer application urea diammonium phosphate and potassium sulphate cotton seed plastic film drip irrigation pipe farm machinery and pesticide γ pga 60 kg 1 was used in 2015 and 2016 urea diammonium phosphate and potassium sulphate were 2 2 5 and 1 8 kg 1 respectively total cost of other materials cotton seed plastic film drip irrigation pipe farm machinery and pesticide was 6800 ha 1 in 2015 and 6500 ha 1 in 2016 respectively labor cost was 5000 ha 1 100 man days 1 50 man days ha 1 in 2015 and 4800 ha 1 100 man days 1 48 man days ha 1 in 2016 respectively water fee was 3000 ha 1 in 2015 and 2016 the cost of harvesting cotton was 1 8 kg 1 in 2015 and 2016 the income of farmer was the selling of seed cotton the selling price of seed cotton 8 4 kg 1 in 2015 and 2016 net profit was calculated by the difference between total income and total cost 9 net profit total income total cost 2 7 statistical analysis all data were showed as the average value of three replicates spss statistics 17 0 software was used to conduct the analysis of variance anova least significant difference lsd tests at p 0 05 level was used to determine significant differences between the treatments excel 2016 and spss 17 0 were used for statistical analyses excel 2016 arcgis 10 2 and microsoft visio 2003 were used to create figures respectively 3 results 3 1 soil water storage sws before and after irrigation there were significant p 0 05 differences in the sws of root zone before and after irrigation among all treatments in 2015 and 2016 during the two growing seasons the sws after irrigation was significantly higher than that before irrigation this was mainly attributed to each irrigation event the amount of irrigation was identical for all experiment treatments during the two growing seasons however the sws of root zone before and after irrigation was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck furthermore after the irrigation event the increase of sws in the root zone was significantly p 0 05 higher in the γ pga treatments than that of the ck table 3 this was possibly attributed to the strong water holding capacity of γ pga 3 2 sws and et in different growing stages there were significant p 0 05 differences in the sws and evapotranspiration et of root zone among all treatments in the different growing stages of 2015 and 2016 tables s1 s2 before sowing the sws in all treatments was the same in 2015 and 2016 this was mainly due to the fact that same pre sowing irrigation management was applied in all treatments this was to ensure that there was sufficient soil moisture in the cotton field to promote cotton germination after cotton sowing the sws in different growth stages was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck tables s1 s2 therefore the sws the difference between sws before sowing and sws in the different growing seasons was significantly lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck precipitation and irrigation were identical for all treatments in the two growing seasons tables s1 s2 et was calculated with the soil water balance equation expressed as the sum of rainfall irrigation and sws in the eq 6 therefore the et was significantly p 0 05 lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck 3 3 water stable aggregates and mean weight diameter mwd there were significant p 0 05 differences in water stable aggregates and mwd of soil aggregates among all treatments in 2015 and 2016 table 4 the proportion of soil micro aggregates 0 25 mm was significantly p 0 05 lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck however compared with the ck γ pga treatments significantly p 0 05 increased the proportion of large soil macro aggregates 2 1 mm and small soil macro aggregates 1 0 25 mm in the two growing seasons this indicated that γ pga application promoted the formation of soil macro aggregates 0 25 2 mm furthermore the mwd of soil aggregates was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck indicating that γ pga application improved the stability of soil aggregates therefore the application of γ pga was very effective in improving the quality of desertified soil 3 4 aboveground dry matter n and p uptake amount and efficiency significant p 0 05 differences in aboveground dry matter were found among all treatments in the different growing stages of 2015 and 2016 fig 2 in the different growing stages the aboveground dry matter of cotton was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck fig 2 compared with the ck the aboveground dry matter in γ pga treatments significantly p 0 05 increased by 11 0 62 8 especially in bolls and boll opening stages of 2015 and 2016 furthermore γ pga treatments p20 p40 p80 and p160 also significantly p 0 05 affected n and p uptake amount and efficiency in 2015 and 2016 table 5 compared with the ck the γ pga treatments significantly p 0 05 enhanced n uptake amount 21 0 81 1 n uptake efficiency 20 7 82 8 p uptake amount 4 8 51 2 and p uptake efficiency 4 2 50 0 in 2015 and 2016 however compared with the p80 treatment the p160 treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased aboveground dry matter and n and p uptake amount and efficiency in 2015 and 2016 the largest aboveground dry matter and highest n and p uptake amount and efficiency were obtained at the p80 treatment in 2015 and 2016 therefore the application of γ pga had great advantages in crop production and promotion of nutrient n and p uptake 3 5 seed cotton yield iwp fpf for fertilizer n p and k and cost benefit analysis the water fertilizer productivity of cotton was evaluated in terms of seed cotton yield iwp and pfp for fertilizer n p and k table 6 there were significant p 0 05 differences in seed cotton yield iwp and pfp for fertilizer n p and k among all treatments in 2015 and 2016 table 6 compared with the ck γ pga treatments significantly p 0 05 enhanced seed cotton yield iwp and pfp for fertilizer n p and k in 2015 and 2016 however the highest seed cotton yield and iwp and the largest pfp for fertilizer n p and k were obtained in the p80 treatment in 2015 and the p40 treatment in 2016 respectively this indicated that the excessive application of γ pga did not increase water fertilizer productivity of cotton as expected economic benefit of γ pga application was evaluated by the cost benefit analysis table 7 significant p 0 05 differences in total income total cost and total net profit were found among all treatments in 2015 and 2016 table 7 total cost significantly p 0 05 increased with increasing γ pga application rates total income was significantly p 0 05 higher in γ pga treatments than that of the ck the highest total income was obtained in the p80 treatment in 2015 and p40 treatment in 2016 respectively furthermore the p20 p40 and p80 treatments appeared to produce higher net profit than the ck although this effect was not statistically significant p 0 05 however the p160 treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased net profit compared with the ck suggesting that excessive γ pga application had negative effect on the increase of economic benefit 3 6 determining an appropriate γ pga application rate according to the above results we found that excessive γ pga application rates did not increase nutrient n and p uptake efficiency water fertilizer productivity and economic benefit as expected therefore we tried to find an appropriate γ pga application rate to maximize water and fertilizer productivity and economic benefit the relationships between γ pga application rates and n and p uptake efficiency were fitted by the quadratic curves fig 3a and b according to the two quadratic functions we found that the highest n and p uptake efficiency were obtained when the optimal γ pga application rate were 79 and 83 3 kg ha 1 respectively moreover the relationships between γ pga application rates and water fertilizer productivity seed cotton yield iwp and pfp of fertilizer n p and k were fitted by the quadratic curves fig s 4 and 5 according to the analysis of these quadratic functions we found that the highest seed cotton yield iwp and pfp for fertilizer n p and k were obtained when the optimal γ pga application rates were 90 8 99 3 93 7 84 5 and 92 3 kg ha 1 respectively therefore the highest nutrient n and p uptake efficiency and water fertilizer productivity might be achieved by calculating the average value 89 kg ha 1 of these optimal γ pga application rates in addition the relationship between γ pga application rates and net profit was also fitted by quadratic curves fig 6 according to the analysis of the quadratic function we found that the highest net profit was obtained when γ pga application rate was 42 1 kg ha 1 therefore based on comprehensive consideration of nutrient n and p uptake efficiency water fertilizer productivity and net profit we recommended that 65 kg ha 1 could be as used an appropriate γ pga application rate 4 discussions 4 1 effects of γ pga on sws et water stable aggregates distribution and stability γ pga could effectively improve soil water holding capacity and increase the sws liang et al 2019 which meant that γ pga had great water saving potential in agriculture production yin et al 2018 ho et al 2008 this was consistent with our finding in this present study this might be likely attributed to the following three mechanisms on the one hand from the molecular structure of γ pga γ pga was an anionic polymer which contained many peptide bonds and hydrophilic carboxyl groups and was easily cross linked with soil moisture thereby absorbing a large amount of irrigation water tarui et al 2005 on the other hand γ pga was a super water absorbable polymer that could absorb thousands of times more water than its own weight sung et al 2005 ho et al 2010 moreover γ pga formed a hydrogel after the saturation of water absorption ho et al 2008 sung et al 2005 the hydrogel could not only adjust soil moisture conditions yin et al 2018 but also effectively store irrigation water ho et al 2008 and reduce soil water loss caused by soil evaporation abedi koupai et al 2008 evapotranspiration et was the sum of soil evaporation e and crop transpiration t the desertified soil in this experimental field was classified as sandy soil with poor water holding capacity therefore high air temperature in this experimental site would result in strong soil evaporation in the desertified soil in this present study however et at the seedling stage of cotton was lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck this was attributed to the following two reasons on the one hand γ pga could efficiently improve water holding capacity of sandy soil liang et al 2019 which would help conserve more water or decrease water loss in the soil by inhibiting soil evaporation especially at early growth periods on the other hand et was mainly dependent on soil evaporation due to the fact that crop transpiration was negligible especially at early growth periods when the crop canopy was small this might imply that γ pga treatments could decrease unproductive soil evaporation γ pga was regarded as super absorbent polymer water retention agent ho et al 2008 2010 in this present study therefore γ pga treatments increased the sws in other growth stages of cotton compared with the ck however it was noteworthy that et in other growth stages of cotton was also lower in γ pga treatments than that of the ck similar result reported by guo et al 2017 indicated that the super absorbent polymer could decrease et in the whole maize growing season by decreasing unproductive soil evaporation and luxury crop transpiration luxury transpiration was unproductive crop transpiration which meant that the water consumption by transpiration that exceeded crop physiology and biochemistry nutrient transfer photosynthesis and yield formation yang et al 2010 also reported that the water retaining agent could decreased et in different growth stages of winter wheat this was due to the fact that the water retaining agent could improve photosynthetic rate of winter wheat by adjusting water condition in soil which might further reduce the luxury crop transpiration yang et al 2009 therefore we speculated that γ pga might also decrease unproductive soil evaporation and luxury crop transpiration in the different growing stages of cotton this speculation might be a possible explanation for the reduction of et the soils with well stabilized soil aggregates structure had the excellent ability of storing nutrients and soil water elliott 1986 angers 1992 xu et al 2015 in this present study γ pga application significantly increased the proportion of soil macro aggregates which implied that γ pga promoted the formation of macro aggregates in the desertified soils similar result was also reported by chen et al 2018b six et al 2004 reported that the formation of macro aggregates was attributed to the fact that micro aggregates were bonded together by binding agents therefore we speculated that the increase of macro aggregates in the desertified soils was attributed to the fact that the micro aggregates might be bonded together by the hydrogel that formed by γ pga absorption of water and saturation this was a possible explanation that γ pga resulted in the increase of macro aggregates the mwd was an index to determine the stability of water stable aggregates the higher the mwd value the better the soil resistance to erosion and tillage kemper and chepil 1965 liu et al 2014 in this present study γ pga significantly enhanced the mwd of water stable aggregates the result implied that γ pga improved the stability of water stable aggregates this might likely depend on hydrogel property of γ pga 4 2 effects of γ pga on aboveground dry matter n and p uptake amount and efficiency cotton yield pfp for fertilizer n p and k some research indicated that γ pga could significantly improve root growth uptake capacity of plant nutrients n p and k crop productivity and nitrogen use efficiency chen et al 2005 inbaraj et al 2009 xu et al 2013a zhang et al 2017a chen et al 2018b liang et al 2019 wang et al 2014b also reported that γ pga significantly enhanced the root activity root growth leaf area aboveground dry matter and yield of rapeseed moreover yin et al 2018 reported that γ pga could enhance drought resistance of crop seedlings through adjusting water condition in soil in this present study we also obtained similar results where γ pga significantly increased aboveground dry matter n and p uptake amount and efficiency seed cotton yield iwp pfp for fertilizer n p and k and economic benefit this might be likely attributed to the following mechanisms firstly γ pga improved soil water holding capacity soil available water content and sws of root zone and thus further increasing water use efficiency and crop yield liang et al 2019 secondly γ pga formed a hydrogel after saturation with absorbed water gonzales et al 1996 ho et al 2008 montesano et al 2015 reported that the hydrogel had the function of storing irrigation water and improving water availability for plants and thus further enhancing dry matter accumulation and crop production thirdly γ pga promoted the formation of soil aggregates and enhanced the stability of soil aggregates and thus further improving cotton growth in addition γ pga could increase root activity of crop wang et al 2014b zhang et al 2017a enhance nutrient uptake capacity of crop zhang et al 2017b and improve nutrient utilization efficiency chen et al 2005 inbaraj et al 2009 this might be an explanation for the increase in aboveground dry matter nitrogen and phosphorus uptake amount and efficiency and water fertilizer productivity however it was noteworthy that n and p uptake efficiency and water fertilizer productivity could not maintain a trend of continuous increase with increasing γ pga application rates this result implied that the excessive application of γ pga did not increase water fertilizer productivity of cotton as expected this might be likely due to the fact that high concentrations of γ pga could affect the osmotic pressure of the crop root system itoh et al 1987 wang et al 2014b and further resulting in weakening the respiration of crop roots and root activity wang et al 2014b furthermore γ pga composed of many d l glutamic acid units was a nitrogen containing organic matter that was easily degraded by microorganisms ashiuchi et al 2003 chen et al 2008 the degradation product of γ pga mainly included glutamic acid molecular portilla arias et al 2007 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b which has a positive effect on the physiological functions of plant cells xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017a for example walch liu et al 2006a 2006b reported that the l glutamic acid could regulate root growth and root activity of crop moreover ho et al 2006 also reported that γ pga had the ability to absorb nh4 in soil results reported by bhattacharyya et al 1998 and ho et al 2008 indicated that the nh4 absorbed by γ pga could be released again to provide crop growth with the degradation of γ pga additionally γ pga could promote the transformation of urea in soil to nh4 n through activating urease activity in soil zhang et al 2017a and further resulting in a positive effect on soil n pool xu et al 2013b zhang et al 2017a therefore future studies should be conducted to investigate 1 the effect of degradation products of γ pga on physiological functions of crop roots 2 the effect of degradation products of γ pga on soil n pool 4 3 appropriate γ pga application strategy in crop production systems water and fertilizer productivity are expressed as crop production per unit volume of water and per kilogram of fertilizer input from the perspective of agriculture production we were interested in producing more with less water and fertilizer which meant that using per unit volume of water and per kilogram of fertilizer input produced more crop yields that is achieving higher water and fertilizer productivity the results in this present study showed that the maximum water fertilizer productivity of cotton and nutrient uptake efficiency could be obtained when γ pga application rate was 89 kg ha 1 liang et al 2019 also reported similar result where highest crop yield and water use efficiency were obtained when 80 kg ha 1 was recommended as an optimal γ pga application rate however the high doses of γ pga might not be economically feasible this was due to the fact that high doses of γ pga corresponded with high cost the high cost was unwillingly accepted by the local farmers which would become a main factor limiting the application of γ pga in agricultural production fortunately the results in this present study indicated that the maximum net profit was obtained when γ pga application rate was 42 kg ha 1 from the perspective of economic benefits the farmers were more interested to achieve largest net profit therefore in order to scientifically maximize nutrient uptake efficiency water fertilizer productivity and economic benefit we suggested farmers to apply γ pga with 65 kg ha 1 in barren desertified soils of northwest china 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that adding γ pga into the desertified soils could be regarded as an effective way to increase sws and decrease water consumption adding γ pga into the desertified soils had the great potential in promoting the formation of soil aggregates and enhancing the stability of soil aggregates moreover adding γ pga into the desertified soils could improve cotton growth n and p uptake amount and efficiency water fertilizer productivity and net profit compared with the ck however water fertilizer productivity and net profit could not maintain a trend of continuous increase with increasing γ pga application rates incorporating considerations of nutrient uptake efficiency water fertilizer productivity and net profit for farmer we recommended that 65 kg ha 1 might be used as an appropriate γ pga application strategy to improve agriculture production and economic benefit and deal with

10262,irrigating water into a paddy field inevitably changes the water temperature and produces a temperature distribution in the field in this study a numerical model for predicting the horizontal water temperature distribution in a paddy field was developed in addition to considering the heat exchange between the atmosphere paddy rice water and soil the model also considers the horizontal heat convection within the paddy field due to the inflow of irrigation water and outflow of paddy field water the horizontal water flow in the field is modeled by the water balance equation of paddy water the model was validated using field measurements collected in a paddy field where the continuous irrigation with running water cirw management method was applied the calculated changes in water temperatures over time and distance showed good agreement with the observed values further the root mean square error rmse of the water temperature during the entire validation period was 0 98 c and the rmse during the nighttime cirw irrigation was 0 55 c these results indicate that the model satisfactorily expresses the features of paddy water temperature distribution under the effect of irrigation water inflow moreover a comparison of the calculation results of the proposed model to those of the conventional methods that do not consider the water temperature distribution demonstrated that the prediction accuracy significantly improves when the water temperature distribution is considered our results suggest that the prediction of water temperature distribution is useful for a more accurate prediction of paddy heat environment and various phenomena affected by water temperature in a paddy field keywords thermal environment in paddy field heat balance equation horizontal water flow in paddy water heat convection water management technique 1 introduction the water temperature in rice paddy fields substantially affects not only rice growth yield and quality matsushima et al 1964 shimono et al 2002 2004 2005 usui et al 2016 li et al 2018 sharifi et al 2018 but also the nitrogen environment inside and outside of the paddy fields as well as greenhouse gas emissions lan et al 2014 rizzo et al 2014 tan et al 2018 thus controlling the water temperature may significantly improve the agricultural production and reduce the negative environmental impact of paddy fields in paddy fields the water temperature is mainly affected by the heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil including water management conditions such as irrigation rate irrigation water temperature and water depth nishida et al 2018 thus various water management techniques have been proposed for controlling the heat environments in paddy fields for example in japan water management techniques e g continuous irrigation with running water cirw controlling water depth have been applied to reduce heat and prevent damage to rice plant morita et al 2016 recently the high temperature damage of rice due to high air temperatures during the rice grain ripening period tashiro and wardlaw 1991 has become a problem in rice cultivation terashima et al 2001 morita 2008 ministry of agriculture and forestry and fisheries of japan 2008 2011 morita et al 2016 and it is feared that future global warming may worsen the high temperature damage morita 2008 morita et al 2016 to prevent this heat damage water management techniques to cool water temperature in paddy fields have been proposed and tested in japan nagahata et al 2005 miyasaka et al 2011 wada et al 2013 it is believed that reducing the water temperature is effective in preventing heat damage of rice plants among the water management techniques for preventing heat damage of rice plants cirw is the most effective in decreasing the water temperature in a paddy field cirw irrigates water at temperatures lower than those of the surrounding air and paddy water and simultaneously drains the paddy water to allow the cool water to replace the paddy water nishida et al 2018 however as cirw requires more irrigation water than conventional water management techniques tomosho and yamashita 2009 nishida et al 2016 it has been noted that applying cirw without consideration of water supply may cause water use problems tomosho and yamashita 2009 therefore optimum water management conditions e g irrigation rate and amount timing water depth duration that minimize water consumption while maximizing the cooling effect of cirw under the constraint of water supply are required to apply cirw several field experiments have been conducted to investigate the effect of irrigation conditions on the water temperature in a paddy field nishida et al 2013 2015 2016 nishida et al 2016 derived an empirical equation expressing the lowest water temperature distribution in a paddy field from the irrigation water temperature irrigation rate and meteorological conditions moreover the relationship between water temperature and leaf and soil temperature nishida et al 2014 grain protein content of rice nishida et al 2019 and percentages of chalky grains of rice nagahata et al 2005 miyasaka et al 2011 wada et al 2013 nishida et al 2019 has also been studied however there is insufficient data on this effect thus the optimal water management conditions under the constraint of water supply have not been determined numerical simulations based on the physical mechanism of the formation of the heat environment in a paddy field will provide insight into this subject various models have been developed to describe the heat environment in a paddy field e g inoue 1985 kim et al 2001 kimura and kondo 1998 kondo and watanabe 1992 liu et al 2019 maruyama et al 2017 saptomo et al 2004 yoshida et al 2013 moreover several studies have considered the effect of water management irrigation water inflow paddy water outflow and water depth changes on the heat environment e g inoue 1985 saptomo et al 2004 yoshida et al 2013 maruyama et al 2017 these models have been widely used in water temperature prediction and they have been shown to describe the heat environment in a paddy field with high accuracy however as these models assume that the water temperature in a paddy field is the same regardless of the location they are unsuitable for predicting the horizontally varying water temperature in a paddy field the irrigation water is heated or cooled via heat exchange with the atmosphere rice canopy and soil as it flows through the paddy field thus it is inevitable that a temperature gradient will form along the longitudinal line of the field nishida et al 2018 in particular a large temperature gradient is formed under cirw tsuboi and honda 1953 nishida et al 2013 2015 2016 therefore to predict the effect of irrigation on the water temperature in a paddy field it is necessary to consider not only the heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil but also the influence of the heat convection in the paddy field due to the inflow of irrigation water in some recent studies matsubayashi et al 2013 nishida et al 2018 models that consider the water temperature distribution in a paddy field have been developed matsubayashi et al 2013 developed a numerical model that considers the heat convection due to the inflow of irrigation water the model was verified using the water temperature measured at the center of the paddy field however it was not verified using the water temperature distribution in the paddy field nishida et al 2018 derived an equation for predicting the water temperature distribution in a paddy field and showed that the equation satisfactorily expresses the features of paddy water temperature under cirw however as this equation was derived based on the assumption of a constant water depth it is unsuitable for water temperature prediction in conditions of varying water depth consequently for predicting the water temperature distribution in a paddy field there is no numerical model validated using field measured water temperature distributions in a paddy field under the influence of irrigation water in this study we aimed to develop a numerical model capable of expressing water temperature distribution due to the irrigation induced heat convection in paddy fields the accuracy of the developed model was validated through comparisons with the observed water temperature distribution collected on a farmer managed paddy field under cirw management using cool irrigation water moreover the difference in the results of the water temperature prediction of the proposed model and conventional methods without water temperature distribution modeling was simulated to determine how considering water temperature distribution improves the prediction accuracy of the water temperature in a paddy field 2 governing equations 2 1 water balance and water flow in a paddy field to simplify the calculation it was assumed that the surface water flow in a paddy field is horizontal and one dimensional from the irrigation inlet to the outlet of the paddy field because the length of a paddy field in the direction of water flow inlet to outlet is longer than that in the direction perpendicular to the flow the assumption of one dimensional water flow is reasonable based on this assumption changes in water depth and water flow rate in the field were calculated from the water balance equation of ponding water in a paddy field matsubayashi et al 2013 the water balance equation is as follows 1 h t q x p e w e c where h is the water depth m in the paddy field t is time s q 0 is the water flow rate per unit width in the paddy field m2 s 1 x is the horizontal distance m from the inlet of the paddy field p is the percolation rate m s 1 to deep soil e w is the evaporation rate m s 1 from water and e c is the transpiration rate m s 1 assuming that h p e w and e c in the paddy field are constant regardless of location the water balance equation of the paddy water is obtained by integrating eq 1 from the inlet x 0 to the outlet of the paddy field x l 2 l h t q in q out p e w e c l where q in is the irrigation rate m2 s 1 q out is the surface runoff m2 s 1 from the outlet of the paddy field and l is the length m between the inlet and outlet of the paddy field generally q out can be expressed as a function of h e g weir function of q out a h h w 1 5 where a is an empirical constant and h w is the weir height of the outlet by solving eq 2 the change in h can be calculated from eqs 1 and 2 the water flow rate per unit width at x is calculated from q in q out and x l using eq 3 3 q x q in 1 x l q out x l 2 2 heat balance equations the heat balances of paddy water rice canopy and soil were considered in this study the heat balances of paddy water and rice canopy were expressed by the double source model of kondo and watanabe 1992 with the terms expressing heat convection due to horizontal water flow in a paddy field similar to those of nishida et al 2018 although the double source model of kondo and watanabe 1992 is simpler than the multilayer model kondo and watanabe 1992 it is known that the model is robust in terms of structure is stable when calculating the energy balance and can consider the effects of changes in canopy structure and plant physiology maruyama and kuwagata 2010 in fact the model of kondo and watanabe 1992 has been

4 validation of the model 4 1 data for validation the data of water temperature distribution under cirw during the rice ripening period obtained by nishida et al 2016 were used for the validation of the model the data were collected in august 2013 at a farmer managed paddy field in ishikawa prefecture japan the field was rectangular 26 m 78 5 m with an irrigation water inlet and outlet at both ends of the longer side fig 3 cirw was conducted during the nighttime and changes in water temperature distributions and water depth were measured the horizontal distributions of the paddy field water temperature and irrigation water temperature were obtained using thermometers kn laboratories inc osaka japan placed at nine positions along a longitudinal line and at the irrigation canal fig 3 because the length of the long side inlet to outlet is three times that of the short side the temperature distribution of the short side must be smaller than that of the long side thus we assumed that the measured values represent the horizontal temperature distribution along a longitudinal line the changes in water depth were measured using a water pressure gauge the measurements were taken at intervals of 10 min the irrigation rate was estimated from the water balance of the paddy field eq 16 using the measured water depth change percolation rate and surface runoff from the outlet of the paddy field nishida et al 2016 16 q in δ h p l q out h where δh is the increase in water depth m s 1 p was estimated from the water depth changes during the nighttime with no irrigation and surface runoff and q out h was obtained from the water depth using the empirical equation of surface runoff at the outlet nishida et al 2016 meteorological data were obtained at the experimental paddy field located at ishikawa prefectural university which is approximately 10 km from the paddy field 4 2 calculation condition for validation to validate the model we simulated the distribution and time change of water temperature in the field from 12 00 p m jst august 8 12 00 p m august 13 2013 during which there was no rainfall fig 4 a shows the measured water depth and irrigation rate nighttime cirw was conducted five times during this period using different amounts of irrigation water and water depth the amount of irrigation water during this period was 630 mm which is much larger than the amount of percolation and the evapotranspiration rate the conditions for the simulation were as follows the percolation rate p was the measured value 0 45 mm h and the irrigation rate and surface runoff drainage were the values estimated by nishida et al 2016 for the simulation as the estimated value of the rate of surface runoff was calculated with the evapotranspiration taken as zero in nishida et al 2016 the evaporation and transpiration rate for eq 1 was assumed to be zero although the latent heat fluxes in eqs 4 and 5 were considered irrigation water temperature air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were the measured values fig 4 b c and d the downward long wave radiation from the sky was estimated from the air temperature and humidity using the equations of kondo 1994 the soil and vegetation properties are shown in table 1 to reduce the influence of the initial soil temperature on the calculation results the calculation started from 18 30 jst august 6 which is approximately two days before cirw started the initial water temperature of each node was given as the interpolated value of the measured water temperature distributions the initial temperatures at the soil surface were given as the same as the initial water temperatures and those below the soil surface and the bottom boundary temperature were given as 26 c the time step δt was given as 10 s the horizontal space node was set to 17 points nx 17 and the vertical space node was set to six points nz 6 4 3 comparison with conventional methods numerical experiments which did not consider the water temperature distribution were also conducted to determine the difference between the results of conventional methods and the proposed model the following two cases were considered case 1 changes in water depth due to irrigation and surface runoff were modeled but the water temperature distribution in the paddy field and effect of irrigation water temperature on the paddy water were not modeled for the calculation the irrigation water temperature was given as the paddy water temperature at the previous time step case 2 the effects of irrigation water temperature and water depth change on the paddy water temperature were modeled but the water temperature distribution was not modeled for the calculations of cases 1 and 2 the number of the horizontal node nx was taken as one in the proposed model thus the discretized version of eq 4 for case 1 and case 2 became eq 17 and eq 18 respectively as follows 17 c w h t w h 0 t w 0 t f v r 1 f v σ t c 4 σ t w 4 h w le w g c w p t w 0 c w q in t w 0 q out t w 0 l 18 c w h t w h 0 t w 0 t f v r 1 f v σ t c 4 σ t w 4 h w le w g c w p t w 0 c w q in t win q out t w 0 l where t win is the irrigation water temperature the meteorological rice and soil conditions as well as irrigation rates and surface runoff were the same as those used in the validation of the proposed model initial water and soil temperatures were given in the same manner as the proposed model the measured water temperature at the center of the field was used to determine the initial temperatures furthermore an additional numerical experiment case 3 was conducted to investigate the effect of the heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil on the water temperature distribution case 3 the effects of irrigation water temperature water depth change on the paddy water temperature and water temperature distribution were modeled but the heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil was not modeled for the calculations of case 3 the heat exchange terms of radiation sensible and latent heat and downward heat conduction flux in eq 4 were set as zero thus the discretized version of eq 4 for case 3 became eq 19 as follows 19 c w h t w i h 0 t w i 0 t c w p t w i 0 c w q i 1 t w i 1 2 0 q i t w i 1 2 0 δ x i the initial water temperatures as well as irrigation rates and surface runoff were the same as those used in the validation of the proposed model for case 3 the meteorological rice and soil conditions did not affect the water temperature 5 results and discussion 5 1 validation the calculated and measured water temperatures as a function of time and distance from the inlet respectively are shown in figs 5 and 6 the root mean square errors rmses for the estimation of water temperatures during the entire period and nighttime irrigation were 0 98 c and 0 55 c respectively matsubayashi et al 2013 reported that rmses for the estimation of water temperature at the center of two paddy fields during the nighttime were 0 5 c and 0 7 c respectively the nighttime rmse of our model was almost the same as that of matsubayashi et al 2013 the prediction accuracy during the nighttime irrigation was better than that during the entire period in particular the rmse was 0 38 c and was small at the end of the irrigation when the water flow in the field became almost steady and the water depth was constant this rmse was almost the same as the rmse of 0 39 c for the analytical model of nishida et al 2018 but lower than that of 0 62 c for the empirical equation of nishida et al 2016 the calculated and measured time averaged water temperature distributions during the entire period 12 00 august 8 12 00 august 13 are shown in fig 7 the differences between the calculated and measured average water temperatures were small and ranged from 0 44 0 38 c average 0 04 c from these results it can be seen that the temporal and spatial changes in the calculated water temperature showed good agreement with the measured values under the different irrigation and water depth conditions the cooling effect of cirw on the water temperature and the increase in water temperature along the flow path in the field during cirw were successfully represented the relatively high rmse during the entire period may be because of insufficient evaluation of the effect of solar radiation and bulk transfer coefficient during the daytime e g plant parameters the effect of thermal convection on the bulk transport coefficient on the other hand although other factors contributed to increasing the error during the daytime the water temperature prediction accuracy during the nighttime irrigation was high this indicates that the irrigation water temperature strongly affected the water temperature during the irrigation in comparison with that during the daytime further although matsubayashi et al 2013 and nishida et al 2018 evaluated their models using the water temperature measured only at the center of the paddy field and under constant time water depth conditions respectively the rmse of our model which was evaluated using the water temperature distribution under time change water depth condition was almost the same these comparisons indicate that our model improves the reliability and usefulness of water temperature prediction during irrigation moreover the smaller rmse of our model compared to that of the empirical equation of nishida et al 2016 indicates that the evaluation by the physical model is superior to the simple empirical model of nishida et al 2016 from these results we conclude that the proposed model can express qualitative and quantitative features of the paddy water temperature environment under cirw conditions that result in large water temperature gradients in paddy fields although the validation data used in this study is limited to a short duration our model which is based on the physical mechanism of the heat environment formation in a paddy field is expected to make accurate predictions even in environments with different meteorological and irrigation conditions this is because the thermal environment in a paddy field is physically determined however the soil and rice parameters needed for the calculation differ depending on soil type and growing season growth and variety of rice thus to accurately predict the thermal environment in a paddy field under different conditions it is essential to use the parameters that appropriately express the soil and rice properties of the field 5 2 comparison with conventional method the calculated time averaged water temperatures of cases 1 2 and 3 are shown in fig 7 fig 8 compares the calculated and measured water temperatures at 8 5 m 38 5 m and 68 5 m from the inlet as a function of time the calculated average water temperatures of case 1 were 1 1 4 4 c higher than the measured average temperatures the rmses of the water temperature at 8 5 m 38 5 m and 68 5 m from the inlet for case 1 were 4 6 c 3 4 c and 1 6 c respectively on the other hand the differences between the calculated and measured time averaged water temperatures of case 2 ranged from 1 1 2 2 c average 0 65 c the rmses at 8 5 m 38 5 m and 68 5 m for case 2 were 2 4 c 1 2 c and 1 4 c respectively the calculated average water temperatures of case 3 were 3 3 6 4 c lower than the measured average temperatures as large temperature gradients were formed in the paddy field there were poor accuracies in both case 1 with the effect of water depth change but without the effect of irrigation water temperature and case 2 with the effect of water depth changes and irrigation water temperature which did not consider the water temperature distribution case 1 highly overestimated the water temperature almost throughout the entire period and the difference was large especially near the inlet case 2 calculated the cooling effect of the inflow of cool irrigation water and the calculated average water temperature was 2 2 c lower than that of case 1 fig 7 however as the water temperature in the paddy field was calculated as being uniform the simulation of case 2 overestimated and underestimated the water temperature near the inlet and outlet respectively these results indicate that the conventional method that does not consider the temperature distribution is inadequate for accurate prediction of water temperature under cirw conditions in contrast case 3 highly underestimated the water temperature fig 7 although the water temperature near the inlet e g 8 5 m during irrigation was almost similar to the measured water temperature fig 8 a the difference between the calculated and measured water temperatures during irrigation increased with the distance from the inlet fig 8 b and c additionally the difference during the daytime became quite large these results indicate that the method that does not consider the heat exchange is also inadequate for accurate prediction of water temperature under cirw conditions in contrast the proposed model successfully represented the spatial and temporal changes in the water temperature measured in the field and showed the high prediction accuracy as written above the rmses at 8 5 m 38 5 m and 68 5 m for the proposed model were 0 87 c 0 75 c and 0 78 c respectively and were lower than those for cases 1 and 2 these results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively improved using the proposed model these comparisons indicate that the consideration of both the temperature distribution and heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil is essential for accurate prediction of water temperature distribution under cirw conditions 5 3 importance of modeling water temperature distribution on water temperature prediction irrigating water into a paddy field affects the thermal environment of the paddy this effect is particularly large when water management techniques for controlling water temperature are applied when a large amount of water is irrigated to a paddy field e g cirw a non negligible water temperature gradient inevitably forms in the field tsuboi and honda 1953 nishida et al 2013 2015 2016 such a water temperature gradient cannot be represented by the conventional methods that do not consider water temperature distribution in a paddy field this is regardless of whether the effects of irrigation water inflow water runoff and water depth changes on the water temperature are considered as shown in figs 7 and 8 as the conventional method assumes that water temperature in the field is uniform irrigation water is calculated to be completely mixed with paddy water however such mixing is unrealistic in reality the irrigation water is cooled or heated via the heat exchanges as it flows through the paddy field thereby forming the temperature gradient in the field nishida et al 2018 our results clearly demonstrate that our model successfully represents the spatial and temporal changes in the water temperature measured in the field which cannot be represented by the conventional methods figs 6 and 7 introducing the thermal convection term into the heat balance equation of paddy water eq 4 with the simple water balance model eqs 1 to 3 significantly improved the prediction accuracy of water temperature under irrigation section 5 2 these facts indicate that the modeling of water temperature distribution due to the inflow of irrigation water is essential to predicting the water temperature in a paddy field under irrigation a numerical simulation using our method provides significant useful information to understand and evaluate the effect of water management techniques on the heat environment in a paddy field the modeling of water temperature distribution is also important for the prediction of various phenomena e g carbon and nitrogen cycle greenhouse gas release that are affected by water and soil temperature in the fields as the irrigation water temperature is different from the paddy water temperature irrigation inevitably changes paddy water temperature even under conventional water management resulting in disruptions phenomena moreover as several phenomena have a nonlinear relationship with temperature a slight error in temperature prediction may significantly affect the prediction result of a phenomenon thus the modeling of water temperature distribution is also useful for improving the prediction and evaluation of the temperature dependent phenomena in paddy fields this improvement will contribute to an understanding of optimal water management which could help to reduce the negative environmental impact of paddy fields 6 conclusions in this study a numerical model to predict horizontal water temperature distribution in a paddy field was developed the model considers not only the heat exchange between the atmosphere paddy rice water and soil but also the horizontal heat movement within a paddy field due to the inflow of irrigation water and outflow of paddy field water the results of this study indicate that the proposed model satisfactorily expresses the features of paddy water temperature distribution under the effect of irrigation moreover a comparison of the results with and without the modeling of water temperature distribution demonstrated that the prediction accuracy is effectively improved by considering the water temperature distribution these results suggest that the prediction of water temperature distribution is important for a more accurate prediction of paddy water temperature and various phenomena affected by water temperature numerical simulations using crop and environmental models with the prediction of water temperature distribution will contribute to understanding the optimal water management for improving agricultural production and reduce the negative environmental impact of paddy fields funding this work was supported by jsps kakenhi grant numbers 16k07939 19h03071

10262,irrigating water into a paddy field inevitably changes the water temperature and produces a temperature distribution in the field in this study a numerical model for predicting the horizontal water temperature distribution in a paddy field was developed in addition to considering the heat exchange between the atmosphere paddy rice water and soil the model also considers the horizontal heat convection within the paddy field due to the inflow of irrigation water and outflow of paddy field water the horizontal water flow in the field is modeled by the water balance equation of paddy water the model was validated using field measurements collected in a paddy field where the continuous irrigation with running water cirw management method was applied the calculated changes in water temperatures over time and distance showed good agreement with the observed values further the root mean square error rmse of the water temperature during the entire validation period was 0 98 c and the rmse during the nighttime cirw irrigation was 0 55 c these results indicate that the model satisfactorily expresses the features of paddy water temperature distribution under the effect of irrigation water inflow moreover a comparison of the calculation results of the proposed model to those of the conventional methods that do not consider the water temperature distribution demonstrated that the prediction accuracy significantly improves when the water temperature distribution is considered our results suggest that the prediction of water temperature distribution is useful for a more accurate prediction of paddy heat environment and various phenomena affected by water temperature in a paddy field keywords thermal environment in paddy field heat balance equation horizontal water flow in paddy water heat convection water management technique 1 introduction the water temperature in rice paddy fields substantially affects not only rice growth yield and quality matsushima et al 1964 shimono et al 2002 2004 2005 usui et al 2016 li et al 2018 sharifi et al 2018 but also the nitrogen environment inside and outside of the paddy fields as well as greenhouse gas emissions lan et al 2014 rizzo et al 2014 tan et al 2018 thus controlling the water temperature may significantly improve the agricultural production and reduce the negative environmental impact of paddy fields in paddy fields the water temperature is mainly affected by the heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil including water management conditions such as irrigation rate irrigation water temperature and water depth nishida et al 2018 thus various water management techniques have been proposed for controlling the heat environments in paddy fields for example in japan water management techniques e g continuous irrigation with running water cirw controlling water depth have been applied to reduce heat and prevent damage to rice plant morita et al 2016 recently the high temperature damage of rice due to high air temperatures during the rice grain ripening period tashiro and wardlaw 1991 has become a problem in rice cultivation terashima et al 2001 morita 2008 ministry of agriculture and forestry and fisheries of japan 2008 2011 morita et al 2016 and it is feared that future global warming may worsen the high temperature damage morita 2008 morita et al 2016 to prevent this heat damage water management techniques to cool water temperature in paddy fields have been proposed and tested in japan nagahata et al 2005 miyasaka et al 2011 wada et al 2013 it is believed that reducing the water temperature is effective in preventing heat damage of rice plants among the water management techniques for preventing heat damage of rice plants cirw is the most effective in decreasing the water temperature in a paddy field cirw irrigates water at temperatures lower than those of the surrounding air and paddy water and simultaneously drains the paddy water to allow the cool water to replace the paddy water nishida et al 2018 however as cirw requires more irrigation water than conventional water management techniques tomosho and yamashita 2009 nishida et al 2016 it has been noted that applying cirw without consideration of water supply may cause water use problems tomosho and yamashita 2009 therefore optimum water management conditions e g irrigation rate and amount timing water depth duration that minimize water consumption while maximizing the cooling effect of cirw under the constraint of water supply are required to apply cirw several field experiments have been conducted to investigate the effect of irrigation conditions on the water temperature in a paddy field nishida et al 2013 2015 2016 nishida et al 2016 derived an empirical equation expressing the lowest water temperature distribution in a paddy field from the irrigation water temperature irrigation rate and meteorological conditions moreover the relationship between water temperature and leaf and soil temperature nishida et al 2014 grain protein content of rice nishida et al 2019 and percentages of chalky grains of rice nagahata et al 2005 miyasaka et al 2011 wada et al 2013 nishida et al 2019 has also been studied however there is insufficient data on this effect thus the optimal water management conditions under the constraint of water supply have not been determined numerical simulations based on the physical mechanism of the formation of the heat environment in a paddy field will provide insight into this subject various models have been developed to describe the heat environment in a paddy field e g inoue 1985 kim et al 2001 kimura and kondo 1998 kondo and watanabe 1992 liu et al 2019 maruyama et al 2017 saptomo et al 2004 yoshida et al 2013 moreover several studies have considered the effect of water management irrigation water inflow paddy water outflow and water depth changes on the heat environment e g inoue 1985 saptomo et al 2004 yoshida et al 2013 maruyama et al 2017 these models have been widely used in water temperature prediction and they have been shown to describe the heat environment in a paddy field with high accuracy however as these models assume that the water temperature in a paddy field is the same regardless of the location they are unsuitable for predicting the horizontally varying water temperature in a paddy field the irrigation water is heated or cooled via heat exchange with the atmosphere rice canopy and soil as it flows through the paddy field thus it is inevitable that a temperature gradient will form along the longitudinal line of the field nishida et al 2018 in particular a large temperature gradient is formed under cirw tsuboi and honda 1953 nishida et al 2013 2015 2016 therefore to predict the effect of irrigation on the water temperature in a paddy field it is necessary to consider not only the heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil but also the influence of the heat convection in the paddy field due to the inflow of irrigation water in some recent studies matsubayashi et al 2013 nishida et al 2018 models that consider the water temperature distribution in a paddy field have been developed matsubayashi et al 2013 developed a numerical model that considers the heat convection due to the inflow of irrigation water the model was verified using the water temperature measured at the center of the paddy field however it was not verified using the water temperature distribution in the paddy field nishida et al 2018 derived an equation for predicting the water temperature distribution in a paddy field and showed that the equation satisfactorily expresses the features of paddy water temperature under cirw however as this equation was derived based on the assumption of a constant water depth it is unsuitable for water temperature prediction in conditions of varying water depth consequently for predicting the water temperature distribution in a paddy field there is no numerical model validated using field measured water temperature distributions in a paddy field under the influence of irrigation water in this study we aimed to develop a numerical model capable of expressing water temperature distribution due to the irrigation induced heat convection in paddy fields the accuracy of the developed model was validated through comparisons with the observed water temperature distribution collected on a farmer managed paddy field under cirw management using cool irrigation water moreover the difference in the results of the water temperature prediction of the proposed model and conventional methods without water temperature distribution modeling was simulated to determine how considering water temperature distribution improves the prediction accuracy of the water temperature in a paddy field 2 governing equations 2 1 water balance and water flow in a paddy field to simplify the calculation it was assumed that the surface water flow in a paddy field is horizontal and one dimensional from the irrigation inlet to the outlet of the paddy field because the length of a paddy field in the direction of water flow inlet to outlet is longer than that in the direction perpendicular to the flow the assumption of one dimensional water flow is reasonable based on this assumption changes in water depth and water flow rate in the field were calculated from the water balance equation of ponding water in a paddy field matsubayashi et al 2013 the water balance equation is as follows 1 h t q x p e w e c where h is the water depth m in the paddy field t is time s q 0 is the water flow rate per unit width in the paddy field m2 s 1 x is the horizontal distance m from the inlet of the paddy field p is the percolation rate m s 1 to deep soil e w is the evaporation rate m s 1 from water and e c is the transpiration rate m s 1 assuming that h p e w and e c in the paddy field are constant regardless of location the water balance equation of the paddy water is obtained by integrating eq 1 from the inlet x 0 to the outlet of the paddy field x l 2 l h t q in q out p e w e c l where q in is the irrigation rate m2 s 1 q out is the surface runoff m2 s 1 from the outlet of the paddy field and l is the length m between the inlet and outlet of the paddy field generally q out can be expressed as a function of h e g weir function of q out a h h w 1 5 where a is an empirical constant and h w is the weir height of the outlet by solving eq 2 the change in h can be calculated from eqs 1 and 2 the water flow rate per unit width at x is calculated from q in q out and x l using eq 3 3 q x q in 1 x l q out x l 2 2 heat balance equations the heat balances of paddy water rice canopy and soil were considered in this study the heat balances of paddy water and rice canopy were expressed by the double source model of kondo and watanabe 1992 with the terms expressing heat convection due to horizontal water flow in a paddy field similar to those of nishida et al 2018 although the double source model of kondo and watanabe 1992 is simpler than the multilayer model kondo and watanabe 1992 it is known that the model is robust in terms of structure is stable when calculating the energy balance and can consider the effects of changes in canopy structure and plant physiology maruyama and kuwagata 2010 in fact the model of kondo and watanabe 1992 has been applied to paddy fields in several studies and shown capable of estimating heat transfer with high accuracy kondo and watanabe 1992 maruyama and kuwagata 2008 2010 maruyama et al 2017 nishida et al 2018 introduced the heat convection term into the double source model and showed that the equation can express the water temperature distribution in a paddy field under cirw the heat balance equation

4 validation of the model 4 1 data for validation the data of water temperature distribution under cirw during the rice ripening period obtained by nishida et al 2016 were used for the validation of the model the data were collected in august 2013 at a farmer managed paddy field in ishikawa prefecture japan the field was rectangular 26 m 78 5 m with an irrigation water inlet and outlet at both ends of the longer side fig 3 cirw was conducted during the nighttime and changes in water temperature distributions and water depth were measured the horizontal distributions of the paddy field water temperature and irrigation water temperature were obtained using thermometers kn laboratories inc osaka japan placed at nine positions along a longitudinal line and at the irrigation canal fig 3 because the length of the long side inlet to outlet is three times that of the short side the temperature distribution of the short side must be smaller than that of the long side thus we assumed that the measured values represent the horizontal temperature distribution along a longitudinal line the changes in water depth were measured using a water pressure gauge the measurements were taken at intervals of 10 min the irrigation rate was estimated from the water balance of the paddy field eq 16 using the measured water depth change percolation rate and surface runoff from the outlet of the paddy field nishida et al 2016 16 q in δ h p l q out h where δh is the increase in water depth m s 1 p was estimated from the water depth changes during the nighttime with no irrigation and surface runoff and q out h was obtained from the water depth using the empirical equation of surface runoff at the outlet nishida et al 2016 meteorological data were obtained at the experimental paddy field located at ishikawa prefectural university which is approximately 10 km from the paddy field 4 2 calculation condition for validation to validate the model we simulated the distribution and time change of water temperature in the field from 12 00 p m jst august 8 12 00 p m august 13 2013 during which there was no rainfall fig 4 a shows the measured water depth and irrigation rate nighttime cirw was conducted five times during this period using different amounts of irrigation water and water depth the amount of irrigation water during this period was 630 mm which is much larger than the amount of percolation and the evapotranspiration rate the conditions for the simulation were as follows the percolation rate p was the measured value 0 45 mm h and the irrigation rate and surface runoff drainage were the values estimated by nishida et al 2016 for the simulation as the estimated value of the rate of surface runoff was calculated with the evapotranspiration taken as zero in nishida et al 2016 the evaporation and transpiration rate for eq 1 was assumed to be zero although the latent heat fluxes in eqs 4 and 5 were considered irrigation water temperature air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were the measured values fig 4 b c and d the downward long wave radiation from the sky was estimated from the air temperature and humidity using the equations of kondo 1994 the soil and vegetation properties are shown in table 1 to reduce the influence of the initial soil temperature on the calculation results the calculation started from 18 30 jst august 6 which is approximately two days before cirw started the initial water temperature of each node was given as the interpolated value of the measured water temperature distributions the initial temperatures at the soil surface were given as the same as the initial water temperatures and those below the soil surface and the bottom boundary temperature were given as 26 c the time step δt was given as 10 s the horizontal space node was set to 17 points nx 17 and the vertical space node was set to six points nz 6 4 3 comparison with conventional methods numerical experiments which did not consider the water temperature distribution were also conducted to determine the difference between the results of conventional methods and the proposed model the following two cases were considered case 1 changes in water depth due to irrigation and surface runoff were modeled but the water temperature distribution in the paddy field and effect of irrigation water temperature on the paddy water were not modeled for the calculation the irrigation water temperature was given as the paddy water temperature at the previous time step case 2 the effects of irrigation water temperature and water depth change on the paddy water temperature were modeled but the water temperature distribution was not modeled for the calculations of cases 1 and 2 the number of the horizontal node nx was taken as one in the proposed model thus the discretized version of eq 4 for case 1 and case 2 became eq 17 and eq 18 respectively as follows 17 c w h t w h 0 t w 0 t f v r 1 f v σ t c 4 σ t w 4 h w le w g c w p t w 0 c w q in t w 0 q out t w 0 l 18 c w h t w h 0 t w 0 t f v r 1 f v σ t c 4 σ t w 4 h w le w g c w p t w 0 c w q in t win q out t w 0 l where t win is the irrigation water temperature the meteorological rice and soil conditions as well as irrigation rates and surface runoff were the same as those used in the validation of the proposed model initial water and soil temperatures were given in the same manner as the proposed model the measured water temperature at the center of the field was used to determine the initial temperatures furthermore an additional numerical experiment case 3 was conducted to investigate the effect of the heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil on the water temperature distribution case 3 the effects of irrigation water temperature water depth change on the paddy water temperature and water temperature distribution were modeled but the heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil was not modeled for the calculations of case 3 the heat exchange terms of radiation sensible and latent heat and downward heat conduction flux in eq 4 were set as zero thus the discretized version of eq 4 for case 3 became eq 19 as follows 19 c w h t w i h 0 t w i 0 t c w p t w i 0 c w q i 1 t w i 1 2 0 q i t w i 1 2 0 δ x i the initial water temperatures as well as irrigation rates and surface runoff were the same as those used in the validation of the proposed model for case 3 the meteorological rice and soil conditions did not affect the water temperature 5 results and discussion 5 1 validation the calculated and measured water temperatures as a function of time and distance from the inlet respectively are shown in figs 5 and 6 the root mean square errors rmses for the estimation of water temperatures during the entire period and nighttime irrigation were 0 98 c and 0 55 c respectively matsubayashi et al 2013 reported that rmses for the estimation of water temperature at the center of two paddy fields during the nighttime were 0 5 c and 0 7 c respectively the nighttime rmse of our model was almost the same as that of matsubayashi et al 2013 the prediction accuracy during the nighttime irrigation was better than that during the entire period in particular the rmse was 0 38 c and was small at the end of the irrigation when the water flow in the field became almost steady and the water depth was constant this rmse was almost the same as the rmse of 0 39 c for the analytical model of nishida et al 2018 but lower than that of 0 62 c for the empirical equation of nishida et al 2016 the calculated and measured time averaged water temperature distributions during the entire period 12 00 august 8 12 00 august 13 are shown in fig 7 the differences between the calculated and measured average water temperatures were small and ranged from 0 44 0 38 c average 0 04 c from these results it can be seen that the temporal and spatial changes in the calculated water temperature showed good agreement with the measured values under the different irrigation and water depth conditions the cooling effect of cirw on the water temperature and the increase in water temperature along the flow path in the field during cirw were successfully represented the relatively high rmse during the entire period may be because of insufficient evaluation of the effect of solar radiation and bulk transfer coefficient during the daytime e g plant parameters the effect of thermal convection on the bulk transport coefficient on the other hand although other factors contributed to increasing the error during the daytime the water temperature prediction accuracy during the nighttime irrigation was high this indicates that the irrigation water temperature strongly affected the water temperature during the irrigation in comparison with that during the daytime further although matsubayashi et al 2013 and nishida et al 2018 evaluated their models using the water temperature measured only at the center of the paddy field and under constant time water depth conditions respectively the rmse of our model which was evaluated using the water temperature distribution under time change water depth condition was almost the same these comparisons indicate that our model improves the reliability and usefulness of water temperature prediction during irrigation moreover the smaller rmse of our model compared to that of the empirical equation of nishida et al 2016 indicates that the evaluation by the physical model is superior to the simple empirical model of nishida et al 2016 from these results we conclude that the proposed model can express qualitative and quantitative features of the paddy water temperature environment under cirw conditions that result in large water temperature gradients in paddy fields although the validation data used in this study is limited to a short duration our model which is based on the physical mechanism of the heat environment formation in a paddy field is expected to make accurate predictions even in environments with different meteorological and irrigation conditions this is because the thermal environment in a paddy field is physically determined however the soil and rice parameters needed for the calculation differ depending on soil type and growing season growth and variety of rice thus to accurately predict the thermal environment in a paddy field under different conditions it is essential to use the parameters that appropriately express the soil and rice properties of the field 5 2 comparison with conventional method the calculated time averaged water temperatures of cases 1 2 and 3 are shown in fig 7 fig 8 compares the calculated and measured water temperatures at 8 5 m 38 5 m and 68 5 m from the inlet as a function of time the calculated average water temperatures of case 1 were 1 1 4 4 c higher than the measured average temperatures the rmses of the water temperature at 8 5 m 38 5 m and 68 5 m from the inlet for case 1 were 4 6 c 3 4 c and 1 6 c respectively on the other hand the differences between the calculated and measured time averaged water temperatures of case 2 ranged from 1 1 2 2 c average 0 65 c the rmses at 8 5 m 38 5 m and 68 5 m for case 2 were 2 4 c 1 2 c and 1 4 c respectively the calculated average water temperatures of case 3 were 3 3 6 4 c lower than the measured average temperatures as large temperature gradients were formed in the paddy field there were poor accuracies in both case 1 with the effect of water depth change but without the effect of irrigation water temperature and case 2 with the effect of water depth changes and irrigation water temperature which did not consider the water temperature distribution case 1 highly overestimated the water temperature almost throughout the entire period and the difference was large especially near the inlet case 2 calculated the cooling effect of the inflow of cool irrigation water and the calculated average water temperature was 2 2 c lower than that of case 1 fig 7 however as the water temperature in the paddy field was calculated as being uniform the simulation of case 2 overestimated and underestimated the water temperature near the inlet and outlet respectively these results indicate that the conventional method that does not consider the temperature distribution is inadequate for accurate prediction of water temperature under cirw conditions in contrast case 3 highly underestimated the water temperature fig 7 although the water temperature near the inlet e g 8 5 m during irrigation was almost similar to the measured water temperature fig 8 a the difference between the calculated and measured water temperatures during irrigation increased with the distance from the inlet fig 8 b and c additionally the difference during the daytime became quite large these results indicate that the method that does not consider the heat exchange is also inadequate for accurate prediction of water temperature under cirw conditions in contrast the proposed model successfully represented the spatial and temporal changes in the water temperature measured in the field and showed the high prediction accuracy as written above the rmses at 8 5 m 38 5 m and 68 5 m for the proposed model were 0 87 c 0 75 c and 0 78 c respectively and were lower than those for cases 1 and 2 these results indicate that the prediction accuracy is effectively improved using the proposed model these comparisons indicate that the consideration of both the temperature distribution and heat exchange with the atmosphere rice and soil is essential for accurate prediction of water temperature distribution under cirw conditions 5 3 importance of modeling water temperature distribution on water temperature prediction irrigating water into a paddy field affects the thermal environment of the paddy this effect is particularly large when water management techniques for controlling water temperature are applied when a large amount of water is irrigated to a paddy field e g cirw a non negligible water temperature gradient inevitably forms in the field tsuboi and honda 1953 nishida et al 2013 2015 2016 such a water temperature gradient cannot be represented by the conventional methods that do not consider water temperature distribution in a paddy field this is regardless of whether the effects of irrigation water inflow water runoff and water depth changes on the water temperature are considered as shown in figs 7 and 8 as the conventional method assumes that water temperature in the field is uniform irrigation water is calculated to be completely mixed with paddy water however such mixing is unrealistic in reality the irrigation water is cooled or heated via the heat exchanges as it flows through the paddy field thereby forming the temperature gradient in the field nishida et al 2018 our results clearly demonstrate that our model successfully represents the spatial and temporal changes in the water temperature measured in the field which cannot be represented by the conventional methods figs 6 and 7 introducing the thermal convection term into the heat balance equation of paddy water eq 4 with the simple water balance model eqs 1 to 3 significantly improved the prediction accuracy of water temperature under irrigation section 5 2 these facts indicate that the modeling of water temperature distribution due to the inflow of irrigation water is essential to predicting the water temperature in a paddy field under irrigation a numerical simulation using our method provides significant useful information to understand and evaluate the effect of water management techniques on the heat environment in a paddy field the modeling of water temperature distribution is also important for the prediction of various phenomena e g carbon and nitrogen cycle greenhouse gas release that are affected by water and soil temperature in the fields as the irrigation water temperature is different from the paddy water temperature irrigation inevitably changes paddy water temperature even under conventional water management resulting in disruptions phenomena moreover as several phenomena have a nonlinear relationship with temperature a slight error in temperature prediction may significantly affect the prediction result of a phenomenon thus the modeling of water temperature distribution is also useful for improving the prediction and evaluation of the temperature dependent phenomena in paddy fields this improvement will contribute to an understanding of optimal water management which could help to reduce the negative environmental impact of paddy fields 6 conclusions in this study a numerical model to predict horizontal water temperature distribution in a paddy field was developed the model considers not only the heat exchange between the atmosphere paddy rice water and soil but also the horizontal heat movement within a paddy field due to the inflow of irrigation water and outflow of paddy field water the results of this study indicate that the proposed model satisfactorily expresses the features of paddy water temperature distribution under the effect of irrigation moreover a comparison of the results with and without the modeling of water temperature distribution demonstrated that the prediction accuracy is effectively improved by considering the water temperature distribution these results suggest that the prediction of water temperature distribution is important for a more accurate prediction of paddy water temperature and various phenomena affected by water temperature numerical simulations using crop and environmental models with the prediction of water temperature distribution will contribute to understanding the optimal water management for improving agricultural production and reduce the negative environmental impact of paddy fields funding this work was supported by jsps kakenhi grant numbers 16k07939 19h03071

10263,solar pv pumping system for irrigation purpose has been gained importance in recent times considering its environmental friendly characteristics and to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel based energy sources for pumping in general 3 hp and 5 hp capacity solar pv pumping systems are used for irrigation purpose in india however large capacity pumps are often also used to lift groundwater resources which may lead to further depletion of ground water table keeping in mind these constraints performance of small sized solar pv pumps of 1 hp capacity was evaluated to lift and irrigate shallow water resources using pressurized irrigation systems experimental observations revealed that 1 hp solar pv pumping system either ac or dc type could successfully be used to operate mini sprinklers micro sprinklers and drippers with good irrigation uniformity further a self sustainable module for sustainable use of water and energy was designed in which both water and energy are harvested and recycled life cycle cost analysis showed that 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system was slightly cheaper than corresponding ac pumping system even the carbon footprint of 1 hp solar pv pumping systems is quite lower 0 009 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 than grid connected electric pumps 1 214 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 and diesel operated pumps 0 382 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 therefore 1 hp solar pv pumping systems could be a feasible solution for small and marginal farmers in the context of water scarcity situation in near future and to mitigate the climate change effects in agricultural farms keywords solar pv pump pressurized irrigation head discharge relationship life cycle cost greenhouse gas emission irrigation uniformity 1 introduction water is the primary source of life for mankind and is the most basic necessity for food production system fao 2017 demand for water to irrigate crops has been increasing at a very fast rate to produce sufficient amount of food for large number of population throughout the world for sustainable production of food from agricultural farms irrigating crops at right stages and efficient utilization of available water resources are highly important saiz rubio and rovira mas 2020 oweis 1997 pressurized irrigation systems helps in application of irrigation water preciously in the agricultural field however energy is required for this purpose fossil fuel based irrigation pumps generally grid connected electric pumps and diesel pumps meet the required energy demand for irrigation purpose fossil fuel based energy sources have adverse effect on climate and it is depleting at a very fast rate therefore alternative solutions to meet the energy demand in agriculture need to be looked for renewable energy options including solar wind biomass etc may provide environment friendly solutions to meet the energy demand for irrigation purpose naas 2018 groundwater resources are mostly used for irrigation purpose however it has been depleting at a very fast rate to meet the civilization targets and therefore needs due attention to optimally use this precious resource harvesting of runoff water in surface storage structures followed by pumping it for irrigation purpose may be a potential solution to achieve the set goal of crop per drop mission abraham and mathew 2018 solar photovoltaic pv pumps are quite useful under such circumstances hossain et al 2015 shinde and wandre 2015 sontake and kalamkar 2016 wazed et al 2017 bassi 2018 typically a solar pv pumping system consists of pv modules mounting structure pump unit ac dc and tracking system sizing of pv module in solar pv pumping system depends on solar irradiation and pumping head odeh et al 2006 if the suction head is about 4 5 m which is the maximum possible in a surface water storage structures 1 hp capacity pump is sufficient however to lift deep ground water size of pv modules needs to be increased accordingly benghanem et al 2014 further if the designed irrigation network requires high operating pressure head the pump capacity and the size of pv modules needs to be increased odeh et al 2006 campana et al 2013 therefore sizing of the pv pumping system is very crucial for applying right amount of water in agricultural field glasnovic and margeta 2007 hamidat and benyoucef 2009 khatib 2010 abu aligah 2011 rawat et al 2016 further solar pv pumping system can be used efficiently if its performance characteristics are known under different pumping head and solar insolation several literatures have reported the head discharge characteristics of solar pv pumping system under different solar irradiation however mostly these are either for large sized solar pump or the experiments were conducted outside india odeh et al 2006 joshi et al 2009 benghanem et al 2014 muhsen et al 2017 ba et al 2018 tiwari and kalamkar 2018 performance of small scale irrigation system using solar pv pumps have also been reported in few literatures singh and pande 2000 pande et al 2003 hamidat et al 2003 kumar et al 2015 irrigation uniformity under pressurized irrigation system is another indicator to judge the performance of irrigation pumping system and knowledge on it under solar pv pumping system is limited in literature zaman et al 2018 since solar irradiation influence the pump s discharge the irrigation uniformity is also expected to vary at different times in a day therefore the influence of solar irradiation on pump s discharge and the irrigation uniformity needs to be determined for better irrigation scheduling economics of solar pv pumping system is another important requirement to successfully adopt the system by farmers in field although the economic superiority of solar pv pumping systems over grid connected electric pumps and diesel pumps have been reported in literatures santra et al 2016 jones et al 2016 however due attention needs to be given to develop self sustainable model so that the system may fetch additional income to farmers knowledge on life cycle cost of solar pv pumping system helps to develop such models and also to guide the stakeholders for capital investment solar pv pumping system also helps in mitigating the greenhouse gas ghg emission potential effect of solar pv systems on reduction in ghg emission have been reported in several literatures chaurey and kandpal 2009 amponsah et al 2014 breyer et al 2015 however the impact of solar pv pumping system on reduction in ghg emission while it replaces grid connected electric pump and diesel operated pump are limited kumar and kandpal 2007 purohit andmichaelowa 2008 moreover solar pv generation is often considered as clean energy production and hence the ghg emission from pv system is taken as zero when ghg mitigation potential of whole system is calculated however solar pv system also contributes to ghg emission although it is very low during its total life cycle which includes cultivation fabrication construction operation maintenance etc nugent and sovacool 2014 therefore consideration of emission factor of solar pv module is also to be considered while the mitigation potential of solar pv pumping system is calculated thus it has been observed that solar pv pumping system has several advantages over conventional irrigation pumping system focusing to tackle the climate change effects and water scarcity situations solar pv pumping systems have been widely used for irrigation purpose at different parts of the world national governments of several countries support policies and programs for intensive adoption of solar pumps in agricultural field karekezi and kithyoma 2002 al samarrai et al 2017 sklarew and sklarew 2018 da silva et al 2020 likewise national government of india also promotes the use of solar pv pumps for irrigation purpose in agriculture by implementing several programs and schemes e g national mission on sustainable agriculture nmsa pradhan mantri krishi sinchai yojana pmksy national solar mission nsm kisan urja suraksha evam utthaan mahabhiyan kusum or farmer s energy security and upliftment program etc niti ayog 2018 rathore et al 2018 shah et al 2018 shah 2018 purohit and purohit 2018 in order to fulfill the targeted objectives of these long term national programs prerequisite information on performance of solar pv pumping system under varying conditions of pumping head and solar irradiation is very essential keeping in mind the importance of solar pv pumping system in the current scenario and the considering the large number 86 2 of total number of farmers of small and marginal farmers in india having land holdings less than 2 ha it is highly important to establish energy and water sustainable farming unit therefore the present manuscript focused on performance evaluation of 1 hp solar pv pumping system to operate different micro irrigation system which is otherwise operated by large sized pv pumping system e g 3 5 hp pumps the major concern of using large sized pv pumps in arid zone is possible over exploitation of ground water resources due to free availability of energy in the agricultural field once the pv pump is established therefore harvesting of water in farm ponds and use of the stored water for irrigation through small sized pv pump may be an optimistic solution for sustainable water and energy management in agricultural production from arid zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 operationalisation of 1 hp solar pv pumping system two solar photovoltaic pv pumping systems were installed at experimental field of icar central arid zone

on 16 mm lateral at 50 cm spacing between them whereas the spacing between laterals was 50 cm laterals were further connected to 32 mm submain pipe with two way valve thus the area covered by the drip network of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system was 12 m 20 m the drip network of 1 hp ac pumping system was used for irrigation in protected cultivation system under small shade net houses of 4 m 20 m for each the drip network of 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system consisted of drippers make jain irrigation type inline dripper model j turbo key plus color code black of 4 lph capacity which were connected on 16 mm lateral at 1 m spacing between them whereas the spacing between laterals was 2 m thus the area covered by the drip network of 1 hp dc pv pumping system was 16 m 20 m the drip network of 1 hp dc pumping system was used for irrigation in fodder production of hybrid napier bajra grass pennisettum galucum p purpureum the micro irrigation system of mini sprinklers attached with 1 hp ac pumping system consisted of nine mini sprinklers make jain irrigation model 5022 u dual nozzle of 2 4 1 8 mm connected on a 32 mm submain pipe with ms riser rod of about 1 2 m height and at 6 m spacing the nominal operating pressure of the mini sprinkler was 2 5 kg cm 2 whereas the discharge and wetted diameter at this pressure was 510 lph and 19 m respectively the micro irrigation system of micro sprinklers attached with 1 hp dc pv pumping system consisted of 50 micro sprinklers make automat model aquatuff aq 205 nozzle size 1 5 mm connected on 16 mm laterals with a plastic riser rod of 50 cm height and at a spacing of 2 m between them whereas the spacing between laterals was 2 m the nominal operating pressure of the micro sprinkler was 2 kg cm 2 whereas discharge and wetted diameter at this nominal pressure was 122 lph and 9 8 m respectively it is to be noted here that both mini sprinklers and micro sprinklers were installed at spacing lower than their recommended spacing because it was hypothesized that 1 hp solar pv pumping system could not generate the nominal operating pressure of these micro irrigation systems 2 4 characterization of irrigation system output operated by solar pv pump discharge of solar pv pumping system under different pressure heads was measured under different solar irradiation pressure head was controlled by a flush valve attached before the pump outlet rate of application of irrigation water by mini sprinkler and micro sprinkler under different pressure heads was measured for measuring the rate of application of irrigation water empty beaker of 50 ml capacity height 70 mm and diameter 36 mm was kept at multiple locations surrounding the sprinkler source and amount of water collected during a specified time period in the beaker was measured location of beaker in the experimental plots with min sprinkler and micro sprinkler is shown in fig 3 uniformity of irrigation water application by mini sprinkler and micro sprinkler was calculated through distribution uniformity du and christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1941 higher is the value of du or cu more uniform is the application of irrigation water from sprinkler irrigation system du is calculated as the ratio of the irrigation depth measured in the low quarter of the irrigated area to the overall average depth applied beales 1964 1 du averageoflowquarterirrigationdepth overallaverageirrigationdepth 100 where du is expressed in percentage the average of low quarter irrigation depth is determined by sorting the data on irrigation depth collected from multiple locations surrounding sprinkler and calculating the average of the smallest 1 4 of the measured depths the overall average irrigation depth is the arithmetic average of all measured data on irrigation depths christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu is another widely used method of calculating the uniformity of irrigation water application from sprinkler irrigation systems and was calculated as follows christiansen 1942 2 cu 1 average deviation from average irrigation depth overall average irrigation depth 100 where cu is expressed in percentage the average deviation from the average irrigation depth is calculated by averaging the absolute values of the differences between each of the measured irrigation depths and the average depth and the overall average irrigation depth was calculated as mentioned above spatial distribution of rate of application of irrigation water was determined by calculating semivariogram followed by kriging semivariogram γ ˆ h measures the average dissimilarity in property between data locations separated by a vector h webster and oliver 2007 3 γ ˆ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z s i z s i h 2 where n h is the number of pairs of data locations within a given class of lag distance z s i is the value of the variable at the location s i with coordinates of x i y i z s i h is the value of the variable at a lag of h from the location s i experimental semivariograms γ ˆ h as obtained from eq 3 were fitted in standard model using weighted least square technique and three standard spatial variations parameters were calculated nugget c 0 sill c c 0 and range a the commonly used semivariogram models to fit the experimental semivariograms are gaussian spherical exponential and linear model the model with lowest sum of squared error sse was selected as the best fit model during semivariogram fitting weight was assigned as directly proportional to number of pairs and inversely proportional to lag distance all geostatistical analyses were carried out using the gstat package of r pebesma 2004 spatial maps of rate of application of irrigation water were prepared through ordinary kriging using the semivariogram parameters as determined through above mentioned procedure in the kriging process estimates of rate of application of irrigation water at unknown locations z s0 are obtained using weighted linear combinations of measured rate of application of irrigation water at locations z si located within a neighborhood centered around s0 webster and oliver 2007 4 z ˆ s 0 i 1 n s 0 λ i z s i where λ i is the weight assigned to datum z s i located within a given neighborhood centered on s0 weights for n number of neighborhood points were chosen as such so as to minimize the estimation or error variance σ e 2 s 0 v a r z ˆ s 0 z s 0 under the constraint of no bias of the estimator the kriged map was prepared using krige function of gstat package of r pebesma 2004 from the spatial maps of rate of application of irrigation water average rate of application at a specified pressure was calculated through spatial averaging technique 2 5 life cycle cost analysis economics of solar pv pumping system was evaluated through life cycle cost lcc analysis as well as by calculating different economic indicators e g net present value npv internal rate of return irr simple payback period and break even period cash outflow and cash inflow of all components of the system throughout the life cycle of solar pv pumping system was calculated and converted to present worth pw value considering the relative rate of inflation and discount rate as follows 5 pw c 1 i 1 d n where i is the relative rate of inflation and d is the discount rate per year and n is the time period in years in this analysis relative rate of inflation was considered zero whereas discount rate was considered as 10 for a future single cash inflow or cash outflow in n th year pw was calculated using eq 5 for comparison purpose annualized life cycle cost alcc of solar pv pumping system was also calculated using the formula as given below 6 af 1 i 1 d 1 1 i 1 d 1 i 1 d n 1 7 alcc lcc af where af is annuity factor since the life span of pv module the major component of solar pv pumping system is 25 years the life cycle of solar pv pumping system was considered 25 years all other components were suitably replaced within the life cycle of the system as per the life span of respective component 2 6 savings of co2 emission during operationalisation of solar pv pump solar pv pumping system helps to reduce the emission of large amount of carbon dioxide which is otherwise released in atmosphere due to use of grid connected electric pumping system and diesel operated pumping system the carbon footprint of grid connected electricity pump and diesel operated pump can be quantified through the following formula 8 carbon footprint kg co 2 eq kwh 1 ef kg co 2 eq kwh 1 efficiency of pumping system where carbon footprint is defined as the equivalent amount of co2 emission per unit hydraulic energy of pumping and ef is the emission factor of grid connected electricity and diesel energy the ef of grid connected electricity in which coal is the major input is about 0 82 kg co2 eq kwh 1 central electricity authority 2018 based on the net calorific value of diesel ef of diesel fuel is 72 6 g co2 eq mj 1 which is equivalent to 0 26 kg co2 eq kwh 1 otherwise the ef of diesel fuel can also be calculated from its volumetric based emission factor of 10 21 kg co2 eq gallon 1 or 2 697 kg co2 eq l 1 and the energy value of diesel as 10 5 kwh l 1 in case of solar pv pumping system the equivalent co2 emission factor of solar pv based electricity is taken as 6 15 g co2 eq kwh 1 during its operation and maintenance cycle nugent and sovacool 2014 whereas if we consider the total life cycle of solar pv system including its cultivation fabrication construction operation maintenance etc the equivalent co2 emission factor is reported as 49 9 g co2 eq kwh 1 efficiency of the grid connected electric pumping system is taken as 57 after considering the motor efficiency as 85 drive efficiency as 95 and pump efficiency as 70 it is to be noted here that delivery and conveyance efficiency through irrigation pipe network is not considered here inclusion of which may reduce the efficiency further to about 35 40 in case of diesel operated pumping system the efficiency varies from 30 to 35 and here we consider the efficiency as 35 the efficiency of solar pv pumping system is considered as similar to grid connected electric pumping system which is 57 as discussed above 3 results and discussion 3 1 availability of solar irradiation in western rajasthan availability of global horizontal irradiance ghi in india is presented in fig 4 which was prepared from the data available in national solar atlas of india das 2015 annual availability of ghi in india varies from 3 25 kwh m 2 day 1 to 6 06 kwh m 2 day 1 generally western part of india receives higher amount of solar irradiation than eastern part of the country western part of rajasthan state comprising 12 districts receives highest amount of solarirradiation in the country it can be viewed from the data on annual average availability of ghi in india vis à vis western rajasthan which is 5 40 kwh m 2 day 1and 5 75 kwh m 2 day 1 respectively leh and ladakh region of india which is located at top northern part of the country also receives high amount of solar irradiation similar to western rajasthan however the area is limited to a highly undulating hilly tract of the region monthly variation of ghi shows that highest amount of ghi is received during may which is about 6 85 0 71 kwh m 2 day 1 in india and 7 45 0 14 kwh m 2 day 1 in western rajasthan it is also to be noted here that during monsoon months june september higher amount of ghi is received in western rajasthan than in india this is because of higher cloud cover in most parts of india during monsoon periods as compared to western rajasthan which lies in hot arid ecosystem plentiful availability of solar irradiation throughout india specifically in western rajasthan shows that there is huge potential to apply solar pv technologies in agricultural farms e g solar pv pumping system for irrigation purpose apart from the spatial and seasonal variation of ghi in india vis à vis western rajasthan fig 5 represents the variation of solar irradiance in day time at jodhpur which is located at the central part of western rajasthan the average solar irradiance data presented in the fig 5 was measured in 2014 15 using pyranometer in built in automatic weather station from the fig 5 it was observed that solar irradiation was quite high peak radiation was about 800 1000 w m 2 during hot summer days april june whereas it was quite low peak radiation is about 600 700 w m 2 during cold winter days december february moreover the solar window was about 13 h from 6 00 h to 19 00 h during hot summer days whereas it was only about 10 h 7 30 h to 5 30 h during cold winter days therefore hot summer days were more resource full in terms of availability of solar irradiation than the cold winter days however in perspective of the use of solar irradiation for pumping of irrigation water cold winter days are more important than hot summer days because irrigated rabi crops are mostly grown in the region during cold winter days during hot summer days irrigation requirement is limited to perennial orchards only apart from winter and summer days life saving irrigation water is applied to rainfed kharif crops in case of occurrence of long dry spells during july october therefore on an average 150 200 days of pumping is required to sustain agricultural production system in arid region of india 3 2 pressure discharge characteristics of solar pv pump system since the availability of solar irradiation varies in a day and also in different seasons of a year the performance of solar pv pumping system also varies accordingly measured pressure discharge relationship of both 1 hp solar ac and dc pumps with a suction head of 2 3 m revealed a maximum discharge of 120 140 litre per minute lpm at full radiation whereas the delivery pressure head was 1 1 2 kg cm 2 it was also observed that in case of solar ac pump whenever output voltage dropped to a level of 120 130 v during cloud cover conditions the pump stopped automatically to lift water moreover during early morning hours and late afternoon hours ac output from pv modules was not sufficient to start the ac pump however in case of solar dc pump the effect of low irradiation on pump performance was minimum and the dc pump was observed to start even early in the morning during winter months 8 30 am and continues till late evening 5 30 pm however the discharge of the dc pump was low during these periods of low irradiation overall it was observed that dc solar pumps could be operated for longer period in a day than ac solar pump effect of solar irradiation on discharge of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping systems is shown in fig 6 in this figure pump discharge under different solar irradiation on a single day during july under different solar irradiation is presented the suction head during all these measurements were about 2 15 m pump discharge was measured about 60 70 lpm corresponding to a pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 pressure equivalent to 10 m 14 2 psi or 100 kpa when solar irradiation was 700 850 w m 2 at 10 45 am the discharge was reduced to about 10 15 lpm during afternoon when the irradiation was about 470 w m 2 at 4 30 pm when the delivery pressure head was maintained at a low level pump discharge was 200 220 lpm during noon time 1 30 pm and 120 150 lpm during morning and afternoon 10 15 am and 4 30 pm therefore it was noted that pump discharge was highly dependent on the availability of solar irradiation here it is to be noted that during noon time the pump discharge at 0 75 1 kg cm 2 pressure head was slightly lower than the corresponding discharge during morning although availability of solar irradiation during noon was higher than during morning this was due to the heating effect of pv modules during noon which reduces the pv output in terms of both voltage and current pv module generally performs optimally at 25 ºc and hence high temperature during noon negatively affects the pv generation we observed that sprinkling of water on top of pv module during noon improved the performance of pv generation and this is because of cooling of pv module through loss of heat in the process of vaporization of sprinkled water the similar finding on improved performance of pv module through cooling effect of water spray was reported by nižetić et al 2016 and tiwari et al 2020 because the solar irradiance varies with the time in a day the power available for the pump also varies with time and thus needs proper tracking towards sun from tracking experiments it was observed that instead of fixed south facing pv array if the pv modules are tracked thrice a day east facing during morning time up to 11 00 am south facing during noon time 11 00 am to 2 00 pm and west facing after 2 00 pm during afternoon time the amount of irradiation received on top of the pv modules will be maximum and thus the pump s performance will be higher singh and pande 2000 3 3 modeling the relationship of pump discharge with pressure and solar irradiation discharge of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system under different heads and solar irradiation is presented in fig 7 a and b respectively characteristically a decrease in discharge with increase in total head of pumping was observed the trend was best fitted in a linear model with r2 value of 0 55 the slope of the trend model showed a decrease in discharge by 9 18 lpm by an increase in pumping head by 1 m it is to be noted here that total head in the figure represents suction head and delivery head together the trend also showed that in case of zero head of pumping the discharge of the solar pv pumping system will be 184 lpm however to operate a pumping system with zero head is not realistic if we consider a suction head of 2 5 m which is a realistic case for farm ponds the discharge of 1 hp solar pv pumping system will be about 162 lpm without any delivery head however if a delivery head of 1 kg cm 2 10 m head is applied along with a suction head of 2 5 m the discharge of the 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system will be 70 lpm thus the head discharge relationship of solar pv pumping system helps to design pressurized irrigation system with optimum performance again the discharge of solar pv pumping system does not solely depend on total head of pumping but also on the available amount of solar irradiation as depicted in fig 7 b increase in availability of solar irradiation increased the discharge of the pumping system the increasing trend of discharge with an increase in availability of solar irradiation was best fitted in a linear model with an r2 value of 0 17 the slope of the trend model indicated that an increase in solar irradiation by 100 w m 2 increased the discharge of the pumping system by 15 lpm since the pumping head and solar irradiation affected the discharge in two opposite trends the sole effect of solar irradiation on pump s discharge was not clearly visible in fig 7 a and b and even the fitting performance in trend model in fig 7 b was not good r2 0 17 therefore we segregated the data into four categories of total head 5 m 5 10 m 10 12m and 12 m and then re fitted the trends which are plotted in fig 8 after segregating the data increase in fitting performance was observed with r2 value of 0 44 0 32 0 42 and 0 39 respectively for 5 m 5 10 m 10 12m and 12 m head after observing the significant individual relation of total head and solar irradiation with discharge of solar pv pumping system we fitted the multiple linear regression model to predict discharge using the data on total head of pumping and available solar irradiation the fitted linear model is presented below 9 q lpm 68 23 0 16 j w m 2 9 41 h m r 2 0 75 indicates significance level at p 0 01 where q is the discharge of the solar pv pumping system j is the available solar irradiation and h is the total head of pumping the fitting performance of the trend model was quite good r2 0 75 and thus can reliably be used to estimate the discharge of 1 hp solar pv pumping system the fitted model was further cross validated with leave out one approach observed and predicted discharge of the pumping system after cross validation is presented in 1 1 line in fig 9 3 4 temporal variation in performance of solar pv pumping system temporal variation in performance of 1 hp ac pv pumping system is presented in table 1 it has been observed that a threshold irradiation of about 400 w m 2 was required to operate 1 hp ac pv pumping system average amount of solar irradiation 400 w m 2 during a year was highest during may and june 722 w m 2 whereas it was lowest during december 531 w m 2 monthly variation of average duration in a day receiving solar irradiation 400 w m 2 was found to vary from 5 h in december to 8 33 h during may and june monthly variation in discharge of solar pv pump was further calculated using eq 9 which revealed potential discharge of 3541 5859 lph with a pumping head of 10 m and 889 3209 lph with a pumping head of 15 m average irrigation potential of 1 hp ac pumping system in 0 25 ha area during rabi season november to march was found 7 08 12 86 mm day 1 with 10 m pumping head and 1 78 4 54 mm day 1 with 15 m pumping head 3 5 off time utilization of solar pv pumps the solar pv pumping system installed in a field is not always used for irrigation because crops require water at certain critical stages otherwise irrigation water is applied at certain intervals or even there are some lag periods between two cropping seasons during these off periods pv modules of a solar pv pumping system continue to generate electricity but it is not used to operate the pump for irrigation and therefore the generated electricity becomes wasted without utilization hence it is necessary to utilize the generated electricity so that the system may become cost effective in view of the need of creating facility for multipurpose use of solar pv pumping system a changeover switch in ac solar pump system was developed in this system one miniature circuit breaker mcb switch was attached between dc ac converter and ac pump this enabled the pumping system to utilize the additional electricity for farm mechanization and even for meeting household demands fig 10 for example the developed change over switch system was successfully used to operate fan motors of 59 w capacities in the earth tube heat exchange based temperature regulation system of protected agriculture and even to operate different electrically operated farm implements such as ber grader winnower etc this addition has far reaching implications in wider adoption of solar pv pumping system for enhancing both energy and water productivity 3 6 field performances of solar pv pump operated irrigation systems performance of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system revealed a maximum delivery pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 with 9 min sprinklers and 2 3 m suction head radius of throw of the mini sprinkler varied from 5 to 8 m depending upon the pressure head and could irrigate about 0 075 0 1 ha area at a time total discharge of 9 mini sprinklers was about 45 50 lpm additionally a drip network of 1200 drippers was successfully operated by 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system with 1 kg cm 2 pressure head and 2 3 m suction head total discharge of the drip network was about 80 lpm the drip network consisted of 12 laterals 16 mm dia of 20 m length and drippers of 4 lph capacity installed on it at 30 cm apart the drip network covered an area of 0 03 ha 20 m 15 m it is to be noted here that both drippers and min sprinklers could not be operated simultaneously using 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system similarly the 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system could generate a maximum delivery pressure head of 1 2 kg cm 2 to successfully operate 10 micro sprinklers with 2 3 m suction head throw radius of micro sprinklers was about 2 m and total discharge of one sprinkler was about 22 lpm micro sprinkler network could generate a pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 when 20 sprinklers were successfully operated at a time and the discharge under such condition was 14 lpm for a sprinkler overall it was observed that the discharge of 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system was 220 280 lpm with a suction head of 2 3 m and pressure head of 0 7 1 2 kg cm 2 additionally 320 drippers capacity 4 lph on 16 mm laterals were also successfully operated by 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system the distance between drippers on a lateral was 1 m whereas distance between laterals was 2 m length of one lateral was designed as 20 m for best performance of the drip network overall 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system could generate a maximum pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 under micro irrigation network whereas the dc pumping system could generate up to 1 2 kg cm 2 this might be due to oversizing of pv modules 1400 wp for 1 hp system in ac pumping system than dc pumping system 900 wp for 1 hp system continuous measurements of radiation vs pump performance revealed that dc pumping system may be operated for longer period in a day than ac pumping system dust load on pv array and its effect on pump performance was also been monitored and it was observed that regular cleaning of pv module at least at 7 days interval is essential for optimum performance of solar pv pumping system 3 7 spatial distribution of rate of application of irrigation water with mini sprinklers and micro sprinkler operated by solar pv pumping system measured rate of application at different locations under mini sprinkler irrigation system operated by 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system was 0 6 30 mm h 1 0 6 90 mm h 1 and 0 8 00 mm h 1 under the operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 respectively coefficient of variation of rate of application was observed as 61 18 62 05 and 53 59 under the operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 respectively du of the mini sprinkler system consisting of 9 sprinklers covering an area of 25 m 40 m was determined as 25 86 26 11 and 35 34 respectively at the operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 christiansen cu was determined as 49 15 48 16 and 55 14 respectively at the operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 overall it was observed that uniformity indices increased with the operating pressure head of the pumping system similar findings on negative relation between operating pressure head and irrigation uniformity was also reported by el wahed et al 2016 theoretically both du and uc reach to 90 100 in case of uniform distribution of irrigation water in field by the sprinkler irrigation system however there is no standard prescribed threshold of du and uc which is desirable for a good sprinkler irrigation system rather a value of du and uc in between 75 and 95 is often desired as a satisfactorily good sprinkler irrigation system suharto and susanawati 2012 and topak et al 2005 recommended that the sprinkler irrigation system should be operated at an operating pressure head in between 200 and 350 kpa 2 3 5 kg cm 2 to achieve good irrigation uniformity in this study low irrigation uniformity was observed due to the low operating pressure head 2 kg cm 2 or 200 kpa which the 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system could generate with 9 mini sprinklers and 2 3 m suction head from these observations it may be noted that for achieving better irrigation uniformity of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system it needs to be operated at a pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 to obtain this pressure head the number of sprinklers attached with the pumping system may be reduced from 9 to 6 even the spacing between two sprinklers may be reduced from 6 m to 5 m for further improvement in irrigation uniformity apart from achieving the better irrigation uniformity by changing sprinkler designs the knowledge on du and uc of existing design could also help in better irrigation scheduling for example to apply a targeted irrigation depth in field it needs to be divided by the du or uc to calculate the actual irrigation depth to be applied so that even the areas receiving low irrigation receive the targeted irrigation amount spatial variation of rate of application of irrigation water under mini sprinkler irrigation system operated by 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system at different pressure heads is presented in fig 11 the semivariogram parameter range revealed that the rate of application of irrigation water was spatially correlated up to a lag distance of about 13 98 15 74 m which was approximately equal to double of the distance between two sprinklers thus the range parameter of spatial variation of irrigation intensity showed the theoretical diameter of throw of irrigation water by sprinklers the parameter was observed to increase with an increase in operating pressure head nugget and sill parameter which were found 0 and 3 35 4 79 also showed good spatial correlation of irrigation intensity based on the spatial variation parameters as discussed above the kriged map of irrigation intensity under three operating pressure heads was prepared and presented in fig 12 spatial maps showed that the central part of the experimental field was better irrigated than the border areas however the rate of application of irrigation water was higher under operating pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 than 1 5 kg cm 2 and 1 kg cm 2 these maps also showed that the irrigation uniformity was higher under operating pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 than 1 5 kg cm 2 and 1 kg cm 2 predicted rate of application of irrigation water in the spatial maps was 0 6 19 mm h 1 0 01 6 86 mm h 1 and 0 02 7 96 mm h 1 under operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 respectively measured rate of application of irrigation water under micro sprinkler system operated by 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system was 0 5 35 mm h 1 0 25 7 64 mm h 1 and 2 04 9 68 mm h 1 under operating pressure head of 0 7 kg cm 2 1 kg cm 2 and 1 2 kg cm 2 respectively it was observed that rate of application of irrigation water was increased with an increase in operating pressure head spatial variation of rate of application of irrigation water at different distances across and along the laterals as depicted in fig 13 also showed the increase in rate of application of irrigation water with increase in operating pressure head coefficient of variation in rate of application of irrigation water was decreased with increase in operating pressure head and it was 79 48 64 46 and 40 69 under operating pressure head of 0 7 kg cm 2 1 kg cm 2 and 1 2 kg cm 2 respectively decrease in coefficient of variation with increase in operating pressure head indirectly indicates the increase in uniformity of irrigation which was evident from increase in du and cu with increase in operating pressure head du of micro sprinkler system was found 13 22 26 48 and 55 21 respectively at the operating pressure head of 0 7 kg cm 2 1 kg cm 2 and 1 2 kg cm 2 whereas christiansen uc was 40 39 43 99 and 67 96 from these observations it may be inferred that micro sprinkler system needs to be operated by 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system at a pressure head of 1 2 kg cm 2 or higher with 10 micro sprinkler at a time to obtain better irrigation uniformity 3 8 development of module for optimum use of water by solar pv pumps from the pressure discharge behavior of 1 hp solar pv pumping system and the performance of micro irrigation system operated by the pumping system it was observed that the 1 hp pumping systems could be utilized to lift shallow water resources followed by its application in field through pressurized irrigation system with a suction head not more than 2 3 m therefore a module for optimum use of harvested runoff water in farm ponds through 1 hp ac dc solar pv pumping system for irrigation has been prepared and presented in fig 14 the module consisted of two sub modules i runoff generation potential calculation and ii use of harvested runoff water in farm ponds for irrigation purpose through solar pv pumping system the first sub module estimates the runoff generation potential from a specific area through curve number cn method using this method suitable cn value for a specific hydrological situation needs to be identified from the standard table here it is to be noted that cn2 refers to cn value corresponding to average antecedent soil moisture condition to account for different soils ability to infiltrate soils have been divided into four hydrologic soil groups hsgs a b c and d hsg a indicates low runoff potential whereas hsg d indicates high runoff potential average infiltration rate of these hsgs are 7 6 mm h 1 3 8 7 6 mm h 1 1 3 3 8 mm h 1 and 1 3 mm h 1 respectively for category a b c and d for example cn2 value for desert shrub land with poor cover condition 30 coverage is 63 for hsg a under this condition soil moisture retention s will be about 6 mm the initial abstraction i a will be 1 2 mm thus potential runoff from a 20 mm rainfall event will be 14 12 mm therefore runoff volume from 1 ha will be about 141 2 m3 if there is 10 such rainfall events occur in a year annual runoff volume will be 1412 m3 if we consider an overall collection efficiency of 50 a farm pond of 706 m3capacity can be dug out near the outlet of the 1 ha catchment area therefore dimension of the pond may be 15 15 3 m for using the stored runoff water in farm pond it is to be ensured to minimize the evaporation and seepage loss thereafter stored runoff water can be used for irrigation purpose and crops can be chosen as per its water requirement and amount of available water in pond if we consider 20 loss of stored water through evaporation and seepage 564 m3 water can be used for irrigation purpose which can provide 56 mm irrigation in 1 ha area 3 9 life cycle cost of solar pv pumping system results of economic analysis of solar pv pumping system are presented in table 2 both cash outflow and cash inflow for all components of solar pv pumping system were converted to present value cash outflow of the system included capital cost maintenance cost repair cost replacement cost for components and cost for cultivation of crops cash inflow of the system was due to income from crop production and additional electricity generated over pumping annualized life cycle cost of 1 hp dc pv pumping system was rs 20 701 slightly lower than the 1 hp ac pv pumping system rs 21 968 however the net present value of 1 hp ac pv pumping system rs 32 958 was slightly higher than 1 hp dc pv pumping system rs 27 298 internal rate of return and break even period of 1 hp solar pv pumping system was found 15 16 and 10 39 11 64 years and thus provides a economically feasible solution to small and marginal farmers in the present analysis cultivation of vigna radiata during kharif with lifesaving irrigation of 40 mm and cultivation of plantago ovata during rabi season with 180 mm irrigation was considered inclusion of pre kharif summer crops might have further improved the economics of solar pv pumping system however availability of surface water resources which could be pumped by 1 hp solar pv pumping system for irrigation purpose is a challenging task in arid zone and therefore it was avoided in semi arid and sub humid part there is opportunity to harvest sufficient amount of rain water in surface water harvesting structure to support irrigation during both rabi and pre kharif season and thus may improve the economics of 1 hp pv pumping system the solar pv pumping system was also reported to be cheaper than grid connected electric pumps and diesel operated irrigation pumps santra et al 2016 therefore solar pv pumping systems are economically more feasible than corresponding grid connected pumps and diesel operated pumps although initial investment for capital cost is quite high for the solar pv pumping system 3 10 carbon footprint of solar pv pumping system apart from economic superiority of solar pv pumps than corresponding grid connected electric pump and diesel pump the environmental impact of all these three type of pumping system was also evaluated the carbon footprint for different types of irrigation pumping system is given in table 3 it is observed that carbon footprint of solar pv pumping system is almost negligible as compared to grid connected electric pumping system and diesel operated pumping system it is also to be noted here that grid connected electric pumping system has the highest carbon footprint and is almost the double of the carbon footprint from diesel operated pumping systems this is mainly because of use of coal as the major input in thermal power based grid networks of the country and the carbon emission factor of coal is comparatively higher than diesel fuel for irrigation pumping system the amount of irrigation water 1 ha mm to be applied in agricultural field can be converted to equivalent hydraulic energy after multiplying the weight of irrigation water mg and total head of the pumping system h followed by dividing it with the efficiency of pumping system ζ in case of 1 hp pv pumping system total head may be considered about 20 m and efficiency of irrigation system is about 46 and 28 for electric pump and diesel pump respectively using the above relationship the equivalent amount of hydraulic energy for 1 ha mm irrigation for a total head of 20 m is 1 185 kwh and 1 946 kwh for electric pump and diesel pump respectively thus the carbon footprint per ha mm irrigation is 1 214 kg co2 eq for grid connected electricity pump whereas for diesel operated pumping system it is about 0 382 kg co2 eq 4 conclusion solar pv pumping system of both ac and dc type and of 1 hp capacity was experimentally evaluated in hot arid region of india following conclusions are drawn from the present study i solar irradiation is available in plenty in india with an annual average of 5 40 kwh m 2 day 1 whereas western rajasthan lying in hot arid region of the country receives more than the national average 5 75 kwh m 2 day 1 therefore solar pv pumping based irrigation even with the small capacity e g 1 hp is a feasible solution for meeting the irrigation demand in fragmented land holdings of the country however the small sized solar pv pumping systems can only be utilized to lift and irrigate shallow water resources 2 3 m suction head ii performance of 1 hp solar pv pumping systems revealed that the dc pumping system could be operated for a longer duration in a day than ac pumping system however higher operating pressure head could be achieved with ac pumping system than dc pumping system iii head discharge relationship of 1 hp solar pv pumping system showed a decreasing trend in discharge with increase in pumping head whereas the pump discharge showed a positive trend with solar irradiation based on these relationships a multiple linear regression model to predict discharge of 1 hp solar pv pumping system was developed with good accuracy r2 0 75 iv change over switching facility in solar pv pumping system developed in the study could further increase the utility of the pumping system to farmer additional electricity generated by the pumping system could be used for on farm mechanization meeting domestic electricity needs and even can be sold out to grids for fetching additional income v performance of mini sprinklers showed that 9 mini sprinklers at a spacing of 6 m could successfully be operated by 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system with a pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 and suction head of 2 3 m christiansen uniformity coefficient of 0 55 could be achieved with the above said sprinkler design however to further improve the irrigation uniformity of mini sprinklers operated by the 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system the number of mini sprinkler can be reduced from 9 to 6 and the spacing between sprinklers can be reduced from 6 m to 5 m vi economic comparison of 1 hp ac and 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system showed that the dc pumping system was slightly cheaper than ac pumping system the annualized life cycle cost of 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system was about rs 20 701 whereas it was rs 21 968 for 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system vii carbon footprint of solar pv pumping system was found significantly lower as compared to grid connected electric pump and diesel operated pump the carbon footprint of 1 hp solar pv pumping system was 0 009 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 whereas it was 1 124 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 for grid connected electric pumps and 0 381 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 for diesel operated pumping system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment author of the manuscript sincerely expresses his thanks to the director icar central arid zone research institute jodhpur for providing logistic support to conduct the experiment under the project optimization of energy and water use in solar pv pump based micro irrigation system for different scales of operation cazri t 08 32 conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest for submission of the manuscript titled performance evaluation of solar pv pumping system for providing irrigation through micro irrigation techniques using surface water resources in hot arid region of india 
10263,solar pv pumping system for irrigation purpose has been gained importance in recent times considering its environmental friendly characteristics and to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel based energy sources for pumping in general 3 hp and 5 hp capacity solar pv pumping systems are used for irrigation purpose in india however large capacity pumps are often also used to lift groundwater resources which may lead to further depletion of ground water table keeping in mind these constraints performance of small sized solar pv pumps of 1 hp capacity was evaluated to lift and irrigate shallow water resources using pressurized irrigation systems experimental observations revealed that 1 hp solar pv pumping system either ac or dc type could successfully be used to operate mini sprinklers micro sprinklers and drippers with good irrigation uniformity further a self sustainable module for sustainable use of water and energy was designed in which both water and energy are harvested and recycled life cycle cost analysis showed that 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system was slightly cheaper than corresponding ac pumping system even the carbon footprint of 1 hp solar pv pumping systems is quite lower 0 009 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 than grid connected electric pumps 1 214 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 and diesel operated pumps 0 382 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 therefore 1 hp solar pv pumping systems could be a feasible solution for small and marginal farmers in the context of water scarcity situation in near future and to mitigate the climate change effects in agricultural farms keywords solar pv pump pressurized irrigation head discharge relationship life cycle cost greenhouse gas emission irrigation uniformity 1 introduction water is the primary source of life for mankind and is the most basic necessity for food production system fao 2017 demand for water to irrigate crops has been increasing at a very fast rate to produce sufficient amount of food for large number of population throughout the world for sustainable production of food from agricultural farms irrigating crops at right stages and efficient utilization of available water resources are highly important saiz rubio and rovira mas 2020 oweis 1997 pressurized irrigation systems helps in application of irrigation water preciously in the agricultural field however energy is required for this purpose fossil fuel based irrigation pumps generally grid connected electric pumps and diesel pumps meet the required energy demand for irrigation purpose fossil fuel based energy sources have adverse effect on climate and it is depleting at a very fast rate therefore alternative solutions to meet the energy demand in agriculture need to be looked for renewable energy options including solar wind biomass etc may provide environment friendly solutions to meet the energy demand for irrigation purpose naas 2018 groundwater resources are mostly used for irrigation purpose however it has been depleting at a very fast rate to meet the civilization targets and therefore needs due attention to optimally use this precious resource harvesting of runoff water in surface storage structures followed by pumping it for irrigation purpose may be a potential solution to achieve the set goal of crop per drop mission abraham and mathew 2018 solar photovoltaic pv pumps are quite useful under such circumstances hossain et al 2015 shinde and wandre 2015 sontake and kalamkar 2016 wazed et al 2017 bassi 2018 typically a solar pv pumping system consists of pv modules mounting structure pump unit ac dc and tracking system sizing of pv module in solar pv pumping system depends on solar irradiation and pumping head odeh et al 2006 if the suction head is about 4 5 m which is the maximum possible in a surface water storage structures 1 hp capacity pump is sufficient however to lift deep ground water size of pv modules needs to be increased accordingly benghanem et al 2014 further if the designed irrigation network requires high operating pressure head the pump capacity and the size of pv modules needs to be increased odeh et al 2006 campana et al 2013 therefore sizing of the pv pumping system is very crucial for applying right amount of water in agricultural field glasnovic and margeta 2007 hamidat and benyoucef 2009 khatib 2010 abu aligah 2011 rawat et al 2016 further solar pv pumping system can be used efficiently if its performance characteristics are known under different pumping head and solar insolation several literatures have reported the head discharge characteristics of solar pv pumping system under different solar irradiation however mostly these are either for large sized solar pump or the experiments were conducted outside india odeh et al 2006 joshi et al 2009 benghanem et al 2014 muhsen et al 2017 ba et al 2018 tiwari and kalamkar 2018 performance of small scale irrigation system using solar pv pumps have also been reported in few literatures singh and pande 2000 pande et al 2003 hamidat et al 2003 kumar et al 2015 irrigation uniformity under pressurized irrigation system is another indicator to judge the performance of irrigation pumping system and knowledge on it under solar pv pumping system is limited in literature zaman et al 2018 since solar irradiation influence the pump s discharge the irrigation uniformity is also expected to vary at different times in a day therefore the influence of solar irradiation on pump s discharge and the irrigation uniformity needs to be determined for better irrigation scheduling economics of solar pv pumping system is another important requirement to successfully adopt the system by farmers in field although the economic superiority of solar pv pumping systems over grid connected electric pumps and diesel pumps have been reported in literatures santra et al 2016 jones et al 2016 however due attention needs to be given to develop self sustainable model so that the system may fetch additional income to farmers knowledge on life cycle cost of solar pv pumping system helps to develop such models and also to guide the stakeholders for capital investment solar pv pumping system also helps in mitigating the greenhouse gas ghg emission potential effect of solar pv systems on reduction in ghg emission have been reported in several literatures chaurey and kandpal 2009 amponsah et al 2014 breyer et al 2015 however the impact of solar pv pumping system on reduction in ghg emission while it replaces grid connected electric pump and diesel operated pump are limited kumar and kandpal 2007 purohit andmichaelowa 2008 moreover solar pv generation is often considered as clean energy production and hence the ghg emission from pv system is taken as zero when ghg mitigation potential of whole system is calculated however solar pv system also contributes to ghg emission although it is very low during its total life cycle which includes cultivation fabrication construction operation maintenance etc nugent and sovacool 2014 therefore consideration of emission factor of solar pv module is also to be considered while the mitigation potential of solar pv pumping system is calculated thus it has been observed that solar pv pumping system has several advantages over conventional irrigation pumping system focusing to tackle the climate change effects and water scarcity situations solar pv pumping systems have been widely used for irrigation purpose at different parts of the world national governments of several countries support policies and programs for intensive adoption of solar pumps in agricultural field karekezi and kithyoma 2002 al samarrai et al 2017 sklarew and sklarew 2018 da silva et al 2020 likewise national government of india also promotes the use of solar pv pumps for irrigation purpose in agriculture by implementing several programs and schemes e g national mission on sustainable agriculture nmsa pradhan mantri krishi sinchai yojana pmksy national solar mission nsm kisan urja suraksha evam utthaan mahabhiyan kusum or farmer s energy security and upliftment program etc niti ayog 2018 rathore et al 2018 shah et al 2018 shah 2018 purohit and purohit 2018 in order to fulfill the targeted objectives of these long term national programs prerequisite information on performance of solar pv pumping system under varying conditions of pumping head and solar irradiation is very essential keeping in mind the importance of solar pv pumping system in the current scenario and the considering the large number 86 2 of total number of farmers of small and marginal farmers in india having land holdings less than 2 ha it is highly important to establish energy and water sustainable farming unit therefore the present manuscript focused on performance evaluation of 1 hp solar pv pumping system to operate different micro irrigation system which is otherwise operated by large sized pv pumping system e g 3 5 hp pumps the major concern of using large sized pv pumps in arid zone is possible over exploitation of ground water resources due to free availability of energy in the agricultural field once the pv pump is established therefore harvesting of water in farm ponds and use of the stored water for irrigation through small sized pv pump may be an optimistic solution for sustainable water and energy management in agricultural production from arid zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 operationalisation of 1 hp solar pv pumping system two solar photovoltaic pv pumping systems were installed at experimental field of icar central arid zone

m3 flow whereas flow measurement capacity of the meter was from 0 6 m3 h 1 to 30 m3 h 1 solar irradiation in terms of global horizontal irradiance ghi was measured by pyranometer sensor of automatic weather station make delta t with gp1 data logger at 5 min interval the pyranometer was a silicon photo diode sensor type d pyrpa ca and measured the solar irradiation in 300 1100 nm with an accuracy

system were controlled using a bypass flush valve head discharge measurements of the pumping system was recorded during different solar irradiation conditions e g clear sunny days cloudy days with intermittent radiation different times during clear sunny day different months etc the period of each measurement was about 30 min during each measurement period discharge of the pump in one minute was recorded at a particular pressure heads controlled by flush valve and after the discharge became steady on that particular pressure head solar irradiation during each measurement period was extracted from weather database recorded in gp1 data logger and was used for further analysis 2 3 setting up of micro irrigation system under solar pv pump micro irrigation system of drippers and mini sprinklers were established with the 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system whereas micro irrigation system of drippers and micro sprinklers were established with 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system fig 2 the drip network attached with 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system consisted of drippers make jain irrigation type online dripper model j turbo key plus color code black of 4 lph capacity which were installed on 16 mm lateral at 50 cm spacing between them whereas the spacing between laterals was 50 cm laterals were further connected to 32 mm submain pipe with two way valve thus the area covered by the drip network of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system was 12 m 20 m the drip network of 1 hp ac pumping system was used for irrigation in protected cultivation system under small shade net houses of 4 m 20 m for each the drip network of 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system consisted of drippers make jain irrigation type inline dripper model j turbo key plus color code black of 4 lph capacity which were connected on 16 mm lateral at 1 m spacing between them whereas the spacing between laterals was 2 m thus the area covered by the drip network of 1 hp dc pv pumping system was 16 m 20 m the drip network of 1 hp dc pumping system was used for irrigation in fodder production of hybrid napier bajra grass pennisettum galucum p purpureum the micro irrigation system of mini sprinklers attached with 1 hp ac pumping system consisted of nine mini sprinklers make jain irrigation model 5022 u dual nozzle of 2 4 1 8 mm connected on a 32 mm submain pipe with ms riser rod of about 1 2 m height and at 6 m spacing the nominal operating pressure of the mini sprinkler was 2 5 kg cm 2 whereas the discharge and wetted diameter at this pressure was 510 lph and 19 m respectively the micro irrigation system of micro sprinklers attached with 1 hp dc pv pumping system consisted of 50 micro sprinklers make automat model aquatuff aq 205 nozzle size 1 5 mm connected on 16 mm laterals with a plastic riser rod of 50 cm height and at a spacing of 2 m between them whereas the spacing between laterals was 2 m the nominal operating pressure of the micro sprinkler was 2 kg cm 2 whereas discharge and wetted diameter at this nominal pressure was 122 lph and 9 8 m respectively it is to be noted here that both mini sprinklers and micro sprinklers were installed at spacing lower than their recommended spacing because it was hypothesized that 1 hp solar pv pumping system could not generate the nominal operating pressure of these micro irrigation systems 2 4 characterization of irrigation system output operated by solar pv pump discharge of solar pv pumping system under different pressure heads was measured under different solar irradiation pressure head was controlled by a flush valve attached before the pump outlet rate of application of irrigation water by mini sprinkler and micro sprinkler under different pressure heads was measured for measuring the rate of application of irrigation water empty beaker of 50 ml capacity height 70 mm and diameter 36 mm was kept at multiple locations surrounding the sprinkler source and amount of water collected during a specified time period in the beaker was measured location of beaker in the experimental plots with min sprinkler and micro sprinkler is shown in fig 3 uniformity of irrigation water application by mini sprinkler and micro sprinkler was calculated through distribution uniformity du and christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1941 higher is the value of du or cu more uniform is the application of irrigation water from sprinkler irrigation system du is calculated as the ratio of the irrigation depth measured in the low quarter of the irrigated area to the overall average depth applied beales 1964 1 du averageoflowquarterirrigationdepth overallaverageirrigationdepth 100 where du is expressed in percentage the average of low quarter irrigation depth is determined by sorting the data on irrigation depth collected from multiple locations surrounding sprinkler and calculating the average of the smallest 1 4 of the measured depths the overall average irrigation depth is the arithmetic average of all measured data on irrigation depths christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu is another widely used method of calculating the uniformity of irrigation water application from sprinkler irrigation systems and was calculated as follows christiansen 1942 2 cu 1 average deviation from average irrigation depth overall average irrigation depth 100 where cu is expressed in percentage the average deviation from the average irrigation depth is calculated by averaging the absolute values of the differences between each of the measured irrigation depths and the average depth and the overall average irrigation depth was calculated as mentioned above spatial distribution of rate of application of irrigation water was determined by calculating semivariogram followed by kriging semivariogram γ ˆ h measures the average dissimilarity in property between data locations separated by a vector h webster and oliver 2007 3 γ ˆ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z s i z s i h 2 where n h is the number of pairs of data locations within a given class of lag distance z s i is the value of the variable at the location s i with coordinates of x i y i z s i h is the value of the variable at a lag of h from the location s i experimental semivariograms γ ˆ h as obtained from eq 3 were fitted in standard model using weighted least square technique and three standard spatial variations parameters were calculated nugget c 0 sill c c 0 and range a the commonly used semivariogram models to fit the experimental semivariograms are gaussian spherical exponential and linear model the model with lowest sum of squared error sse was selected as the best fit model during semivariogram fitting weight was assigned as directly proportional to number of pairs and inversely proportional to lag distance all geostatistical analyses were carried out using the gstat package of r pebesma 2004 spatial maps of rate of application of irrigation water were prepared through ordinary kriging using the semivariogram parameters as determined through above mentioned procedure in the kriging process estimates of rate of application of irrigation water at unknown locations z s0 are obtained using weighted linear combinations of measured rate of application of irrigation water at locations z si located within a neighborhood centered around s0 webster and oliver 2007 4 z ˆ s 0 i 1 n s 0 λ i z s

error variance σ e 2 s 0 v a r z ˆ s 0 z s 0 under the constraint of no bias of the estimator the kriged map was prepared using krige function of gstat package of r pebesma 2004 from the spatial maps of rate of application of irrigation water average rate of application at a specified pressure was calculated through spatial averaging technique 2 5 life cycle cost analysis economics of solar pv pumping system was evaluated through life cycle cost lcc analysis as well as by calculating different economic indicators e g net present value npv internal rate of return irr simple payback period and break even period cash outflow and cash inflow of all components of the system throughout the life cycle of solar pv pumping system was calculated and converted to present worth pw value considering the relative rate of inflation and discount rate as follows 5 pw c 1 i 1 d n where i is the relative rate of inflation and d is the discount rate per year and n is the time period in years in this analysis relative rate of inflation was considered zero whereas discount rate was considered as 10 for a future single cash inflow or cash outflow in n th year pw was calculated using eq 5 for comparison purpose annualized life cycle cost alcc of solar pv pumping system was also calculated using the formula as given below 6 af 1 i 1 d 1 1 i 1 d 1 i 1 d n 1 7 alcc lcc af where af is annuity factor since the life span of pv module the major component of solar pv pumping system is 25 years the life cycle of solar pv pumping system was considered 25 years all other components were suitably replaced within the life cycle of the system as per the life span of respective component 2 6 savings of co2 emission during operationalisation of solar pv pump solar pv pumping system helps to reduce the emission of large amount of carbon dioxide which is otherwise released in atmosphere due to use of grid connected electric pumping system and diesel operated pumping system the carbon footprint of grid connected electricity pump and diesel operated pump can be quantified through the following formula 8 carbon footprint kg co 2 eq kwh 1 ef kg co 2 eq kwh 1 efficiency of pumping system where carbon footprint is defined as the equivalent amount of co2 emission per unit hydraulic energy of pumping and ef is the emission factor of grid connected electricity and diesel energy the ef of grid connected electricity in which coal is the major input is about 0 82 kg co2 eq kwh 1 central electricity authority 2018 based on the net calorific value of diesel ef of diesel fuel is 72 6 g co2 eq mj 1 which is equivalent to 0 26 kg co2 eq kwh 1 otherwise the ef of diesel fuel can also be calculated from its volumetric based emission factor of 10 21 kg co2 eq gallon 1 or 2 697 kg co2 eq l 1 and the energy value of diesel as 10 5 kwh l 1 in case of solar pv pumping system the equivalent co2 emission factor of solar pv based electricity is taken as 6 15 g co2 eq kwh 1 during its operation and maintenance cycle nugent and sovacool 2014 whereas if we consider the total life cycle of solar pv system including its cultivation fabrication construction operation maintenance etc the equivalent co2 emission factor is reported as 49 9 g co2 eq kwh 1 efficiency of the grid connected electric pumping system is taken as 57 after considering the motor efficiency as 85 drive efficiency as 95 and pump efficiency as 70 it is to be noted here that delivery and conveyance efficiency through irrigation pipe network is not considered here inclusion of which may reduce the efficiency further to about 35 40 in case of diesel operated pumping system the efficiency varies from 30 to 35 and here we consider the efficiency as 35 the efficiency of solar pv pumping system is considered as similar to grid connected electric pumping system which is 57 as discussed above 3 results and discussion 3 1 availability of solar irradiation in western rajasthan availability of global horizontal irradiance ghi in india is presented in fig 4 which was prepared from the data available in national solar atlas of india das 2015 annual availability of ghi in india varies from 3 25 kwh m 2 day 1 to 6 06 kwh m 2 day 1 generally western part of india receives higher amount of solar irradiation than eastern part of the country western part of rajasthan state comprising 12 districts receives highest amount of solarirradiation in the country it can be viewed from the data on annual average availability of ghi in india vis à vis western rajasthan which is 5 40 kwh m 2 day 1and 5 75 kwh m 2 day 1 respectively leh and ladakh region of india which is located at top northern part of the country also receives high amount of solar irradiation similar to western rajasthan however the area is limited to a highly undulating hilly tract of the region monthly variation of ghi shows that highest amount of ghi is received during may which is about 6 85 0 71 kwh m 2 day 1 in india and 7 45 0 14 kwh m 2 day 1 in western rajasthan it is also to be noted here that during monsoon months june september higher amount of ghi is received in western rajasthan than in india this is because of higher cloud cover in most parts of india during monsoon periods as compared to western rajasthan which lies in hot arid ecosystem plentiful availability of solar irradiation throughout india specifically in western rajasthan shows that there is huge potential to apply solar pv technologies in agricultural farms e g solar pv pumping system for irrigation purpose apart from the spatial and seasonal variation of ghi in india vis à vis western rajasthan fig 5 represents the variation of solar irradiance in day time at jodhpur which is located at the central part of western rajasthan the average solar irradiance data presented in the fig 5 was measured in 2014 15 using pyranometer in built in automatic weather station from the fig 5 it was observed that solar irradiation was quite high peak radiation was about 800 1000 w m 2 during hot summer days april june whereas it was quite low peak radiation is about 600 700 w m 2 during cold winter days december february moreover the solar window was about 13 h from 6 00 h to 19 00 h during hot summer days whereas it was only about 10 h 7 30 h to 5 30 h during cold winter days therefore hot summer days were more resource full in terms of availability of solar irradiation than the cold winter days however in perspective of the use of solar irradiation for pumping of irrigation water cold winter days are more important than hot summer days because irrigated rabi crops are mostly grown in the region during cold winter days during hot summer days irrigation requirement is limited to perennial orchards only apart from winter and summer days life saving irrigation water is applied to rainfed kharif crops in case of occurrence of long dry spells during july october therefore on an average 150 200 days of pumping is required to sustain agricultural production system in arid region of india 3 2 pressure discharge characteristics of solar pv pump system since the availability of solar irradiation varies in a day and also in different seasons of a year the performance of solar pv pumping system also varies accordingly measured pressure discharge relationship of both 1 hp solar ac and dc pumps with a suction head of 2 3 m revealed a maximum discharge of 120 140 litre per minute lpm at full radiation whereas the delivery pressure head was 1 1 2 kg cm 2 it was also observed that in case of solar ac pump whenever output voltage dropped to a level of 120 130 v during cloud cover conditions the pump stopped automatically to lift water moreover during early morning hours and late afternoon hours ac output from pv modules was not sufficient to start the ac pump however in case of solar dc pump the effect of low irradiation on pump performance was minimum and the dc pump was observed to start even early in the morning during winter months 8 30 am and continues till late evening 5 30 pm however the discharge of the dc pump was low during these periods of low irradiation overall it was observed that dc solar pumps could be operated for longer period in a day than ac solar pump effect of solar irradiation on discharge of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping systems is shown in fig 6 in this figure pump discharge under different solar irradiation on a single day during july under different solar irradiation is presented the suction head during all these measurements were about 2 15 m pump discharge was measured about 60 70 lpm corresponding to a pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 pressure equivalent to 10 m 14 2 psi or 100 kpa when solar irradiation was 700 850 w m 2 at 10 45 am the discharge was reduced to about 10 15 lpm during afternoon when the irradiation was about 470 w m 2 at 4 30 pm when the delivery pressure head was maintained at a low level pump discharge was 200 220 lpm during noon time 1 30 pm and 120 150 lpm during morning and afternoon 10 15 am and 4 30 pm therefore it was noted that pump discharge was highly dependent on the availability of solar irradiation here it is to be noted that during noon time the pump discharge at 0 75 1 kg cm 2 pressure head was slightly lower than the corresponding discharge during morning although availability of solar irradiation during noon was higher than during morning this was due to the heating effect of pv modules during noon which reduces the pv output in terms of both voltage and current pv module generally performs optimally at 25 ºc and hence high temperature during noon negatively affects the pv generation we observed that sprinkling of water on top of pv module during noon improved the performance of pv generation and this is because of cooling of pv module through loss of heat in the process of vaporization of sprinkled water the similar finding on improved performance of pv module through cooling effect of water spray was reported by nižetić et al 2016 and tiwari et al 2020 because the solar irradiance varies with the time in a day the power available for the pump also varies with time and thus needs proper tracking towards sun from tracking experiments it was observed that instead of fixed south facing pv array if the pv modules are tracked thrice a day east facing during morning time up to 11 00 am south facing during noon time 11 00 am to 2 00 pm and west facing after 2 00 pm during afternoon time the amount of irradiation received on top of the pv modules will be maximum and thus the pump s performance will be higher singh and pande 2000 3 3 modeling the relationship of pump discharge with pressure and solar irradiation discharge of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system under different heads and solar irradiation is presented in fig 7 a and b respectively characteristically a decrease in discharge with increase in total head of pumping was observed the trend was best fitted in a linear model with r2 value of 0 55 the slope of the trend model showed a decrease in discharge by 9 18 lpm by an increase in pumping head by 1 m it is to be noted here that total head in the figure represents suction head and delivery head together the trend also showed that in case of zero head of pumping the discharge of the solar pv pumping system will be 184 lpm however to operate a pumping system with zero head is not realistic if we consider a suction head of 2 5 m which is a realistic case for farm ponds the discharge of 1 hp solar pv pumping system will be about 162 lpm without any delivery head however if a delivery head of 1 kg cm 2 10 m head is applied along with a suction head of 2 5 m the discharge of the 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system will be 70 lpm thus the head discharge relationship of solar pv pumping system helps to design pressurized irrigation system with optimum performance again the discharge of solar pv pumping system does not solely depend on total head of pumping but also on the available amount of solar irradiation as depicted in fig 7 b increase in availability of solar irradiation increased the discharge of the pumping system the increasing trend of discharge with an increase in availability of solar irradiation was best fitted in a linear model with an r2 value of 0 17 the slope of the trend model indicated that an increase in solar irradiation by 100 w m 2 increased the discharge of the pumping system by 15 lpm since the pumping head and solar irradiation affected the discharge in two opposite trends the sole effect of solar irradiation on pump s discharge was not clearly visible in fig 7 a and b and even the fitting performance in trend model in fig 7 b was not good r2 0 17 therefore we segregated the data into four categories of total head 5 m 5 10 m 10 12m and 12 m and then re fitted the trends which are plotted in fig 8 after segregating the data increase in fitting performance was observed with r2 value of 0 44 0 32 0 42 and 0 39 respectively for 5 m 5 10 m 10 12m and 12 m head after observing the significant individual relation of total head and solar irradiation with discharge of solar pv pumping system we fitted the multiple linear regression model to predict discharge using the data on total head of pumping and available solar irradiation the fitted linear model is presented below 9 q lpm 68 23 0 16 j w m 2 9 41 h m r 2 0 75 indicates significance level at p 0 01 where q is the discharge of the solar pv pumping system j is the available solar irradiation and h is the total head of pumping the fitting performance of the trend model was quite good r2 0 75 and thus can reliably be used to estimate the discharge of 1 hp solar pv pumping system the fitted model was further cross validated with leave out one approach observed and predicted discharge of the pumping system after cross validation is presented in 1 1 line in fig 9 3 4 temporal variation in performance of solar pv pumping system temporal variation in performance of 1 hp ac pv pumping system is presented in table 1 it has been observed that a threshold irradiation of about 400 w m 2 was required to operate 1 hp ac pv pumping system average amount of solar irradiation 400 w m 2 during a year was highest during may and june 722 w m 2 whereas it was lowest during december 531 w m 2 monthly variation of average duration in a day receiving solar irradiation 400 w m 2 was found to vary from 5 h in december to 8 33 h during may and june monthly variation in discharge of solar pv pump was further calculated using eq 9 which revealed potential discharge of 3541 5859 lph with a pumping head of 10 m and 889 3209 lph with a pumping head of 15 m average irrigation potential of 1 hp ac pumping system in 0 25 ha area during rabi season november to march was found 7 08 12 86 mm day 1 with 10 m pumping head and 1 78 4 54 mm day 1 with 15 m pumping head 3 5 off time utilization of solar pv pumps the solar pv pumping system installed in a field is not always used for irrigation because crops require water at certain critical stages otherwise irrigation water is applied at certain intervals or even there are some lag periods between two cropping seasons during these off periods pv modules of a solar pv pumping system continue to generate electricity but it is not used to operate the pump for irrigation and therefore the generated electricity becomes wasted without utilization hence it is necessary to utilize the generated electricity so that the system may become cost effective in view of the need of creating facility for multipurpose use of solar pv pumping system a changeover switch in ac solar pump system was developed in this system one miniature circuit breaker mcb switch was attached between dc ac converter and ac pump this enabled the pumping system to utilize the additional electricity for farm mechanization and even for meeting household demands fig 10 for example the developed change over switch system was successfully used to operate fan motors of 59 w capacities in the earth tube heat exchange based temperature regulation system of protected agriculture and even to operate different electrically operated farm implements such as ber grader winnower etc this addition has far reaching implications in wider adoption of solar pv pumping system for enhancing both energy and water productivity 3 6 field performances of solar pv pump operated irrigation systems performance of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system revealed a maximum delivery pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 with 9 min sprinklers and 2 3 m suction head radius of throw of the mini sprinkler varied from 5 to 8 m depending upon the pressure head and could irrigate about 0 075 0 1 ha area at a time total discharge of 9 mini sprinklers was about 45 50 lpm additionally a drip network of 1200 drippers was successfully operated by 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system with 1 kg cm 2 pressure head and 2 3 m suction head total discharge of the drip network was about 80 lpm the drip network consisted of 12 laterals 16 mm dia of 20 m length and drippers of 4 lph capacity installed on it at 30 cm apart the drip network covered an area of 0 03 ha 20 m 15 m it is to be noted here that both drippers and min sprinklers could not be operated simultaneously using 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system similarly the 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system could generate a maximum delivery pressure head of 1 2 kg cm 2 to successfully operate 10 micro sprinklers with 2 3 m suction head throw radius of micro sprinklers was about 2 m and total discharge of one sprinkler was about 22 lpm micro sprinkler network could generate a pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 when 20 sprinklers were successfully operated at a time and the discharge under such condition was 14 lpm for a sprinkler overall it was observed that the discharge of 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system was 220 280 lpm with a suction head of 2 3 m and pressure head of 0 7 1 2 kg cm 2 additionally 320 drippers capacity 4 lph on 16 mm laterals were also successfully operated by 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system the distance between drippers on a lateral was 1 m whereas distance between laterals was 2 m length of one lateral was designed as 20 m for best performance of the drip network overall 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system could generate a maximum pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 under micro irrigation network whereas the dc pumping system could generate up to 1 2 kg cm 2 this might be due to oversizing of pv modules 1400 wp for 1 hp system in ac pumping system than dc pumping system 900 wp for 1 hp system continuous measurements of radiation vs pump performance revealed that dc pumping system may be operated for longer period in a day than ac pumping system dust load on pv array and its effect on pump performance was also been monitored and it was observed that regular cleaning of pv module at least at 7 days interval is essential for optimum performance of solar pv pumping system 3 7 spatial distribution of rate of application of irrigation water with mini sprinklers and micro sprinkler operated by solar pv pumping system measured rate of application at different locations under mini sprinkler irrigation system operated by 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system was 0 6 30 mm h 1 0 6 90 mm h 1 and 0 8 00 mm h 1 under the operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 respectively coefficient of variation of rate of application was observed as 61 18 62 05 and 53 59 under the operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 respectively du of the mini sprinkler system consisting of 9 sprinklers covering an area of 25 m 40 m was determined as 25 86 26 11 and 35 34 respectively at the operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 christiansen cu was determined as 49 15 48 16 and 55 14 respectively at the operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 overall it was observed that uniformity indices increased with the operating pressure head of the pumping system similar findings on negative relation between operating pressure head and irrigation uniformity was also reported by el wahed et al 2016 theoretically both du and uc reach to 90 100 in case of uniform distribution of irrigation water in field by the sprinkler irrigation system however there is no standard prescribed threshold of du and uc which is desirable for a good sprinkler irrigation system rather a value of du and uc in between 75 and 95 is often desired as a satisfactorily good sprinkler irrigation system suharto and susanawati 2012 and topak et al 2005 recommended that the sprinkler irrigation system should be operated at an operating pressure head in between 200 and 350 kpa 2 3 5 kg cm 2 to achieve good irrigation uniformity in this study low irrigation uniformity was observed due to the low operating pressure head 2 kg cm 2 or 200 kpa which the 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system could generate with 9 mini sprinklers and 2 3 m suction head from these observations it may be noted that for achieving better irrigation uniformity of 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system it needs to be operated at a pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 to obtain this pressure head the number of sprinklers attached with the pumping system may be reduced from 9 to 6 even the spacing between two sprinklers may be reduced from 6 m to 5 m for further improvement in irrigation uniformity apart from achieving the better irrigation uniformity by changing sprinkler designs the knowledge on du and uc of existing design could also help in better irrigation scheduling for example to apply a targeted irrigation depth in field it needs to be divided by the du or uc to calculate the actual irrigation depth to be applied so that even the areas receiving low irrigation receive the targeted irrigation amount spatial variation of rate of application of irrigation water under mini sprinkler irrigation system operated by 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system at different pressure heads is presented in fig 11 the semivariogram parameter range revealed that the rate of application of irrigation water was spatially correlated up to a lag distance of about 13 98 15 74 m which was approximately equal to double of the distance between two sprinklers thus the range parameter of spatial variation of irrigation intensity showed the theoretical diameter of throw of irrigation water by sprinklers the parameter was observed to increase with an increase in operating pressure head nugget and sill parameter which were found 0 and 3 35 4 79 also showed good spatial correlation of irrigation intensity based on the spatial variation parameters as discussed above the kriged map of irrigation intensity under three operating pressure heads was prepared and presented in fig 12 spatial maps showed that the central part of the experimental field was better irrigated than the border areas however the rate of application of irrigation water was higher under operating pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 than 1 5 kg cm 2 and 1 kg cm 2 these maps also showed that the irrigation uniformity was higher under operating pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 than 1 5 kg cm 2 and 1 kg cm 2 predicted rate of application of irrigation water in the spatial maps was 0 6 19 mm h 1 0 01 6 86 mm h 1 and 0 02 7 96 mm h 1 under operating pressure head of 1 kg cm 2 1 5 kg cm 2 and 2 kg cm 2 respectively measured rate of application of irrigation water under micro sprinkler system operated by 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system was 0 5 35 mm h 1 0 25 7 64 mm h 1 and 2 04 9 68 mm h 1 under operating pressure head of 0 7 kg cm 2 1 kg cm 2 and 1 2 kg cm 2 respectively it was observed that rate of application of irrigation water was increased with an increase in operating pressure head spatial variation of rate of application of irrigation water at different distances across and along the laterals as depicted in fig 13 also showed the increase in rate of application of irrigation water with increase in operating pressure head coefficient of variation in rate of application of irrigation water was decreased with increase in operating pressure head and it was 79 48 64 46 and 40 69 under operating pressure head of 0 7 kg cm 2 1 kg cm 2 and 1 2 kg cm 2 respectively decrease in coefficient of variation with increase in operating pressure head indirectly indicates the increase in uniformity of irrigation which was evident from increase in du and cu with increase in operating pressure head du of micro sprinkler system was found 13 22 26 48 and 55 21 respectively at the operating pressure head of 0 7 kg cm 2 1 kg cm 2 and 1 2 kg cm 2 whereas christiansen uc was 40 39 43 99 and 67 96 from these observations it may be inferred that micro sprinkler system needs to be operated by 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system at a pressure head of 1 2 kg cm 2 or higher with 10 micro sprinkler at a time to obtain better irrigation uniformity 3 8 development of module for optimum use of water by solar pv pumps from the pressure discharge behavior of 1 hp solar pv pumping system and the performance of micro irrigation system operated by the pumping system it was observed that the 1 hp pumping systems could be utilized to lift shallow water resources followed by its application in field through pressurized irrigation system with a suction head not more than 2 3 m therefore a module for optimum use of harvested runoff water in farm ponds through 1 hp ac dc solar pv pumping system for irrigation has been prepared and presented in fig 14 the module consisted of two sub modules i runoff generation potential calculation and ii use of harvested runoff water in farm ponds for irrigation purpose through solar pv pumping system the first sub module estimates the runoff generation potential from a specific area through curve number cn method using this method suitable cn value for a specific hydrological situation needs to be identified from the standard table here it is to be noted that cn2 refers to cn value corresponding to average antecedent soil moisture condition to account for different soils ability to infiltrate soils have been divided into four hydrologic soil groups hsgs a b c and d hsg a indicates low runoff potential whereas hsg d indicates high runoff potential average infiltration rate of these hsgs are 7 6 mm h 1 3 8 7 6 mm h 1 1 3 3 8 mm h 1 and 1 3 mm h 1 respectively for category a b c and d for example cn2 value for desert shrub land with poor cover condition 30 coverage is 63 for hsg a under this condition soil moisture retention s will be about 6 mm the initial abstraction i a will be 1 2 mm thus potential runoff from a 20 mm rainfall event will be 14 12 mm therefore runoff volume from 1 ha will be about 141 2 m3 if there is 10 such rainfall events occur in a year annual runoff volume will be 1412 m3 if we consider an overall collection efficiency of 50 a farm pond of 706 m3capacity can be dug out near the outlet of the 1 ha catchment area therefore dimension of the pond may be 15 15 3 m for using the stored runoff water in farm pond it is to be ensured to minimize the evaporation and seepage loss thereafter stored runoff water can be used for irrigation purpose and crops can be chosen as per its water requirement and amount of available water in pond if we consider 20 loss of stored water through evaporation and seepage 564 m3 water can be used for irrigation purpose which can provide 56 mm irrigation in 1 ha area 3 9 life cycle cost of solar pv pumping system results of economic analysis of solar pv pumping system are presented in table 2 both cash outflow and cash inflow for all components of solar pv pumping system were converted to present value cash outflow of the system included capital cost maintenance cost repair cost replacement cost for components and cost for cultivation of crops cash inflow of the system was due to income from crop production and additional electricity generated over pumping annualized life cycle cost of 1 hp dc pv pumping system was rs 20 701 slightly lower than the 1 hp ac pv pumping system rs 21 968 however the net present value of 1 hp ac pv pumping system rs 32 958 was slightly higher than 1 hp dc pv pumping system rs 27 298 internal rate of return and break even period of 1 hp solar pv pumping system was found 15 16 and 10 39 11 64 years and thus provides a economically feasible solution to small and marginal farmers in the present analysis cultivation of vigna radiata during kharif with lifesaving irrigation of 40 mm and cultivation of plantago ovata during rabi season with 180 mm irrigation was considered inclusion of pre kharif summer crops might have further improved the economics of solar pv pumping system however availability of surface water resources which could be pumped by 1 hp solar pv pumping system for irrigation purpose is a challenging task in arid zone and therefore it was avoided in semi arid and sub humid part there is opportunity to harvest sufficient amount of rain water in surface water harvesting structure to support irrigation during both rabi and pre kharif season and thus may improve the economics of 1 hp pv pumping system the solar pv pumping system was also reported to be cheaper than grid connected electric pumps and diesel operated irrigation pumps santra et al 2016 therefore solar pv pumping systems are economically more feasible than corresponding grid connected pumps and diesel operated pumps although initial investment for capital cost is quite high for the solar pv pumping system 3 10 carbon footprint of solar pv pumping system apart from economic superiority of solar pv pumps than corresponding grid connected electric pump and diesel pump the environmental impact of all these three type of pumping system was also evaluated the carbon footprint for different types of irrigation pumping system is given in table 3 it is observed that carbon footprint of solar pv pumping system is almost negligible as compared to grid connected electric pumping system and diesel operated pumping system it is also to be noted here that grid connected electric pumping system has the highest carbon footprint and is almost the double of the carbon footprint from diesel operated pumping systems this is mainly because of use of coal as the major input in thermal power based grid networks of the country and the carbon emission factor of coal is comparatively higher than diesel fuel for irrigation pumping system the amount of irrigation water 1 ha mm to be applied in agricultural field can be converted to equivalent hydraulic energy after multiplying the weight of irrigation water mg and total head of the pumping system h followed by dividing it with the efficiency of pumping system ζ in case of 1 hp pv pumping system total head may be considered about 20 m and efficiency of irrigation system is about 46 and 28 for electric pump and diesel pump respectively using the above relationship the equivalent amount of hydraulic energy for 1 ha mm irrigation for a total head of 20 m is 1 185 kwh and 1 946 kwh for electric pump and diesel pump respectively thus the carbon footprint per ha mm irrigation is 1 214 kg co2 eq for grid connected electricity pump whereas for diesel operated pumping system it is about 0 382 kg co2 eq 4 conclusion solar pv pumping system of both ac and dc type and of 1 hp capacity was experimentally evaluated in hot arid region of india following conclusions are drawn from the present study i solar irradiation is available in plenty in india with an annual average of 5 40 kwh m 2 day 1 whereas western rajasthan lying in hot arid region of the country receives more than the national average 5 75 kwh m 2 day 1 therefore solar pv pumping based irrigation even with the small capacity e g 1 hp is a feasible solution for meeting the irrigation demand in fragmented land holdings of the country however the small sized solar pv pumping systems can only be utilized to lift and irrigate shallow water resources 2 3 m suction head ii performance of 1 hp solar pv pumping systems revealed that the dc pumping system could be operated for a longer duration in a day than ac pumping system however higher operating pressure head could be achieved with ac pumping system than dc pumping system iii head discharge relationship of 1 hp solar pv pumping system showed a decreasing trend in discharge with increase in pumping head whereas the pump discharge showed a positive trend with solar irradiation based on these relationships a multiple linear regression model to predict discharge of 1 hp solar pv pumping system was developed with good accuracy r2 0 75 iv change over switching facility in solar pv pumping system developed in the study could further increase the utility of the pumping system to farmer additional electricity generated by the pumping system could be used for on farm mechanization meeting domestic electricity needs and even can be sold out to grids for fetching additional income v performance of mini sprinklers showed that 9 mini sprinklers at a spacing of 6 m could successfully be operated by 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system with a pressure head of 2 kg cm 2 and suction head of 2 3 m christiansen uniformity coefficient of 0 55 could be achieved with the above said sprinkler design however to further improve the irrigation uniformity of mini sprinklers operated by the 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system the number of mini sprinkler can be reduced from 9 to 6 and the spacing between sprinklers can be reduced from 6 m to 5 m vi economic comparison of 1 hp ac and 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system showed that the dc pumping system was slightly cheaper than ac pumping system the annualized life cycle cost of 1 hp dc solar pv pumping system was about rs 20 701 whereas it was rs 21 968 for 1 hp ac solar pv pumping system vii carbon footprint of solar pv pumping system was found significantly lower as compared to grid connected electric pump and diesel operated pump the carbon footprint of 1 hp solar pv pumping system was 0 009 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 whereas it was 1 124 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 for grid connected electric pumps and 0 381 kg co2 eq ha mm 1 for diesel operated pumping system declaration of competing interest

10264,water and soil are important natural resources for agricultural development soil erosion is a worldwide problem threatening sustainable agriculture development rainfall is one of the major natural factors that cause soil erosion the study of the spatial distribution and temporal trends of rainfall erosivity is practical and important for the assessment of soil erosion hazards the planning of soil and water conservation measures and the sustainable agriculture development in this study the data of daily rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 were collected the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of rainfall and rainfall erosivity were analyzed the results show that the regional mean annual rainfall varies from 315 0 to 807 3 mm which shows an increasing spatial trend from northwest to southeast the mean annual rainfall erosivity in the basin ranges from 751 4 to 2600 0 mj mm hm 2 h 1 which has a similar pattern of spatial distribution as the rainfall the monthly rainfall erosivity changing pattern is a single peak type high erosivity of rainfall was mainly observed from july to september the peaks mostly occur in july and august the temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity ranges from 6 6 10 1 mj mm hm 2 h 1 per year the loess plateau and the qinling mountains in the southern basin show an increasing trend and the surroundings of xifeng changwu and huanxian have the statistical significance of p 0 05 in the midstream and downstream of the basin and the guanzhong plain the rainfall erosivity shows an insignificant decreasing trend the north atlantic oscillation obviously influences the rainfall erosivity in the recent two decades the study results may helpful for the scientific management soil erosion prevention and sustainable agricultural development of the wei river basin keywords wei river basin rainfall erosivity trends sustainable agriculture 1 introduction soil erosion is a global problem threatening the sustainable agriculture development strong soil erosion destroys the soil cultivation layer takes away nutrients from the soil and reduces grain yield the cutting effect of water erosion causes the fragmentation of arable land which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture rainfall is a major natural factor that leads to soil erosion li et al 2020 under the background of global climate changing the variation of precipitation has a remarkable influence on the soil erosion process the rainfall erosivity is a key indicator to evaluate the potential capacity of rainfall energy causing soil erosion under the action of rainfall the soil loss caused by surface runoff in the upstream changes the sediment load of the river causing the channel to be blocked in the downstream irrigation districts land irrigated with surface water with excessive sediments will change the soil structure and affect crop growth soil loss will cause pollutants to migrate downstream and affect agricultural production in downstream areas this phenomenon has caused soil erosion to have a significant cross regional effect and has a more serious impact on sustainable agricultural development studying the spatial distribution characteristics of the rainfall erosivity and testing its temporal trends are of great significance for assessing soil erosion hazards planning soil and water conservation measures and sustainable agriculture development the rainfall erosivity is a fundamental factor for the universal soil loss equation usle proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 usle uses the product of the total rainfall kinetic energy and the rainfall intensity 30 minute during the individual rainstorm as an indicator to evaluate the rainfall erosivity for the next 4 decades rainfall erosivity was used as the major parameter in usle and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 to evaluate the soil loss meanwhile many researches have been done to study the changing characteristics of the rainfall erosivity worldwide yu 1998 g zhao et al 2015 j zhao et al 2015 chen and zha 2018 liu et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 kim et al 2020 li et al 2020 because of the limited rainfall data various methods for calculating rainfall erosivity have been put forward for different rainfall data renard and freimund 1994 yu and rosewell 1996 yin et al 2007 lee and heo 2011 some parameterized models for rainfall erosivity estimation were also established using the data of daily precipitation from china zhang et al 2002 xie et al 2016 have been widely applied in studies concerning the risk of soil erosion by rainfall and changes of sedimentation of rivers in china huang et al 2013 ma et al 2014 sun et al 2013 2014 wen et al 2019 wu et al 2015 g zhao et al 2015 j zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 since the 1950s the runoff and sediment load of rivers have changed significantly under the influences of anthropogenic activities and the natural reasons leading to great changes in the landforms of the river and its near shore environment walling 2006 the obvious changes have a significant impact on the sustainable development of agriculture and the allocation of the water resources in these basins the wei river basin is one of the most seriously eroded areas in the yellow river basin the soil erosion brings an enormous amount of sand and soil to the yellow river and results in the serious siltation of river channels and reservoirs in the midstream and the lower stream of the yellow river which is the main reason for the frequent flooding disaster downstream the wei river basin provides water resources for agriculture however due to the influences of climate change and anthropogenic activities the runoff and sedimentation of the rivers in the wei river basin show different trends in recent years which have great impacts on the agricultural production in the basin as an important component of the loess plateau of china about 76 9 of the basin has different degrees of soil erosion the major erosion types are water erosion and gravity erosion in the wei river basin the main factors that cause soil erosion are the natural environment and frequent human activities the soil erosion is aggravated by the short duration and high intensity precipitation in summer moreover the basin is located in the loess plateau which has complex terrain and lots of ravines overgrazing non sustainable agricultural activities and indiscriminate logging are also the major reasons for the aggravation of the soil loss in the basin some studies on the rainfall erosivity of different places in the loess plateau or the yellow river basin have been done g zhao et al 2015 j zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 sun et al 2013 2014 however the studies on the rainfall erosivity among the whole wei river basin are limited in this paper the observed data of daily rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 were collected the spatial temporal distribution and variation characteristics of the rainfall and its erosivity are analyzed the aim of this study is to provide a scientific basis for the soil erosion hazard assessment and sustainable agricultural development in the wei river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wei river originates from the east of gansu province cross ningxia province and flows into the yellow river at tongguan fig 1 as the largest tributary of the yellow river the drainage area of the basin is 134 800 km2 the jing river and the beiluo river are two major tributaries of the wei river the northern part of the wei river basin is the gullies of the loess plateau the central part is guanzhong plain and the southern part of the basin is the northern foothill of qinling mountains the terrain variation is large with a higher elevation in the west a considerable area of the basin is covered by thick loess the soil is porous and relatively loose with the good permeability but a poor corrosion resistance the wei river basin belongs to the continental monsoon climate zone cold in the winter with major west and northwest wind and hot in the summer

lowest temperature of 28 1 the mean annual precipitation is about 551 5 mm the precipitation in mountainous areas is higher than that in river valleys the high value of the evapotranspiration mainly recorded in june and july with an average annual value of 995 0 mm fig 2 shows the agricultural land use and hydraulic engineering infrastructure in the wei river basin the dominating land use is arable land and grassland with percentages of 40 5 and 38 2 respectively the wei river basin is a very important production base for food vegetables and fruits in china there are 9 large irrigation districts in the guanzhong plain irrigation water mainly depends on the jing river beiluo river and wei river and the proportion of agricultural water consumption exceeds 60 of the total water resources in the basin 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate in the present study daily rainfall data of the wei river basin and its surrounding area from 1969 to 2018 were collected totally 30 surface

or equal to 12 mm during the calculation the first 15 days in each month is defined as a half month period and the rest is used as another half month period there are 24 half month periods in one year the erosivity of the rainfall in the specific period is calculated as follows zhang et al 2002 4 r i α j 1 k d j β where r i refers to the rainfall erosivity in the i th period mj mm hm 2 h 1 k presents the number of days in the i th period d j refers to the rainfall on the specific day in the i th period the value of d j is assigned to zero if the daily rainfall is less than 12 mm α and β are the model parameters α and β of each meteorological station is estimated as follows zhang et al 2002 5 α 21 586 β 7 1891 6 β 0 8363 18 144 p d 12 24 455 p y 12 where p d 12 refers to the average of daily rainfall 12 mm p y 12 refers to the average of annual rainfall 12 mm 3 1 3 xie model xie proposed the optimized model for estimating rainfall erosivity in china xie et al 2016 the equation of the xie model is as follows xie et al 2016 7 r i α j 1 k p d 1 7265 where r i is the rainfall erosivity of the i th half month of a year mj mm hm 2 h 1 j 1 2 k refers to the number of days of erosive rainfall in a half month p d is the daily rainfall 10 mm in this model the threshold of rainfall is deﬁned as 10 mm instead of 12 mm considering that the single rainfall event occurring across two days maybe recorded as two daily rainfall amounts avoiding the underestimation of the rainfall erosivity the parameter α was set to 0 3937 during the warm season may to september and to 0 3101 in the cold season october to april 3 2 mann kendall trend test the mann kendall mann 1945 rank correlation test method is widely used in the research of hydrology and meteorology by using the order of data sequence rather than the actual value to judge the degree of correlation between the two variables can avoid the disturbance from the maxima or minima value moreover the variation trend of the long term data series can be achieved objectively the mann kendall test statistic can be calculated as follows mann 1945 8 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k where n is the length of the time series x j and x k are the variable values of time in the time series j k sgn is a symbolic function and its equation is as follows mann 1945 9 sgn x j x k 1 x j x k 0 0 x j x k 0 1 x j x k 0 when determining the trend significance of time series data changes the mann kendall test has the following main parameters a significance level of trend z and the slope of the trend s the significance level indicates whether the trend of the variable is obvious while the slope represents the direction and degree of the trend the null hypothesis is unacceptable when the mean value of s equals to zero and the variance is close to a normal distribution the variance is as follows mann 1945 10 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where q refers to the number of sets with the same time series variable value t p represents data s number in the p th set the statistic z can be calculated by following equation mann 1945 11 z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 if z is positive the time series shows a monodic

spatial interpolation the inverse distance weighting idw radial basis function rbf and kriging models were independently optimized using parameters and the optimal prediction results of each model were cross compared zhang et al 2019 according to the accuracy analysis results the kriging model of the arcgis was chosen as the major method for spatial interpolation in the study 4 results and discussion 4 1 changing characteristics of rainfall 4 1 1 changes of annual rainfall the inter annual variation of the annual rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 is shown in fig 3 the mean annual rainfall in the wei river basin is 551 5 mm the maximum annual rainfall is 769 4 mm 2003 the minimum annual rainfall is 356 9 mm 1997 and the coefficient of variation is 16 1 the statistical analysis results of rainfall in the basin are shown in table 1 the maximum decadal average of rainfall is 588 4 mm 1980s while the minimum value is 516 6 mm 1990 s a downward trend of the rainfall shows from the 1980 s to the 1990 s and then gradually increases from 2000 to 2010 the overall annual rainfall shows a fluctuating upward trend and the annual variation coefficient gradually decreases 4 1 2 spatial trend of annual rainfall spatial interpolation is carried out for the mean annual rainfall in the wei river basin and the spatial distribution characteristics of the mean annual rainfall in the basin are shown in fig 4 the rainfall shows a trend of decreasing from southeast to northwest the qinling mountains in the south basin which represented by foping and taibai had the highest value of rainfall the rainfall in the north loess hilly region is the least and the rainfall in the eastern and western wings of the south basin are quite different the rainfall along the basin is mainly from 500 mm to 600 mm distributing in the strip area in the middle of the basin from the northeast to southwest which accounts for about 55 56 of the total area of the basin in the guanzhong plain that located at the lower reaches of the basin it forms a relatively low rainfall area represented by yongshou qindu and pucheng the guanzhong plain belongs to a warm semi arid climate zone and it is surrounded by mountains on three sides the narrow mouth of baoji gorge west the qinling mountains south and the loess plateau north the multiple barriers to water vapor from the ocean result in the frequent drought disasters in the guanzhong plain and the spatial differences of rainfall as can be seen from the foregoing the rainfall in the basin has obvious spatial differences the time series data of the spatial interpolation of annual rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 are analyzed using the mann kendall test fig 5 depicted the spatial distribution of annual rainfall changing trends and statistical significance as shown in fig 5a the trend of annual rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 varies from 1 38 2 76 mm a 1 the annual rainfall in the mountain of the western basin and the loess plateau shows an upward trend the largest increase is found in huanxian xifeng and changwu of the loess plateau and the decreasing trend is found in guanzhong plain as can be seen from fig 5b the trend of rainfall shows the significance of p 0 1 and p 0 05 in huajialing guyuan liupanshan wuqi kongtong xifeng changwu and huanxian but the trends in other regions are not significant 4 2 changing characteristics of rainfall erosivity 4 2 1 determination of major model for estimation of rainfall erosivity fig 6a shows the spatial distribution characteristics of mean annual rainfall erosivity estimated using the three models all three models produce the similar spatial variation trend with the mean annual rainfall the spatial distributions derived from the yu model and the xie model show a very similar pattern while the spatial distribution of the zhang model differs from the yu model and the xie model in the guanzhong plain the values of rainfall erosivity of three models also show significant differences the regional mean annual rainfall erosivity of the yu model the zhang model and the xie model are 1415 0718 1634 8446 and 1479 3918 respectively fig 6b shows the spatial distribution difference of mean annual rainfall erosivity among different models rainfall erosivity estimated by the zhang model is generally higher than the value of the xie model the relatively high values of the zhang model are mainly observed at the southeastern border of the basin the relatively low values of the zhang model are mainly observed at the northwestern border and the downstream of the basin the mean difference of rainfall erosivity between the zhang model and the xie model is 155 4528 rainfall erosivity estimated by the yu model is totally lower than the value of the xie model differs from the pattern of the zhang model the relatively low values of the yu model are mainly observed at the southeastern border of the basin the mean difference of rainfall erosivity between the yu model and the xie model is 64 3200 in the view of above the differences between three models are ignorable and it is necessary to determine the major model to estimate the rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin previous studies point out that among the yu model the zhang model and the xie model the result of the xie model is the closest one to the actual rainfall erosivity ma et al 2014 chen et al 2020 the zhang model generally overestimates the rainfall erosivity and the yu model underestimates the rainfall erosivity slightly in this study the rainfall erosivity was estimated using all 3 models the relationship between the models is shown in fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 the trends show a similar relationship observed in the previous studies chen et al 2020 therefore we choose the xie model as the major model for the estimation of rainfall erosivity the following analysis and discussion are based on the results of the xie model 4 2 2 changes of seasonal rainfall erosivity fig 8 shows the distribution characteristics of seasonal rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin the changing characteristics of seasonal rainfall erosivity within one year are similar to that of the rainfall the high erosivity in the basin is mainly observed in summer and autumn both of which show a single peak the peak of the rainfall erosivity reaches from july to august the rainfall erosivity from july to september accounts for 68 87 of the entire year the rainfall erosivity of spring summer and autumn accounts for 12 36 63 10 and 7 02 of the annual rainfall erosivity respectively the rainfall erosivity of winter accounted for only 0 27 of the annual rainfall erosivity suggesting that the erosivity generated by snowfall and snowmelt is negligible the peak of rainfall erosivity at the stations from the northwestern basin appeared in august while the peak of rainfall erosivity at most stations from the central region and stations from the southeast appeared in july the annual proportion of rainfall erosivity in the northwest central and southeast regions in july and august is 60 66 56 95 and 48 03 respectively therefore the seasonal variation of the water erosion and the soil loss in the wei river basin has obvious spatial differences and the seasonal distribution of erosive rainfall in the northwest part is relatively concentrated the soil erosion mainly occurred in the northwestern basin from july to september which is also the rainfall concentrated period in the southeastern basin soil erosion was likely to occur from may to october when the rainfall and the rainfall frequency is high 4 2 3 spatial trend of annual rainfall erosivity the mean annual rainfall erosivity at each station in the wei river basin is calculated by the xie model the spatial distribution map of the annual rainfall erosivity in the basin is obtained by spatial interpolation as shown in fig 9 the rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin ranges from 751 4 to 2600 0 mj mm hm 2 h 1 with an average of 1479 4 mj mm hm 2 h 1 a standard deviation of 346 8 mj mm hm 2 h 1 and a coefficient of variation of 23 4 it can be concluded that the spatial difference of the rainfall erosivity in the basin is large the mean annual rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin gradually decreases from the southeast part to the northwest part and the high value areas are formed in huashan and foping in the southern qinling mountains the low value area with the annual rainfall erosivity lower than 1400 mj mm hm 2 h 1 is formed in the upper reaches of the wei river basin and the northern part of the loess plateau a relatively low value area with the annual rainfall erosivity from 1600 to 1800 mj mm hm 2 h 1 is formed in guanzhong plain in the lower reaches of the wei river basin 4 2 4 vertical spatial trend of annual rainfall erosivity the elevation data of the wei river basin are reclassified according to the standard deviation 520 4 m with the mean elevation 1380 m as the center and five levels of different elevation range are divided the wei river basin is divided into east and west parts according to the average rainfall erosivity 1479 4 mj mm hm 2 h 1 as shown in fig 10 the spatial statistics of the vertical variation of mean rainfall erosivity are carried out by using the zonal statistical method in arcgis table 2 in the qinling mountains the mean rainfall erosivity increases rapidly with the escalation of elevation for every 100 m increase in mean elevation the mean rainfall erosivity of this region increased by 46 7 mj mm hm 2 h 1 in the guanzhong plain and loess plateau the mean rainfall erosivity decreases gradually with the increase of elevation for every 100 m increase in average elevation the average rainfall erosion decreased by 25 6 mj mm hm 2 h 1 in the western basin the mean rainfall erosivity decreases gradually with the increase of elevation for every 100 m increase in average elevation the average rainfall erosion decreased by 24 7 mj mm hm 2 h 1 in conclusion the mean annual rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin has an obvious vertical spatial difference and the spatial difference changes under the affection by topography and geomorphology in addition the coefficient of variation is usually higher in high elevation areas than that in low elevation areas indicating that as the elevation increases the spatial variability of regional rainfall in the horizontal dimension continues to increase and the rainfall erosivity changes drastically in the high altitude areas 4 2 5 temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity the spatial distribution of annual rainfall erosivity changing trend and the statistical significance are obtained using the mann kendall test and arcgis fig 11 as can be seen in fig 11a the temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 ranges from 6 6 10 1 mj mm hm 2 h 1 a 1 per year the annual rainfall erosivity in the qinling mountains and the loess plateau shows an upward trend the largest increase is found in huanxian and xifeng the trend of decreasing is found in the midstream and downstream of the wei river basin such as pucheng huaxian and huashan as presented in fig 11b the temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity in the basin shows the significance of p 0 1 and p 0 05 only in the areas around xifeng changwu and huanxian the trends in other areas are not significant 4 3 impacts of global climate change on rainfall erosivity we analyzed the wavelet coherence of rainfall erosivity and the main oscillations influencing the global climate change grinsted et al 2004 considering the temporal trend of the rainfall erosivity the analysis mainly focuses on those climate indices causing variation of rainfall erosivity in the recent two decades among all climate indices analyzed north atlantic oscillation nao shows a high correlation with the rainfall erosivity in wei river basin as shown in fig 12 rainfall erosivity in the basin shows a statistically significant positive correlation with the nao variation with a 3 6 years resonant period from 1997 to 2018 the arrow direction depicted in fig 12 indicates that the rainfall erosivity variation in the basin has a 9 months lag behind the nao variation in the period of 1997 2014 and change to an 11 months lag from 2015 4 4 implications for sustainable agriculture development since 1998 the chinese government had launched the grain for green program for soil and water conservation on the loess plateau sun et al 2013 positive environmental effects have been achieved through the large scale vegetation restoration however with the increasing of vegetation coverage the water requirement has also increased dramatically this directly causes the decrease of soil moisture and groundwater storage xie et al 2018 in the present study the temporal variation trend of the global wetness percentile was analyzed using the mann kendall test fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of the temporal trend of the surface soil moisture 0 2 cm the root zone soil moisture 1 m and the groundwater in the period of 2003 2020 as can be seen in fig 13 the soil moisture and the groundwater both have a decreasing trend in the loess plateau the change of soil moisture can influence the soil erodibility which is another controlling factor of soil erosion bryan et al 1989 larionov et al 2014 in this situation the increase in rainfall erosivity implies an increase in the potential risk of the soil erosion as shown in fig 14 the coverage with increased potential soil erosion risk in the loess plateau accounted for 13 97 of the basin among them the areas of arable land grassland and bare land most affected by soil erosion are 7229 10 024 and 5 km 2 respectively with the lower soil moisture and intense rainfall the topsoil of the arable land in the northern basin may be lost under the water erosion of the runoff resulting in a decline in land productivity and a reduction in food production world bank 2006 li et al 2015 check dam is an important soil and water conservation facility in the loess plateau according to the previous study as of 2014 59 037 check dams have been built in the loess plateau about 7336 of them were built in 1960s and are nearly dysfunctional dang et al 2020 nearly 43 8 of the medium size check dams are running in unsafe conditions dang et al 2020 in this situation the increase in rainfall erosivity in the loess plateau may increase the sediments content of surface runoff causing soil conservation facilities such as check dams to lose their ability to trap sediment early than their design life dang et al 2020 this will affect the sediment transport capacity of rivers in the basin change the water storage capacity of the reservoirs downstream reduce the amount of water resources and affect the sustainable development of agriculture in the basin as can be seen in fig 14 in the lower reaches of the basin many irrigation districts that use surface water as the irrigation source may be impacted by the increase of sediment load of the rivers excessive sediment erosion will shorten the life of the channels at the lower reaches of the channels the flow velocity will be reduced and excessive sediment deposits may block the channel leading to the low efficiency of water resources use and influencing the agricultural production regarding the potential issues discussed above it is necessary to take some measures to deal with potential hazards caused by the increase of rainfall erosivity such as soil loss land productivity decline and failure of soil and water conservation facilities suggestions are as follows a for areas with increased rainfall erosivity on the loess plateau the planting ratio of cover crops should be increased to reduce the erosion of topsoil by rainfall it should also enhance returning the crop residues to the field increase the content of soil organic matter and ensure land productivity world bank 2006 b besides water and soil conservation measures such as vegetation restoration building terraces and check dams implement land consolidation projects to increase the area of high quality arable land and increase food production li et al 2015 c strengthen the monitoring of water erosion and soil loss in the river basin improve the infrastructure of hydraulic engineering in the downstream irrigation districts of the basin and control the sediment content in the irrigation water d enhance the policy of grain for green program scientifically plan the water resource consumption and the vegetation restoration in short in view of the increasing trend of rainfall erosivity it should to adjust the control measures in time for soil erosion focus on the regional differences the systemic nature of disaster prevention and the harmony between society and nature eventually promote the sustainable development of the agriculture 5 conclusions in the present study the long term daily rainfall data of the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 were collected the seasonal distribution characteristics of the rainfall and its erosivity were examined the temporal trends spatial distributions and changing patterns of the rainfall and the rainfall erosivity in the basin have been analyzed the conclusions can be summarized 1 the changing characteristics of rainfall show that the annual rainfall in wei river basin shows a spatial trend of decreasing from southeast to northwest the temporal trend of annual rainfall in the basin varies from 1 38 2 76 mm a 1 the annual rainfall in the western basin and the loess plateau showed an upward temporal trend and the temporal trend of decreasing is found in the middle and lower reaches of the wei river basin 2 the high rainfall erosivity in the basin is mainly observed in summer and autumn the peak of the rainfall erosivity is reached from july to august the mean annual rainfall erosivity gradually decreases from the southeast basin to the northwest basin the vertical spatial trend shows that the mean annual rainfall erosivity in the basin has obvious vertical spatial difference which changes under the influence of topography and geomorphology 3 the wavelet coherence shows that rainfall erosivity in the basin has a statistically significant positive correlation with the nao variation with a 3 6 years resonant period from 1997 to 2018 indicating global climate change has impacted the rainfall erosivity in the recent two decades 4 the increase in rainfall erosivity implies an increase in potential soil erosion risk in areas with increased rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin it should take appropriate measures to reduce the

10264,water and soil are important natural resources for agricultural development soil erosion is a worldwide problem threatening sustainable agriculture development rainfall is one of the major natural factors that cause soil erosion the study of the spatial distribution and temporal trends of rainfall erosivity is practical and important for the assessment of soil erosion hazards the planning of soil and water conservation measures and the sustainable agriculture development in this study the data of daily rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 were collected the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of rainfall and rainfall erosivity were analyzed the results show that the regional mean annual rainfall varies from 315 0 to 807 3 mm which shows an increasing spatial trend from northwest to southeast the mean annual rainfall erosivity in the basin ranges from 751 4 to 2600 0 mj mm hm 2 h 1 which has a similar pattern of spatial distribution as the rainfall the monthly rainfall erosivity changing pattern is a single peak type high erosivity of rainfall was mainly observed from july to september the peaks mostly occur in july and august the temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity ranges from 6 6 10 1 mj mm hm 2 h 1 per year the loess plateau and the qinling mountains in the southern basin show an increasing trend and the surroundings of xifeng changwu and huanxian have the statistical significance of p 0 05 in the midstream and downstream of the basin and the guanzhong plain the rainfall erosivity shows an insignificant decreasing trend the north atlantic oscillation obviously influences the rainfall erosivity in the recent two decades the study results may helpful for the scientific management soil erosion prevention and sustainable agricultural development of the wei river basin keywords wei river basin rainfall erosivity trends sustainable agriculture 1 introduction soil erosion is a global problem threatening the sustainable agriculture development strong soil erosion destroys the soil cultivation layer takes away nutrients from the soil and reduces grain yield the cutting effect of water erosion causes the fragmentation of arable land which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture rainfall is a major natural factor that leads to soil erosion li et al 2020 under the background of global climate changing the variation of precipitation has a remarkable influence on the soil erosion process the rainfall erosivity is a key indicator to evaluate the potential capacity of rainfall energy causing soil erosion under the action of rainfall the soil loss caused by surface runoff in the upstream changes the sediment load of the river causing the channel to be blocked in the downstream irrigation districts land irrigated with surface water with excessive sediments will change the soil structure and affect crop growth soil loss will cause pollutants to migrate downstream and affect agricultural production in downstream areas this phenomenon has caused soil erosion to have a significant cross regional effect and has a more serious impact on sustainable agricultural development studying the spatial distribution characteristics of the rainfall erosivity and testing its temporal trends are of great significance for assessing soil erosion hazards planning soil and water conservation measures and sustainable agriculture development the rainfall erosivity is a fundamental factor for the universal soil loss equation usle proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 usle uses the product of the total rainfall kinetic energy and the rainfall intensity 30 minute during the individual rainstorm as an indicator to evaluate the rainfall erosivity for the next 4 decades rainfall erosivity was used as the major parameter in usle and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 to evaluate the soil loss meanwhile many researches have been done to study the changing characteristics of the rainfall erosivity worldwide yu 1998 g zhao et al 2015 j zhao et al 2015 chen and zha 2018 liu et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 kim et al 2020 li et al 2020 because of the limited rainfall data various methods for calculating rainfall erosivity have been put forward for different rainfall data renard and freimund 1994 yu and rosewell 1996 yin et al 2007 lee and heo 2011 some parameterized models for rainfall erosivity estimation were also established using the data of daily precipitation from china zhang et al 2002 xie et al 2016 have been widely applied in studies concerning the risk of soil erosion by rainfall and changes of sedimentation of rivers in china huang et al 2013 ma et al 2014 sun et al 2013 2014 wen et al 2019 wu et al 2015 g zhao et al 2015 j zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 since the 1950s the runoff and sediment load of rivers have changed significantly under the influences of anthropogenic activities and the natural reasons leading to great changes in the landforms of the river and its near shore environment walling 2006 the obvious changes have a significant impact on the sustainable development of agriculture and the allocation of the water resources in these basins the wei river basin is one of the most seriously eroded areas in the yellow river basin the soil erosion brings an enormous amount of sand and soil to the yellow river and results in the serious siltation of river channels and reservoirs in the midstream and the lower stream of the yellow river which is the main reason for the frequent flooding disaster downstream the wei river basin provides water resources for agriculture however due to the influences of climate change and anthropogenic activities the runoff and sedimentation of the rivers in the wei river basin show different trends in recent years which have great impacts on the agricultural production in the basin as an important component of the loess plateau of china about 76 9 of the basin has different degrees of soil erosion the major erosion types are water erosion and gravity erosion in the wei river basin the main factors that cause soil erosion are the natural environment and frequent human activities the soil erosion is aggravated by the short duration and high intensity precipitation in summer moreover the basin is located in the loess plateau which has complex terrain and lots of ravines overgrazing non sustainable agricultural activities and indiscriminate logging are also the major reasons for the aggravation of the soil loss in the basin some studies on the rainfall erosivity of different places in the loess plateau or the yellow river basin have been done g zhao et al 2015 j zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 sun et al 2013 2014 however the studies on the rainfall erosivity among the whole wei river basin are limited in this paper the observed data of daily rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 were collected the spatial temporal distribution and variation characteristics of the rainfall and its erosivity are analyzed the aim of this study is to provide a scientific basis for the soil erosion hazard assessment and sustainable agricultural development in the wei river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wei river originates from the east of gansu province cross ningxia province and flows into the yellow river at tongguan fig 1 as the largest tributary of the yellow river the drainage area of the basin is 134 800 km2 the jing river and the beiluo river are two major tributaries of the wei river the northern part of the wei river basin is the gullies of the loess plateau the central part is guanzhong plain and the southern part of the basin is the northern foothill of qinling mountains the terrain variation is large with a higher elevation in the west a considerable area of the basin is covered by thick loess the soil is porous and relatively loose with the good permeability but a poor corrosion resistance the wei river basin belongs to the continental monsoon climate zone cold in the winter with major west and northwest wind and hot in the summer with the south wind the weather in spring and autumn are relatively mild the annual average temperature of the wei river basin ranges from 7 8 to 13 5 with the highest temperature of 42 8 and the lowest temperature of 28 1 the mean annual precipitation is about 551 5 mm the precipitation in mountainous areas is higher than that in river valleys the high value of the evapotranspiration mainly recorded in june and july with an average annual value of 995 0 mm fig 2 shows the agricultural land use and hydraulic engineering infrastructure in the wei river basin the dominating land use is arable land and grassland with percentages of 40 5 and 38 2 respectively the wei river basin is a very important production base for food vegetables and fruits in china there are 9 large irrigation districts in the guanzhong plain irrigation water mainly depends on the jing river beiluo river and wei river and the proportion of agricultural water consumption exceeds 60 of the total water resources in the basin 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate in the present study daily rainfall data of the wei river basin and its surrounding area from 1969 to 2018 were collected totally 30 surface

rainfall in a half month p d is the daily rainfall 10 mm in this model the threshold of rainfall is deﬁned as 10 mm instead of 12 mm considering that the single rainfall event occurring across two days maybe recorded as two daily rainfall amounts avoiding the underestimation of the rainfall erosivity the parameter α was set to 0 3937 during the warm season may to september and to 0 3101 in the cold season october to april 3 2 mann kendall trend test the mann kendall mann 1945 rank correlation test method is widely used in the research of hydrology and meteorology by using the order of data sequence rather than the actual value to judge the degree of correlation between the two variables can avoid the disturbance from the maxima or minima value moreover the variation trend of the long term data series can be achieved objectively the mann kendall test statistic can be calculated as follows mann 1945 8 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k where n is the length of the time series x j and x k are the variable values of time in the time series j k sgn is a symbolic function and its equation is as follows mann 1945 9 sgn x j x k 1 x j x k 0 0 x j x k 0 1 x j x k 0 when determining the trend significance of time series data changes the mann kendall test has the following main parameters a significance level of trend z and the slope of the trend s the significance level indicates whether the trend of the variable is obvious while the slope represents the direction and degree of the trend the null hypothesis is unacceptable when the mean value of s equals to zero and the variance is close to a normal distribution the variance is as follows mann 1945 10 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where q refers to the number of sets with the same time series variable value t p represents data s number in the p th set the statistic z can be calculated by following equation mann 1945 11 z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 if z is positive the time series shows a monodic upward trend if it is negative the time series shows a monodic downward trend the absolute critical value of z for the significance level 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 are 2 576 1 96 and 1 645 respectively 3 3 spatial interpolation the inverse distance weighting idw radial basis function rbf and kriging models were independently optimized using parameters and the optimal prediction results of each model were cross compared zhang et al 2019 according to the accuracy analysis results the kriging model of the arcgis was chosen as the major method for spatial interpolation in the study 4 results and discussion 4 1 changing characteristics of rainfall 4 1 1 changes of annual rainfall the inter annual variation of the annual rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 is shown in fig 3 the mean annual rainfall in the wei river basin is 551 5 mm the maximum annual rainfall is 769 4 mm 2003 the minimum annual rainfall is 356 9 mm 1997 and the coefficient of variation is 16 1 the statistical analysis results of rainfall in the basin are shown in table 1 the maximum decadal average of rainfall is 588 4 mm 1980s while the minimum value is 516 6 mm 1990 s a downward trend of the rainfall shows from the 1980 s to the 1990 s and then gradually increases from 2000 to 2010 the overall annual rainfall shows a fluctuating upward trend and the annual variation coefficient gradually decreases 4 1 2 spatial trend of annual rainfall spatial interpolation is carried out for the mean annual rainfall in the wei river basin and the spatial distribution characteristics of the mean annual rainfall in the basin are shown in fig 4 the rainfall shows a trend of decreasing from southeast to northwest the qinling mountains in the south basin which represented by foping and taibai had the highest value of rainfall the rainfall in the north loess hilly region is the least and the rainfall in the eastern and western wings of the south basin are quite different the rainfall along the basin is mainly from 500 mm to 600 mm distributing in the strip area in the middle of the basin from the northeast to southwest which accounts for about 55 56 of the total area of the basin in the guanzhong plain that located at the lower reaches of the basin it forms a relatively low rainfall area represented by yongshou qindu and pucheng the guanzhong plain belongs to a warm semi arid climate zone and it is surrounded by mountains on three sides the narrow mouth of baoji gorge west the qinling mountains south and the loess plateau north the multiple barriers to water vapor from the ocean result in the frequent drought disasters in the guanzhong plain and the spatial differences of rainfall as can be seen from the foregoing the rainfall in the basin has obvious spatial differences the time series data of the spatial interpolation of annual rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 are analyzed using the mann kendall test fig 5 depicted the spatial distribution of annual rainfall changing trends and statistical significance as shown in fig 5a the trend of annual rainfall in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 varies from 1 38 2 76 mm a 1 the annual rainfall in the mountain of the western basin and the loess plateau shows an upward trend the largest increase is found in huanxian xifeng and changwu of the loess plateau and the decreasing trend is found in guanzhong plain as can be seen from fig 5b the trend of rainfall shows the significance of p 0 1 and p 0 05 in huajialing guyuan liupanshan wuqi kongtong xifeng changwu and huanxian but the trends in other regions are not significant 4 2 changing characteristics of rainfall erosivity 4 2 1 determination of major model for estimation of rainfall erosivity fig 6a shows the spatial distribution characteristics of mean annual rainfall erosivity estimated using the three models all three models produce the similar spatial variation trend with the mean annual rainfall the spatial distributions derived from the yu model and the xie model show a very similar pattern while the spatial distribution of the zhang model differs from the yu model and the xie model in the guanzhong plain the values of rainfall erosivity of three models also show significant differences the regional mean annual rainfall erosivity of the yu model the zhang model and the xie model are 1415 0718 1634 8446 and 1479 3918 respectively fig 6b shows the spatial distribution difference of mean annual rainfall erosivity among different models rainfall erosivity estimated by the zhang model is generally higher than the value of the xie model the relatively high values of the zhang model are mainly observed at the southeastern border of the basin the relatively low values of the zhang model are mainly observed at the northwestern border and the downstream of the basin the mean difference of rainfall erosivity between the zhang model and the xie model is 155 4528 rainfall erosivity estimated by the yu model is totally lower than the value of the xie model differs from the pattern of the zhang model the relatively low values of the yu model are mainly observed at the southeastern border of the basin the mean difference of rainfall erosivity between the yu model and the xie model is 64 3200 in the view of above the differences between three models are ignorable and it is necessary to determine the major model to estimate the rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin previous studies point out that among the yu model the zhang model and the xie model the result of the xie model is the closest one to the actual rainfall erosivity ma et al 2014 chen et al 2020 the zhang model generally overestimates the rainfall erosivity and the yu model underestimates the rainfall erosivity slightly in this study the rainfall erosivity was estimated using all 3 models the relationship between the models is shown in fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 the trends show a similar relationship observed in the previous studies chen et al 2020 therefore we choose the xie model as the major model for the estimation of rainfall erosivity the following analysis and discussion are based on the results of the xie model 4 2 2 changes of seasonal rainfall erosivity fig 8 shows the distribution characteristics of seasonal rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin the changing characteristics of seasonal rainfall erosivity within one year are similar to that of the rainfall the high erosivity in the basin is mainly observed in summer and autumn both of which show a single peak the peak of the rainfall erosivity reaches from july to august the rainfall erosivity from july to september accounts for 68 87 of the entire year the rainfall erosivity of spring summer and autumn accounts for 12 36 63 10 and 7 02 of the annual rainfall erosivity respectively the rainfall erosivity of winter accounted for only 0 27 of the annual rainfall erosivity suggesting that the erosivity generated by snowfall and snowmelt is negligible the peak of rainfall erosivity at the stations from the northwestern basin appeared in august while the peak of rainfall erosivity at most stations from the central region and stations from the southeast appeared in july the annual proportion of rainfall erosivity in the northwest central and southeast regions in july and august is 60 66 56 95 and 48 03 respectively therefore the seasonal variation of the water erosion and the soil loss in the wei river basin has obvious spatial differences and the seasonal distribution of erosive rainfall in the northwest part is relatively concentrated the soil erosion mainly occurred in the northwestern basin from july to september which is also the rainfall concentrated period in the southeastern basin soil erosion was likely to occur from may to october when the rainfall and the rainfall frequency is high 4 2 3 spatial trend of annual rainfall erosivity the mean annual rainfall erosivity at each station in the wei river basin is calculated by the xie model the spatial distribution map of the annual rainfall erosivity in the basin is obtained by spatial interpolation as shown in fig 9 the rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin ranges from 751 4 to 2600 0 mj mm hm 2 h 1 with an average of 1479 4 mj mm hm 2 h 1 a standard deviation of 346 8 mj mm hm 2 h 1 and a coefficient of variation of 23 4 it can be concluded that the spatial difference of the rainfall erosivity in the basin is large the mean annual rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin gradually decreases from the southeast part to the northwest part and the high value areas are formed in huashan and foping in the southern qinling mountains the low value area with the annual rainfall erosivity lower than 1400 mj mm hm 2 h 1 is formed in the upper reaches of the wei river basin and the northern part of the loess plateau a relatively low value area with the annual rainfall erosivity from 1600 to 1800 mj mm hm 2 h 1 is formed in guanzhong plain in the lower reaches of the wei river basin 4 2 4 vertical spatial trend of annual rainfall erosivity the elevation data of the wei river basin are reclassified according to the standard deviation 520 4 m with the mean elevation 1380 m as the center and five levels of different elevation range are divided the wei river basin is divided into east and west parts according to the average rainfall erosivity 1479 4 mj mm hm 2 h 1 as shown in fig 10 the spatial statistics of the vertical variation of mean rainfall erosivity are carried out by using the zonal statistical method in arcgis table 2 in the qinling mountains the mean rainfall erosivity increases rapidly with the escalation of elevation for every 100 m increase in mean elevation the mean rainfall erosivity of this region increased by 46 7 mj mm hm 2 h 1 in the guanzhong plain and loess plateau the mean rainfall erosivity decreases gradually with the increase of elevation for every 100 m increase in average elevation the average rainfall erosion decreased by 25 6 mj mm hm 2 h 1 in the western basin the mean rainfall erosivity decreases gradually with the increase of elevation for every 100 m increase in average elevation the average rainfall erosion decreased by 24 7 mj mm hm 2 h 1 in conclusion the mean annual rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin has an obvious vertical spatial difference and the spatial difference changes under the affection by topography and geomorphology in addition the coefficient of variation is usually higher in high elevation areas than that in low elevation areas indicating that as the elevation increases the spatial variability of regional rainfall in the horizontal dimension continues to increase and the rainfall erosivity changes drastically in the high altitude areas 4 2 5 temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity the spatial distribution of annual rainfall erosivity changing trend and the statistical significance are obtained using the mann kendall test and arcgis fig 11 as can be seen in fig 11a the temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 ranges from 6 6 10 1 mj mm hm 2 h 1 a 1 per year the annual rainfall erosivity in the qinling mountains and the loess plateau shows an upward trend the largest increase is found in huanxian and xifeng the trend of decreasing is found in the midstream and downstream of the wei river basin such as pucheng huaxian and huashan as presented in fig 11b the temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity in the basin shows the significance of p 0 1 and p 0 05 only in the areas around xifeng changwu and huanxian the trends in other areas are not significant 4 3 impacts of global climate change on rainfall erosivity we analyzed the wavelet coherence of rainfall erosivity and the main oscillations influencing the global climate change grinsted et al 2004 considering the temporal trend of the rainfall erosivity the analysis mainly focuses on those climate indices causing variation of rainfall erosivity in the recent two decades among all climate indices analyzed north atlantic oscillation nao shows a high correlation with the rainfall erosivity in wei river basin as shown in fig 12 rainfall erosivity in the basin shows a statistically significant positive correlation with the nao variation with a 3 6 years resonant period from 1997 to 2018 the arrow direction depicted in fig 12 indicates that the rainfall erosivity variation in the basin has a 9 months lag behind the nao variation in the period of 1997 2014 and change to an 11 months lag from 2015 4 4 implications for sustainable agriculture development since 1998 the chinese government had launched the grain for green program for soil and water conservation on the loess plateau sun et al 2013 positive environmental effects have been achieved through the large scale vegetation restoration however with the increasing of vegetation coverage the water requirement has also increased dramatically this directly causes the decrease of soil moisture and groundwater storage xie et al 2018 in the present study the temporal variation trend of the global wetness percentile was analyzed using the mann kendall test fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of the temporal trend of the surface soil moisture 0 2 cm the root zone soil moisture 1 m and the groundwater in the period of 2003 2020 as can be seen in fig 13 the soil moisture and the groundwater both have a decreasing trend in the loess plateau the change of soil moisture can influence the soil erodibility which is another controlling factor of soil erosion bryan et al 1989 larionov et al 2014 in this situation the increase in rainfall erosivity implies an increase in the potential risk of the soil erosion as shown in fig 14 the coverage with increased potential soil erosion risk in the loess plateau accounted for 13 97 of the basin among them the areas of arable land grassland and bare land most affected by soil erosion are 7229 10 024 and 5 km 2 respectively with the lower soil moisture and intense rainfall the topsoil of the arable land in the northern basin may be lost under the water erosion of the runoff resulting in a decline in land productivity and a reduction in food production world bank 2006 li et al 2015 check dam is an important soil and water conservation facility in the loess plateau according to the previous study as of 2014 59 037 check dams have been built in the loess plateau about 7336 of them were built in 1960s and are nearly dysfunctional dang et al 2020 nearly 43 8 of the medium size check dams are running in unsafe conditions dang et al 2020 in this situation the increase in rainfall erosivity in the loess plateau may increase the sediments content of surface runoff causing soil conservation facilities such as check dams to lose their ability to trap sediment early than their design life dang et al 2020 this will affect the sediment transport capacity of rivers in the basin change the water storage capacity of the reservoirs downstream reduce the amount of water resources and affect the sustainable development of agriculture in the basin as can be seen in fig 14 in the lower reaches of the basin many irrigation districts that use surface water as the irrigation source may be impacted by the increase of sediment load of the rivers excessive sediment erosion will shorten the life of the channels at the lower reaches of the channels the flow velocity will be reduced and excessive sediment deposits may block the channel leading to the low efficiency of water resources use and influencing the agricultural production regarding the potential issues discussed above it is necessary to take some measures to deal with potential hazards caused by the increase of rainfall erosivity such as soil loss land productivity decline and failure of soil and water conservation facilities suggestions are as follows a for areas with increased rainfall erosivity on the loess plateau the planting ratio of cover crops should be increased to reduce the erosion of topsoil by rainfall it should also enhance returning the crop residues to the field increase the content of soil organic matter and ensure land productivity world bank 2006 b besides water and soil conservation measures such as vegetation restoration building terraces and check dams implement land consolidation projects to increase the area of high quality arable land and increase food production li et al 2015 c strengthen the monitoring of water erosion and soil loss in the river basin improve the infrastructure of hydraulic engineering in the downstream irrigation districts of the basin and control the sediment content in the irrigation water d enhance the policy of grain for green program scientifically plan the water resource consumption and the vegetation restoration in short in view of the increasing trend of rainfall erosivity it should to adjust the control measures in time for soil erosion focus on the regional differences the systemic nature of disaster prevention and the harmony between society and nature eventually promote the sustainable development of the agriculture 5 conclusions in the present study the long term daily rainfall data of the wei river basin from 1969 to 2018 were collected the seasonal distribution characteristics of the rainfall and its erosivity were examined the temporal trends spatial distributions and changing patterns of the rainfall and the rainfall erosivity in the basin have been analyzed the conclusions can be summarized 1 the changing characteristics of rainfall show that the annual rainfall in wei river basin shows a spatial trend of decreasing from southeast to northwest the temporal trend of annual rainfall in the basin varies from 1 38 2 76 mm a 1 the annual rainfall in the western basin and the loess plateau showed an upward temporal trend and the temporal trend of decreasing is found in the middle and lower reaches of the wei river basin 2 the high rainfall erosivity in the basin is mainly observed in summer and autumn the peak of the rainfall erosivity is reached from july to august the mean annual rainfall erosivity gradually decreases from the southeast basin to the northwest basin the vertical spatial trend shows that the mean annual rainfall erosivity in the basin has obvious vertical spatial difference which changes under the influence of topography and geomorphology 3 the wavelet coherence shows that rainfall erosivity in the basin has a statistically significant positive correlation with the nao variation with a 3 6 years resonant period from 1997 to 2018 indicating global climate change has impacted the rainfall erosivity in the recent two decades 4 the increase in rainfall erosivity implies an increase in potential soil erosion risk in areas with increased rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin it should take appropriate measures to reduce the potential risk of soil erosion and ensure the sustainable development of regional agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
