14695,marine and lake snows play an important ecological role in aquatic systems and recent researches have also revealed their interactions with various pollutants in this paper the interaction of silver nanoparticles ag nps a typical nano pollutant with marine lake snow in the early formation stage was investigated by roller table experiments results indicated ag nps promoted the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs while inhibited the development of lake snow the promotion effect of agnps might be attributed to their oxidative dissolution into low toxic silver chloride complexes in seawater and the subsequent incorporation into marine snow which would enhance the rigidity and strength of larger flocs and favor the development of biomass conversely ag nps mainly existed in the form of colloidal nanoparticles in lake water and their strong antimicrobial effect suppressed the growths of biomass and lake snow in addition ag nps could also affect the microbial community of marine lake snow including impact on microbial diversity and elevation on abundances of extracellular polymeric substances eps synthesis genes and silver resistance genes this work has deepened our understanding of the fate and ecological effect of ag nps via the interaction with marine lake snow in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marine snow lake snow silver nanoparticles oxidative dissolution microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rapid development of nanotechnology nanomaterials are widely applied in various fields of production and life due to their unique properties babbitt and moore 2018 cai et al 2018 inevitably a large amount of engineered nanomaterials enms has appeared as new pollutants with their unintentional release into the environment giese et al 2018 keller and lazareva 2014 consequently the environmental fate ecological effects and health risks of enms have attracted increasing attention from scientists all over the world sharma et al 2015 zhao et al 2021 silver nanoparticles ag nps are one of the most used enms due to their good catalytic optical sensing antiviral and antibacterial properties liu et al 2020 sharma et al 2015 they are extensively used in medical devices and supplies and consumer products deshmukh et al 2019 yue et al 2019 and even used in agriculture to improve seeds zhou et al 2022 however the widespread use of ag nps has led to increasing apprehension regarding their release into the environment and associated potential threat to the ecosystem tortella et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the water body is the final reservoir of most pollutants including ag nps the concentration of ag nps in natural waters ranges from ng l to μg l with great variations in different locations jiménez lamana and slaveykova 2016 moreno garrido et al 2015 in addition to enms source the aquatic environment can generate large amounts of natural ag nps through the reduction of silver ions by natural organic matter nom liu et al 2020 sharma et al 2015 increasing studies have focused on the migration transformation fate and ecotoxicity of ag nps in aquatic environments ellis et al 2016 wang et al 2020 in marine environments there are large amounts of mucilaginous and amorphous flocculent aggregates called marine snow whose composition are complex including inorganic mineral particles bacterial mucilage thin shelled phytoplankton and fecal pellets from plankton etc alldredge and silver 1988 fu et al 2014 early researches recognized the physical coagulation and phytoplankton activity as the main drives for the formation of marine snow and different types of marine snows were formed such as larvacean diatom dinoflagellate fecal microbial and miscellaneous marine snows alldredge 1998 passow 2016 recent studies have indicated the microbial activity and their secreted extracellular polymeric substances eps significantly promote the formation of marine snow fu et al 2014 passow et al 2012 marine snow plays a very important role in the ocean such as providing patchiness for the distribution of nutrients and biological communities turner 2015 accelerating the vertical transport of particulate matter in the ocean alldredge and silver 1988 and providing important food sources for marine organisms turner 2015 analogously similar flocculent aggregates can also be formed in the turbulent lake environment called lake snow ahmmed et al 2021 hans peter et al 2003 comparatively the information on lake snow is not well documented in fact the turbulent lake environment formed by wind and waves can promote collision and aggregation between particles zhou et al 2015 which provides enough physical shear forces for the formation of lake snow unfortunately the scientific community is not focusing enough attention toward lake snow in addition to the ecological function of marine lake snow recent researches have revealed the interaction between marine lake snow and various pollutants for instance after the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2010 numerous studies indicated the marine snow played a vital role in the weathering of spilled oil and the generated marine snow containing crude oil was called marine oil snow burd et al 2020 gregson et al 2021 a latest research showed the lake snow was capable of scavenging mercury ions and releasing produced methylmercury back into the water column gallorini and loizeau 2022 these studies make people realize that marine lake snow is also involved in the degradation and transformation of pollutants in aquatic environments and has an important impact on the biogeochemical cycle of related elements the widespread coexistence of ag nps and marine lake snow in aquatic environments makes the research of their interaction indispensable the previous study indicated that ag nps could inhibit the formation of marine snow at the initial stage in which the key and straight microbial factor was the suppression on development of biomass dang et al 2022 however the information about the interaction between ag nps and the formed marine snow has been not known and in particular the physiochemical change and partition between solid liquid phase of ag nps and the resulting impact on the environmental fate of ag nps have not been revealed in addition the different characteristics of seawater and freshwater will affect the aggregation sedimentation and dissolution of ag nps and the subsequent interaction with marine lake snow and this issue has not been addressed to this end the interaction of ag nps with marine lake snow in the early formation stage was investigated in this study the distinct fates of ag nps in seawater and lake water and subsequently opposite effects on the development of marine lake snow and microbial community were revealed and clarified 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents seawater and lake water were collected from the east china sea and the donghu lake wuhan china respectively and their basic physicochemical properties are summarized in table s1 the seawater was collected from the coast of

microbial community based on biocyc and kegg databases 3 results 3 1 effect of ag nps on development of marine lake snow as shown in fig 1 marine lake snows were successfully generated in roller table experiments before starting the experiment the water samples were filtered with filter paper to eliminate the influence of impurities such as suspended particles and phytoplankton cells therefore the generated flocs could be ascribed to microbial marine lake snow due to the origin from the activities of microorganisms dang et al 2022 inspecting the dynamics of marine lake snow formation obvious flocs appeared in both seawater and lake water after 4 days of rolling fig 1a which was in line with our previous observation dang et al 2022 in group ⅰ without the addition of ag nps approximately 517 51 particles of tiny flocs appeared fig 1b and some of them aggregated to form rod shaped agglomerates with a length of 3 8 mm on day 4 which gradually dissipated to form fibrous flocs of 3 mm on day 5 from day 10 to 15 the relatively larger flocs were gradually split into smaller ones and meanwhile the floc number was increased to the maximum of 3126 47 fig 1b and the vmd of flocs was decreased to the minimum of 0 49 0 04 mm fig 1c by day 20 the mean floc size increased slightly and the floc number decreased mildly however the vt of marine snow kept the growth trend and gradually increased from 27 63 mm3 on day 4 to 108 87 mm3 on day 20 fig 1d interestingly after the addition of 100 μg l ag nps on the fourth day group ⅱ marine snow aggregated rapidly and grew into larger rod shaped agglomerates 10 mm within 1 day fig 1a accompanied by sharply decreasing floc number from 983 15 to 283 26 fig 1b it was easy to get the conclusion from the photographs of marine snows on day 5 20 that the addition of ag nps significantly intensified the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs and slowed their dissipation there were still many rod shaped agglomerates 3 6 mm at the end of roller experiments on day 20 moreover the vt of marine snow in group ii was always greater than in group i therefore ag nps did not exhibit the expected inhibitory effect on the development of marine snow but instead promoted the accumulation of larger flocs the development of lake snow in group iii showed a similar trend as the marine snow in group i that was tiny flocs aggregated first and then broke during the 20 day roller table experiments fig 1a however the floc number and vt of lake snow were smaller than those of marine snow fig 1b and d moreover larger flake flocs 1 3 mm did not appear in the lake water until the 10th day from day 15 to 20 the floc number and vmd of lake snow increased from 1025 47 to 1319 83 fig 1b and from 0 74 0 10 to 0 62 0 16 fig 1c respectively unlike the case of marine snow the addition of ag nps showed a significantly inhibitory effect on the development of lake snow in group iv the floc number was reduced from 870 10 on day 4 to 346 20 on day 20 fig 1b and the vt of lake snow was decreased from 23 33 mm3 on day 4 to 11 7 mm3 on day 20 fig 1d in addition the lake water in group iv showed the tyndall effect and an obvious brown light path was observed with the incident visible light fig 1a which was resulted from the light scattering by colloidal particles of ag nps tamari et al 2011 3 2 fate of ag nps in marine lake snow suspension the opposite effects of ag nps on the development of marine snow and lake snow drive us to explore the fate of ag nps in seawater and lake water as well as the interaction with marine lake snow the tyndall effect observed in lake water group iv indicated that there were many ag nps in the lake water fig 1a while no tyndall effect was observed in the seawater group ii suggesting the state of ag nps might be changed in the seawater therefore we monitored the dissolution of ag nps during 20 day roller table experiments as shown in fig 2 a the background concentration of silver ion ag was 26 23 and 0 06 μg l in seawater and lake water respectively after adding the ag nps suspension in groups ii and iv the concentration of ag in the water phase increased sharply it is obvious that the release of ag was much stronger in seawater than in lake water during the whole experiments the average release rates of ag in seawater and lake water were 0 16 μg l h and 0 057 μg l h respectively according to the mass balance calculation 25 μg of ag nps was added into the seawater and lake water on day 4 after 20 day roller table experiments 19 44 μg 78 of added ag nps was dissolved in seawater and 5 56 μg 22 maintained the nanoparticle state for lake water only 6 81 μg 27 of ag nps was dissolved in water and most of ag nps 18 19 μg 73 was dispersed in the water phase the faster dissolution of ag nps in seawater could be ascribed to the quickly reacting of ag with chloride ions cl near the ag nps surface thio et al 2012 due to the violent dissolution of ag nps in seawater the transmission electron microscopy tem did not detect agglomerates of ag nps in marine snow in the range of 5 200 nm fig 2b instead many agglomerates of ag nps ranging from 20 to 200 nm were found in lake snow the mapping results in fig 2c also showed that these agglomerated nanoparticles in lake snow were indeed ag nps while the silver elements distributed in marine snow existed as either ag or dissolved silver in addition the richness in elements of carbon and nitrogen indicated the main component of marine lake snow was organic matter confirming the microbial origin of these flocs furthermore the results of xps spectra also showed that the content of silver element in marine snow was low and only a small amount of ag was detected fig 2d indicating the main state of silver in marine snow was ag on the contrary the content of silver element in lake snow was high and there were obvious characteristic peaks of ag0 and ag according to the peak area it can be roughly judged that the relative content of ag0 was higher than that of ag which is consistent with the aforementioned results of ag concentration fig 2a and tem with edx characterization fig 2b and 2c 3 3 effect of ag nps on microbial community in marine lake snow the development of biomass during 20 day roller table experiments was monitored by atp measurement as shown in fig 3 a the atp content typically showed a trend of first rising and then falling in the first half period of roller table experiments the formation of marine lake snow flocs significantly promoted the development of biomass which can be attributed to the enrichment of microbial populations by particulate organic matter bochdansky et al 2017 however in the second half period the nutrients available for microorganisms in the limited water samples were gradually exhausted which limited the further development of biomass the biomass in lake water group iii maximum atp content 995 19 10 16 mol ml was much higher than that in seawater group i maximum atp content 125 12 10 16 mol ml which might be determined by the relatively higher organic matter in lake water table s1 surprisingly after adding 100 µg l ag nps into seawater on day 4 the atp content was significantly increased in group ii maximum atp content 378 9 10 16 mol ml in comparison to that in group i fig 3a instead of falling as expected this phenomenon may be related to the promotion of ag nps for the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs fig 1 which provided a relatively independent micro environment for the microbial growth against the bactericidal activity of silver in turn the proliferation of microorganisms further favored the development of marine snow flocs in lake water the addition of ag nps resulted in a remarkable decline of biomass in group iv maximum atp content 173 21 10 16 mol ml and the bactericidal activity of ag nps and ag played the key role the effect of ag nps on the highly resolved structure of microbial community in marine lake snow was further investigated by pacbio 16s rrna gene full length sequencing a total of 130 616 quality sequences were obtained from 10 samples ranging from 9932 to 20 321 in each sample the high good s coverage 0 93 1 table s2 as well as the rarefaction curves rank abundance curve and species accumulation curve fig s2 indicated a good sequencing depth and the results could reflect the real microbial community overall the diversity indexes in group i were slightly higher than those in group iii and all showed an increasing trend with time table s2 the addition of ag nps in groups ii and iv first increased the microbial diversity on day 5 but decreased the diversity at the end of experiments on day 20 this implied ag nps affected the structure of microbial community the pca plot fig 3b is used to represent the similarity of community structure between samples and it showed the microbial community structure in marine snow had a large difference with that in lake snow moreover during the 20 day roller table experiments the microbial community in lake snow showed a larger differentiation relative to that in marine snow ag nps seemed to promote the differentiation in marine snow while they suppressed the differentiation in lake snow the distance heatmap between samples fig s3 based on bray curtis distance also supported these findings fig 3c e showed the profile of microbial community at phylum genus and species levels the unclassified taxa only accounted for 3 99 9 28 indicating the highly resolved structure of microbial community was obtained by pacbio sequencing the composition of microbial community showed a large disparity between marine and lake snows for instance the predominant genera in marine snow were marinobacter 1 21 52 polycyclovorans 0 42 13 23 alcanivorax 0 17 6 62 methylophaga 1 30 6 09 and litorilinea 0 74 5 71 fig s4a while the predominant genera in lake snow were sphingobium 5 08 35 18 gimesia 5 08 35 18 pseudomonas 0 18 15 93 reyranella 1 23 8 42 and luteitalea 1 91 5 76 fig s4b the dominance of ocean origin microbes e g marinobacter topel et al 2019 in marine snow demonstrated the marine microbial ecology the addition of ag nps had greatly changed microbial composition in marine lake snow the hierarchical cluster analysis fig 3c e indicated ag nps promoted the disparities of community compositions in marine snow while concentrated the dissimilarity in lake snow which agreed with the pca analysis fig 3b inspecting the genus composition fig 3d the expanding change in marine snow by ag nps might be related to the promotion on resistant microbes e g marinobacter and the contracting change in lake snow would be attributed to the decrease of sensitive microbes e g sphingobium for the function of microbial community fig 4 a shows the dominant picrust2 predicted pathways in each sample the detailed information for each pathway is summarized in table s3 the total abundance of the main metabolic pathways in the marine lake snow all showed a tendency to increase first and then decrease which was consistent with the development of biomass fig 3a however the coercion of ag nps on the microbial community in lake snow seemed to be violent the metabolic pathways of 3 hydroxyphenylacetate degradation pwy 4 hydroxyphenylacetate degradation arg polyamine syn superpathway of arginine and polyamine biosynthesis argornprost pwy arginine ornithine and proline interconversion aspasn pwy superpathway of l aspartate and l asparagine synthesis and ast pwy l arginine degradation ii ast pathway were all up regulated analysis on functional genes kegg orthologous groups kos found that some basic functional genes accounted for a relatively high proportion and determined the stability of the microbial community fig 4b such as k03088 rna polymerase sigma 70 factor which has been proven to respond to changes in the external environment by regulating the transcription of genes related to biological or abiotic stressors and improving the adaptability of bacteria woods and mcbride 2017 both cluster analysis fig 4b and pca analysis fig 4c showed that ag nps could increase the disparity of community function in marine snow while reduce the disparity in lake snow which agrees with the situations in community compositions fig 3b e this suggests to some extent the function is consistent with the species further the special functional genes associated with eps synthesis and silver resistance were analyzed fig 4d and e tables s4 and s5 the presence of ag nps elevated the relative abundance of eps synthesis related kos in marine lake snow fig 4d such as k02517 kdo2 lipid iva lauroyltransferase acyltransferase k00067 dtdp 4 dehydrorhamnose reductase k02536 udp 3 o 3 hydroxymyristoyl glucosamine n acyltransferase and k00748 lipid a disaccharide synthase the elevation of eps synthesis fuction induced by ag nps also implied that the secretion of eps was one of the survival means for microorganisms to cope with the threat of ag nps hajipour et al 2012 besides microorganisms numerous studies have also pointed out that enms can induce the release of eps from phytoplankton babakhani et al 2022 compared between groups i and iii the total abundance of silver resistance related kos was higher in marine snow than in lake snow fig 4d which may be related to the high background value of ag in seawater fig 2a the addition of ag nps had induced the elevation of some dominant silver resistance genes in marine lake snow such as k17686 p type cu transporter k15727 membrane fusion protein heavy metal efflux system k15725 outer membrane protein heavy metal efflux system k07233 copper resistance protein b and k07787 copper silver efflux system protein 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of ag nps on development of marine lake snow as shown in fig 1 ag nps exhibited a promoting effect on the development of marine snow while an inhibitory effect on the development of lake snow it is easy to understand the inhibition of lake snow development by ag nps the strong bactericidal effect of ag nps and the released ag resulted in violent suppression on the development of biomass fig 3a which play the key role for the formation of larger flocs in aquatic environments dang et al 2022 although the relative abundance of eps synthesis genes in lake snow had been increased fig 4d it was not enough to compensate for the large reduction of biomass as the main form of ag nps in lake water was still colloidal particles fig 1 and only 27 was dissolved into ag fig 2a the antimicrobial effect of ag nps was the dominant mechanism which was related to high oxidative stress on microbes induced by the reactive oxygen species ros generated by ag nps le ouay and stellacci 2015 however the opposite effect of ag nps on the development of marine snow could also be explained by the microbial activity the enhancement of biomass growth fig 3a and eps synthesis fig 4d favored the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs fig 1 this seemed to contradict the bactericidal activity of ag nps after inspecting on the state of ag nps it was found most of ag nps 78 were dissolved in seawater fig 2a the dissolution of ag nps in the aquatic environment is an oxidative process with the following stoichiometry gunsolus et al 2015 4 2 a g s 1 2 o 2 aq 2 h aq 2 ag aq h 2 o l typically the toxicity of ag should be stronger than ag nps croteau et al 2011 however due to the presence of large amounts of cl in seawater 5 30 g l table s1 the released ag would quickly react to form silver chloride agcl as follows li et al 2018 5 ag aq cl aq agc l aq the solubility of agcl is 1 93 mg l which is much higher than the added concentration of ag nps 100 μg l thus the formed agcl was still in dissolved state the toxicity of agcl is much less than that of ag nps or ag chen et al 2016 therefore the added ag nps did not exhibit the bactericidal effect in group ii due to their transformation to agcl in addition the abundance of silver resistance genes in seawater was relatively higher fig 4e owing to the high background concentration of silver fig 2a which made microbes in seawater more adaptable to silver stress the low toxicity of agcl may indicate silver has little impact on the development of marine snow but it cannot be explained the accumulation of larger flocs with the addition of ag nps fig 1 therefore we continue to discuss the distribution and state of silver as shown in fig 2b 2d mono valence silver ag i was evenly distributed in marine snow indicating ag i was well incorporated in the flocs of marine snow the incorporation of silver might enhance the rigidity and strength of larger flocs of marine snow to avoid the disintegration by the turbulent shear force many studies have confirmed that introducing silver into materials can enhance the rigidity and strength ghosh and maiti 1996 weidenmann et al 2009 the maintenance of larger flocs was conducive to biofilm formation and biomass development fig 3a in turn the growth of biomass would promote the accumulation of larger flocs and the development of marine snow fig 1 another question that needs to be clarified is whether the incorporated ag i would affect the aggregation of marine snow flocs due to the presence of large quantities of cl agcl would continue to react with cl to form soluble ag cl complexes agcl x 1 x li et al 2018 6 agc l aq x cl aq agcl x aq 1 x using visual minteq 3 1 software the silver species distribution in seawater was calculated as follows ag 0 035 agcl aq 5 10 agcl2 76 28 agcl3 2 18 58 as marine snow flocs generally carry net negative charges fu et al 2014 and the negatively charged agcl x 1 x would further enhance the negative charge on the surface of marine snow flocs which is unfavorable for the aggregation of flocs to evaluate the impact of electrostatic repulsion the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to calculate the total interaction energy vt h between marine snow flocs in group ii which included van der waals attraction va h and electrostatic double layer edl repulsion vr h the calculations were according to the following equations zhang et al 2022 7 v t h v a h v r h 8 v a h ar 12 h 1 bh λ ln 1 λ bh 9 v r h 2000 π r n a c s z 2 e 2 ζ 2 κ 2 k b t ln 1 e κ h 1 e κ h ln 1 e 2 κ h where a was the combined hamaker constant for marine snow interacting through water and the value was 4 0 10 20 kg m2 s2 lambert and variano 2016 b 5 32λ was the characteristic wavelength of the interaction with an often assumed value of 100 nm r was the radius of marine snow and the data could be found in table s6 h was separation distance between floc particles which was much smaller than their radius h r kb was the boltzmann constant with a value of 1 381 10 23 j l and t was the absolute temperature 298 15 k na was avogadro constant with a value of 6 022 10 23 cs was the electrolyte molar concentration mol l z was the valence of ion in the bulk suspension e was the electron charge 1 60 10 19c ζ was the electrical potential of marine snow table s6 κ was the debye huckel reciprocal length at approximately 25 c in aqueous solution 1 037 109 as shown in fig 5 the calculation results indicated the van der waals attraction dominated the total interaction energy between marine snow flocs in group ii therefore the electrostatic repulsion caused by negatively charged agcl x 1 x played a negligible role for the aggregation tendency of marine snow flocs alternatively the incorporation of ag i into marine snow maintained the larger flocs which is beneficial for the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs and the development of biomass 4 2 environmental implications for fate of ag nps this work showed that ag nps had different behavior and fate in the turbulent environments of seawater and lake water in seawater most of ag nps 78 were oxidatively dissolved into the aqueous phase mainly as agcl x 1 x the rest of ag nps 22 either existed in the form of very tiny nanoparticle 5 nm or was incorporated in marine snow as agcl x 1 x fig 2 therefore oxidative dissolution was the dominant behavior of ag nps in the marine turbulent environment which was driven by the reaction with cl in addition the used ag nps in this study were non coated and well dispersed and this is also an important reason for the rapid dissolution observed studies indicate the coating on ag nps could slow down the dissolution rates ho et al 2010 considering that most of enms are coated the enms could exist in the form of particles for a long time in the actual marine environment however in lake water a small part of ag nps 22 was dissolved and most of ag nps was still dispersed in the form of nanoparticles fig 2 moreover the particle size of ag nps had increased to varying degrees 20 200 nm indicating an aggregation behavior therefore ag nps could exist for a long time in the freshwater environment which has been proved by many studies garner and keller 2014 the aggregation and attachment on the lake snow would decrease the dissolution rate of ag nps garner and keller 2014 he et al 2013 compared with the marine environment ag nps would bring more risk in the freshwater environment due to their longer existence time stronger transport capacity and biological impacts 4 3 environmental implications for ecological effect of ag nps ag nps could inhibit the formation of marine snow at the initial stage dang et al 2022 but they could accumulate larger flocs by the interaction with formed marine snow fig 1 thus the influence of ag nps on marine snow is disparate in different development stages considering the wide distribution of marine snow in the ocean 0 100 particles per liter turner 2015 it seems that the interaction between ag nps and already formed marine snow is more universal the positive effect on the development of larger marine snow flocs could bring many benefits to the marine ecosystem such as enhancing the patchiness and promoting the vertical transport of particulate matter however the incorporation of silver in marine snow would also bring health risks to the food chain since marine snows are important food sources for zooplanktons and fishes turner 2015 for lake snow ag nps exhibited significant inhibition on the developments of flocs and biomass figs 1 and 3 moreover the high stability and attachment on lake snow fig 2 indicated ag nps had a greater negative impact on freshwater ecosystems although the negative effects of ag nps on freshwater systems have been widely reported previously ramzan et al 2022 this study has provided a new way of impact from the perspective of lake snow in addition the effect of ag nps on microbial diversity fig 3 eps synthesis genes fig 4d and silver resistance genes fig 4e in marine lake snow may also have important influences on aquatic ecosystems for instance the up regulation of eps synthesis genes would promote the transformation from free living bacteria to attached bacteria the attached bacteria were 10 to 100 times more active than free living bacteria crump et al 1999 thus accelerating the biogeochemical cycles turley and mackie 1994 in addition the up regulation of silver resistance genes and enrichment of silver resistant microbes may bring risks for the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args in the aquatic environment many studies have pointed out that there is a genetic linkage between silver and antibiotic resistance in bacteria alonso et al 2001 yuan et al 2019 a new study has found that marinobacter could significantly enrich args yang et al 2022 which was also enriched in marine snow as a silver resistant genus by ag nps fig 3d 5 conclusions through the roller table experiment this study explored the distinct effects of ag nps on the development of marine lake snow in the early formation stage that is ag nps accumulated larger marine snow flocs while inhibited the development of lake snow which was resulted from the different interface behaviors of ag nps in seawater 78 of ag nps was oxidatively dissolved to produce agcl x 1 x which weakened the bactericidal ability moreover the even incorporation of ag i into marine snow would enhance the rigidity and strength of marine snow which favored the maintenance of larger flocs and growth of biomass however most of ag nps 73 in lake water existed as aggregated nanoparticles 20 200 nm and the strong bactericidal activity of ag nps would inhibit the developments of biomass and lake snow the microbial community in marine lake snow was also significantly affected by ag nps ag nps promoted the disparities of community compositions in marine snow while concentrated the dissimilarity in lake snow under the stress of ag nps the abundance of eps synthesis genes in marine lake snow showed an increasing trend indicating that eps secretion was one of the survival means for microbes to cope with the threat of ag nps in addition ag nps elevated the abundance of silver resistance genes in marine lake snow which would bring the spread risk of microbial resistance genes

14695,marine and lake snows play an important ecological role in aquatic systems and recent researches have also revealed their interactions with various pollutants in this paper the interaction of silver nanoparticles ag nps a typical nano pollutant with marine lake snow in the early formation stage was investigated by roller table experiments results indicated ag nps promoted the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs while inhibited the development of lake snow the promotion effect of agnps might be attributed to their oxidative dissolution into low toxic silver chloride complexes in seawater and the subsequent incorporation into marine snow which would enhance the rigidity and strength of larger flocs and favor the development of biomass conversely ag nps mainly existed in the form of colloidal nanoparticles in lake water and their strong antimicrobial effect suppressed the growths of biomass and lake snow in addition ag nps could also affect the microbial community of marine lake snow including impact on microbial diversity and elevation on abundances of extracellular polymeric substances eps synthesis genes and silver resistance genes this work has deepened our understanding of the fate and ecological effect of ag nps via the interaction with marine lake snow in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marine snow lake snow silver nanoparticles oxidative dissolution microbial community data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rapid development of nanotechnology nanomaterials are widely applied in various fields of production and life due to their unique properties babbitt and moore 2018 cai et al 2018 inevitably a large amount of engineered nanomaterials enms has appeared as new pollutants with their unintentional release into the environment giese et al 2018 keller and lazareva 2014 consequently the environmental fate ecological effects and health risks of enms have attracted increasing attention from scientists all over the world sharma et al 2015 zhao et al 2021 silver nanoparticles ag nps are one of the most used enms due to their good catalytic optical sensing antiviral and antibacterial properties liu et al 2020 sharma et al 2015 they are extensively used in medical devices and supplies and consumer products deshmukh et al 2019 yue et al 2019 and even used in agriculture to improve seeds zhou et al 2022 however the widespread use of ag nps has led to increasing apprehension regarding their release into the environment and associated potential threat to the ecosystem tortella et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the water body is the final reservoir of most pollutants including ag nps the concentration of ag nps in natural waters ranges from ng l to μg l with great variations in different locations jiménez lamana and slaveykova 2016 moreno garrido et al 2015 in addition to enms source the aquatic environment can generate large amounts of natural ag nps through the reduction of silver ions by natural organic matter nom liu et al 2020 sharma et al 2015 increasing studies have focused on the migration transformation fate and ecotoxicity of ag nps in aquatic environments ellis et al 2016 wang et al 2020 in marine environments there are large amounts of mucilaginous and amorphous flocculent aggregates called marine snow whose composition are complex including inorganic mineral particles bacterial mucilage thin shelled phytoplankton and fecal pellets from plankton etc alldredge and silver 1988 fu et al 2014 early researches recognized the physical coagulation and phytoplankton activity as the main drives for the formation of marine snow and different types of marine snows were formed such as larvacean diatom dinoflagellate fecal microbial and miscellaneous marine snows alldredge 1998 passow 2016 recent studies have indicated the microbial activity and their secreted extracellular polymeric substances eps significantly promote the formation of marine snow fu et al 2014 passow et al 2012 marine snow plays a very important role in the ocean such as providing patchiness for the distribution of nutrients and biological communities turner 2015 accelerating the vertical transport of particulate matter in the ocean alldredge and silver 1988 and providing important food sources for marine organisms turner 2015 analogously similar flocculent aggregates can also be formed in the turbulent lake environment called lake snow ahmmed et al 2021 hans peter et al 2003 comparatively the information on lake snow is not well documented in fact the turbulent lake environment formed by wind and waves can promote collision and aggregation between particles zhou et al 2015 which provides enough physical shear forces for the formation of lake snow unfortunately the scientific community is not focusing enough attention toward lake snow in addition to the ecological function of marine lake snow recent researches have revealed the interaction between marine lake snow and various pollutants for instance after the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2010 numerous studies indicated the marine snow played a vital role in the weathering of spilled oil and the generated marine snow containing crude oil was called marine oil snow burd et al 2020 gregson et al 2021 a latest research showed the lake snow was capable of scavenging mercury ions and releasing produced methylmercury back into the water column gallorini and loizeau 2022 these studies make people realize that marine lake snow is also involved in the degradation and transformation of pollutants in aquatic environments and has an important impact on the biogeochemical cycle of related elements the widespread coexistence of ag nps and marine lake snow in aquatic environments makes the research of their interaction indispensable the previous study indicated that ag nps could inhibit the formation of marine snow at the initial stage in which the key and straight microbial factor was the suppression on development of biomass dang et al 2022 however the information about the interaction between ag nps and the formed marine snow has been not known and in particular the physiochemical change and partition between solid liquid phase of ag nps and the resulting impact on the environmental fate of ag nps have not been revealed in addition the different characteristics of seawater and freshwater will affect the aggregation sedimentation and dissolution of ag nps and the subsequent interaction with marine lake snow and this issue has not been addressed to this end the interaction of ag nps with marine lake snow in the early formation stage was investigated in this study the distinct fates of ag nps in seawater and lake water and subsequently opposite effects on the development of marine lake snow and microbial community were revealed and clarified 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents seawater and lake water were collected from the east china sea and the donghu lake wuhan china respectively and their basic physicochemical properties are summarized in table s1 the seawater was collected from the coast of

microbial community based on biocyc and kegg databases 3 results 3 1 effect of ag nps on development of marine lake snow as shown in fig 1 marine lake snows were successfully generated in roller table experiments before starting the experiment the water samples were filtered with filter paper to eliminate the influence of impurities such as suspended particles and phytoplankton cells therefore the generated flocs could be ascribed to microbial marine lake snow due to the origin from the activities of microorganisms dang et al 2022 inspecting the dynamics of marine lake snow formation obvious flocs appeared in both seawater and lake water after 4 days of rolling fig 1a which was in line with our previous observation dang et al 2022 in group ⅰ without the addition of ag nps approximately 517 51 particles of tiny flocs appeared fig 1b and some of them aggregated to form rod shaped agglomerates with a length of 3 8 mm on day 4 which gradually dissipated to form fibrous flocs of 3 mm on day 5 from day 10 to 15 the relatively larger flocs were gradually split into smaller ones and meanwhile the floc number was increased to the maximum of 3126 47 fig 1b and the vmd of flocs was decreased to the minimum of 0 49 0 04 mm fig 1c by day 20 the mean floc size increased slightly and the floc number decreased mildly however the vt of marine snow kept the growth trend and gradually increased from 27 63 mm3 on day 4 to 108 87 mm3 on day 20 fig 1d interestingly after the addition of 100 μg l ag nps on the fourth day group ⅱ marine snow aggregated rapidly and grew into larger rod shaped agglomerates 10 mm within 1 day fig 1a accompanied by sharply decreasing floc number from 983 15 to 283 26 fig 1b it was easy to get the conclusion from the photographs of marine snows on day 5 20 that the addition of ag nps significantly intensified the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs and slowed their dissipation there were still many rod shaped agglomerates 3 6 mm at the end of roller experiments on day 20 moreover the vt of marine snow in group ii was always greater than in group i therefore ag nps did not exhibit the expected inhibitory effect on the development of marine snow but instead promoted the accumulation of larger flocs the development of lake snow in group iii showed a similar trend as the marine snow in group i that was tiny flocs aggregated first and then broke during the 20 day roller table experiments fig 1a however the floc number and vt of lake snow were smaller than those of marine snow fig 1b and d moreover larger flake flocs 1 3 mm did not appear in the lake water until the 10th day from day 15 to 20 the floc number and vmd of lake snow increased from 1025 47 to 1319 83 fig 1b and from 0 74 0 10 to 0 62 0 16 fig 1c respectively unlike the case of marine snow the addition of ag nps showed a significantly inhibitory effect on the development of lake snow in group iv the floc number was reduced from 870 10 on day 4 to 346 20 on day 20 fig 1b and the vt of lake snow was decreased from 23 33 mm3 on day 4 to 11 7 mm3 on day 20 fig 1d in addition the lake water in group iv showed the tyndall effect and an obvious brown light path was observed with the incident visible light fig 1a which was resulted from the light scattering by colloidal particles of ag nps tamari et al 2011 3 2 fate of ag nps in marine lake snow suspension the opposite effects of ag nps on the development of marine snow and lake snow drive us to explore the fate of ag nps in seawater and lake water as well as the interaction with marine lake snow the tyndall effect observed in lake water group iv indicated that there were many ag nps in the lake water fig 1a while no tyndall effect was observed in the seawater group ii suggesting the state of ag nps might be changed in the seawater therefore we monitored the dissolution of ag nps during 20 day roller table experiments as shown in fig 2 a the background concentration of silver ion ag was 26 23 and 0 06 μg l in seawater and lake water respectively after adding the ag nps suspension in groups ii and iv the concentration of ag in the water phase increased sharply it is obvious that the release of ag was much stronger in seawater than in lake water during the whole experiments the average release rates of ag in seawater and lake water were 0 16 μg l h and 0 057 μg l h respectively according to the mass balance calculation 25 μg of ag nps was added into the seawater and lake water on day 4 after 20 day roller table experiments 19 44 μg 78 of added ag nps was dissolved in seawater and 5 56 μg 22 maintained the nanoparticle state for lake water only 6 81 μg 27 of ag nps was dissolved in water and most of ag nps 18 19 μg 73 was dispersed in the water phase the faster dissolution of ag nps in seawater could be ascribed to the quickly reacting of ag with chloride ions cl near the ag nps surface thio et al 2012 due to the violent dissolution of ag nps in seawater the transmission electron microscopy tem did not detect agglomerates of ag nps in marine snow in the range of 5 200 nm fig 2b instead many agglomerates of ag nps ranging from 20 to 200 nm were found in lake snow the mapping results in fig 2c also showed that these agglomerated nanoparticles in lake snow were indeed ag nps while the silver elements distributed in marine snow existed as either ag or dissolved silver in addition the richness in elements of carbon and nitrogen indicated the main component of marine lake snow was organic matter confirming the microbial origin of these flocs furthermore the results of xps spectra also showed that the content of silver element in marine snow was low and only a small amount of ag was detected fig 2d indicating the main state of silver in marine snow was ag on the contrary the content of silver element in lake snow was high and there were obvious characteristic peaks of ag0 and ag according to the peak area it can be roughly judged that the relative content of ag0 was higher than that of ag which is consistent with the aforementioned results of ag concentration fig 2a and tem with edx characterization fig 2b and 2c 3 3 effect of ag nps on microbial community in marine lake snow the development of biomass during 20 day roller table experiments was monitored by atp measurement as shown in fig 3 a the atp content typically showed a trend of first rising and then falling in the first half period of roller table experiments the formation of marine lake snow flocs significantly promoted the development of biomass which can be attributed to the enrichment of microbial populations by particulate organic matter bochdansky et al 2017 however in the second half period the nutrients available for microorganisms in the limited water samples were gradually exhausted which limited the further development of biomass the biomass in lake water group iii maximum atp content 995 19 10 16 mol ml was much higher than that in seawater group i maximum atp content 125 12 10 16 mol ml which might be determined by the relatively higher organic matter in lake water table s1 surprisingly after adding 100 µg l ag nps into seawater on day 4 the atp content was significantly increased in group ii maximum atp content 378 9 10 16 mol ml in comparison to that in group i fig 3a instead of falling as expected this phenomenon may be related to the promotion of ag nps for the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs fig 1 which provided a relatively independent micro environment for the microbial growth against the bactericidal activity of silver in turn the proliferation of microorganisms further favored the development of marine snow flocs in lake water the addition of ag nps resulted in a remarkable decline of biomass in group iv maximum atp content 173 21 10 16 mol ml and the bactericidal activity of ag nps and ag played the key role the effect of ag nps on the highly resolved structure of microbial community in marine lake snow was further investigated by pacbio 16s rrna gene full length sequencing a total of 130 616 quality sequences were obtained from 10 samples ranging from 9932 to 20 321 in each sample the high good s coverage 0 93 1 table s2 as well as the rarefaction curves rank abundance curve and species accumulation curve fig s2 indicated a good sequencing depth and the results could reflect the real microbial community overall the diversity indexes in group i were slightly higher than those in group iii and all showed an increasing trend with time table s2 the addition of ag nps in groups ii and iv first increased the microbial diversity on day 5 but decreased the diversity at the end of experiments on day 20 this implied ag nps affected the structure of microbial community the pca plot fig 3b is used to represent the similarity of community structure between samples and it showed the microbial community structure in marine snow had a large difference with that in lake snow moreover during the 20 day roller table experiments the microbial community in lake snow showed a larger differentiation relative to that in marine snow ag nps seemed to promote the differentiation in marine snow while they suppressed the differentiation in lake snow the distance heatmap between samples fig s3 based on bray curtis distance also supported these findings fig 3c e showed the profile of microbial community at phylum genus and species levels the unclassified taxa only accounted for 3 99 9 28 indicating the highly resolved structure of microbial community was obtained by pacbio sequencing the composition of microbial community showed a large disparity between marine and lake snows for instance the predominant genera in marine snow were marinobacter 1 21 52 polycyclovorans 0 42 13 23 alcanivorax 0 17 6 62 methylophaga 1 30 6 09 and litorilinea 0 74 5 71 fig s4a while the predominant genera in lake snow were sphingobium 5 08 35 18 gimesia 5 08 35 18 pseudomonas 0 18 15 93 reyranella 1 23 8 42 and luteitalea 1 91 5 76 fig s4b the dominance of ocean origin microbes e g marinobacter topel et al 2019 in marine snow demonstrated the marine microbial ecology the addition of ag nps had greatly changed microbial composition in marine lake snow the hierarchical cluster analysis fig 3c e indicated ag nps promoted the disparities of community compositions in marine snow while concentrated the dissimilarity in lake snow which agreed with the pca analysis fig 3b inspecting the genus composition fig 3d the expanding change in marine snow by ag nps might be related to the promotion on resistant microbes e g marinobacter and the contracting change in lake snow would be attributed to the decrease of sensitive microbes e g sphingobium for the function of microbial community fig 4 a shows the dominant picrust2 predicted pathways in each sample the detailed information for each pathway is summarized in table s3 the total abundance of the main metabolic pathways in the marine lake snow all showed a tendency to increase first and then decrease which was consistent with the development of biomass fig 3a however the coercion of ag nps on the microbial community in lake snow seemed to be violent the metabolic pathways of 3 hydroxyphenylacetate degradation pwy 4 hydroxyphenylacetate degradation arg polyamine syn superpathway of arginine and polyamine biosynthesis argornprost pwy arginine ornithine and proline interconversion aspasn pwy superpathway of l aspartate and l asparagine synthesis and ast pwy l arginine degradation ii ast pathway were all up regulated analysis on functional genes kegg orthologous groups kos found that some basic functional genes accounted for a relatively high proportion and determined the stability of the microbial community fig 4b such as k03088 rna polymerase sigma 70 factor which has been proven to respond to changes in the external environment by regulating the transcription of genes related to biological or abiotic stressors and improving the adaptability of bacteria woods and mcbride 2017 both cluster analysis fig 4b and pca analysis fig 4c showed that ag nps could increase the disparity of community function in marine snow while reduce the disparity in lake snow which agrees with the situations in community compositions fig 3b e this suggests to some extent the function is consistent with the species further the special functional genes associated with eps synthesis and silver resistance were analyzed fig 4d and e tables s4 and s5 the presence of ag nps elevated the relative abundance of eps synthesis related kos in marine lake snow fig 4d such as k02517 kdo2 lipid iva lauroyltransferase acyltransferase k00067 dtdp 4 dehydrorhamnose reductase k02536 udp 3 o 3 hydroxymyristoyl glucosamine n acyltransferase and k00748 lipid a disaccharide synthase the elevation of eps synthesis fuction induced by ag nps also implied that the secretion of eps was one of the survival means for microorganisms to cope with the threat of ag nps hajipour et al 2012 besides microorganisms numerous studies have also pointed out that enms can induce the release of eps from phytoplankton babakhani et al 2022 compared between groups i and iii the total abundance of silver resistance related kos was higher in marine snow than in lake snow fig 4d which may be related to the high background value of ag in seawater fig 2a the addition of ag nps had induced the elevation of some dominant silver resistance genes in marine lake snow such as k17686 p type cu transporter k15727 membrane fusion protein heavy metal efflux system k15725 outer membrane protein heavy metal efflux system k07233 copper resistance protein b and k07787 copper silver efflux system protein 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of ag nps on development of marine lake snow as shown in fig 1 ag nps exhibited a promoting effect on the development of marine snow while an inhibitory effect on the development of lake snow it is easy to understand the inhibition of lake snow development by ag nps the strong bactericidal effect of ag nps and the released ag resulted in violent suppression on the development of biomass fig 3a which play the key role for the formation of larger flocs in aquatic environments dang et al 2022 although the relative abundance of eps synthesis genes in lake snow had been increased fig 4d it was not enough to compensate for the large reduction of biomass as the main form of ag nps in lake water was still colloidal particles fig 1 and only 27 was dissolved into ag fig 2a the antimicrobial effect of ag nps was the dominant mechanism which was related to high oxidative stress on microbes induced by the reactive oxygen species ros generated by ag nps le ouay and stellacci 2015 however the opposite effect of ag nps on the development of marine snow could also be explained by the microbial activity the enhancement of biomass growth fig 3a and eps synthesis fig 4d favored the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs fig 1 this seemed to contradict the bactericidal activity of ag nps after inspecting on the state of ag nps it was found most of ag nps 78 were dissolved in seawater fig 2a the dissolution of ag nps in the aquatic environment is an oxidative process with the following stoichiometry gunsolus et al 2015 4 2 a g s 1 2 o 2 aq 2 h aq 2 ag aq h 2 o l typically the toxicity of ag should be stronger than ag nps croteau et al 2011 however due to the presence of large amounts of cl in seawater 5 30 g l table s1 the released ag would quickly react to form silver chloride agcl as follows li et al 2018 5 ag aq cl aq agc l aq the solubility of agcl is 1 93 mg l which is much higher than the added concentration of ag nps 100 μg l thus the formed agcl was still in dissolved state the toxicity of agcl is much less than that of ag nps or ag chen et al 2016 therefore the added ag nps did not exhibit the bactericidal effect in group ii due to their transformation to agcl in addition the abundance of silver resistance genes in seawater was relatively higher fig 4e owing to the high background concentration of silver fig 2a which made microbes in seawater more adaptable to silver stress the low toxicity of agcl may indicate silver has little impact on the development of marine snow but it cannot be explained the accumulation of larger flocs with the addition of ag nps fig 1 therefore we continue to discuss the distribution and state of silver as shown in fig 2b 2d mono valence silver ag i was evenly distributed in marine snow indicating ag i was well incorporated in the flocs of marine snow the incorporation of silver might enhance the rigidity and strength of larger flocs of marine snow to avoid the disintegration by the turbulent shear force many studies have confirmed that introducing silver into materials can enhance the rigidity and strength ghosh and maiti 1996 weidenmann et al 2009 the maintenance of larger flocs was conducive to biofilm formation and biomass development fig 3a in turn the growth of biomass would promote the accumulation of larger flocs and the development of marine snow fig 1 another question that needs to be clarified is whether the incorporated ag i would affect the aggregation of marine snow flocs due to the presence of large quantities of cl agcl would continue to react with cl to form soluble ag cl complexes agcl x 1 x li et al 2018 6 agc l aq x cl aq agcl x aq 1 x using visual minteq 3 1 software the silver species distribution in seawater was calculated as follows ag 0 035 agcl aq 5 10 agcl2 76 28 agcl3 2 18 58 as marine snow flocs generally carry net negative charges fu et al 2014 and the negatively charged agcl x 1 x would further enhance the negative charge on the surface of marine snow flocs which is unfavorable for the aggregation of flocs to evaluate the impact of electrostatic repulsion the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was used to calculate the total interaction energy vt h between marine snow flocs in group ii which included van der waals attraction va h and electrostatic double layer edl repulsion vr h the calculations were according to the following equations zhang et al 2022 7 v t h v a h v r h 8 v a h ar 12 h 1 bh λ ln 1 λ bh 9 v r h 2000 π r n a c s z 2 e 2 ζ 2 κ 2 k b t ln 1 e κ h 1 e κ h ln 1 e 2 κ h where a was the combined hamaker constant for marine snow interacting through water and the value was 4 0 10 20 kg m2 s2 lambert and variano 2016 b 5 32λ was the characteristic wavelength of the interaction with an often assumed value of 100 nm r was the radius of marine snow and the data could be found in table s6 h was separation distance between floc particles which was much smaller than their radius h r kb was the boltzmann constant with a value of 1 381 10 23 j l and t was the absolute temperature 298 15 k na was avogadro constant with a value of 6 022 10 23 cs was the electrolyte molar concentration mol l z was the valence of ion in the bulk suspension e was the electron charge 1 60 10 19c ζ was the electrical potential of marine snow table s6 κ was the debye huckel reciprocal length at approximately 25 c in aqueous solution 1 037 109 as shown in fig 5 the calculation results indicated the van der waals attraction dominated the total interaction energy between marine snow flocs in group ii therefore the electrostatic repulsion caused by negatively charged agcl x 1 x played a negligible role for the aggregation tendency of marine snow flocs alternatively the incorporation of ag i into marine snow maintained the larger flocs which is beneficial for the accumulation of larger marine snow flocs and the development of biomass 4 2 environmental implications for fate of ag nps this work showed that ag nps had different behavior and fate in the turbulent environments of seawater and lake water in seawater most of ag nps 78 were oxidatively dissolved into the aqueous phase mainly as agcl x 1 x the rest of ag nps 22 either existed in the form of very tiny nanoparticle 5 nm or was incorporated in marine snow as agcl x 1 x fig 2 therefore oxidative dissolution was the dominant behavior of ag nps in the marine turbulent environment which was driven by the reaction with cl in addition the used ag nps in this study were non coated and well dispersed and this is also an important reason for the rapid dissolution observed studies indicate the coating on ag nps could slow down the dissolution rates ho et al 2010 considering that most of enms are coated the enms could exist in the form of particles for a long time in the actual marine environment however in lake water a small part of ag nps 22 was dissolved and most of ag nps was still dispersed in the form of nanoparticles fig 2 moreover the particle size of ag nps had increased to varying degrees 20 200 nm indicating an aggregation behavior therefore ag nps could exist for a long time in the freshwater environment which has been proved by many studies garner and keller 2014 the aggregation and attachment on the lake snow would decrease the dissolution rate of ag nps garner and keller 2014 he et al 2013 compared with the marine environment ag nps would bring more risk in the freshwater environment due to their longer existence time stronger transport capacity and biological impacts 4 3 environmental implications for ecological effect of ag nps ag nps could inhibit the formation of marine snow at the initial stage dang et al 2022 but they could accumulate larger flocs by the interaction with formed marine snow fig 1 thus the influence of ag nps on marine snow is disparate in different development stages considering the wide distribution of marine snow in the ocean 0 100 particles per liter turner 2015 it seems that the interaction between ag nps and already formed marine snow is more universal the positive effect on the development of larger marine snow flocs could bring many benefits to the marine ecosystem such as enhancing the patchiness and promoting the vertical transport of particulate matter however the incorporation of silver in marine snow would also bring health risks to the food chain since marine snows are important food sources for zooplanktons and fishes turner 2015 for lake snow ag nps exhibited significant inhibition on the developments of flocs and biomass figs 1 and 3 moreover the high stability and attachment on lake snow fig 2 indicated ag nps had a greater negative impact on freshwater ecosystems although the negative effects of ag nps on freshwater systems have been widely reported previously ramzan et al 2022 this study has provided a new way of impact from the perspective of lake snow in addition the effect of ag nps on microbial diversity fig 3 eps synthesis genes fig 4d and silver resistance genes fig 4e in marine lake snow may also have important influences on aquatic ecosystems for instance the up regulation of eps synthesis genes would promote the transformation from free living bacteria to attached bacteria the attached bacteria were 10 to 100 times more active than free living bacteria crump et al 1999 thus accelerating the biogeochemical cycles turley and mackie 1994 in addition the up regulation of silver resistance genes and enrichment of silver resistant microbes may bring risks for the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args in the aquatic environment many studies have pointed out that there is a genetic linkage between silver and antibiotic resistance in bacteria alonso et al 2001 yuan et al 2019 a new study has found that marinobacter could significantly enrich args yang et al 2022 which was also enriched in marine snow as a silver resistant genus by ag nps fig 3d 5 conclusions through the roller table experiment this study explored the distinct effects of ag nps on the development of marine lake snow in the early formation stage that is ag nps accumulated larger marine snow flocs while inhibited the development of lake snow which was resulted from the different interface behaviors of ag nps in seawater 78 of ag nps was oxidatively dissolved to produce agcl x 1 x which weakened the bactericidal ability moreover the even incorporation of ag i into marine snow would enhance the rigidity and strength of marine snow which favored the maintenance of larger flocs and growth of biomass however most of ag nps 73 in lake water existed as aggregated nanoparticles 20 200 nm and the strong bactericidal activity of ag nps would inhibit the developments of biomass and lake snow the microbial community in marine lake snow was also significantly affected by ag nps ag nps promoted the disparities of community compositions in marine snow while concentrated the dissimilarity in lake snow under the stress of ag nps the abundance of eps synthesis genes in marine lake snow showed an increasing trend indicating that eps secretion was one of the survival means for microbes to cope with the threat of ag nps in addition ag nps elevated the abundance of silver resistance genes in marine lake snow which would bring the spread risk of microbial resistance genes

14696,as a factor affecting the efficiency of hollow fiber membrane filtration air resistance is gradually being discovered to obtain a better air resistance control strategy in the study two representative strategies have been proposed namely membrane vibration and inner surface modification which was achieved by aeration combined with looseness induced membrane vibration and dopamine pda hydrophilic modification of the inner surface respectively the performance of two strategies was based on fiber bragg grating fbg sensing technology and ultrasonic phased array upa technology to achieve real time monitoring mathematical model result shows that in hollow fiber membrane modules the initial appearance of air resistance causes a rapid reduction in filtration efficiency while this effect diminishes as the air resistance increases besides experimental results show that aeration combined with fiber looseness helps to inhibit air aggregation and accelerate air escape while inner surface modification enhances the hydrophilicity of inner surface weakens the air adhesion and increases the drag force of fluid on air bubbles in the corresponding optimized state both strategies perform well in optimizing the air resistance control and the improvement in flux enhancement ability for the two strategies is 26 92 and 34 10 respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hollow fiber membrane membrane vibration pda modification upa technology fbg technology data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction hollow fiber membrane has been widely used in water purification blood oxygenator desalination biosensors membrane distillation etc while fouling remains a major challenge in membrane filtration particulates and colloidal matter in the feed deposit on membrane surfaces or inside membrane pores and this fouling reduces membrane efficiency chang et al 2017 li et al 2017 as a result of fouling it would result in lower permeate flux production higher energy consumption frequent membrane cleaning and shorter membrane lifetime le clech et al 2006 silva et al 2019 however in previous studies qin et al 2022 we have found that air resistance caused by released air in the outside in hollow fiber membrane lumen would not be beneficial for the filtration and backwash process once released air is formed if it could not be discharged in time with the filtrate it would gradually increase in size and area covered until it is subjected to a drag force sufficient to discharge it with the filtrate akhondi et al 2014 cui et al 2017 whether or not the released air is discharged depends on the size of the bubbles the flux flow rate and the bubble adhesion ability on the membrane the drag force is mainly influenced by the flux and the properties of the inner surface of the membrane the higher the flux the easier it is for air bubbles to escape while increasing the flux requires higher filtration pressure which further encourages the release of air it is obviously not a good solution the air adhesion ability to adhesion on the inner surface depends on the level of membrane vibration and hydrophilic of the membrane surface by increasing the possibility of air escape by vibration or the hydrophilicity of the inner surface of the membrane they will help to reduce the contact area of air on the membrane surface and reduce its adhesive force membrane vibration systems can be divided into two types namely membrane vibration driven by mechanical motion and fluid turbulence the former has a low vibration frequency usually between a few and tens of hertz and amplitude is usually in the millimeter range the latter usually refers to fluid turbulence to change the motion of the membrane module itself kola et al 2012 li et al 2014 low et al 2005 in practice aeration combined with hollow fiber modules with a certain degree of looseness in turbulent fluids will help to enhance the vibration strength of the membrane modules liu et al 2016 yeo et al 2007 compared to membrane vibration driven by mechanical motion the fluid turbulence induced membrane vibration mode would be less equipment demanding and more suitable for existing membrane systems in addition membrane modification a hot topic of current research can also be an effective way to mitigate air resistance pristine polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is one of the most popular membrane materials due to its excellent comprehensive properties however the inert and hydrophobic surfaces limit their further extended applications xi et al 2009 to date the most common strategy for membrane fouling control has been to construct fouling resistant membrane surfaces which are usually hydrophilic or superhydrophilic various methods such as surface coating ozaydin ince et al 2013 sagle et al 2009 surface grafting słowikowska et al 2021 surface bioadhesion jiang et al 2010 mccloskey et al 2012 physical blending and surface segregation mccloskey et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 have been explored to prepare different kinds of antifouling membranes among them a mussel inspired bioadhesion strategy has been demonstrated for surface modification based on the multifunctionalities of dopamine pda which can be generated by in situ spontaneous oxidative self polymerization of pda under mild conditions zhang et al 2016 pda modification due to its simplicity and universality has been widely used for membrane surface modification fan et al 2016 the oxidative self polymerisation of pda adheres firmly to the surface of various membrane materials effectively increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface kazemi et al 2019 xi et al 2009 therefore in the study aiming to mitigate the effects of air resistance on the outside in hollow fiber membrane filtration process two representative strategies aeration induced membrane vibration and inner surface modification were proposed aeration with fiber looseness was first employed to facilitate the escape of released air then pda was used to improve the hydrophilicity of the inner surface in the two strategies the frequency of bubble release was monitored using fiber bragg grating fbg in situ monitoring technology and the distribution of released air was monitored using ultrasonic phased array upa in situ monitoring technology finally the ability of the two strategies to control air resistance was compared 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials a lab scale hollow fiber membrane setup is shown in fig 1 a pvdf hollow fiber membrane was provided by tianjin cnclear

were determined by fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence photometer f 380 shimadzu japan and energy dispersive spectrometer ultim max 65 oxford britain the morphology of the membrane surface was observed using scanning electron microscope regulus 8100 hitachi japan 2 3 monitoring methods 2 3 1 fiber bragg grating fbg sensing technology the fbg sensing technique has been used in our previous experiments and it allows for real time monitoring of shear force in this experiment the fbg was placed vertically at the filtrate outlet in order to monitor the discharge of the released air inside the fiber as shown in the partial enlargement in fig 1 the released air inside the fiber causes a change in shear frequency at the outlet which can be expressed as 1 f f b f a 100 where f b is the fiber outlet bubble released frequency f a is the acquisition frequency in this experiment the acquisition frequency is 1000 hz and the bubble released frequency is the amount of the change in fbg central wavelength caused by the bubble in 1 s 2 3 2 ultrasonic phased array upa technology the upa technique has been applied to industrial nondestructive testing and its feasibility in monitoring air water distribution in hollow fiber membrane modules has been verified in previous experiments which shows that at the air water interface ultrasonic wave will be totally reflected in this study we used the upa technique to monitor the air water distribution in a single fiber by line sweep mode as shown in fig 1 b upa probe moved from p1 to p5 and we would get the released air distribution information the results of a single upa scan can obtain n collection points then the average reflection of the air r air in the membrane module is 2 r air i 1 n p ri p i n 5 i 1 n x i 255 n 5 where x i and 255 are the output and input of upa image acquisition respectively and the total number of scans is 5 2 4 experimental strategies in this experiment two strategies are proposed for air resistance control aeration induced membrane vibration and inner surface modification in the membrane vibration strategy aeration intensities of 0 m3 h 0 012 m3 h and 0 024 m3 h and looseness of 0 1 2 and 4 were used to promote membrane vibration to facilitate air release fbg was used to monitor the air released ability and upa technique to monitor the air adhesion ability on the membrane lumen in the membrane modification process the inner surface hydrophilic modification of the fibers was achieved by backwash of pda solution for 0 5 10 15 of 20 min in situ monitoring of the air release status was performed by fbg and upa technologies 3 results and discussion 3 1 released air and filtration efficiency model the release air adhering to the inner surface would have an adverse effect on the filtration efficiency as shown in fig 2 assuming that the area occupied by the air in the membrane lumen is aa and the total area of the membrane lumen is dinπl the effective filtration area as follow 3 a d i n π l a a where din is the fiber inner diameter and l is the fiber length equating the air area to the area of a circle with an inner diameter of the membrane lumen the effective length is 4 l 1 d i n π l a a d i n π the air percentage in the hollow fiber membrane can be shown 5 p a i r v a v m 100 l 1 l 100 where v a and v m are air volume in the hollow fiber membrane and membrane lumen volume respectively the flux of hollow fiber membrane mu et al 2018 6 q z π d o u t j a v l e x p λ z exp λ z e x p λ l exp λ l where j av is the average flux and λ is related to the outer and inner diameters of the hollow fiber d out and d in and the membrane intrinsic resistance r 0 7 j a v q π d o u t l 8 λ 128 d o u t r 0 d i n 4 where q is the total flux 9 q 0 l q z d z when there is air in the fiber the flux is 10 q z π d o u t j a v l e x p λ l l 1 exp λ l l 1 e x p λ l exp λ l and the filtration efficiency e f can be shown 11 e f j 1 j 0 100 at 0 5 m hollow fiber membrane the model can predict the relationship between filtration efficiency and air volume as shown in fig 3 the filtration efficiency has been reduced to 60 when the air volume occupies 7 of the membrane lumen volume which indicates that the released air attached to the membrane lumen has a significant adverse effect on the filtration efficiency 3 2 the effect of fluid turbulence on air resistance 3 2 1 force model of bubbles in the fiber lumen the forces of a single bubble in the horizontal and vertical directions are shown in fig 4 12 f x f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 13 f y f y 1 f y 2 f y 3 fx1 and fy1 are the surface tensions in the horizontal and vertical directions 14 f x 1 d σ π sin α β 2 15 f y 1 2 5 d σ α β sin α π where d is the bubble attachment diameter σ is the surface tension coefficient and α and β are the contact angles at the lower and upper ends of the bubbles respectively since the space inside the fiber is narrow and the bubble size is less than 1 mm the bubble asymmetry due to the filtrate flow is neglected then it can be simplified as 16 f x 1 d σ π sin θ 17 f y 1 0 fx2 is the force due to the water pressure including the hydrostatic pressure of the water and the contact pressure between the bubble and the surface 18 f x 2 ρ a ρ l g r 2 σ r t o p π d 2 4 where ρa and ρl are the densities of the gas and liquid phases respectively g is the acceleration of gravity r is the radius of the bubble and rtop is the local radius of curvature at the top of the bubble f x 3 is the shear lift force on the bubble 19 f x 3 1 2 ρ l v 2 π r 2 3 877 g 1 2 r e 2 0 014 g 2 1 4 where g is the cross sectional mass flow rate and re is the reynolds number f y 2 and f y 3 are the buoyancy force and the fluid drag force on the bubble respectively 20 f y 2 4 3 π r 2 ρ l ρ a g 21 f y 3 1 2 c d ρ l π r 2 v 2 where cd is a coefficient related to turbulence intensity reynolds number and bubble shape and v is the filtrate flow rate aeration and looseness complement each other and will promote the membrane vibration the membrane vibration will promote the occurrence of fiber deformation which in turn leads to the change of contact angle between the bubbles and the inner surface and further leads to the decrease of surface tension and increase of fluid drag force as shown in fig 4 at this time the air bubbles will be more easily discharged with the filtrate 22 α f x f y d i f f i c u l t α f x f y e a s y 3 2 2 the released air distribution the upa images allow the observation of air release during filtration as shown in fig s1 the 0 and 1 looseness showed similar air distribution without aeration and there was a significant increase in the released air volume as the looseness increased which indicated that the large increase in looseness was not conducive to the discharge of air when increasing aeration intensity to 0 012 m3 h the air accumulation caused by fiber looseness was alleviated but not eliminated and with an increase in looseness from 0 to 2 the discharge of air showed an increasing trend however at 4 looseness we can observe that the air accumulation is significantly relieved mainly concentrated at the bottom of the fiber and this phenomenon also changes with time further increase of aeration to 0 024 m3 h further weakened the air accumulation phenomenon which indicates that the membrane vibration caused by aeration has a certain effect on air discharge especially in the middle region of the fiber it is also consistent with the large vibration frequency in the middle of the fiber compared to other regions in previous study we found that the upa reflected signal r air has a positive correlation with the volume of released air thus as shown in fig 5 a the volume of released air is minimized at 2 looseness and 0 024 m3 h aeration intensity while the effect is not satisfactory at only 4 looseness or with aeration only this indicates that the complementarity of the two helps to promote the attenuation of the attachment of the released air in fig 5 b the upa image also shows the positive significance of aeration induced membrane vibration in weakening air resistance at a certain looseness the aeration induced membrane vibration is positive in mitigating the air resistance caused by the released air which is mainly reflected in the fact that the membrane vibration weakens the adhesion of the air to the membrane surface thus mitigating the reduction of the effective filtration area due to air adhesion 3 2 3 the air released ability the relationship between air displacement and vibration intensity could be expressed in terms of the shear frequency caused by bubble discharge the stronger the vibration the easier it is to discharge expressed as a low shear frequency and vice versa it is because the released air mostly in the form of tiny bubbles discharge which would not cause changes in shear frequency when the aggregation of tiny bubbles gathered in the fiber aggregated and merged to produce large bubbles and discharge which would cause a sharp increase in shear frequency fig 6 a and b shows the schematic diagrams of air release ability caused by no vibration and membrane vibration respectively when there is no vibration the released air in the membrane lumen is prone to aggregation resulting in the released air mostly in the form of large bubbles when the aeration induced membrane vibration drives the membrane vibration the air aggregation ability weakened and when released air is formed in the membrane lumen the air bubbles are not easily attached and mostly discharged as tiny bubbles with the filtrate the aeration induced membrane vibration determines the air bubble adhesion ability on the membrane inner surface and further influences the bubble size fig 6 c and d show the effects of the interactions caused by aeration intensity and looseness on air released frequency and flux respectively there is no doubt that the increase in aeration intensity reduces the air aggregation capacity which is manifested by a decrease in the air release frequency as air is mostly discharged in tiny bubbles that cannot be effectively monitored in addition the increase in looseness at high aeration intensities contributes to the timely discharge of air bubbles which is related to the fact that fibers are more prone to deformation in highly turbulent fluids thus making it impossible for bubbles to adhere stably to the inner surface at the optimal operating parameters namely 0 024 m3 h aeration intensity and 2 looseness the improvement in flux enhancement ability is 34 10 therefore the air release ability is closely related to the fiber looseness and aeration intensity 2 looseness and 0 024 m3 h aeration intensity would facilitate the timely air discharge in the form of tiny bubbles and slow down its effect on the effective filtration area of the membrane surface 3 3 the effect of membrane hydrophilicity on air resistance 3 3 1 characteristics of pda pvdf membrane the pvdf hollow fiber membrane does not have o element with the molecular formula of ch2 cf2 n and pda with the molecular formula of c6h3 oh 2 ch2 ch2 nh2 therefore o and f elements were used as characteristic elements to characterize the amount of pda aggregation on the membrane surface as shown in 7 a with the increase of backwash duration it is clear that the aggregation of pda can be observed in the inner surface by sem images fig 7 c shows the energy spectrum scan and the results show that the o element gradually increases and the f element gradually decreases with increasing backwashing time which also further indicates that the membrane surface is gradually covered by pda the spatial distribution difference exists due to the backwash mode of pda solution infusion as shown in fig 7 b c it can be learned from sem images as well as energy spectra that the pda aggregation is obvious at the position close to the outlet 0 05 m and far from the outlet 0 45 m and the least amount of pda is attached at the position of 0 15 m which is caused by the difference of local flow rate fig 7 d shows the infrared scans including the infrared spectra of the inner surface and the outer surface of the membrane as well as the infrared spectra of the pda attachment to the inner surface and the outer surface of the membrane at different locations of the hollow fiber membrane the attachment of pda to the membrane results in phenolic hydroxyl groups which form strong and broad absorption peaks in the infrared at 3500 3200 cm 1 due to hydroxyl group association by analyzing the pda solution backwash at different times and its accumulation of pda at different positions the same results as sem images and edx energy spectrum analysis can be obtained fig 7 e shows the variation of the contact angle of the inner surface of the membrane with the backwashing time and the results show that the backwashing modification for a long time helps to increase the hydrophilicity of the inner surface of the membrane 3 3 2 the released air distribution and released ability unlike the hydraulic induced membrane vibration the hydrophilic modification of the inner surface is mainly through reducing the contact angle of the air bubbles on the inner surface decreasing their attachment area and thus making them more susceptible to discharge the reduction of air adhesion area effectively weakens the coverage of membrane pores and reduces its adverse effect on filtration efficiency as shown in fig 8 a there is a difference in the state of air on the inner surface caused by the difference in hydrophilicity on the surface with high hydrophilicity a certain distance between the air bubbles and the surface is created and the air bubbles migrate with the filtrate in the form of tumbling beads on the surface with low hydrophilicity the air adheres to the surface which will seriously reduce the effective filtration area as shown in fig s3 by comparing the released air distribution in the membrane lumen under different modification times it can be observed that at the modification time of 5 min there is obviously no more air aggregation at the outlet but as the distance away from the outlet increases the air aggregation becomes more and more obvious which also indicates that the modification time of 5 min is less effective for the modification of the fiber end it also leads to the less easy release of air at the fiber end with the increase of modification time to 10 min the phenomenon was significantly alleviated and we performed sem characterization of the spatial distribution of pda in the inner surface at this time as shown in fig 7 b the results showed that the pda modification effect was better as the distance away from the fiber outlet increased which was also consistent with the upa images in addition the flux also increased significantly at this time and air discharge ability was enhanced as the modification time continues to increase the inner surface modification effect increases but the flux decreases which leads to a decrease in the ability of the filtrate to carry away air and a more obvious aggregation occurs at this point the phenomenon becomes more and more obvious as the modification time continues to increase this indicates that the long modification time is not conducive to the increase of flux and air elimination by comparing the air release frequencies before and after modification and at different modification times as shown in fig 8 b f the dashed line indicates the release strength the blue area indicates the minimum time required for two releases and the arrow indicates the number of releases within 150 min it is evident that the modified membranes produce less air and generate lower release frequencies by increasing the modification time of the inner surface the air release interval was reduced but the release gradually increased with the increase of modification time which also indicated that the increase of hydrophilicity promoted the air discharge combined with the change in flux as shown in fig 8 g it can be concluded that a high flux can be maintained at a modification time of 10 min and the generated air can be discharged in time 3 4 comparison between the two strategies both the membrane vibration and the inner surface hydrophilic modification have positive effects on the air resistance control and the relevant parameters can be adjusted to achieve the best control fig 9 compares the effects of the two strategies on the air resistance and flux fig 9 a shows the comparison of the two strategies on the air adhesion ability it can be seen that the membrane vibration and hydrophilic modification have similar effects on the air resistance control and r air caused by both are mainly between 3 956 and 4 516 the difference in r air between the best operating conditions is 0 93 and the corresponding difference in flux efficiency is 0 48 fig 9 b shows the average flux of the two strategies since the air resistance affects the flux the change in flux has an opposite trend to r air at the optimal operating parameters the improvement in flux enhancement ability for the two strategies is 26 92 and 34 10 respectively it is worth noting that the optimal average fluxes in both states are almost identical which also indicates the consistency of the two strategies in optimizing the air resistance control however for some hollow fiber systems that do not require aeration the significance of this strategy will be lost in contrast hydrophilic modification is universally adaptable but the decay of hydrophilic material at the membrane surface also prompts periodic in line backwashing to compensate for the loss of hydrophilic material therefore both strategies should be adapted to their applicability in practice either in combination or individually for hollow fiber membrane systems in addition membrane fouling during filtration process would accelerate the formation of released air as shown in fig s4 there is a significant difference in the release air in the membrane lumen between membrane fouling and no fouling various strategies for hydrophilic modification of current membrane materials and process adjustments for actual operation are positive in terms of membrane fouling control the reduction of membrane fouling drives down the transmembrane pressure difference which to some extent attenuates the effect of air resistance in this study both strategies have excellent performance as representatives of optimized air resistance moreover the two strategies can achieve the membrane fouling control 4 conclusion in the study two representative strategies on how to achieve air resistance control in hollow fiber membrane processes are proposed i e membrane vibration and inner surface modification based on fbg sensing technology and upa technology which provide directions for air resistance control in the study by investigating the ability of two strategies in air resistance control the core results and conclusion are summarized as follows mathematical model shows that in hollow fiber membrane modules the initial appearance of air resistance causes a rapid reduction in filtration efficiency while this effect diminishes as the air resistance increases aeration reduces the air aggregation ability in the hollow fiber membrane lumen and when combined with fiber looseness it will facilitate the timely discharge of released air in the form of tiny bubbles in this study upa and fbg results show the optimal parameter of membrane vibration was 2 looseness and 0 024 m3 h aeration intensity and the flux was improved by 34 10 the inner surface modification of the membrane lumen with pda backwash can effectively reduce the effect of air resistance which is achieved by enhancing the hydrophilicity and weakening the air adhesion ability upa and fbg results showed that the air adhesion ability was reduced and could be discharged timely the strategy showed a 0 56 reduction in air volume and a 26 92 improvement in flux compared to the unmodified at 10 min of backwashing with pda two strategies are beneficial for air resistance control and should be adjusted according to the actual process and equipped with corresponding monitoring method to achieve effective optimization of the membrane process in current membrane filtration systems aeration induced membrane vibration has better applicability but it must be acknowledged that with the development of membrane material modification technology the technology will also eventually be widely used declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with

by the flux and the properties of the inner surface of the membrane the higher the flux the easier it is for air bubbles to escape while increasing the flux requires higher filtration pressure which further encourages the release of air it is obviously not a good solution the air adhesion ability to adhesion on the inner surface depends on the level of membrane vibration and hydrophilic of the membrane surface by increasing the possibility of air escape by vibration or the hydrophilicity of the inner surface of the membrane they will help to reduce the contact area of air on the membrane surface and reduce its adhesive force membrane vibration systems can be divided into two types namely membrane vibration driven by mechanical motion and fluid turbulence the former has a low vibration frequency usually between a few and tens of hertz and amplitude is usually in the millimeter range the latter usually refers to fluid turbulence to change the motion of the membrane module itself kola et al 2012 li et al 2014 low et al 2005 in practice aeration combined with hollow fiber modules with a certain degree of looseness in turbulent fluids will help to enhance the vibration strength of the membrane modules liu et al 2016 yeo et al 2007 compared to membrane vibration driven by mechanical motion the fluid turbulence induced membrane vibration mode would be less equipment demanding and more suitable for existing membrane systems in addition membrane modification a hot topic of current research can also be an effective way to mitigate air resistance pristine polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is one of the most popular membrane materials due to its excellent comprehensive properties however the inert and hydrophobic surfaces limit their further extended applications xi et al 2009 to date the most common strategy for membrane fouling control has been to construct fouling resistant membrane surfaces which are usually hydrophilic or superhydrophilic various methods such as surface coating ozaydin ince et al 2013 sagle et al 2009 surface grafting słowikowska et al 2021 surface bioadhesion jiang et al 2010 mccloskey et al 2012 physical blending and surface segregation mccloskey et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 have been explored to prepare different kinds of antifouling membranes among them a mussel inspired bioadhesion strategy has been demonstrated for surface modification based on the multifunctionalities of dopamine pda which can be generated by in situ spontaneous oxidative self polymerization of pda under mild conditions zhang et al 2016 pda modification due to its simplicity and universality has been widely used for membrane surface modification fan et al 2016 the oxidative self polymerisation of pda adheres firmly to the surface of various membrane materials effectively increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface kazemi et al 2019 xi et al 2009 therefore in the study aiming to mitigate the effects of air resistance on the outside in hollow fiber membrane filtration process two representative strategies aeration induced membrane vibration and inner surface modification were proposed aeration with fiber looseness was first employed to facilitate the escape of released air then pda was used to improve the hydrophilicity of the inner surface in the two strategies the frequency of bubble release was monitored using fiber bragg grating fbg in situ monitoring technology and the distribution of released air was monitored using ultrasonic phased array upa in situ monitoring technology finally the ability of the two strategies to control air resistance was compared 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials a lab scale hollow fiber membrane setup is shown in fig 1 a pvdf hollow fiber membrane was provided by tianjin cnclear

observed using scanning electron microscope regulus 8100 hitachi japan 2 3 monitoring methods 2 3 1 fiber bragg grating fbg sensing technology the fbg sensing technique has been used in our previous experiments and it allows for real time monitoring of shear force in this experiment the fbg was placed vertically at the filtrate outlet in order to monitor the discharge of the released air inside the fiber as shown in the partial enlargement in fig 1 the released air inside the fiber causes a change in shear frequency at the outlet which can be expressed as 1 f f b f a 100 where f b is the fiber outlet bubble released frequency f a is the acquisition frequency in this experiment the acquisition frequency is 1000 hz and the bubble released frequency is the amount of the change in fbg central wavelength caused by the bubble in 1 s 2 3 2 ultrasonic phased array upa technology the upa technique has been applied to industrial nondestructive testing and its feasibility in monitoring air water distribution in hollow fiber membrane modules has been verified in previous experiments which shows that at the air water interface ultrasonic wave will be totally reflected in this study we used the upa technique to monitor the air water distribution in a single fiber by line sweep mode as shown in fig 1 b upa probe moved from p1 to p5 and we would get the released air distribution information the results of a single upa scan can obtain n collection points then the average reflection of the air r air in the membrane module is 2 r air i 1 n p ri p i n 5 i 1 n x i 255 n 5 where x i and 255 are the output and input of upa image acquisition respectively and the total number of scans is 5 2 4 experimental strategies in this experiment two strategies are proposed for air resistance control aeration induced membrane vibration and inner surface modification in the membrane vibration strategy aeration intensities of 0 m3 h 0 012 m3 h and 0 024 m3 h and looseness of 0 1 2

the membrane modification process the inner surface hydrophilic modification of the fibers was achieved by backwash of pda solution for 0 5 10 15 of 20 min in situ monitoring of the air release status was performed by fbg and upa technologies 3 results and discussion 3 1 released air and filtration efficiency model the release air adhering to the inner surface would have an adverse effect on the filtration efficiency as shown in fig 2 assuming that the area occupied by the air in the membrane lumen is aa and the total area of the membrane lumen is dinπl the effective filtration area as follow 3 a d i n π l a a where din is the fiber inner diameter and l is the fiber length equating the air area to the area of a circle with an inner diameter of the membrane lumen the effective length is 4 l 1 d i n π l a a d i n π the air percentage in the hollow fiber membrane can be shown 5 p a i r v a v m 100 l 1 l 100 where v a and v m are air volume in the hollow fiber membrane and membrane lumen volume respectively the flux of hollow fiber membrane mu et al 2018 6 q z π d o u t j a v l e x p λ z exp λ z e x p λ l exp λ l where j av is the average flux and λ is related to the outer and inner diameters of the hollow fiber d out and d in and the membrane intrinsic resistance r 0 7 j a v q π d o u t l 8 λ 128 d o u t r 0 d i n 4 where q is the total flux 9 q 0 l q z d z when there is air in the fiber the flux is 10 q z π d o u t j a v l e x p λ l l 1 exp λ l l 1 e x p λ l exp λ l and the filtration efficiency e f can be shown 11 e f j 1 j 0 100 at 0 5 m hollow fiber membrane the model can predict the relationship between filtration efficiency and air volume as shown in fig 3 the filtration efficiency has been reduced to 60 when the air volume occupies 7 of the membrane lumen volume which indicates that the released air attached to the membrane lumen has a significant adverse effect on the filtration efficiency 3 2 the effect of fluid turbulence on air resistance 3 2 1 force model of bubbles in the fiber lumen the forces of a single bubble in the horizontal and vertical directions are shown in fig 4 12 f x f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 13 f y f y 1 f y 2 f y 3 fx1 and fy1 are the surface tensions in the horizontal and vertical directions 14 f x 1 d σ π sin α β 2 15 f y 1 2 5 d σ α β sin α π where d is the bubble attachment diameter σ is the surface tension coefficient and α and β are the contact angles at the lower and upper ends of the bubbles respectively since the space inside the fiber is narrow and the bubble size is less than 1 mm the bubble asymmetry due to the filtrate flow is neglected then it can be simplified as 16 f x 1 d σ π sin θ 17 f y 1 0 fx2 is the force due to the water pressure including the hydrostatic pressure of the water and the contact pressure between the bubble and the surface 18 f x 2 ρ a ρ l g r 2 σ r t o p π d 2 4 where ρa and ρl are the densities of the gas and liquid phases respectively g is the acceleration of gravity r is the radius of the bubble and rtop is the local radius of curvature at the top of the bubble f x 3 is the shear lift force on the bubble 19 f x 3 1 2 ρ l v 2 π r 2 3 877 g 1 2 r e 2 0 014 g 2 1 4 where g is the cross sectional mass flow rate and re is the reynolds number f y 2 and f y 3 are the buoyancy force and the fluid drag force on the bubble respectively 20 f y 2 4 3 π r 2 ρ l ρ a g 21 f y 3 1 2 c d ρ l π r 2 v 2 where cd is a coefficient related to turbulence intensity reynolds number and bubble shape and v is the filtrate flow rate aeration and looseness complement each other and will promote the membrane vibration the membrane vibration will promote the occurrence of fiber deformation which in turn leads to the change of contact angle between the bubbles and the inner surface and further leads to the decrease of surface tension and increase of fluid drag force as shown in fig 4 at this time the air bubbles will be more easily discharged with the filtrate 22 α f x f y d i f f i c u l t α f x f y e a s y 3 2 2 the released air distribution the upa images allow the observation of air release during filtration as shown in fig s1 the 0 and 1 looseness showed similar air distribution without aeration and there was a significant increase in the released air volume as the looseness increased which indicated that the large increase in looseness was not conducive to the discharge of air when increasing aeration intensity to 0 012 m3 h the air accumulation caused by fiber looseness was alleviated but not eliminated and with an increase in looseness from 0 to 2 the discharge of air showed an increasing trend however at 4 looseness we can observe that the air accumulation is significantly relieved mainly concentrated at the bottom of the fiber and this phenomenon also changes with time further increase of aeration to 0 024 m3 h further weakened the air accumulation phenomenon which indicates that the membrane vibration caused by aeration has a certain effect on air discharge especially in the middle region of the fiber it is also consistent with the large vibration frequency in the middle of the fiber compared to other regions in previous study we found that the upa reflected signal r air has a positive correlation with the volume of released air thus as shown in fig 5 a the volume of released air is minimized at 2 looseness and 0 024 m3 h aeration intensity while the effect is not satisfactory at only 4 looseness or with aeration only this indicates that the complementarity of the two helps to promote the attenuation of the attachment of the released air in fig 5 b the upa image also shows the positive significance of aeration induced membrane vibration in weakening air resistance at a certain looseness the aeration induced membrane vibration is positive in mitigating the air resistance caused by the released air which is mainly reflected in the fact that the membrane vibration weakens the adhesion of the air to the membrane surface thus mitigating the reduction of the effective filtration area due to air adhesion 3 2 3 the air released ability the relationship between air displacement and vibration intensity could be expressed in terms of the shear frequency caused by bubble discharge the stronger the vibration the easier it is to discharge expressed as a low shear frequency and vice versa it is because the released air mostly in the form of tiny bubbles discharge which would not cause changes in shear frequency when the aggregation of tiny bubbles gathered in the fiber aggregated and merged to produce large bubbles and discharge which would cause a sharp increase in shear frequency fig 6 a and b shows the schematic diagrams of air release ability caused by no vibration and membrane vibration respectively when there is no vibration the released air in the membrane lumen is prone to aggregation resulting in the released air mostly in the form of large bubbles when the aeration induced membrane vibration drives the membrane vibration the air aggregation ability weakened and when released air is formed in the membrane lumen the air bubbles are not easily attached and mostly discharged as tiny bubbles with the filtrate the aeration induced membrane vibration determines the air bubble adhesion ability on the membrane inner surface and further influences the bubble size fig 6 c and d show the effects of the interactions caused by aeration intensity and looseness on air released frequency and flux respectively there is no doubt that the increase in aeration intensity reduces the air aggregation capacity which is manifested by a decrease in the air release frequency as air is mostly discharged in tiny bubbles that cannot be effectively monitored in addition the increase in looseness at high aeration intensities contributes to the timely discharge of air bubbles which is related to the fact that fibers are more prone to deformation in highly turbulent fluids thus making it impossible for bubbles to adhere stably to the inner surface at the optimal operating parameters namely 0 024 m3 h aeration intensity and 2 looseness the improvement in flux enhancement ability is 34 10 therefore the air release ability is closely related to the fiber looseness and aeration intensity 2 looseness and 0 024 m3 h aeration intensity would facilitate the timely air discharge in the form of tiny bubbles and slow down its effect on the effective filtration area of the membrane surface 3 3 the effect of membrane hydrophilicity on air resistance 3 3 1 characteristics of pda pvdf membrane the pvdf hollow fiber membrane does not have o element with the molecular formula of ch2 cf2 n and pda with the molecular formula of c6h3 oh 2 ch2 ch2 nh2 therefore o and f elements were used as characteristic elements to characterize the amount of pda aggregation on the membrane surface as shown in 7 a with the increase of backwash duration it is clear that the aggregation of pda can be observed in the inner surface by sem images fig 7 c shows the energy spectrum scan and the results show that the o element gradually increases and the f element gradually decreases with increasing backwashing time which also further indicates that the membrane surface is gradually covered by pda the spatial distribution difference exists due to the backwash mode of pda solution infusion as shown in fig 7 b c it can be learned from sem images as well as energy spectra that the pda aggregation is obvious at the position close to the outlet 0 05 m and far from the outlet 0 45 m and the least amount of pda is attached at the position of 0 15 m which is caused by the difference of local flow rate fig 7 d shows the infrared scans including the infrared spectra of the inner surface and the outer surface of the membrane as well as the infrared spectra of the pda attachment to the inner surface and the outer surface of the membrane at different locations of the hollow fiber membrane the attachment of pda to the membrane results in phenolic hydroxyl groups which form strong and broad absorption peaks in the infrared at 3500 3200 cm 1 due to hydroxyl group association by analyzing the pda solution backwash at different times and its accumulation of pda at different positions the same results as sem images and edx energy spectrum analysis can be obtained fig 7 e shows the variation of the contact angle of the inner surface of the membrane with the backwashing time and the results show that the backwashing modification for a long time helps to increase the hydrophilicity of the inner surface of the membrane 3 3 2 the released air distribution and released ability unlike the hydraulic induced membrane vibration the hydrophilic modification of the inner surface is mainly through reducing the contact angle of the air bubbles on the inner surface decreasing their attachment area and thus making them more susceptible to discharge the reduction of air adhesion area effectively weakens the coverage of membrane pores and reduces its adverse effect on filtration efficiency as shown in fig 8 a there is a difference in the state of air on the inner surface caused by the difference in hydrophilicity on the surface with high hydrophilicity a certain distance between the air bubbles and the surface is created and the air bubbles migrate with the filtrate in the form of tumbling beads on the surface with low hydrophilicity the air adheres to the surface which will seriously reduce the effective filtration area as shown in fig s3 by comparing the released air distribution in the membrane lumen under different modification times it can be observed that at the modification time of 5 min there is obviously no more air aggregation at the outlet but as the distance away from the outlet increases the air aggregation becomes more and more obvious which also indicates that the modification time of 5 min is less effective for the modification of the fiber end it also leads to the less easy release of air at the fiber end with the increase of modification time to 10 min the phenomenon was significantly alleviated and we performed sem characterization of the spatial distribution of pda in the inner surface at this time as shown in fig 7 b the results showed that the pda modification effect was better as the distance away from the fiber outlet increased which was also consistent with the upa images in addition the flux also increased significantly at this time and air discharge ability was enhanced as the modification time continues to increase the inner surface modification effect increases but the flux decreases which leads to a decrease in the ability of the filtrate to carry away air and a more obvious aggregation occurs at this point the phenomenon becomes more and more obvious as the modification time continues to increase this indicates that the long modification time is not conducive to the increase of flux and air elimination by comparing the air release frequencies before and after modification and at different modification times as shown in fig 8 b f the dashed line indicates the release strength the blue area indicates the minimum time required for two releases and the arrow indicates the number of releases within 150 min it is evident that the modified membranes produce less air and generate lower release frequencies by increasing the modification time of the inner surface the air release interval was reduced but the release gradually increased with the increase of modification time which also indicated that the increase of hydrophilicity promoted the air discharge combined with the change in flux as shown in fig 8 g it can be concluded that a high flux can be maintained at a modification time of 10 min and the generated air can be discharged in time 3 4 comparison between the two strategies both the membrane vibration and the inner surface hydrophilic modification have positive effects on the air resistance control and the relevant parameters can be adjusted to achieve the best control fig 9 compares the effects of the two strategies on the air resistance and flux fig 9 a shows the comparison of the two strategies on the air adhesion ability it can be seen that the membrane vibration and hydrophilic modification have similar effects on the air resistance control and r air caused by both are mainly between 3 956 and 4 516 the difference in r air between the best operating conditions is 0 93 and the corresponding difference in flux efficiency is 0 48 fig 9 b shows the average flux of the two strategies since the air resistance affects the flux the change in flux has an opposite trend to r air at the optimal operating parameters the improvement in flux enhancement ability for the two strategies is 26 92 and 34 10 respectively it is worth noting that the optimal average fluxes in both states are almost identical which also indicates the consistency of the two strategies in optimizing the air resistance control however for some hollow fiber systems that do not require aeration the significance of this strategy will be lost in contrast hydrophilic modification is universally adaptable but the decay of hydrophilic material at the membrane surface also prompts periodic in line backwashing to compensate for the loss of hydrophilic material therefore both strategies should be adapted to their applicability in practice either in combination or individually for hollow fiber membrane systems in addition membrane fouling during filtration process would accelerate the formation of released air as shown in fig s4 there is a significant difference in the release air in the membrane lumen between membrane fouling and no fouling various strategies for hydrophilic modification of current membrane materials and process adjustments for actual operation are positive in terms of membrane fouling control the reduction of membrane fouling drives down the transmembrane pressure difference which to some extent attenuates the effect of air resistance in this study both strategies have excellent performance as representatives of optimized air resistance moreover the two strategies can achieve the membrane fouling control 4 conclusion in the study two representative strategies on how to achieve air resistance control in hollow fiber membrane processes are proposed i e membrane vibration and inner surface modification based on fbg sensing technology and upa technology which provide directions for air resistance control in the study by investigating the ability of two strategies in air resistance control the core results and conclusion are summarized as follows mathematical model shows that in hollow fiber membrane modules the initial appearance of air resistance causes a rapid reduction in filtration efficiency while this effect diminishes as the air resistance increases aeration reduces the air aggregation ability in the hollow fiber membrane lumen and when combined with fiber looseness it will facilitate the timely discharge of released air in the form of tiny bubbles in this study upa and fbg results show the optimal parameter of membrane vibration was 2 looseness and 0 024 m3 h aeration intensity and the flux was improved by 34 10 the inner surface modification of the membrane lumen with pda backwash can effectively reduce the effect of air resistance which is achieved by enhancing the hydrophilicity and weakening the air adhesion ability upa and fbg results showed that the air adhesion ability was reduced and could be discharged timely the strategy showed a 0 56 reduction in air volume and a 26 92 improvement in flux compared to the unmodified at 10 min of backwashing with pda two strategies are beneficial for air resistance control and should be adjusted according to the actual process and equipped with corresponding monitoring method to achieve effective optimization of the membrane process in current membrane filtration systems aeration induced membrane vibration has better applicability but it must be acknowledged that with the development of membrane material modification technology the technology will also eventually be widely used declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with

14697,elevated riverine nitrate no3 levels have led to increased eutrophication and other ecological implications while high riverine no3 levels were generally ascribed to anthropogenic activities high no3 levels in some pristine or minimally disturbed rivers were reported the drivers of these unexpectedly high no3 levels remain unclear this study combined natural abundance isotopes 15n labeling techniques and molecular techniques to reveal the processes driving the high no3 levels in a sparsely populated forest river the natural abundance isotopes revealed that the no3 was mainly from soil sources and that no3 removal processes were insignificant the 15n labeling experiments also quantitatively showed that the biological no3 removal processes i e denitrification dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox in the soils and sediments were weak relative to nitrification in summer while nitrification was minor in winter the no3 removal was insignificant relative to the large no3 stock in the catchment stepwise multiple regression analyses and structural equation models revealed that in summer nitrification in the soils was regulated by the amoa aob gene abundances and nh4 n contents low temperature constrained nitrification in winter denitrification was largely controlled by moisture content in both seasons and anammox and dnra could be explained by the competition with nitrification and denitrification on their substrate nitrite no2 we also revealed the strong hydrological control on the transport of soil no3 to the river

introduction nitrogen n is a major but usually limiting nutrient element for living organisms kuypers et al 2018 in the past few decades increasing agricultural domestic and industrial activities have more than doubled the production of reactive n fowler et al 2013 stevens 2019 and a large portion of the reactive n produced especially nitrate no3 has entered the aquatic ecosystems particularly

relevance in freshwater environments compared to denitrification assimilation and dnra only transform no3 without releasing n2 in addition to the complex no3 sources and transformations the processes cannot be considered in isolation because they are tightly coupled francis et al 2007 zhou et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 rivers are receptors for the no3 produced in their respective drainages jiang et al 2022 the natural abundance isotopes of no3 δ15n δ17o δ18o no3 in a river contain compositive information on the no3 sources and biogeochemical turnovers in a catchment kendall et al 2007 jiang et al 2020 liu et al 2022a these isotopic indicators are based on the distinct isotopic signatures of the no3 sources and the predictable isotope fractionation signals for the different no3 transformation processes xue et al 2009 jiang et al 2021a pan et al 2021 while there are increasing numbers of studies accessing the spatiotemporal sources and turnovers of no3 at catchment scales using river s natural abundance isotopes there are several deficiencies associated with this method 1 the isotopic signals of the no3 sources and transformations are often overlapping zarnetske et al 2012 zhu et al 2018 meghdadi and javar 2018 archana et al 2018 kobayashi et al 2019 and 2 it cannot accurately determine where in the catchment the no3 yield processes are occurring meghdadi and javar 2018 xia et al 2018 thus the no3 related processes in a catchment revealed by the river s isotopes are somewhat speculative jiang et al 2021b 15n labeling techniques can quantify the rates of no3

processes and no3 production and removal hot spots can also be identified pasten zapata et al 2014 guo et al 2023 in addition microorganisms are important drivers of no3 transformations molecular techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reactions qpcr can be used to analyze the abundances of key enzyme encoding genes involved in no3 cycling e g amoa nxra nitrification narg nirk nirs nosz denitrification hzsa hzsb anammox and nrfa dnra nelson et al 2016 nadeau et al 2019 on this basis we can access the driving mechanism of the no3 related processes from a microscopic perspective by establishing relationships between the rates and the biotic and physicochemical factors zhu et al 2013 kim et al 2016 ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 however the no3 cycling processes identified from microscopic studies can be totally different because n biogeochemistry is highly heterogeneous in microenvironments mcclain et al 2003 nadeau et al 2019 fortunately integrated no3 cycling information obtained at the catchment scale from river s natural abundance isotopes can attest to the reliability of the information acquired from labeled isotopes and molecular techniques in the microenvironments therefore natural abundance isotopes labeled isotopes and molecular techniques can provide complementary information for catchment scale n cycling studies for this study we collected river waters soils and sediments from the jinshui river catchment in central china although the catchment is forested and minimally disturbed it has one of the highest no3 concentrations ever recorded in a forested river catchment binkley et al 2004 li et al 2022 thus this catchment provides a window to elucidate the mechanisms driving high no3 levels in minimally disturbed rivers we took advantage of the natural abundance labeled isotopes and molecular techniques qpcr to determine the processes regulating the high no3 levels and their driving mechanisms at the catchment scale we aimed to address two questions 1 what were the critical processes involved in no3 cycling in the catchment 2 what were the key driving factors of the high riverine no3 loadings we expected combining these approaches could generate key clues for resolving these questions and help to breach the barrier between the catchment and microenvironmental scales thereby achieving a methodological improvement in the study of n cycling at catchment scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 general setting of the jinshui river catchment the catchment 33 16 n to 33 45 n 107 40 e to 108 10 e is located in central china

sediments 5 5 were well mixed to form one sample c a 5 kg at each site surface forest soils yellow brown were collected from the nearby river banks using a shovel after removing the overlying grasses this type of soil was selected as forest dominates the land use types more than 95 based on a 10 meter interval grid 25 parallel soils 5 5 were collected at each site and well mixed c a 5 kg the soil

immediately frozen in liquid n for subsequent qpcr detection 2 3 analytical procedures the cl no2 and no3 concentrations in the waters were determined by an ics 900 ion chromatography system dionex with uncertainties of c a 5 the δ15n δ18o no3 were measured using the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 briefly no3 was reduced to nitrous oxide n2o by a denitrifier pseudomonas aureofaciens and then its δ15n and δ18o compositions were measured with a mat 253 thermo fisher scientific with uncertainties of 0 3 the δd h2o and δ18o h2o were determined using an l1102 i isotope analyzer picarro with uncertainties of 0 5 for δd h2o and 0 1 for δ18o h2o all isotope analyses were conducted in triplicate soil ph was determined from a suspension 1 5 soil to water with a ph meter soil and sediment moisture was determined gravimetrically after air drying after extracting procedures with 2 m potassium chloride kcl the no3 and nh4 contents of the soils and sediments were determined using spectrophotometry bottomley et al 2020 the available phosphorus a p was also determined using spectrophotometry after extraction with 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 bottomley et al 2020 the total n tn and total organic carbon toc contents were measured using a vario el cube elemental analyzer elementar the potential denitrification anammox and dnra rates were determined using the 15n labeling method risgaard petersen et al 2003 deng et al 2015 zhao et al 2021 the details of the labeling experiments are given in supporting information in brief a series of pre incubation experiments were set to ascertain the ideal pre incubation time 72 h and incubation time 8 h after pre incubation no2 no3 and o2 were effectively removed the samples were spiked with 100 μl 12 mm k15no3 99 2 15n the background samples were preserved immediately and experiment samples were further incubated for 8 h at the in situ temperature the 29n2 and 30n2 concentrations produced were analyzed using an hpr 40 membrane inlet mass spectrometer mims hiden analytical and the rates of denitrification and anammox can be calculated risgaard petersen et al 2003 for the dnra rate determination after the above incubation the samples were purged with he gas then the dnra produced 15nh4 was oxidized into 29n2 and 30n2 by a hypobromite iodine solution the 29n2 and 30n2 concentrations were determined with the mims and the dnra rates were quantified deng et al 2015 the net nitrification rates were determined following bottomley et al 2020 briefly 20 g of field moist soil or sediment was incubated under aerobic conditions in the dark at the in situ temperature for 14 days the nitrification rate was determined from the change in no3 content over time we chose to determine the net nitrification rates in the samples because it was commonly used in the literature see the review by li et al 2020 allowing comparations with other locations in addition in soil assimilation the only undetermined no3 loss process was deducted in the net nitrification rates eleven functional genes i e amoa aob amoa aoa nxra narg napa nirs nirk noszi noszii hzsa and nrfa were amplified by qpcr briefly dna was extracted from the soils and sediments using a powersoil dna isolation kit qiagen the copies of the genes were quantified by applying the sybrgreen qpcr method with a real time pcr system roche lightcycler480 the qpcr primer pairs and thermal conditions were provided in table s2 to establish the standard curves a 10 fold dilution series of known amounts of plasmid containing the target genes were used as the standards 2 4 statistical analyses the data were analyzed with the shapiro wilk test for normality spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationships between physicochemical parameters gene abundances and n transformation rates one way anova was used to evaluate the differences in the parameters multiple regression analyses with stepwise selection p 0 05 and mantel tests applying spearman correlations were used to identify the key drivers of the n transformations a bayesian isotopic mixing model r package siar was employed to estimate the no3 sources parnell et al 2010 korth et al 2014 the endmembers for no3 sources ap son cf and ma sw were adopted from our previous study li et al 2022 which were given in table s3 the source apportionments were conducted for the upper reaches js 1 to 10 and lower reaches js 11 to 18 respectively in the two seasons structural equation models sem amos 22 0 amos development corporation were applied to elucidate the direct and indirect effects of the biotic and abiotic variables on the n transformation rates the sems were constructed based on the basic ecological principles and the results of the spearman correlations and stepwise regression analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of nitrate in the river waters the no3 n no2 and nh4 n concentrations were 0 17 0 71 mg l 1 mean sd 0 49 0 14 mg l 1 0 02

table s4 no3 was the dominant dissolved inorganic n species in both seasons the no3 n concentrations were higher than the average value for global rivers 0 3 0 2 mg l 1 matiatos et al 2021 implying intense natural no3 production in the catchment e g nitrification of forest son the mean chl a concentrations in the river were low 1 07 0 36 μg l 1 in summer and 0 34 0 13 μg l 1 in winter and there was no clear relationships between the no3 and chl a concentrations p 0 05 indicating in stream assimilation was likely minor cl is a widely used indicator of ma sw as they have high cl concentrations and very low no3 cl ratios chen et al 2009 significant correlations were obtained between the no3 n and cl concentrations in the main stream p 0 05 fig s1 suggesting that ma sw was a nonnegligible source of the no3 n in the main stream the no3 concentrations showed a general increasing trend fig 2 a which is likely associated with increasing anthropogenic activities downstream as more villages are distributed in the lower reaches the decreasing no3 cl ratios downstream fig 2b might imply increasing ma sw inputs seasonally the no3 n concentrations were higher in summer p 0 05 fig 2a albeit the high river discharge implying soil sources to be the major no3 sources the no3 cl ratios were also higher in summer p 0 001 fig 2b suggesting more inputs from soil sources the δ15n no3 varied from 8 37 to 3 29 2 42 3 62 in summer and 0 66 to 4 26 1 76 1 44 in winter table s4 the mean δ15n no3 values in both seasons were much lower than the global mean of 7 1 3 8 matiatos et al 2021 but were in the typical range for pristine or minimally disturbed rivers 1 to 8 mueller et al 2016 liu et al 2022b the low δ15n no3 values suggest much of the riverine no3 was from 15n depleted sources such as son and cf in summer no clear spatial trend of δ15n no3 values were observed fig 2c in contrast the δ15n no3 values showed an increasing trend downstream in winter fig 2c seasonally the higher 15n no3 values were observed in winter p 0 001 fig 2c which might be ascribed to more inputs from ma sw or more 15n enrichment associated with no3 removal kendall et al 2007 the δ18o no3 values were from 1 80 to 0 89 1 03 0 84 in summer and 2 67 to 2 35 0 82 1 20 in winter table s4 which are comparable to those of other mountainous rivers xia et al 2019 sebestyen et al 2019 but lower than the global mean value 2 3 6 2 matiatos et al 2021 the low δ18o no3 of the jinshui river may be a result of the low precipitation δ18o h2o which is incorporated in the no3 during nitrification there was no discernible spatial pattern in the δ18o no3 values in both seasons fig 2d 3 2 catchment scale no3 cycling processes revealed by natural abundance isotopes classic keeling plots δ15n δ18o versus 1 no3 were applied to identify the key no3 cycling processes in the catchment kendall et al 2007 simple mixing between two no3 sources can lead to a line between δ15n δ18o no3 and 1 no3 whereas biological no3 removal processes produce a curve furthermore biological no3 removal will result in a negative line between δ15n δ18o no3 and ln no3 or a co enrichment in the dual isotopes mariotti et al 1981 no clear relationship between δ15n no3 and 1 no3 or between δ18o no3 and 1 no3 was obtained p 0 05 figs 3 a c indicating simple mixing between two no3 sources was inadequate to explain the isotopic compositions in both seasons that is the no3 may have multiple sources or have undergone significant biological removal processes there was no clear correlation between δ15n δ18o no3 and ln no3 p 0 05 figs 3b d suggesting that no3 removal might be minor relative to no3 production in the catchment the weak no3 removal was also supported by the unclear relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 05 fig 4 b thus the conservative mixing of no3 from multiple sources likely dominated the no3 processes in the catchment the no3 cl ratios showed wide ranges 1 6 to 43 6 in summer and 0 6 to 1 8 in winter also suggesting more than one source of no3 fig 4a while the data points were distributed near the ap end member in fig 4a the direct contributions from ap to no3 should be insignificant because the δ18o no3 compositions of the river were far lower than the end member for ap fig 4b most of the data points were distributed near the son end member implying mineralization nitrification of son as a predominate source of the riverine no3 fig 4b the dominant role of son in contributing to the no3 is expected given forest covered more than 95 of the catchment area notably the data points showed a rough trend toward the ma sw and cf end members fig 4b this is reasonable as small villages and farmlands were scattered in the catchment table s1 in summer son and cf were the dominant sources of the riverine no3 accounting for mean sd 42 1 17 4 and 40 4 11 1 in the upper reaches and 38 7 20 5 and 42 1 14 5 in the lower reaches figs 5 a b the contributions of ma sw were relatively insignificant in summer figs 5a b there was no clear spatial variation in the no3 sources in summer figs 5a b in winter son was the dominant source accounting for 57 0 20 4 and 45 7 19 5 of the riverine no3 in the upper and lower reaches respectively fig 5c d as no fertilization occurred in winter the proportional contributions of cf were lower than those in summer fig 5 however the proportional contributions of ma sw increased in winter especially in the lower reaches 32 0 9 7 fig 5 the direct inputs from ap were insignificant in the seasons the no3 apportionment results are consistent with the water chemistry and isotopic composition analyses overall from the perspective of the river s isotopic compositions the no3 removal processes were likely minor in the catchment and the riverine no3 loadings were largely regulated by no3 originating from the nitrification of son and cf and direct external inputs from ma sw yet it is worth noting that the river s isotopic signal associated with biological no3 turnovers could be masked by some factors e g the coupling of multiple transformation processes and the spatial distribution of no3 sources in addition where the nitrification processes occur in soil versus in stream in the catchment remains unclear requiring more evidence from the microenvironment i e soils and sediments to reveal see below 3 3 rates of the processes regulating the nitrate loadings in the soils and streams in the sediments and soils the rates of the no3 related processes showed substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity tables s5 s6 in summer the nitrification denitrification anammox and dnra rates in the soils were 9 45 3 58 mg n kg 1 d 1 0 88 0 70 mg n kg 1 d 1 0 26 0 23 mg n kg 1 d 1 and 0 42 1 21 mg n kg 1 d 1 respectively and 10 17 1 25 mg n kg 1 d 1 1 78 2 19 mg n kg 1 d 1 0 28 0 21 mg n kg 1 d 1 and 0 69 0 81 mg n kg 1 d 1 in the sediments respectively fig 6 a spatially the rates of denitrification anammox and dnra in the soils increased with elevations in summer p 0 05 while in winter the vertical trend was not observed p 0 05 fig s2 in the sediments except for dnra in summer which increased with elevations p 0 05 there was no clear vertical trend in the rates fig s2 in both the soils and the sediments the rates of total no3 removal were insignificantly lower than those of nitrification p 0 01 fig 6a the rates in the microenvironments support the results from the river s isotopes which suggested that no3 removal was minor in the catchment while the rates in the sediments and soils were similar the small river channel area in the catchment 1 may indicate a minor role for sedimentary no3 production at the catchment scale nitrification would be generally greater in sediments than the overlying water in a river due to the greater microbial biomass and nutrient contents within the sediments repert et al 2014 therefore nitrification in the river water column should also be minor that is the riverine no3 loadings were predominantly produced in the soils the conclusion is supported by the source apportionment results fig 5a the consistent results of the river isotopes catchment scale and microenvironment measurements confirmed the representativeness of the microscopic processes at the catchment scale the rates of nitrification in the soils far exceeded the global mean 3 2 mg n kg 1 d 1 whereas the rates of denitrification the major no3 removal pathway 56 8 fig 6a were much lower than the global mean 3 5 mg n kg 1 d 1 li et al 2020 2022 the effect of anammox on no3 removal was relatively minimal accounting for 16 5 of the total no3 removal fig 6a the rates for dnra which was responsible for 26 7 of the total no3 removal were slightly higher than the global mean 0 31 mg n kg 1 d 1 cheng et al 2022 as most of the nitrification in the catchment occurred in the soils the prevailing nitrification of soil sources son and cf was largely responsible for the riverine no3 which well matched the source apportionment results fig 5a in winter nitrification rates in both the soils mean sd 0 06 0 04 n kg 1 d 1 and sediments 0 10 0 10 n kg 1 d 1 were minor and significantly weaker than the total no3 removal 1 01 1 43 n kg 1 d 1 and 1 10 1 61 n kg 1 d 1 respectively figs 6b d also the correlation between δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o was insignificant in winter p 0 05 therefore the legacy no3 produced in warm seasons might contribute to the high no3 levels in winter the weak no3 removal signal of the river s isotopes in winter implies the no3 removal was minor relative to the no3 stock in the catchment but notably dnra outcompeted denitrification and was the most important no3 removal pathway in winter fig 6b overall combining the perspectives of natural abundance isotopes and 15n labeling techniques we effectively and quantitatively revealed the no3 related processes in the catchment however the biotic and abiotic driving forces of the no3 production nitrification and removal processes remained unclear see below 3 4 driving forces of the no3 related processes given the soil sources i e son and cf and in soil processes dominated the no3 production at the catchment scale we focused on assessing the driving mechanisms of the in soil no3 turnover processes it is well documented that n transformation rates in soils are regulated by environmental conditions e g temperature ph moisture and c and n contents and biological activities zhu et al 2018 zhang et al 2023 there was considerable variability in the n transformation rates in the soils which appeared to be closely associated with selective abiotic and biotic factors functional gene abundances fig s3 tables s7 s8 a stepwise multiple regression analysis suggested that nh4 n was the key factor affecting the nitrification rate in summer explaining 35 6 of the variation table 1 the sem r2 0 65 matched the stepwise multiple regression analyses showing the nitrification rates were significantly regulated by nh4 n and amoa aob fig 7 a as nitrification is a biochemical reaction it is inevitably regulated by a catalyzer amoa aob and its substrate nh4 n the amoa aob gene abundance was largely regulated by elevation fig 7a the high elevation regions have high plant richness resulting in the high soil nutrient contents especially nh4 n and microbial biomass all of which are conducive to nitrification fig 7a cf application in the catchment c a 800 kg n hm 2 could significantly stimulate in soil nitrification by increasing the soil nh4 content fig 5a in winter the freezing temperature limited microbial nitrification studies showed that nitrification reduced substantially when temperature dropped from the optimum temperature c a 25 c zaman and chang 2004 the stepwise multiple regression analyses and sem r2 0 93 suggested the soil denitrification rates in both summer and winter were predominantly controlled by moisture content table 1 fig 7b high soil moisture content can limit the availability of o2 which favors denitrification wong et al 2018 ma et al 2020 the overall weak denitrification was limited by the low soil moisture which can largely be ascribed to the strong water and soil erosion bu et al 2009b 2010 the moisture content was regulated by elevation in summer fig 7b and fig s3 in the high elevation areas the forest vegetation coverage results in a thick litter layer and better water holding capacity leading to the higher denitrification fig 7b in contrast the correlations between denitrification and the functional genes were insignificant fig s3 the nirk gene abundance even has a negative effect on the denitrification rates in summer fig 7b a recent study has also found that denitrification can increase significantly in substrate replete settings despite a decrease in soil microbial biomass wang et al 2018 the anammox appeared to be associated with moisture and tn in summer table 1 as anammox is an anaerobic process it was not unexpected that anammox was regulated by moisture tn is significantly correlated with nh4 n fig 7c which is the substrate of anammox there was no clear correlation between the dnra and their substrates or functional genes in summer table 1 and dnra was correlated with ph fig 7d and table 1 stevens et al 1998 cheng et al 2022 the prevailing nitrification outcompeted denitrification anammox and dnra in the consumption of no2 resulting in relatively low rates for those processes in addition we found a positive correlation between anammox and denitrification r2 0 76 p 0 01 fig s4a because denitrification can produce no2 the electron acceptor for anammox in winter anammox was associated with hzsa gene tn and a p but no parameter was significantly correlated with dnra table 1 while the cold weather could limit denitrification anammox and dnra the competition for no2 by nitrification was weak due to the minor nitrification fig 6b consequently the no3 removal pathways in winter did not decrease as significantly as nitrification in winter figs 6a b these correlations suggest that although the biotic and abiotic factors directly regulate no3 related processes these processes are tightly coupled and must be considered as a whole francis et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 3 5 nitrate transport from soils to river the prevailing no3 production in the soils could significantly affect the riverine no3 through hydrological processes in the catchment to evaluate the role of hydrological processes and associated no3 transport in regulating the no3 concentrations deuterium excess d excess which is calculated by δd h2o 8δ18o h2o was introduced jiang et al 2022 high d excess values indicate small evaporation ratios dansgaard 1964 bajjali et al 1997 as the small catchment has a relatively uniform vapor source the higher d excess indicates less evaporation shorter water residence time more surface subsurface runoff and thus more intense soil leaching zhong et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 in this river significant negative relationships between δ15n no3 and d excess were observed fig 8 a suggesting the transport of 15n depleted no3 from soils to the river was largely regulated by the intensity of soil leaching meanwhile the stronger soil leaching higher d excess showed an concentration effect on the riverine no3 in summer fig 8b therefore the intense soil leaching in the catchment could couple with the no3 replete conditions in the soils associated with the intensive no3 production leading to the high no3 concentrations in the minimally disturbed river in summer liu et al 2022 yet no clear concentration effect was observed for the 4 most downstream samples in winter fig 8b as the flux of soil no3 was relatively small in winter due to the limited rainfall the impact of soil leaching on the no3 concentrations was likely confounded by the input of point sources ma sw in the lower reaches 4 conclusions and perspectives through the joint application of isotopic and microbial molecular techniques we explicitly revealed the mechanisms underlying the high no3 levels in a minimally disturbed river the no3 dual isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 indicated that no3 removal was minor at the catchment scale son and cf were the major sources of the riverine no3 in summer while the role of ma sw cannot be overlooked in winter the rate determinations in the microenvironments i e soils and sediments by 15n labeling techniques supported the river s isotopes showing nitrification prevailed while the no3 removal pathways i e denitrification anammox and dnra were weak in summer the intense nitrification was driven by amoa aob gene abundances and nh4 n contents the intense soil leaching and the no3 replete conditions in the soils associated with the intensive no3 production resulted in the high riverine no3 concentrations in summer in winter nitrification was minor in the soils which was constrained by the low temperature however the legacy no3 produced in warmer periods and to a lesser extent point sources continued to support the high no3 level in the river these findings are important for understanding the high no3 levels in pristine or minimally disturbed rivers worldwide

14697,elevated riverine nitrate no3 levels have led to increased eutrophication and other ecological implications while high riverine no3 levels were generally ascribed to anthropogenic activities high no3 levels in some pristine or minimally disturbed rivers were reported the drivers of these unexpectedly high no3 levels remain unclear this study combined natural abundance isotopes 15n labeling techniques and molecular techniques to reveal the processes driving the high no3 levels in a sparsely populated forest river the natural abundance isotopes revealed that the no3 was mainly from soil sources and that no3 removal processes were insignificant the 15n labeling experiments also quantitatively showed that the biological no3 removal processes i e denitrification dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox in the soils and sediments were weak relative to nitrification in summer while nitrification was minor in winter the no3 removal was insignificant relative to the large no3 stock in the catchment stepwise multiple regression analyses and structural equation models revealed that in summer nitrification in the soils was regulated by the amoa aob gene abundances and nh4 n contents low temperature constrained nitrification in winter denitrification was largely controlled by moisture content in both seasons and anammox and dnra could be explained by the competition with nitrification and denitrification on their substrate nitrite no2 we also revealed the strong hydrological control on the transport of soil no3 to the river

introduction nitrogen n is a major but usually limiting nutrient element for living organisms kuypers et al 2018 in the past few decades increasing agricultural domestic and industrial activities have more than doubled the production of reactive n fowler et al 2013 stevens 2019 and a large portion of the reactive n produced especially nitrate no3 has entered the aquatic ecosystems particularly rivers through terrestrial leaching and atmospheric precipitation the excess no3 has led to eutrophication and cascading environmental implications e g hypoxia algal blooms and fish kills hobbie et al

relevance in freshwater environments compared to denitrification assimilation and dnra only transform no3 without releasing n2 in addition to the complex no3 sources and transformations the processes cannot be considered in isolation because they are tightly coupled francis et al 2007 zhou et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 rivers are receptors for the no3 produced in their respective drainages jiang et al 2022 the natural abundance isotopes of no3 δ15n δ17o δ18o no3 in a river contain compositive information on the no3 sources and biogeochemical turnovers in a catchment kendall et al 2007 jiang et al 2020 liu et al 2022a these isotopic indicators are based on the distinct isotopic signatures of the no3 sources and the predictable isotope fractionation signals for the different no3 transformation processes xue et al 2009 jiang et al 2021a pan et al 2021 while there are increasing numbers of studies accessing the spatiotemporal sources and turnovers of no3 at catchment scales using river s natural abundance isotopes there are several deficiencies associated with this method 1 the isotopic signals of the no3 sources and transformations are often overlapping zarnetske et al 2012 zhu et al 2018 meghdadi and javar 2018 archana et al 2018 kobayashi et al 2019 and 2 it cannot accurately determine where in the catchment the no3 yield processes are occurring meghdadi and javar 2018 xia et al 2018 thus the no3 related processes in a catchment revealed by the river s isotopes are somewhat speculative jiang et al 2021b 15n labeling techniques can quantify the rates of no3 related processes in microenvironments such as river sediments and soils risgaard petersen et al 2003 zhu et al 2018 providing complementary signatures for the co occurring no3 transformation processes and no3 production and removal hot spots can also be identified pasten zapata et al 2014 guo et al 2023 in addition microorganisms are important drivers of no3 transformations molecular techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reactions qpcr can be used to analyze the abundances of key enzyme encoding genes involved in no3 cycling e g amoa nxra nitrification narg nirk nirs nosz denitrification hzsa hzsb anammox and nrfa dnra nelson et al 2016 nadeau et al 2019 on this basis we can access the driving mechanism of the no3 related processes from a microscopic perspective by establishing relationships between the rates and the biotic and physicochemical factors zhu et al 2013 kim et al 2016 ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 however the no3 cycling processes identified from microscopic studies can be totally different because n biogeochemistry is highly heterogeneous in microenvironments mcclain et al 2003 nadeau et al 2019 fortunately integrated no3 cycling information obtained at the catchment scale from river s natural abundance isotopes can attest to the reliability of the information acquired from labeled isotopes and molecular techniques in the microenvironments therefore natural abundance isotopes labeled isotopes and molecular techniques can provide complementary information for catchment scale n cycling studies for this study we collected river waters soils and sediments from the jinshui river catchment in central china although the catchment is forested and minimally disturbed it has one of the highest no3 concentrations ever recorded in a forested river catchment binkley et al 2004 li et al 2022 thus this catchment provides a window to elucidate the mechanisms driving high no3 levels in minimally disturbed rivers we took advantage of the natural abundance labeled isotopes and molecular techniques qpcr to determine the processes regulating the high no3 levels and their driving mechanisms at the catchment scale we aimed to address two questions 1 what were the critical processes involved in no3 cycling in the catchment 2 what were the key driving factors of the high riverine no3 loadings we expected combining these approaches could generate key clues for resolving these questions and help to breach the barrier between the catchment and microenvironmental scales thereby achieving a methodological improvement in the study of n cycling at catchment scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 general setting of the jinshui river catchment the catchment 33 16 n to 33 45 n 107 40 e to 108 10 e is located in central china the jinshui river has a length of 87 km an elevation gradient of 2590 m and a catchment area of 730 km2 bu et al 2009a zhao et al 2020 the catchment is characterized by a monsoon climate bu et al 2010 with an annual average temperature of 11 5 14 5 c the annual average precipitation is 950 1200 mm which is mostly concentrated in summer wang et al 2014 the river flow pattern follows that of the precipitation with july to september being the high flow period li et al 2022 the catchment is nearly pristine with a population density of 26 people km 2 forest covers more than 95 of the catchment abies chensiensis abies fargesii and pinus armandii are the dominant tree species few n fixing tree species were distributed in the catchment the soils of the catchment are generally thin and prone to erosion bu et al 2009b several small villages are distributed in the catchment with cultivation being the major human activity fig 1b table s1 the main crops cultivated in the catchment were corn and rice the major fertilizer applied is urea with an average fertilization rate of c a 800 kg n hm 2 there is no industry or animal husbandry in the catchment zhang et al 2010 2 2 field sampling field samplings were conducted in july summer and december winter 2021 to explore the seasonal no3 cycling dynamics a total of 18 sampling sites were set in the catchment including 12 main stream sites and 6 tributary sites fig 1 river water soil and sediment samples were collected from each site during the field campaigns the samples were collected around noon for 5 consecutive days no extreme weather

collected in a 50 ml centrifuge tube for the water isotope δ18o h2o and δd h2o analyses river sediments were collected from the midchannel of the river based on a 1 meter interval grid and 25 parallel sediments 5 5 were well mixed to form one sample c a 5 kg at each site surface forest soils yellow brown were collected from the nearby river banks using a shovel after removing the overlying grasses

immediately frozen in liquid n for subsequent qpcr detection 2 3 analytical procedures the cl no2 and no3 concentrations in the waters were determined by an ics 900 ion chromatography system dionex with uncertainties of c a 5 the δ15n δ18o no3 were measured using the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 briefly no3 was reduced to nitrous oxide n2o by a denitrifier pseudomonas aureofaciens and then its δ15n and δ18o compositions were measured with a mat 253 thermo fisher scientific with uncertainties of 0 3 the δd h2o and δ18o h2o were determined using an l1102 i isotope analyzer picarro

spectrophotometry bottomley et al 2020 the available phosphorus a p was also determined using spectrophotometry after extraction with 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 bottomley et al 2020 the total n tn and total organic carbon toc contents were measured using a vario el cube elemental analyzer elementar the potential denitrification anammox and dnra rates were determined using the 15n labeling method risgaard petersen et al 2003 deng et al 2015 zhao et al 2021 the details of the labeling experiments are given in supporting information in brief a series of pre incubation experiments were set to ascertain the ideal pre incubation time 72 h and incubation time 8 h after pre incubation no2 no3 and o2 were effectively removed the samples were spiked with 100 μl 12 mm k15no3 99 2 15n the background samples were preserved immediately and experiment samples were further incubated for 8 h at the in situ temperature the 29n2 and 30n2 concentrations produced were analyzed using an hpr 40 membrane inlet mass spectrometer mims hiden analytical and the rates of denitrification and anammox can be calculated risgaard petersen et al 2003 for the dnra rate determination after the above incubation the samples were purged with he gas then the dnra produced 15nh4 was oxidized into 29n2 and 30n2 by a hypobromite iodine solution the 29n2 and 30n2 concentrations were determined with the mims and the dnra rates were quantified deng et al 2015 the net nitrification rates were determined following bottomley et al 2020 briefly 20 g of field moist soil or sediment was incubated under aerobic conditions in the dark at the in situ temperature for 14 days the nitrification rate was determined from the change in no3 content over time we chose to determine the net nitrification rates in the samples because it was commonly used in the literature see the review by li et al 2020 allowing comparations with other locations in addition in soil assimilation the only undetermined no3 loss process was deducted in the net nitrification rates eleven functional genes i e amoa aob amoa aoa nxra narg napa nirs nirk noszi noszii hzsa and nrfa were amplified by qpcr briefly dna was extracted

the qpcr primer pairs and thermal conditions were provided in table s2 to establish the standard curves a 10 fold dilution series of known amounts of plasmid containing the target genes were used as the standards 2 4 statistical analyses the data were analyzed with the shapiro wilk test for normality spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationships between physicochemical parameters gene abundances and n transformation rates one way anova was used to evaluate the differences in the parameters multiple regression analyses with stepwise selection p 0 05 and mantel tests applying spearman correlations were used to identify the key drivers of the n transformations a bayesian isotopic mixing model r package siar was employed to estimate the no3 sources parnell et al 2010 korth et al 2014 the endmembers for no3 sources ap son cf and ma sw were adopted from our previous study li et al 2022 which were given in table s3 the source apportionments were conducted for the upper reaches js 1 to 10 and lower reaches js 11 to 18 respectively in the two seasons structural equation models sem amos 22 0 amos development corporation were applied to elucidate the direct and indirect effects of the biotic and abiotic variables on the n transformation rates the sems were constructed based on the basic ecological principles and the results of the spearman correlations and stepwise regression analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of nitrate in the river waters the no3 n no2 and nh4 n concentrations were 0 17 0 71 mg l 1 mean sd 0 49 0 14 mg l 1 0 02

table s4 no3 was the dominant dissolved inorganic n species in both seasons the no3 n concentrations were higher than the average value for global rivers 0 3 0 2 mg l 1 matiatos et al 2021 implying intense natural no3 production in the catchment e g nitrification of forest son the mean chl a concentrations in the river were low 1 07 0 36 μg l 1 in summer and 0 34 0 13 μg l 1 in winter and there was no clear relationships between the no3 and chl a concentrations p 0 05 indicating in stream assimilation was likely minor cl is a widely used indicator of ma sw as they have high cl concentrations and very low no3 cl ratios chen et al 2009 significant correlations were obtained between the no3 n and cl concentrations in the main stream p 0 05 fig s1 suggesting that ma sw was a nonnegligible source of the no3 n in the main stream the no3 concentrations showed a general increasing trend fig 2 a which is likely associated with increasing anthropogenic activities downstream as more villages are distributed in the lower reaches the decreasing no3 cl ratios downstream fig 2b might imply increasing ma sw inputs seasonally the no3 n concentrations were higher in summer p 0 05 fig 2a albeit the high river discharge implying soil sources to be the major no3 sources the no3 cl ratios were also higher in summer p 0 001 fig 2b suggesting more inputs from soil sources the δ15n no3 varied from 8 37 to 3 29 2 42 3 62 in summer and 0 66 to 4 26 1 76 1 44 in winter table s4 the mean δ15n no3 values in both seasons were much lower than the global mean of 7 1 3 8 matiatos et al 2021 but were in the typical range for pristine or minimally disturbed rivers 1 to 8 mueller et al 2016 liu et al 2022b the low δ15n no3 values suggest much of the riverine no3 was from 15n depleted sources such as son and cf in summer no clear spatial trend of δ15n no3 values were observed fig 2c in contrast the δ15n no3 values showed an increasing trend downstream in winter fig 2c seasonally the higher 15n no3 values were observed in winter p 0 001 fig 2c which might be ascribed to more inputs from ma sw or more 15n enrichment associated with no3 removal kendall et al 2007 the δ18o no3 values were from 1 80 to 0 89 1 03 0 84 in summer and 2 67 to 2 35 0 82 1 20 in winter table s4 which are comparable to those of other mountainous rivers xia et al 2019 sebestyen et al 2019 but lower than the global mean value 2 3 6 2 matiatos et al 2021 the low δ18o no3 of the jinshui river may be a result of the low precipitation δ18o h2o which is incorporated in the no3 during nitrification there was no discernible spatial pattern in the δ18o no3 values in both seasons fig 2d 3 2 catchment scale no3 cycling processes revealed by natural abundance isotopes classic keeling plots δ15n δ18o versus 1 no3 were applied to identify the key no3 cycling processes in the catchment kendall et al 2007 simple mixing between two no3 sources can lead to a line between δ15n δ18o no3 and 1 no3 whereas biological no3 removal processes produce a curve furthermore biological no3 removal will result in a negative line between δ15n δ18o no3 and ln no3 or a co enrichment in the dual isotopes mariotti et al 1981 no clear relationship between δ15n no3 and 1 no3 or between δ18o no3 and 1 no3 was obtained p 0 05 figs 3 a c indicating simple mixing between two no3 sources was inadequate to explain the isotopic compositions in both seasons that is the no3 may have multiple sources or have undergone significant biological removal processes there was no clear correlation between δ15n δ18o no3 and ln no3 p 0 05 figs 3b d suggesting that no3 removal might be minor relative to no3 production in the catchment the weak no3 removal was also supported by the unclear relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 05 fig 4 b thus the conservative mixing of no3 from multiple sources likely dominated the no3 processes in the catchment the no3 cl ratios showed wide ranges 1 6 to 43 6 in summer and 0 6 to 1 8 in winter also suggesting more than one source of no3 fig 4a while the data points were distributed near the ap end member in fig 4a the direct contributions from ap to no3 should be insignificant because the δ18o no3 compositions of the river were far lower than the end member for ap fig 4b most of the data points were distributed near the son end member implying mineralization nitrification of son as a predominate source of the riverine no3 fig 4b the dominant role of son in contributing to the no3 is expected given forest covered more than 95 of the catchment area notably the data points showed a rough trend toward the ma sw and cf end members fig 4b this is reasonable as small villages and farmlands were scattered in the catchment table s1 in summer son and cf were the dominant sources of the riverine no3 accounting for mean sd 42 1 17 4 and 40 4 11 1 in the upper reaches and 38 7 20 5 and 42 1 14 5 in the lower reaches figs 5 a b the contributions of ma sw were relatively insignificant in summer figs 5a b there was no clear spatial variation in the no3 sources in summer figs 5a b in winter son was the dominant source accounting for 57 0 20 4 and 45 7 19 5 of the riverine no3 in the upper and lower reaches respectively fig 5c d as no fertilization occurred in winter the proportional contributions of cf were lower than those in summer fig 5 however the proportional contributions of ma sw increased in winter especially in the lower reaches 32 0 9 7 fig 5 the direct inputs from ap were insignificant in the seasons the no3 apportionment results are consistent with the water chemistry and isotopic composition analyses overall from the perspective of the river s isotopic compositions the no3 removal processes were likely minor in the catchment and the riverine no3 loadings were largely regulated by no3 originating from the nitrification of son and cf and direct external inputs from ma sw yet it is worth noting that the river s isotopic signal associated with biological no3 turnovers could be masked by some factors e g the coupling of multiple transformation processes and the spatial distribution of no3 sources in addition where the nitrification processes occur in soil versus in stream in the catchment remains unclear requiring more evidence from the microenvironment i e soils and sediments to reveal see below 3 3 rates of the processes regulating the nitrate loadings in the soils and streams in the sediments and soils the rates of the no3 related processes showed substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity tables s5 s6 in summer the nitrification denitrification anammox and dnra rates in the soils were 9 45 3 58 mg n kg 1 d 1 0 88 0 70 mg n kg 1 d 1 0 26 0 23 mg n kg 1 d 1 and 0 42 1 21 mg n kg 1 d 1 respectively and 10 17 1 25 mg n kg 1 d 1 1 78 2 19 mg n kg 1 d 1 0 28 0 21 mg n kg 1 d 1 and 0 69 0 81 mg n kg 1 d 1 in the sediments respectively fig 6 a spatially the rates of denitrification anammox and dnra in the soils increased with elevations in summer p 0 05 while in winter the vertical trend was not observed p 0 05 fig s2 in the sediments except for dnra in summer which increased with elevations p 0 05 there was no clear vertical trend in the rates fig s2 in both the soils and the sediments the rates of total no3 removal were insignificantly lower than those of nitrification p 0 01 fig 6a the rates in the microenvironments support the results from the river s isotopes which suggested that no3 removal was minor in the catchment while the rates in the sediments and soils were similar the small river channel area in the catchment 1 may indicate a minor role for sedimentary no3 production at the catchment scale nitrification would be generally greater in sediments than the overlying water in a river due to the greater microbial biomass and nutrient contents within the sediments repert et al 2014 therefore nitrification in the river water column should also be minor that is the riverine no3 loadings were predominantly produced in the soils the conclusion is supported by the source apportionment results fig 5a the consistent results of the river isotopes catchment scale and microenvironment measurements confirmed the representativeness of the microscopic processes at the catchment scale the rates of nitrification in the soils far exceeded the global mean 3 2 mg n kg 1 d 1 whereas the rates of denitrification the major no3 removal pathway 56 8 fig 6a were much lower than the global mean 3 5 mg n kg 1 d 1 li et al 2020 2022 the effect of anammox on no3 removal was relatively minimal accounting for 16 5 of the total no3 removal fig 6a the rates for dnra which was responsible for 26 7 of the total no3 removal were slightly higher than the global mean 0 31 mg n kg 1 d 1 cheng et al 2022 as most of the nitrification in the catchment occurred in the soils the prevailing nitrification of soil sources son and cf was largely responsible for the riverine no3 which well matched the source apportionment results fig 5a in winter nitrification rates in both the soils mean sd 0 06 0 04 n kg 1 d 1 and sediments 0 10 0 10 n kg 1 d 1 were minor and significantly weaker than the total no3 removal 1 01 1 43 n kg 1 d 1 and 1 10 1 61 n kg 1 d 1 respectively figs 6b d also the correlation between δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o was insignificant in winter p 0 05 therefore the legacy no3 produced in warm seasons might contribute to the high no3 levels in winter the weak no3 removal signal of the river s isotopes in winter implies the no3 removal was minor relative to the no3 stock in the catchment but notably dnra outcompeted denitrification and was the most important no3 removal pathway in winter fig 6b overall combining the perspectives of natural abundance isotopes and 15n labeling techniques we effectively and quantitatively revealed the no3 related processes in the catchment however the biotic and abiotic driving forces of the no3 production nitrification and removal processes remained unclear see below 3 4 driving forces of the no3 related processes given the soil sources i e son and cf and in soil processes dominated the no3 production at the catchment scale we focused on assessing the driving mechanisms of the in soil no3 turnover processes it is well documented that n transformation rates in soils are regulated by environmental conditions e g temperature ph moisture and c and n contents and biological activities zhu et al 2018 zhang et al 2023 there was considerable variability in the n transformation rates in the soils which appeared to be closely associated with selective abiotic and biotic factors functional gene abundances fig s3 tables s7 s8 a stepwise multiple regression analysis suggested that nh4 n was the key factor affecting the nitrification rate in summer explaining 35 6 of the variation table 1 the sem r2 0 65 matched the stepwise multiple regression analyses showing the nitrification rates were significantly regulated by nh4 n and amoa aob fig 7 a as nitrification is a biochemical reaction it is inevitably regulated by a catalyzer amoa aob and its substrate nh4 n the amoa aob gene abundance was largely regulated by elevation fig 7a the high elevation regions have high plant richness resulting in the high soil nutrient contents especially nh4 n and microbial biomass all of which are conducive to nitrification fig 7a cf application in the catchment c a 800 kg n hm 2 could significantly stimulate in soil nitrification by increasing the soil nh4 content fig 5a in winter the freezing temperature limited microbial nitrification studies showed that nitrification reduced substantially when temperature dropped from the optimum temperature c a 25 c zaman and chang 2004 the stepwise multiple regression analyses and sem r2 0 93 suggested the soil denitrification rates in both summer and winter were predominantly controlled by moisture content table 1 fig 7b high soil moisture content can limit the availability of o2 which favors denitrification wong et al 2018 ma et al 2020 the overall weak denitrification was limited by the low soil moisture which can largely be ascribed to the strong water and soil erosion bu et al 2009b 2010 the moisture content was regulated by elevation in summer fig 7b and fig s3 in the high elevation areas the forest vegetation coverage results in a thick litter layer and better water holding capacity leading to the higher denitrification fig 7b in contrast the correlations between denitrification and the functional genes were insignificant fig s3 the nirk gene abundance even has a negative effect on the denitrification rates in summer fig 7b a recent study has also found that denitrification can increase significantly in substrate replete settings despite a decrease in soil microbial biomass wang et al 2018 the anammox appeared to be associated with moisture and tn in summer table 1 as anammox is an anaerobic process it was not unexpected that anammox was regulated by moisture tn is significantly correlated with nh4 n fig 7c which is the substrate of anammox there was no clear correlation between the dnra and their substrates or functional genes in summer table 1 and dnra was correlated with ph fig 7d and table 1 stevens et al 1998 cheng et al 2022 the prevailing nitrification outcompeted denitrification anammox and dnra in the consumption of no2 resulting in relatively low rates for those processes in addition we found a positive correlation between anammox and denitrification r2 0 76 p 0 01 fig s4a because denitrification can produce no2 the electron acceptor for anammox in winter anammox was associated with hzsa gene tn and a p but no parameter was significantly correlated with dnra table 1 while the cold weather could limit denitrification anammox and dnra the competition for no2 by nitrification was weak due to the minor nitrification fig 6b consequently the no3 removal pathways in winter did not decrease as significantly as nitrification in winter figs 6a b these correlations suggest that although the biotic and abiotic factors directly regulate no3 related processes these processes are tightly coupled and must be considered as a whole francis et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 3 5 nitrate transport from soils to river the prevailing no3 production in the soils could significantly affect the riverine no3 through hydrological processes in the catchment to evaluate the role of hydrological processes and associated no3 transport in regulating the no3 concentrations deuterium excess d excess which is calculated by δd h2o 8δ18o h2o was introduced jiang et al 2022 high d excess values indicate small evaporation ratios dansgaard 1964 bajjali et al 1997 as the small catchment has a relatively uniform vapor source the higher d excess indicates less evaporation shorter water residence time more surface subsurface runoff and thus more intense soil leaching zhong et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 in this river significant negative relationships between δ15n no3 and d excess were observed fig 8 a suggesting the transport of 15n depleted no3 from soils to the river was largely regulated by the intensity of soil leaching meanwhile the stronger soil leaching higher d excess showed an concentration effect on the riverine no3 in summer fig 8b therefore the intense soil leaching in the catchment could couple with the no3 replete conditions in the soils associated with the intensive no3 production leading to the high no3 concentrations in the minimally disturbed river in summer liu et al 2022 yet no clear concentration effect was observed for the 4 most downstream samples in winter fig 8b as the flux of soil no3 was relatively small in winter due to the limited rainfall the impact of soil leaching on the no3 concentrations was likely confounded by the input of point sources ma sw in the lower reaches 4 conclusions and perspectives through the joint application of isotopic and microbial molecular techniques we explicitly revealed the mechanisms underlying the high no3 levels in a minimally disturbed river the no3 dual isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 indicated that no3 removal was minor at the catchment scale son and cf were the major sources of the riverine no3 in summer while the role of ma sw cannot be overlooked in winter the rate determinations in the microenvironments i e soils and sediments by 15n labeling techniques supported the river s isotopes showing nitrification prevailed while the no3 removal pathways i e denitrification anammox and dnra were weak in summer the intense nitrification was driven by amoa aob gene abundances and nh4 n contents the intense soil leaching and the no3 replete conditions in the soils associated with the intensive no3 production resulted in the high riverine no3 concentrations in summer in winter nitrification was minor in the soils which was constrained by the low temperature however the legacy no3 produced in warmer periods and to a lesser extent point sources continued to support the high no3 level in the river these findings are important for understanding the high no3 levels in pristine or minimally disturbed rivers worldwide in addition this study shows that coupling the isotopic and molecular techniques can effectively link catchment scale biogeochemistry with microscopic processes thus generating an integrated picture

14698,chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom plays key role as photosensitizer in sunlit surface water environments and it is deeply involved in the photodegradation of contaminants it has recently been shown that sunlight absorption by cdom can be conveniently approximated based on its monochromatic absorption at 560 nm here we show that such an approximation allows for the assessment of cdom photoreactions on a wide global scale and particularly in the latitude belt between 60 s and 60 n global lake databases are currently incomplete as far as water chemistry is concerned but estimates of the content of organic matter are available with such data it is possible to assess global steady state concentrations of cdom triplet states 3cdom which are predicted to reach particularly high values at nordic latitudes during summer due to a combination of high sunlight irradiance and elevated content of organic matter for the first time to our knowledge we are able to model an indirect photochemistry process in inland waters around the globe implications are discussed for the phototransformation of a contaminant that is mainly degraded by reaction with 3cdom clofibric acid lipid regulator metabolite and for the formation of known products on a wide geographic scale ggraphical abstact image graphical abstract keywords photochemistry surface waters micropollutants decontamination ecotoxicological risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction photochemical processes play key role in the transformation of natural compounds and anthropogenic pollutants in surface waters fenner et al 2013 in particular photoreactions are often the only important way by which biorecalcitrant compounds can be transformed in sunlit aquatic environments these processes involve either direct photolysis or transformation by reaction with photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris vione et al 2014 ppris are generated by sunlight irradiation of photosensitizers such as nitrate nitrite and chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom vione et al 2014 main ppris are the hydroxyl oh and carbonate co3 radicals cdom triplet states 3cdom and singlet oxygen 1o2 oh is generated by irradiation of nitrate nitrite and cdom mack and bolton 1999 niu and croué 2019 sun et al 2015 and it is mostly scavenged by dissolved organic matter dom not necessarily chromophoric westerhoff et al 2007 and by inorganic carbon hco3 and co3 2 wojnárovits et al 2020 cdom irradiation is also the source of 3cdom which is quenched by dissolved oxygen mcneill and canonica 2016 the latter quenching reaction gives 1o2 with 50 yield while the main quenching process for 1o2 is collision with the water solvent ossola et al 2021 finally co3 is produced upon oxidation of hco3 co3 2 by oh buxton et al 1988 and upon oxidation of co3 2 by 3cdom canonica et al 2005 scavenging by dom is by far the prevailing pathway of co3 removal from surface waters yan et al 2019 although reactions with contaminants are secondary processes to consume ppris they can play key role in contaminant removal remucal 2014 photochemical generation of ppris in surface waters can be quantitatively assessed with light absorption calculations by taking into account the incident spectrum of sunlight as spectral photon flux density units of einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 and the absorption spectra of photosensitizers absorbance unitless considering that the spectra of both sunlight and photosensitizers are polychromatic the relevant calculations involve numerical integrals vione et al 2014 for instance sunlight absorption by cdom absorbed photon flux units of einstein cm 2 s 1 can be calculated as follows braslavsky 2007 1 p a c d o m λ p λ 1 10 a c d o m λ d λ where p λ is the spectral photon flux density of sunlight and a cdom λ is the absorbance of cdom which is the main sunlight absorber in natural waters because of the integral nature of eq 1 and of similar equations that account for sunlight absorption by nitrate nitrite and contaminants modeling of surface water photoreactivity is usually carried out by means of software packages bodrato and vione 2014 a recent approach has proposed a useful approximation by which absorption of sunlight by photosensitizers can be expressed by means of monochromatic lambert beer equations the agreement between polychromatic and monochromatic equations for radiation absorption can be very good provided that the most suitable wavelength is chosen to assess monochromatic absorption by each photosensitizer or contaminant that is the so called equivalent monochromatic wavelength emw which is for instance 315 nm in the case of nitrate 360 nm for nitrite and 560 nm for cdom vione 2021 the emw approximation allows for considerable simplification of calculation procedures in photochemical modeling which turns out particularly useful when latitude or seasonal effects have to be considered garcía gil et al 2022 vione and carena 2022 an important barrier in the modeling of solar processes is the determination of accurate solar radiation doses since theoretical fair weather solar radiation is a function of the day of the year and the latitude only a few software tools can be found in the literature that return these values unfortunately these are typically black boxes that cannot be coupled to other kinetic processes in this context a recent publication describes the development of a novel algorithm eq 2 to easily predict the daily dose or cumulative irradiance gday for different latitudes and seasons garcía gil et al 2022 2 g d a y λ f 1 p s n λ τ d l where p sn is the incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight at solar noon which is only a function of the day of the year and latitude units of einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 briefly the irradiance reaching the earth s surface can be estimated only with the zenith angle for a given time and latitude which determine the solar position once the zenith angle is defined with expressions that only depend on the latitude and the time of the day the relative atmospheric depth crossed by solar rays air mass and the radiation attenuation by the atmosphere can be calculated consequently the irradiance reaching the earth s surface is defined τ dl is the time from sunrise to sunset units of s the simple procedure to calculate it for latitudes above 60 s and below 60 n can be found in garcía gil et al 2022 again only the day of the year and the latitude are required to this purpose f 1 1 and unitless relates the theoretical daily dose and the hypothetical maximum cumulated incident radiation if the solar photon flux density corresponds to that at solar noon and is constant during the day length this correction is required because the product p sn τ dl assumes that the solar photon flux density corresponds to that at solar noon and is constant during the day and therefore overestimates the daily dose detailed calculation procedures are provided in previous work garcía gil et al 2022 the mentioned algorithm is not applicable to latitudes outside the 60 s 60 n belt but within this latitude range the irradiance of sunlight is high enough to make photochemical processes important in addition the algorithm offers the possibility to calculate the daily dose for each wavelength this issue is very important in the framework of the emw approximation because it potentially allows for easily predicting radiation absorption and therefore seasonal photochemical reactions of nitrate nitrite and cdom on a very wide almost global geographic scale indirect photochemistry depends on the concentration values of water constituents the availability of which on a worldwide scale is still insufficient however a novel machine learning technique has provided an estimate of dissolved organic carbon doc concentration values for many of the world s lakes toming et al 2020 although such data do not allow for an assessment of steady state oh and co3 values which also require nitrate nitrite and inorganic carbon concentrations they allow for a first approximation estimate of 3cdom or 1o2 on this basis this work has the first goal of developing a general procedure that allows for the application of the emw approximation to the photochemistry of cdom on a wide geographic scale it has also the additional goal of providing the first assessment of seasonal 3cdom and hence 1o2 considering that 3cdom 1o2 in well oxygenated waters in the surface water layer of global lakes that are included in the 60 s 60 n latitude belt 2 methods 2 1 spectral photon flux density of sunlight as a function of month and latitude according to the emw approximation sunlight absorption by cdom can be assessed by considering monochromatic absorption at 560 nm this wavelength was chosen because it allows for a good description of the polychromatic system by means of a much simpler monochromatic equation vione 2021 the average incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight at 560 nm p 560 nm was defined following the easy procedure described in garcía gil et al 2022 in that work the term f 1 has been calculated for λ 307 5 nm to assess the direct photoinactivation of the virus phi x174 in the present work f 1 was calculated for λ 560 nm following an otherwise identical procedure which enables a description of cdom photochemistry briefly f 1 was optimized for a latitude of 45 n considering the 15th day of each month january december optimization was carried out by minimizing the normalized root mean square error nrmse between the values of g day 560 nm assessed with eq 2 and the values of the daily dose at 560 nm under the assumption of fair weather conditions the latter dose values were obtained by integrating the curve that describes the photon flux density of sunlight p 560 nm t over the time of the day eq 3 such curve was defined with 24 points i e one point for each hour of the day time step 3600 s 3 g day 560 nm 1 day p 560 nm t dt each value of p 560 nm t was computed by introducing the zenith angle obtained with the solar position algorithm spa from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel national renewable energy laboratory solar position algorithm nrel 2022 for each hour of the day the same method was used to obtain p sn 560 nm p 560 nm 12 h garcía gil et al 2022 in particular p sn 560 nm for use in eq 2 is expressed as follows λ 560 nm 4 p sn λ i am 0 λ exp κ λ cos ϕ δ 0 506 96 08 ϕ δ 1 636 λ hc 1 n a where i am0 is the intensity of sunlight outside the atmosphere κ is the atmospheric extinction coefficient φ is the latitude h is planck s constant c is light s speed in vacuum and n a is avogadro s number moreover sun s declination δ is expressed as δ 23 45 sin 360 365 d a y 284 where day 1 is 1 january and day 365 is 31 december the day length τ dl eq 2 is expressed as τ d l 2 15 arccos tan ϕ tan δ where the value of the arccos is in degrees and τ dl in hours which is valid for 60 s φ 60 n 60 φ 60 f 1 was then optimized by matching g day 560 nm eq 3 with eq 2 the value of f 1 thus obtained is useful if it is valid for all relevant worldwide latitudes to validate f 1 we computed discrete values of g day 560 nm by integration of p 560 nm t over the time of the day for the 15th day of each month and in the latitude range of 60 s to 60 n varied at steps of 5 such discrete integral values were then compared with the curves expressing g day 560 nm vs day of the year obtained by means of eq 2 the degree of agreement was quantified as nrmse once the term f 1 was optimized for λ 560 nm the average incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight at 560 nm p 560 nm was obtained by dividing eq 2 by the day length τ dl 5 p 560 nm f 1 p sn 560 nm the actual daily dose for non fair weather conditions can be calculated by introducing into eq 5 a cloud cover factor f2 that relates the actual and the theoretical fair weather cumulated incident radiation the value of f2 is variable even for the same location and day of the year since it depends on the weather conditions although it can be estimated based on historical data it is strongly preferred to measure the actual irradiance in the field and calculate f2 by dividing the experimental value by the theoretical value therefore the parameter f2 has not been considered in this work however an approximation of annual average values of f2 as a function of the latitude and longitude geocoordinates based on historical data f2 range 0 5 1 can be found in garcía gil et al 2022 2 2 global scale modeling of 3cdom the formation of 3cdom stems from sunlight absorption by cdom and is followed by 3cdom deactivation upon thermal processes or prevalently o2 quenching mcneill and canonica 2016 according to the emw approximation the steady state concentration of 3cdom is expressed as follows note that 3cdom 1o2 in well oxygenated waters thus the 3cdom data can be relevant to 1o2 as well 6 3 cdo m φ app 3 cdo m p a cdom 560 nm k d where φ app 3cdom 0 33 vione 2021 is the photon efficiency for 3cdom formation from irradiated cdom p a cdom 560 nm is the monochromatic photon flux absorbed by cdom at 560 nm and k d is the pseudo first order rate constant of 3cdom quenching by o2 in aerated solution k d 5 105 s 1 mcneill and canonica 2016 the quantum yields quantum efficiencies of 3cdom production by irradiated cdom are quite variable among different cdom types but also the sunlight absorbing properties of cdom vary significantly actually the inverse correlation between sunlight absorption by cdom and 3cdom production efficiency zhou et al 2017 offsets to a certain degree the natural variations of both parameters with the result that both 3cdom formation rate and the steady state 3cdom show lesser environmental variability than either p a cdom or φ app 3cdom taken separately marchisio et al 2015 because the emw approximation considers monochromatic radiation absorption by cdom at 560 nm the relevant calculated absorbed photon flux is much lower than the photon flux of sunlight absorbed by cdom at all the wavelengths this issue is offset by the fact that φ app 3cdom 0 33 mol einstein 1 is much higher than the quantum yield of 3cdom formation from irradiated cdom the value of p a cdom 560 nm was calculated as follows vione 2021 7 p a cdom 560 nm 10 d p 560 nm 1 10 100 a 1 560 nm doc d α d 2 β d γ where p 560 nm was determined with eq 5 furthermore a 1 560 nm 1 10 4 l mgc 1 cm 1 is an average value for the 560 nm absorbance of cdom per unit doc and optical path length of 1 cm vione et al 2010 it was also assumed d 3 m vide infra the exponent αd 2 βd γ has been introduced so that monochromatic absorption by cdom could match the depth trend of polychromatic absorption which extends over several hundreds nm the values α 3 0 10 4 m 2 β 2 2 10 4 m 1 and γ 0 58 have been shown to provide an excellent match between polychromatic and monochromatic absorption for 1 m d 10 m vione 2021 finally 100 is the conversion factor between m and cm while 10 is the conversion factor between cm 2 m 1 and l 1 by comparison the polychromatic expression for sunlight absorption by cdom p a cdom units of einstein l 1 s 1 reads as follows vione 2021 8 p a cdom 10 d λ p λ 1 10 100 a 1 λ doc d d λ the values of p a cdom 560 nm eq 7 and p a cdom eq 8 are the basis for the determination of 3cdom a comparison between polychromatic calculations and the emw approximation is provided in fig 1 the figure shows that the emw approach provides excellent approximation in a rather wide range of depth and doc values thereby simplifying calculations while entailing minimal loss in accuracy it provides further support for the choice of 560 nm as emw considering that all other quantities are known or can be calculated doc is the master variable of eq 7 unfortunately a complete global database of doc values directly measured in surface waters is not available remote sensing by e g satellites gives some possibility to assess doc and or cdom but this technique still has important limitations and can only be applied to small regions at present chen et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in this work we used doc data obtained by toming et al 2020 who employed a novel machine learning technique and global databases to predict the doc values in lakes with a surface area 0 1 km2 input data for machine learning were catchment properties meteorological and hydrological features as well as lake morphometry the latter actually played minor role in doc variability obtained from both worldclim v 2 0 23 and from hydrolakes v 1 0 21 databases toming et al 2020 in particular hydrolakes contains data of over 1 400 000 individual lakes having surface area of at least 0 1 km2 messager et al 2016 to develop the predictive model these databases have been used by toming et al 2020 together with the dataset of measured doc values reported by sobek et al 2007 which consists of doc data of 7500 lakes mainly distributed in the boreal hemisphere the lake doc database by toming et al 2020 was even too large for our purposes and some selection procedures were used to decrease the number of study lakes first of all lakes located above 60 n latitude were excluded because of limits connected with the calculation of p 560 nm note that in the austral hemisphere except for antarctica there are no continents below 60 s latitude moreover although altitude is not the main factor involved in cdom photochemistry zhang et al 2020 mountain environments are characterized by higher values of uv irradiance compared to lowland ones ncar 2015 for this reason lakes located above 500 m a s l were excluded from our study this selection also allowed for reducing issues connected with winter spring ice cover not considered in the model as ice cover can effectively block sunlight penetration in mountain lakes located at temperate latitudes the surface of the lakes here selected is considered ice free regardless of the season finally lakes having average depth lower than 5 m were also excluded to minimize problems due to sediment resuspension that can affect the doc value in shallow lakes the remaining 72 380 lakes had the average depth distribution shown in table 1 the value of 3cdom was then calculated for a surface water layer having d 3 m for which the emw approximation gives excellent results see fig 1 and where photochemical reactions would be very important photochemistry is most effective in the surface water layer vione et al 2014 the use of a standard depth value for all lakes allows for highlighting differences related to doc and latitude that might be of rather general validity while both deep and shallow lakes usually occur within the same region furthermore d 3 m is the standard depth used in the euses multimedia model for regional substance risk assessments finch et al 2017 to connect the lakes with their doc or 3cdom values global mapping of the relevant quantities was carried out by means of the qgis software qgis 2020 2 3 model uncertainty the doc assessment by means of a machine learning model entails a level of uncertainty expressed as standard deviation σ d o c the values of which are reported in toming et al 2020 that is directly reflected into the uncertainty associated with 3cdom σ 3 cdo m from eqs 6 7 and the rules of error propagation the relationship between σ doc and σ 3 cdo m can be expressed as follows text s1 in the supplementary material hereinafter sm 9 σ 3 cdo m 3 cdo m 100 ln 10 a 1 560 nm d α d 2 β d γ 10 100 a 1 560 nm d doc 1 10 100 a 1 560 nm d doc σ doc the distributions of the relative standard deviations of both doc and 3cdom are shown in fig 2 the relative standard deviation on the doc fig 2a is far from negligible but it should be considered that the doc values ranged from 1 to over 20 mgc l 1 therefore distinction between low doc and high doc environments is quite feasible despite the uncertainty as far as the uncertainty on 3cdom is concerned the values reported in fig 2b are lower estimates because additional contributions other than σ d o c should be considered for a proper determination of σ 3 cdo m in particular the following assumptions were made to describe the photochemistry of 3cdom 1 cdom was considered as the main optically active component of lake water in the presence of significant amounts of suspended solids or phytoplankton radiation scattering by the latter would not be much of an issue actually scattering would modify the underwater light field and as a consequence the rates of photochemical reactions as a function of water depth but it would not change much the average reaction rates in the water column scattering would produce higher rates at the water surface which would be offset by lower rates in deeper layers calza and vione 2015 in contrast sunlight absorption by suspended solids or phytoplankton would decrease both absorbed irradiance by cdom and the steady state 3cdom but that would be partially compensated by photoactivity of algal derived organic matter zhang et al 2022 2 the connection between lake water doc and 3cdom required the use of average values of p a cdom 560 nm and φ app 3cdom luckily cdom types having higher p a cdom 560 nm would show lower φ app 3cdom and vice versa see section 2 2 3 fair weather sunlight irradiance was considered here see section 2 1 overall the model values of 3cdom should be considered as order of magnitude estimates that would allow for a distinction between lakes with high or low 3cdom 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization and validation of f1 the first procedure was to find the value of f 1 that best matched the daily doses of radiation integrated with eq 3 and calculated with eq 5 to do so the reference values of g day 560 nm were calculated by 24 h integration of p 560 nm t for the 15th day of each month at 45 n latitude red squares in fig 3 these values were the basis for optimizing f 1 with eq 2 the red curve in fig 3 shows the g day 560 nm predictions with eq 2 using the optimized value f 1 0 82 nrmse 2 such a value f 1 0 82 means that the average photon flux density of sunlight at 560 nm during the day length τ dl is 82 of the photon flux density peak at the solar noon the very good agreement shown in fig 3 suggests that f 1 0 82 can be used all along the year the value of f 1 thus obtained was then validated with predictions of g day 560 nm for latitudes ranging from 60 s to 60 n at 5 steps in a similar way as for the optimization procedure the solid symbols in fig 4 represent the integral of radiation intensity referred to the 15th day of each month conversely curves show predictions obtained with eq 2 and f 1 0 82 the overall agreement was again very good with nrmse 7 for all the latitude range this finding suggests that the optimized value of f 1 can be used conveniently in the whole relevant latitude belt once the algorithm was optimized and validated for λ 560 nm eq 2 could be used to obtain the values of p 560 nm around the world data for each couple of latitude longitude values with steps of 0 5 and for the solstices and equinoxes can be found as a microsoft excel file in the sm 3 2 mapping of 3cdom around the globe from 60 s to 60 n latitude following the selection procedure applied to the doc database of toming et al 2020 the doc map of the selected lakes is provided in fig 5 the fact that the vast majority of the lakes is located in the temperate belt of the boreal hemisphere 30 n 60 n is a phenomenon that does not depend on the selection procedure except for the exclusion of the lakes located above 60 n it is interesting to point out that the highest doc values 9 mgc l 1 are usually observed in eastern europe central asia and canada while lakes located in the tropical belt often show moderate to low doc levels it is also important to observe that the latitude limits of the photochemical model exclude most of the scandinavian peninsula which is very rich in lakes especially finland and where the doc levels are usually very high toming et al 2020 the combination of the doc data with the photon flux density of sunlight eqs 6 7 yielded global maps 60 s 60 n of 3cdom which would also be representative of 1o2 values in well oxygenated waters the 3cdom values thus determined are shown in fig 6 for summer and winter solstices june 21st and december 21st while the maps relative to the spring and fall equinoxes march 20th and september 23rd are shown in figure s4 calculated 3cdom values vary in the range of 10 16 10 15 m it is important to observe that 3cdom is here referred to clear sky conditions thereby representing the maximum steady state concentration that can be reached in a given environment the results shown in figs 6 and s4 suggest that seasonal variations of 3cdom generally follow the relevant variations of solar daily doses fig 4 for this reason the highest values of 3cdom are predicted for the temperate belt of the boreal hemisphere 30 60 n and especially 50 60 n during the summer solstice while the lowest values are predicted for the same areas during the winter solstice the same does not happen in the southern hemisphere partly because there is very little land and as a consequence very few lakes below 45 s and partly because of the relatively low doc values of lake water in these regions fig 5 high water doc in the nordic temperate areas also explains why 3cdom is generally high in these regions at the equinoxes figure s4 while the 560 nm daily dose does not vary as much on a global scale fig 4 as shown in fig 1 3cdom increases with increasing doc 3 3 environmental implications photodegradation of clofibric acid the global distribution of 3cdom can for instance be used to assess the potential of lakes to photodegrade contaminants on the one side photochemical processes taking place in surface waters can depollute water bodies but at the same time contaminant photodegradation can sometimes produce harmful transformation products buth et al 2010 erickson et al 2012 halladja et al 2007 vogna et al 2004 we modeled here the photodegradation of clofibric acid hereinafter clo to show an example of how a global mapping of lake photochemistry and in particular 3cdom can be used clo is a metabolite of blood lipid regulators which has been widely detected in surface waters castiglioni et al 2020 korkmaz et al 2022 sousa et al 2020 where it may be harmful to aquatic organisms coimbra et al 2015 gonzález ortegón et al 2015 clo is significantly transformed by photochemical reactions avetta et al 2016 carena et al 2019 packer et al 2003 with major role played by 3cdom additionally reaction with hydroxyl radicals would play secondary role carena et al 2019 an issue that should be considered in modeling clo photodegradation is that a fraction of photooxidized clo here indicated as clo clo 3cdom clo cdom can be transformed back to the parent compound by the antioxidant moieties contained in dom canonica and laubscher 2008 carena et al 2019 wenk and canonica 2012 furthermore clo photooxidation by 3cdom produces both 4 chlorophenol yield 50 and hydroquinone yield 5 which may represent an additional concern for aquatic ecosystems avetta et al 2016 figs 7 and s5 show the global mapping of the photochemical half life time t 1 2 of clo as accounted for by its main reaction with 3cdom that depicted here is clearly a somewhat fictitious scenario because it assumes that clo occurs in all the studied lakes which is fortunately not the case however it gives insight into the vulnerability of different lake environments to the potential occurrence of clo the half life time t 1 2 was calculated as per eq 10 where k 3 cdo m clo 5 2 109 l mol 1 s 1 carena et al 2019 τ dl is the day length units of h day 1 computed as above and ψ 0 68 0 32 1 10 doc 1 is a parameter that takes into account the back reactions of photooxidized clo with antioxidant dom moieties for details see carena et al 2019 10 t 1 2 ln 2 3600 ψ k 3 cdo m clo 3 cdo m τ dl despite the fact that ψ decreases as the doc increases meaning that ψ also decreases as 3cdom increases because of the proportionality between 3cdom and the doc see fig 1 the value of t 1 2 decreases with increasing 3cdom the obtained results allow for a rough comparison between the predicted photodegradation kinetics and the disappearance of clo in the field a previous study has reported an upper limit for the photodegradation kinetics of clo as k 0 01 day 1 in the epilimnion of lake greinfensee switzerland in late summer depth of the thermocline 10 m note that greinfensee is 30 m deep tixier et al 2003 with our model we obtained k 0 08 day 1 in the greifensee for a water column with depth d 3 m on fall equinox this value has to be corrected for common mid latitude irradiance which is 1 5 times lower compared to a clear sky scenario frank and klöpffer 1988 and for the different water depths 10 m vs 3 m obtaining k 0 02 day 1 this result is not so far from that assessed in the field if one considers all the approximations used in our model note that a two times difference can be also found between the values of 3cdom obtained here and those assessed in a previous study canonica et al 1995 reported in fact 3cdom 10 14 mol l 1 for the top 1 m of lake greinfensee under summer noon sunlight which would mean 10 15 mol l 1 if one considers the entire 10 m epilimnion under the same conditions we predict 3cdom 5 5 10 16 mol l 1 the t 1 2 values of clo follow those of 3cdom the highest 3cdom the lowest t 1 2 see figs 6 and 7 and the maps for the equinoxes in the sm in most cases clo lifetimes range within 4 16 days however the highest seasonal variability is predicted for the temperate areas of the northern hemisphere and especially the 50 60 n latitude belt in that region the calculated values of t 1 2 range from 3 to 4 days at the summer solstice to 16 67 days at the winter solstice the same does not happen in the corresponding region of the southern hemisphere mainly due to scarcity of land and therefore lakes furthermore the few lakes located in that region of the southern hemisphere have relatively low doc which would prevent 3cdom from reaching high values in december and therefore would also prevent t 1 2 from being proportionally low as mentioned before clo photodegradation gives both 4 chlorophenol clphoh with yield η clphoh 0 5 and hydroquinone hq with η hq 0 05 avetta et al 2016 the rate coefficient of clphoh photoformation k f clphoh day 1 units is obtained from the rate constant of clo photodegradation k clo ln 2 t 1 2 1 3600 ψ k 3 c d o m c l o 3 c d o m τ d l as k f clphoh η clphoh k clo 3600 η clphoh ψ k 3 c d o m c l o 3 c d o m τ d l the corresponding rate coefficient for hq is k f hq 0 1 k f clphoh because η hq 0 1 η clphoh the global 60 s φ 60 n maps of k f clphoh which are also indicative of k f hq are shown in figure s6 sm the values of k f clphoh are highest in the temperate areas of the northern hemisphere at the summer solstice and lowest in the same areas at the winter solstice the tropical belt and the southern hemisphere show intermediate values of k f clphoh interestingly clphoh formation in the spring and fall equinoxes is consistently lower in southern china southern japan and the south eastern us compared with other locations at comparable latitude figure s6 sm the most likely explanation lies in the relatively low doc values of the relevant lakes see fig 5 photochemical mapping as per this work can support and potentially be integrated into ecotoxicological risk assessment era in order to see if photochemical reactions taking place in surface waters can act as real self depollution processes for water bodies or if the production of by products upon pollutant photodegradation can increase the ecological risk text s2 describes how the risk quotient rq of a contaminant which is a parameter commonly used in era studies to determine the ecological risk gosset et al 2021 topaz et al 2020 wielens becker et al 2020 can be expressed as a function of parameters describing pollutant photodegradation in a simplified scenario where the photodegradation of clphoh and hq into different transformation products was neglected which is reasonable when considering the evolution of clo clphoh and hq between sunrise and sunset in a single day avetta et al 2016 it could be seen that clo reaction with 3cdom would actually increase the ecological risk and the increase would be higher where the transformation of clo is faster the reason is the higher toxicity for aquatic organisms of both clphoh and hq compared to clo 4 conclusions by applying the emw approximation to the absorption of sunlight by cdom it is possible to approximately predict the steady state 3cdom on the basis of the photon flux density of sunlight at 560 nm and of water doc values the average daily photon flux density can be expressed as p 560 n m f 1 p sn 560 n m where f 1 0 82 the value of p sn 560 nm is referred to the solar noon and can be calculated for any day of the year at any latitude between 60 s and 60 n interestingly the equation for p 560 nm holds at all relevant latitudes and seasons the coupling of cdom absorption assessment with a global database of doc values enables the mapping of 3cdom on a quasi global scale the values of 3cdom generally follow the daily doses of sunlight at the given latitudes and seasons at the spring and fall equinoxes however where such doses vary less with latitude than in other times of the year the usually high doc values of lakes located in temperate areas of the northern hemisphere account for high 3cdom values calculated for this region moreover a combination of high doc and high daily dose explains why the highest values of 3cdom are predicted at 50 60 n during the summer solstice june the same does not happen in the southern hemisphere during the winter solstice december because lake water in the relevant locations is characterized by relatively low values of the doc the 3cdom map is reflected into a map of photodegradation kinetics of compounds that mainly undergo transformation by reaction with 3cdom the case of clofibric acid clo is considered here clear sky clo lifetimes of a couple of weeks or lower are predicted in many parts of the globe in the 3 m uppermost layer of the global lakes in many cases photochemistry contributes to depollution however the 3cdom induced phototransformation of clo into 4 chlorophenol and hydroquinone is likely to increase the ecological risk related to this contaminant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

14698,chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom plays key role as photosensitizer in sunlit surface water environments and it is deeply involved in the photodegradation of contaminants it has recently been shown that sunlight absorption by cdom can be conveniently approximated based on its monochromatic absorption at 560 nm here we show that such an approximation allows for the assessment of cdom photoreactions on a wide global scale and particularly in the latitude belt between 60 s and 60 n global lake databases are currently incomplete as far as water chemistry is concerned but estimates of the content of organic matter are available with such data it is possible to assess global steady state concentrations of cdom triplet states 3cdom which are predicted to reach particularly high values at nordic latitudes during summer due to a combination of high sunlight irradiance and elevated content of organic matter for the first time to our knowledge we are able to model an indirect photochemistry process in inland waters around the globe implications are discussed for the phototransformation of a contaminant that is mainly degraded by reaction with 3cdom clofibric acid lipid regulator metabolite and for the formation of known products on a wide geographic scale ggraphical abstact image graphical abstract keywords photochemistry surface waters micropollutants decontamination ecotoxicological risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction photochemical processes play key role in the transformation of natural compounds and anthropogenic pollutants in surface waters fenner et al 2013 in particular photoreactions are often the only important way by which biorecalcitrant compounds can be transformed in sunlit aquatic environments these processes involve either direct photolysis or transformation by reaction with photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris vione et al 2014 ppris are generated by sunlight irradiation of photosensitizers such as nitrate nitrite and chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom vione et al 2014 main ppris are the hydroxyl oh and carbonate co3 radicals cdom triplet states 3cdom and singlet oxygen 1o2 oh is generated by irradiation of nitrate nitrite and cdom mack and bolton 1999 niu and croué 2019 sun et al 2015 and it is mostly scavenged by dissolved organic matter dom not necessarily chromophoric westerhoff et al 2007 and by inorganic carbon hco3 and co3 2 wojnárovits et al 2020 cdom irradiation is also the source of 3cdom which is quenched by dissolved oxygen mcneill and canonica 2016 the latter quenching reaction gives 1o2 with 50 yield while the main quenching process for 1o2 is collision with the water solvent ossola et al 2021 finally co3 is produced upon oxidation of hco3 co3 2 by oh buxton et al 1988 and upon oxidation of co3 2 by 3cdom canonica et al 2005 scavenging by dom is by far the prevailing pathway of co3 removal from surface waters yan et al 2019 although reactions with contaminants are secondary processes to consume ppris they can play key role in contaminant removal remucal 2014 photochemical generation of ppris in surface waters can be quantitatively assessed with light absorption calculations by taking into account the incident spectrum of sunlight as spectral photon flux density units of einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 and the absorption spectra of photosensitizers absorbance unitless considering that the spectra of both sunlight and photosensitizers are polychromatic the relevant calculations involve numerical integrals vione et al 2014 for instance sunlight absorption by cdom absorbed photon flux units of einstein cm 2 s 1 can be calculated as follows braslavsky 2007 1 p a c d o m λ p λ 1 10 a c d o m λ d λ where p λ is the spectral photon flux density of sunlight and a cdom λ is the absorbance of cdom which is the main sunlight absorber in natural waters because of the integral nature of eq 1 and of similar equations that account for sunlight absorption by nitrate nitrite and contaminants modeling of surface water photoreactivity is usually carried out by means of software packages bodrato and vione 2014 a recent approach has proposed a useful approximation by which absorption of sunlight by photosensitizers can be expressed by means of monochromatic lambert beer equations the agreement between polychromatic and monochromatic equations for radiation absorption can be very good provided that the most suitable wavelength is chosen to assess monochromatic absorption by each photosensitizer or contaminant that is the so called equivalent monochromatic wavelength emw which is for instance 315 nm in the case of nitrate 360 nm for nitrite and 560 nm for cdom vione 2021 the emw approximation allows for considerable simplification of calculation procedures in photochemical modeling which turns out particularly useful when latitude or seasonal effects have to be considered garcía gil et al 2022 vione and carena 2022 an important barrier in the modeling of solar processes is the determination of accurate solar radiation doses since theoretical fair weather solar radiation is a function of the day of the year and the latitude only a few software tools can be found in the literature that return these values unfortunately these are typically black boxes that cannot be coupled to other kinetic processes in this context a recent publication describes the development of a novel algorithm eq 2 to easily predict the daily dose or cumulative irradiance gday for different latitudes and seasons garcía gil et al 2022 2 g d a y λ f 1 p s n λ τ d l where p sn is the incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight at solar noon which is only a function of the day of the year and latitude units of einstein cm 2 s 1 nm 1 briefly the irradiance reaching the earth s surface can be estimated only with the zenith angle for a given time and latitude which determine the solar position once the zenith angle is defined with expressions that only depend on the latitude and the time of the day the relative atmospheric depth crossed by solar rays air mass and the radiation attenuation by the atmosphere can be calculated consequently the irradiance reaching the earth s surface is defined τ dl is the time from sunrise to sunset units of s the simple procedure to calculate it for latitudes above 60 s and below 60 n can be found in garcía gil et al 2022 again only the day of the year and the latitude are required to this purpose f 1 1 and unitless relates the theoretical daily dose and the hypothetical maximum cumulated incident radiation if the solar photon flux density corresponds to that at solar noon and is constant during the day length this correction is required because the product p sn τ dl assumes that the solar photon flux density corresponds to that at solar noon and is constant during the day and therefore overestimates the daily dose detailed calculation procedures are provided in previous work garcía gil et al 2022 the mentioned algorithm is not applicable to latitudes outside the 60 s 60 n belt but within this latitude range the irradiance of sunlight is high enough to make photochemical processes important in addition the algorithm offers the possibility to calculate the daily dose for each wavelength this issue is very important in the framework of the emw approximation because it potentially allows for easily predicting radiation absorption and therefore seasonal photochemical reactions of nitrate nitrite and cdom on a very wide almost global geographic scale indirect photochemistry depends on the concentration values of water constituents the availability of which on a worldwide scale is still insufficient however a novel machine learning technique has provided an estimate of dissolved organic carbon doc concentration values for many of the world s lakes toming et al 2020 although such data do not allow for an assessment of steady state oh and co3 values which also require nitrate nitrite and inorganic carbon concentrations they allow for a first approximation estimate of 3cdom or 1o2 on this basis this work has the first goal of developing a general procedure that allows for the application of the emw approximation to the photochemistry of cdom on a wide geographic scale it has also the additional goal of providing the first assessment of seasonal 3cdom and hence 1o2 considering that 3cdom 1o2 in well oxygenated waters in the surface water layer of global lakes that are included in the 60 s 60 n latitude belt 2 methods 2 1 spectral photon flux density of sunlight as a function of month and latitude according to the emw approximation sunlight absorption by cdom can be assessed by considering monochromatic absorption at 560 nm this wavelength was chosen because it allows for a good description of the polychromatic system by means of a much simpler monochromatic equation vione 2021 the average incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight at 560 nm p 560 nm was defined following the easy procedure described in garcía gil et al 2022 in that work the term f 1 has been calculated for λ 307 5 nm to assess the direct photoinactivation of the virus phi x174 in the present work f 1 was calculated for λ 560 nm following an otherwise identical procedure which enables a description of cdom photochemistry briefly f 1 was optimized for a latitude of 45 n considering the 15th day of each month january december optimization was carried out by minimizing the normalized root mean square error nrmse between the values of g day 560 nm assessed with eq 2 and the values of the daily dose at 560 nm under the assumption of fair weather conditions the latter dose values were obtained by integrating the curve that describes the photon flux density of sunlight p 560 nm t over the time of the day eq 3 such curve was defined with 24 points i e one point for each hour of the day time step 3600 s 3 g day 560 nm 1 day p 560 nm t dt each value of p 560 nm t was computed by introducing the zenith angle obtained with the solar position algorithm spa from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel national renewable energy laboratory solar position algorithm nrel 2022 for each hour of the day the same method was used to obtain p sn 560 nm p 560 nm 12 h garcía gil et al 2022 in particular p sn 560 nm for use in eq 2 is expressed as follows λ 560 nm 4 p sn λ i am 0 λ exp κ λ cos ϕ δ 0 506 96 08 ϕ δ 1 636 λ hc 1 n a where i am0 is the intensity of sunlight outside the atmosphere κ is the atmospheric extinction coefficient φ is the latitude h is planck s constant c is light s speed in vacuum and n a is avogadro s number moreover sun s declination δ is expressed as δ 23 45 sin 360 365 d a y 284 where day 1 is 1 january and day 365 is 31 december the day length τ dl eq 2 is expressed as τ d l 2 15 arccos tan ϕ tan δ where the value of the arccos is in degrees and τ dl in hours which is valid for 60 s φ 60 n 60 φ 60 f 1 was then optimized by matching g day 560 nm eq 3 with eq 2 the value of f 1 thus obtained is useful if it is valid for all relevant worldwide latitudes to validate f 1 we computed discrete values of g day 560 nm by integration of p 560 nm t over the time of the day for the 15th day of each month and in the latitude range of 60 s to 60 n varied at steps of 5 such discrete integral values were then compared with the curves expressing g day 560 nm vs day of the year obtained by means of eq 2 the degree of agreement was quantified as nrmse once the term f 1 was optimized for λ 560 nm the average incident spectral photon flux density of sunlight at 560 nm p 560 nm was obtained by dividing eq 2 by the day length τ dl 5 p 560 nm f 1 p sn 560 nm the actual daily dose for non fair weather conditions can be calculated by introducing into eq 5 a cloud cover factor f2 that relates the actual and the theoretical fair weather cumulated incident radiation the value of f2 is variable even for the same location and day of the year since it depends on the weather conditions although it can be estimated based on historical data it is strongly preferred to measure the actual irradiance in the field and calculate f2 by dividing the experimental value by the theoretical value therefore the parameter f2 has not been considered in this work however an approximation of annual average values of f2 as a function of the latitude and longitude geocoordinates based on historical data f2 range 0 5 1 can be found in garcía gil et al 2022 2 2 global scale modeling of 3cdom the formation of 3cdom stems from sunlight absorption by cdom and is followed by 3cdom deactivation upon thermal processes or prevalently o2 quenching mcneill and canonica 2016 according to the emw approximation the steady state concentration of 3cdom is expressed as follows note that 3cdom 1o2 in well oxygenated waters thus the 3cdom data can be relevant to 1o2 as well 6 3 cdo m φ app 3 cdo m p a cdom 560 nm k d where φ app 3cdom 0 33 vione 2021 is the photon efficiency for 3cdom formation from irradiated cdom p a cdom 560 nm is the monochromatic photon flux absorbed by cdom at 560 nm and k d is the pseudo first order rate constant of 3cdom quenching by o2 in aerated solution k d 5 105 s 1 mcneill and canonica 2016 the quantum yields quantum efficiencies of 3cdom production by irradiated cdom are quite variable among different cdom types but also the sunlight absorbing properties of cdom vary significantly actually the inverse correlation between sunlight absorption by cdom and 3cdom production efficiency zhou et al 2017 offsets to a certain degree the natural variations of both parameters with the result that both 3cdom formation rate and the steady state 3cdom show lesser environmental variability than either p a cdom or φ app 3cdom taken separately marchisio et al 2015 because the emw approximation considers monochromatic radiation absorption by cdom at 560 nm the relevant calculated absorbed photon flux is much lower than the photon flux of sunlight absorbed by cdom at all the wavelengths this issue is offset by the fact that φ app 3cdom 0 33 mol einstein 1 is much higher than the quantum yield of 3cdom formation from irradiated cdom the value of p a cdom 560 nm was calculated as follows vione 2021 7 p a cdom 560 nm 10 d p 560 nm 1 10 100 a 1 560 nm doc d α d 2 β d γ where p 560 nm was determined with eq 5 furthermore a 1 560 nm 1 10 4 l mgc 1 cm 1 is an average value for the 560 nm absorbance of cdom per unit doc and optical path length of 1 cm vione et al 2010 it was also assumed d 3 m vide infra the exponent αd 2 βd γ has been introduced so that monochromatic absorption by cdom could match the depth trend of polychromatic absorption which extends over several hundreds nm the values α 3 0 10 4 m 2 β 2 2 10 4 m 1 and γ 0 58 have been shown to provide an excellent match between polychromatic and monochromatic absorption for 1 m d 10 m vione 2021 finally 100 is the conversion factor between m and cm while 10 is the conversion factor between cm 2 m 1 and l 1 by comparison the polychromatic expression for sunlight absorption by cdom p a cdom units of einstein l 1 s 1 reads as follows vione 2021 8 p a cdom 10 d λ p λ 1 10 100 a 1 λ doc d d λ the values of p a cdom 560 nm eq 7 and p a cdom eq 8 are the basis for the determination of 3cdom a comparison between polychromatic calculations and the emw approximation is provided in fig 1 the figure shows that the emw approach provides excellent approximation in a rather wide range of depth and doc values thereby simplifying calculations while entailing minimal loss in accuracy it provides further support for the choice of 560 nm as emw considering that all other quantities are known or can be calculated doc is the master variable of eq 7 unfortunately a complete global database of doc values directly measured in surface waters is not available remote sensing by e g satellites gives some possibility to assess doc and or cdom but this technique still has important limitations and can only be applied to small regions at present chen et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in this work we used doc data obtained by toming et al 2020 who employed a novel machine learning technique and global databases to predict the doc values in lakes with a surface area 0 1 km2 input data for machine learning were catchment properties meteorological and hydrological features as well as lake morphometry the latter actually played minor role in doc variability obtained from both worldclim v 2 0 23 and from hydrolakes v 1 0 21 databases toming et al 2020 in particular hydrolakes contains data of over 1 400 000 individual lakes having surface area of at least 0 1 km2 messager et al 2016 to develop the predictive model these databases have been used by toming et al 2020 together with the dataset of measured doc values reported by sobek et al 2007 which consists of doc data of 7500 lakes mainly distributed in the boreal hemisphere the lake doc database by toming et al 2020 was even too large for our purposes and some selection procedures were used to decrease the number of study lakes first of all lakes located above 60 n latitude were excluded because of limits connected with the calculation of p 560 nm note that in the austral hemisphere except for antarctica there are no continents below 60 s latitude moreover although altitude is not the main factor involved in cdom photochemistry zhang et al 2020 mountain environments are characterized by higher values of uv irradiance compared to lowland ones ncar 2015 for this reason lakes located above 500 m a s l were excluded from our study this selection also allowed for reducing issues connected with winter spring ice cover not considered in the model as ice cover can effectively block sunlight penetration in mountain lakes located at temperate latitudes the surface of the lakes here selected is considered ice free regardless of the season finally lakes having average depth lower than 5 m were also excluded to minimize problems due to sediment resuspension that can affect the doc value in shallow lakes the remaining 72 380 lakes had the average depth distribution shown in table 1 the value of 3cdom was then calculated for a surface water layer having d 3 m for which the emw approximation gives excellent results see fig 1 and where photochemical reactions would be very important photochemistry is most effective in the surface water layer vione et al 2014 the use of a standard depth value for all lakes allows for highlighting differences related to doc and latitude that might be of rather general validity while both deep and shallow lakes usually occur within the same region furthermore d 3 m is the standard depth used in the euses multimedia model for regional substance risk assessments finch et al 2017 to connect the lakes with their doc or 3cdom values global mapping of the relevant quantities was carried out by means of the qgis software qgis 2020 2 3 model uncertainty the doc assessment by means of a machine learning model entails a level of uncertainty expressed as standard deviation σ d o c the values of which are reported in toming et al 2020 that is directly reflected into the uncertainty associated with 3cdom σ 3 cdo m from eqs 6 7 and the rules of error propagation the relationship between σ doc and σ 3 cdo m can be expressed as follows text s1 in the supplementary material hereinafter sm 9 σ 3 cdo m 3 cdo m 100 ln 10 a 1 560 nm d α d 2 β d γ 10 100 a 1 560 nm d doc 1 10 100 a 1 560 nm d doc σ doc the distributions of the relative standard deviations of both doc and 3cdom are shown in fig 2 the relative standard deviation on the doc fig 2a is far from negligible but it should be considered that the doc values ranged from 1 to over 20 mgc l 1 therefore distinction between low doc and high doc environments is quite feasible despite the uncertainty as far as the uncertainty on 3cdom is concerned the values reported in fig 2b are lower estimates because additional contributions other than σ d o c should be considered for a proper determination of σ 3 cdo m in particular the following assumptions were made to describe the photochemistry of 3cdom 1 cdom was considered as the main optically active component of lake water in the presence of significant amounts of suspended solids or phytoplankton radiation scattering by the latter would not be much of an issue actually scattering would modify the underwater light field and as a consequence the rates of photochemical reactions as a function of water depth but it would not change much the average reaction rates in the water column scattering would produce higher rates at the water surface which would be offset by lower rates in deeper layers calza and vione 2015 in contrast sunlight absorption by suspended solids or phytoplankton would decrease both absorbed irradiance by cdom and the steady state 3cdom but that would be partially compensated by photoactivity of algal derived organic matter zhang et al 2022 2 the connection between lake water doc and 3cdom required the use of average values of p a cdom 560 nm and φ app 3cdom luckily cdom types having higher p a cdom 560 nm would show lower φ app 3cdom and vice versa see section 2 2 3 fair weather sunlight irradiance was considered here see section 2 1 overall the model values of 3cdom should be considered as order of magnitude estimates that would allow for a distinction between lakes with high or low 3cdom 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization and validation of f1 the first procedure was to find the value of f 1 that best matched the daily doses of radiation integrated with eq 3 and calculated with eq 5 to do so the reference values of g day 560 nm were calculated by 24 h integration of p 560 nm t for the 15th day of each month at 45 n latitude red squares in fig 3 these values were the basis for optimizing f 1 with eq 2 the red curve in fig 3 shows the g day 560 nm predictions with eq 2 using the optimized value f 1 0 82 nrmse 2 such a value f 1 0 82 means that the average photon flux density of sunlight at 560 nm during the day length τ dl is 82 of the photon flux density peak at the solar noon the very good agreement shown in fig 3 suggests that f 1 0 82 can be used all along the year the value of f 1 thus obtained was then validated with predictions of g day 560 nm for latitudes ranging from 60 s to 60 n at 5 steps in a similar way as for the optimization procedure the solid symbols in fig 4 represent the integral of radiation intensity referred to the 15th day of each month conversely curves show predictions obtained with eq 2 and f 1 0 82 the overall agreement was again very good with nrmse 7 for all the latitude range this finding suggests that the optimized value of f 1 can be used conveniently in the whole relevant latitude belt once the algorithm was optimized and validated for λ 560 nm eq 2 could be used to obtain the values of p 560 nm around the world data for each couple of latitude longitude values with steps of 0 5 and for the solstices and equinoxes can be found as a microsoft excel file in the sm 3 2 mapping of 3cdom around the globe from 60 s to 60 n latitude following the selection procedure applied to the doc database of toming et al 2020 the doc map of the selected lakes is provided in fig 5 the fact that the vast majority of the lakes is located in the temperate belt of the boreal hemisphere 30 n 60 n is a phenomenon that does not depend on the selection procedure except for the exclusion of the lakes located above 60 n it is interesting to point out that the highest doc values 9 mgc l 1 are usually observed in eastern europe central asia and canada while lakes located in the tropical belt often show moderate to low doc levels it is also important to observe that the latitude limits of the photochemical model exclude most of the scandinavian peninsula which is very rich in lakes especially finland and where the doc levels are usually very high toming et al 2020 the combination of the doc data with the photon flux density of sunlight eqs 6 7 yielded global maps 60 s 60 n of 3cdom which would also be representative of 1o2 values in well oxygenated waters the 3cdom values thus determined are shown in fig 6 for summer and winter solstices june 21st and december 21st while the maps relative to the spring and fall equinoxes march 20th and september 23rd are shown in figure s4 calculated 3cdom values vary in the range of 10 16 10 15 m it is important to observe that 3cdom is here referred to clear sky conditions thereby representing the maximum steady state concentration that can be reached in a given environment the results shown in figs 6 and s4 suggest that seasonal variations of 3cdom generally follow the relevant variations of solar daily doses fig 4 for this reason the highest values of 3cdom are predicted for the temperate belt of the boreal hemisphere 30 60 n and especially 50 60 n during the summer solstice while the lowest values are predicted for the same areas during the winter solstice the same does not happen in the southern hemisphere partly because there is very little land and as a consequence very few lakes below 45 s and partly because of the relatively low doc values of lake water in these regions fig 5 high water doc in the nordic temperate areas also explains why 3cdom is generally high in these regions at the equinoxes figure s4 while the 560 nm daily dose does not vary as much on a global scale fig 4 as shown in fig 1 3cdom increases with increasing doc 3 3 environmental implications photodegradation of clofibric acid the global distribution of 3cdom can for instance be used to assess the potential of lakes to photodegrade contaminants on the one side photochemical processes taking place in surface waters can depollute water bodies but at the same time contaminant photodegradation can sometimes produce harmful transformation products buth et al 2010 erickson et al 2012 halladja et al 2007 vogna et al 2004 we modeled here the photodegradation of clofibric acid hereinafter clo to show an example of how a global mapping of lake photochemistry and in particular 3cdom can be used clo is a metabolite of blood lipid regulators which has been widely detected in surface waters castiglioni et al 2020 korkmaz et al 2022 sousa et al 2020 where it may be harmful to aquatic organisms coimbra et al 2015 gonzález ortegón et al 2015 clo is significantly transformed by photochemical reactions avetta et al 2016 carena et al 2019 packer et al 2003 with major role played by 3cdom additionally reaction with hydroxyl radicals would play secondary role carena et al 2019 an issue that should be considered in modeling clo photodegradation is that a fraction of photooxidized clo here indicated as clo clo 3cdom clo cdom can be transformed back to the parent compound by the antioxidant moieties contained in dom canonica and laubscher 2008 carena et al 2019 wenk and canonica 2012 furthermore clo photooxidation by 3cdom produces both 4 chlorophenol yield 50 and hydroquinone yield 5 which may represent an additional concern for aquatic ecosystems avetta et al 2016 figs 7 and s5 show the global mapping of the photochemical half life time t 1 2 of clo as accounted for by its main reaction with 3cdom that depicted here is clearly a somewhat fictitious scenario because it assumes that clo occurs in all the studied lakes which is fortunately not the case however it gives insight into the vulnerability of different lake environments to the potential occurrence of clo the half life time t 1 2 was calculated as per eq 10 where k 3 cdo m clo 5 2 109 l mol 1 s 1 carena et al 2019 τ dl is the day length units of h day 1 computed as above and ψ 0 68 0 32 1 10 doc 1 is a parameter that takes into account the back reactions of photooxidized clo with antioxidant dom moieties for details see carena et al 2019 10 t 1 2 ln 2 3600 ψ k 3 cdo m clo 3 cdo m τ dl despite the fact that ψ decreases as the doc increases meaning that ψ also decreases as 3cdom increases because of the proportionality between 3cdom and the doc see fig 1 the value of t 1 2 decreases with increasing 3cdom the obtained results allow for a rough comparison between the predicted photodegradation kinetics and the disappearance of clo in the field a previous study has reported an upper limit for the photodegradation kinetics of clo as k 0 01 day 1 in the epilimnion of lake greinfensee switzerland in late summer depth of the thermocline 10 m note that greinfensee is 30 m deep tixier et al 2003 with our model we obtained k 0 08 day 1 in the greifensee for a water column with depth d 3 m on fall equinox this value has to be corrected for common mid latitude irradiance which is 1 5 times lower compared to a clear sky scenario frank and klöpffer 1988 and for the different water depths 10 m vs 3 m obtaining k 0 02 day 1 this result is not so far from that assessed in the field if one considers all the approximations used in our model note that a two times difference can be also found between the values of 3cdom obtained here and those assessed in a previous study canonica et al 1995 reported in fact 3cdom 10 14 mol l 1 for the top 1 m of lake greinfensee under summer noon sunlight which would mean 10 15 mol l 1 if one considers the entire 10 m epilimnion under the same conditions we predict 3cdom 5 5 10 16 mol l 1 the t 1 2 values of clo follow those of 3cdom the highest 3cdom the lowest t 1 2 see figs 6 and 7 and the maps for the equinoxes in the sm in most cases clo lifetimes range within 4 16 days however the highest seasonal variability is predicted for the temperate areas of the northern hemisphere and especially the 50 60 n latitude belt in that region the calculated values of t 1 2 range from 3 to 4 days at the summer solstice to 16 67 days at the winter solstice the same does not happen in the corresponding region of the southern hemisphere mainly due to scarcity of land and therefore lakes furthermore the few lakes located in that region of the southern hemisphere have relatively low doc which would prevent 3cdom from reaching high values in december and therefore would also prevent t 1 2 from being proportionally low as mentioned before clo photodegradation gives both 4 chlorophenol clphoh with yield η clphoh 0 5 and hydroquinone hq with η hq 0 05 avetta et al 2016 the rate coefficient of clphoh photoformation k f clphoh day 1 units is obtained from the rate constant of clo photodegradation k clo ln 2 t 1 2 1 3600 ψ k 3 c d o m c l o 3 c d o m τ d l as k f clphoh η clphoh k clo 3600 η clphoh ψ k 3 c d o m c l o 3 c d o m τ d l the corresponding rate coefficient for hq is k f hq 0 1 k f clphoh because η hq 0 1 η clphoh the global 60 s φ 60 n maps of k f clphoh which are also indicative of k f hq are shown in figure s6 sm the values of k f clphoh are highest in the temperate areas of the northern hemisphere at the summer solstice and lowest in the same areas at the winter solstice the tropical belt and the southern hemisphere show intermediate values of k f clphoh interestingly clphoh formation in the spring and fall equinoxes is consistently lower in southern china southern japan and the south eastern us compared with other locations at comparable latitude figure s6 sm the most likely explanation lies in the relatively low doc values of the relevant lakes see fig 5 photochemical mapping as per this work can support and potentially be integrated into ecotoxicological risk assessment era in order to see if photochemical reactions taking place in surface waters can act as real self depollution processes for water bodies or if the production of by products upon pollutant photodegradation can increase the ecological risk text s2 describes how the risk quotient rq of a contaminant which is a parameter commonly used in era studies to determine the ecological risk gosset et al 2021 topaz et al 2020 wielens becker et al 2020 can be expressed as a function of parameters describing pollutant photodegradation in a simplified scenario where the photodegradation of clphoh and hq into different transformation products was neglected which is reasonable when considering the evolution of clo clphoh and hq between sunrise and sunset in a single day avetta et al 2016 it could be seen that clo reaction with 3cdom would actually increase the ecological risk and the increase would be higher where the transformation of clo is faster the reason is the higher toxicity for aquatic organisms of both clphoh and hq compared to clo 4 conclusions by applying the emw approximation to the absorption of sunlight by cdom it is possible to approximately predict the steady state 3cdom on the basis of the photon flux density of sunlight at 560 nm and of water doc values the average daily photon flux density can be expressed as p 560 n m f 1 p sn 560 n m where f 1 0 82 the value of p sn 560 nm is referred to the solar noon and can be calculated for any day of the year at any latitude between 60 s and 60 n interestingly the equation for p 560 nm holds at all relevant latitudes and seasons the coupling of cdom absorption assessment with a global database of doc values enables the mapping of 3cdom on a quasi global scale the values of 3cdom generally follow the daily doses of sunlight at the given latitudes and seasons at the spring and fall equinoxes however where such doses vary less with latitude than in other times of the year the usually high doc values of lakes located in temperate areas of the northern hemisphere account for high 3cdom values calculated for this region moreover a combination of high doc and high daily dose explains why the highest values of 3cdom are predicted at 50 60 n during the summer solstice june the same does not happen in the southern hemisphere during the winter solstice december because lake water in the relevant locations is characterized by relatively low values of the doc the 3cdom map is reflected into a map of photodegradation kinetics of compounds that mainly undergo transformation by reaction with 3cdom the case of clofibric acid clo is considered here clear sky clo lifetimes of a couple of weeks or lower are predicted in many parts of the globe in the 3 m uppermost layer of the global lakes in many cases photochemistry contributes to depollution however the 3cdom induced phototransformation of clo into 4 chlorophenol and hydroquinone is likely to increase the ecological risk related to this contaminant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

service line have yet been captured quantified or compared in the literature in field distribution systems the challenges in studying particle cell release from pipes include the episodic occurrence of such events the dilution effects caused by the flushing water the limited accessibility of the biofilm matrix and the lack of source apportionment methods these difficulties have been partially overcome in our previous studies such as through the application of preconcentration tools focused on suspended particles and the introduction of microbial community fingerprint based source tracking to investigate the contributions of loose deposits and biofilm in main pipes chen et al 2020 liu et al 2018 however the contribution from service lines remains unknown and no long term study has followed particle cell release from different types of pipes the objectives of this study are to capture and trace the particle cell release from main and service line and to compare their contributions for this purpose filter bags were developed and placed in front of water meters before being sampled together with paired main and service line pipe specimens during the introduction of a new treatment for elemental composition bacterial quantity and community analysis this study provides an important opportunity to advance our understanding of episodic particle cell release from different types of pipes in full scale dwdss thereby allowing water utilities to answer the crucial question of where the major problems may come from 2 material and methods 2 1 drinking water treatments the dutch drinking water treatment plant assessed in this study uses riverbank filtrated water as a source and produces 3 mm3 of drinking water per year the source water abstracted from 2 well fields each contributing 50 is further treated by sprinkler aeration rapid sand filtration activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection before being pumped into the distribution network recently reverse osmosis was introduced to pretreat abstracted source water from one well field thereafter the ro permeate is blended with abstracted source water from another well field before being subjected to subsequent aeration rapid sand filtration activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection treatments the treatments applied before and after introducing ro are shown in figure s1 in the netherlands chlorine is not used in the drinking water treatment and distribution for bacteriological control 2 2 distribution area and sampling program the distribution system in the study area is a branched network as illustrated in fig 1 four locations l1 l2 l3 and l4 were chosen in the distribution system with gradually increasing distances 1 1 km 4 2 km 13 0 km and 18 7 km to the treatment plant wtp at each location integral sample sets were taken including pipe specimens from main and service line and the filter bags installed in front of water meters at household connections loose deposits may have considerable contributions in releasing particles cells since it may be flushed out distribution network by regular hydraulic flushing hence loose deposits were excluded from the present study therefore the objectives of this study are to capture and trace the particle cell release from biofilm in service line and water main and to compare their contributions for this purpose filter bags were developed and placed in front of water meters before being sampled together with paired service line and main pipe specimens during the introduction of a new treatment for elemental composition bacterial quantity and community analysis this study targeted on larger particles released from pipe water biofilm which may lead to water quality deterioration at customers taps therefore a pore size of 50 µm was selected based on pre tested particle size distribution in tap water by particle counter hiac royco 9703 combined with pharm spec version 2 the filter bags used in this study were made of polypropylene pp with a pore size of 50 µm diameter of 10 5 cm height of 20 3 cm and an inner surface area of 500 cm2 manufacturer pentair mexico the vessels used for filter bag accommodation were polypropylene pp filter housing with a diameter of 11 4 cm and height of 25 4 cm manufacturer pentair mexico based on our previous field study of transition effects sampling campaigns were conducted at three stages after introducing ro in wtp for a period of 6 months 26 weeks chen et al 2020 more specifically the 26 weeks were divided into three phases the initial period from week 0 4 t ini middle period from week 5 21 t mid and final period from week 22 26 t end the main and service line pipe specimens were sampled as described previously liu et al 2018 in short duplicate pipe specimens l 20 40 cm were taken after flushing out loose deposits and filled with tap water at the same site water taken after flushing until the temperature was constant and closed by pre disinfected end caps to keep the inner environment humid during transportation considering the biofilm sampling is destructive paired pipe specimens of main and service line were taken from adjacent streets as close as possible to the house installed filter bags at t ini and t mid the service line and main connected directly to filter bags were sampled at t end as we reported earlier chen et al 2022 liu et al 2014 and found in the present study fig 4a reliable and reproducible biofilm results are collected the operation of filter bags was kept as similar as possible between 38 and 40 days for t mid and t end there may be growth during the filtration period but it would be neglectable considering the short filtration time comparing to biofilm formation and high biological stability of drinking water aoc 3 µg c l in the studied system sousi et al 2020 the collected filter bags were sealed in their original housing for transportation and evenly rinsed with 30 ml dna free demi water to keep filtrates from drying out milliq water all samples were transported to the lab on ice stored at 4 c and processed within 24 h after sampling liu et al 2018 2014 in total 23 main samples t ini 7 t mid 8 t end 8 19 service line samples t ini 5 t mid 8 t end 6 and 24 filter bags t mid 12 t end 12 were collected throughout the campaign and were subject to chemical and microbiological analysis general information about sampling location pipe diameter duration of filter bags in the system etc are provided in table s1 2 3 sample preparation the biofilm matrices isolated from pipes and filter bags were detached by pretreatment with low energy ultrasonication as previously described liu et al 2018 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 in short 3 2min ultrasonication treatments at 43 khz were applied branson ultrasonic water bath 180w power output 10l sonification chamber the obtained suspensions were further used for the biomass quantification atp dna extraction and elemental composition analyses ca fe mn al and as considering the uneven distribution of filtrates on filter bags 3 1 cm2 pieces were cut from the upper middle and bottom of the filter bags and treated by the same ultrasonication method to obtain representative results the tailer dividing of three zones upper middle and bottom were based on visually inspected particle distribution over filter bags similar to our previous study on the radial spatial distribution of biofilm over 360 pipe surface liu et al 2020 2 4 inorganic element analysis by icp ms the inorganic elements of calcium ca iron fe manganese mn aluminum al and arsenic as were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer elan drc e icp ms following previously description liu et al 2017a quality control samples were performed for every ten samples assessed including laboratory fortified blanks and laboratory fortified samples for filter bag samples the elemental concentration is the total elements amount divided by the corresponding water volume flowing through it within a sampling period 2 5 adenosine triphosphate atp the adenosine triphosphate atp content as an indicator of active biomass was determined for all samples by combining bactiter glo reagent and a luminometer liu et al 2017a magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 briefly the atp released from bacteria is capable of luminescence after mixing with the atp reagent at 30 c for 2 min therefore the intensity of emitted light was directly measured in a luminometer and converted to atp using a calibration curve based on known atp standards for filter bag samples the atp concentration is the total atp content normalized by the corresponding water volume flowing through it within a sampling period 2 6 dna extraction and illumina 16s rrna gene sequencing dna was extracted from pretreated suspensions using the fastdna spin kit for soil in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions q biogene mp biomedicals solo oh usa amplification of the 16s rrna gene was performed following kozich et al 2013 in short primers 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 785r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 targeting the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene were applied to amplify the extracted genomic dna gdna paired end sequencing of the amplicons 2 300 bp was conducted on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa at a baseclear laboratory in leiden the netherlands the sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi database with reference code prjna922967 2 7 sequencing data processing demultiplexing and adaptor trimming were performed by the sequencing center and the retrieved data were imported into artifacts for use with the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime2 v2020 11 platform bolyen et al 2019 plugins installed in qiime2 were used to perform data preprocessing 16s rrna amplicon sequence variant asv generation and phylogenetic tree construction primer trimming was performed by the q2 cutadapt plugin to optimize the 16s rrna gene trimming parameters and increase the reproducibility of analysis figaro v1 1 2 was

p trunc len f 251 p trunc len r 206 p max ee f 2 p max ee r 2 callahan et al 2016 in total 1 231 847 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained from 66 samples 42 pipe samples and 24 filter bag samples with an average of 216 611 5 399 34 780 sequences per sample the numbers of quality filtered and chimera free reads in each sample are provided in table s1 and rarefaction curves are provided in figure s2 taxonomy was assigned to the generated asvs using the q2 feature classifier customized for the v3 v4 primer set with silva ssu database release 138 1 quast et al 2013 multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstruction processes were applied using q2 phylogeny alpha diversity and beta diversity indices were calculated based on asv 2 8 microbial source tracking by sourcetracker2 to identify the contribution proportions of potential sources to the sink the bayesian based sourcetracker method was applied using the asv tables as the input files knights et al 2011 in this study the communities of bacteria associated with particles retained by on filter bags were considered sinks while the communities of biofilms from upstream water main and service line were defined as sources the source proportioning is based on bacterial fingerprints of biofilm released particles which would not be influenced by different flow patterns and nutrients availability between filter bags and pipe surface when quantifying the source sink relationships at each location the biofilms collected from upstream water mains and service lines were assumed to be potential independent contributors in this study source apportionment was performed by sourcetracker2 v 2 0 1 using the following parameter settings source rarefaction depth of 11 547 sink rarefaction depth of 4 528 burn in of 100 restart of 10 alpha1 of 0 001 alpha2 of 0 1 and beta of 10 the analysis was repeated in triplicate with the average values derived as described liu et al 2018 mccarthy et al 2017 2 9 statistical analysis all of the downstream analyses including post denoising alpha diversity estimation beta diversity comparisons and further statistical analyses as well as data visualization were carried out in r r core team 2021 rstudio team 2020 by utilizing the packages phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 vegan oksanen et al 2019 data table dowle and srinivasan 2021 and ggplot2 wickham 2016 considering the difference in library size across samples the read count of each asv was normalized by the total number of reads in each sample alpha and beta diversity analyses were conducted to compare the samples based on normalized asvs while alpha diversity was calculated using the simpson index principal coordinate analyses pcoa were performed based on the bray curtis distance matrix calculated for beta diversity comparison statistically significant differences in alpha diversity indices between different groups were evaluated using the wilcoxon rank sum test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed using the adonis function with dispersion in the dataset tested by the betadisp function asvs with a maximum abundance greater than 5 across all samples were illustrated in a heatmap using pheatmap kolde 2019 3 results 3 1 elemental composition of biofilms on main and service line and particles captured by filter bags as shown in fig 2 higher elemental concentrations sum of ca fe al mn and as were detected within the biofilm matrix in mains 54 3 268 5 μg cm2 than on the service line 27 1 44 4 μg cm2 at each location both of which were dominated by ca 97 6 99 4 main pipes 52 5 99 2 service lines figure s3 the other elements in descending order were fe al mn and as in the filter bags a total mass of 10 8 96 3 μg was detected resulting in elemental concentrations of 3 5 31 8 μg l different from the biofilm matrix the filter bags were dominated by fe and mn 77 5 98 1 while ca accounted for only 1 4 6 5 taking the observed differences at different time points t ini vs t mid t mid vs t end as indication for biofilm detachment enrichment it is interesting to notice that significant decreases in the measured elements mainly in ca were observed on the water mains from t ini to t mid p 0 05 figure s4 and remained stable until t end this indicates occurrence of release from biofilm matrix on water main shortly after the introduction of the new treatment which stopped after t mid however no clear variance was noticed for service lines for the filter bags significant decreases in fe and mn were observed at l3 and l4 while the content of fe increased at l1 and l4 from t mid to t end this observation suggested that the released fe mn rather than ca arrives at customers locations though the time and the exact level of release might be location dependent 3 2 active biomass quantification for the biofilm matrix in main and service line 0 01 0 7 ng atp cm2 and 0 01 5 6 ng atp cm2 were detected respectively fig 2 in general the atp concentrations were higher in the service line than in the main pipes and this was especially true at t mid and t end after introducing new treatments the atp concentrations on water mains slightly decreased p 0 05 while those of service line slightly increased from t ini to t mid and sharply increased afterward until t end p 0 05 figure s5 the increased atp within service line might have been caused by the deposition and accumulation of the detached biofilm from upstream main pipes the accumulation could be favored by the longer stagnation time and intermittent water usage pattern of service line in addition relatively high standard deviations were observed for service line replicates indicating the uneven biomass distribution within service lines the atp content of the filter bags ranged from 10 8 to 96 3 ng resulting in atp concentrations of 0 3 4 0 ng l the relatively high standard deviations among the top middle and bottom of the filter bags revealed the uneven distribution of particulate matter on the filter bags specifically there were clearly higher atp at bottom of filter bags than other positions indicating bigger particles sedimentation accumulation driven by gravity may occur in premise plumbing from t mid to t end the atp content in filter bags decreased at l1 l2 and l3 but increased at l4 indicating heavier or lighter release of biofilm matrix upstream this process might be location and residential water usage pattern dependent 3 3 bacterial community composition in total 1 231 847 sequences were obtained from 66 samples 42 biofilm samples and 24 filter bag samples and further assigned to 14 692 asvs for taxonomic composition the bacterial community was assigned to 11 core phyla relative abundance 5 fig 3 table s7 procteobacteria 19 4 78 6 was the dominant phylum across all the samples regardless of the sample type for biofilms on main pipes the core phyla in descending order were proteobacteria 25 2 78 6 planctomycetota 1 4 14 7 acidobacteriota 1 4 13 3 patescibacteria 0 4 33 0 nitrospirota 0 9 9 9 actinobacteriota 0 7 10 4 choroflexil 0 5 9 5 verrucomicrobiota 0 6 4 9 myxococcota 0 3 8 4 bacteroidota 0 2 5 2 and firmicutes 0 10 4 similar to the main pipes proteobacteria planctomycetota and acidobacteriota remained the most abundant phyla in the biofilms on service line in contrast compared to mains the relative abundances of bacteroidota verrucomicrobiota and myxococcota were higher while the relative abundances of patescribacteria and actinobacteriota were lower the bacterial communities sampled from the filter bags contained lower proteobacteria and patescribacteria but higher planctomycetota acidobacteriota nitrospirota bacteroidota and verrucomicrobiota interestingly firmicutes was detected in all biofilm samples but not in the filter bag samples until t end indicating its possible late release from the biofilm at the genus level the detected asvs mainly consisted of nitrospira spp 0 4 14 6 is 44 spp 0 1 5 0 methylocystis spp 0 17 1 iheb2 2 spp 0 9 9 methyloglobulus spp 0 7 8 crenothrix spp 0 23 6 and pseudomonas spp 0 27 2 in total 15 core genera maximum relative abundance 5 were found across all samples among which 14 15 and 11 12 core genera in biofilms on main and service line were present in the filter bags figure s6 asv04 0 3 12 8 assigned as nitrospira was the most abundant across all samples especially in the filter bag samples asv10 assigned as methylocystis and asv12 genus unclassified were also abundant but were found mainly in service line biofilms figure s7 3 4 bacterial community diversity for alpha diversity similar trends were observed for species richness asv number figure s8a and diversity simpson index figure s8b for all sample groups specifically the species richness and diversity of the service line community decreased from t ini to t mid and then increased from t mid to t end back to a similar level as t ini differently in the filter bag community they decreased significantly from t mid to t end while the main community showed no clear changes these results indicate the relatively sharp responses of the biofilms on the service line on the main pipes which may have led to a higher contribution of the service line than the main pipes to water quality deterioration moreover 24 asvs 5 were identified as core asvs taxonomy information given in table s6 the venn diagram illustrated that 13 24 core asvs were shared by the service line 13 17 main 13 21 and filter bag 13 17 samples figure s9 interestingly there was no unique asv contained by the filter bags but all were shared with either main 16 17 or service line 14 17 indicating a close relationship among the three sample types and the materials collected by the filter bags may have all originated from upstream service line and main pipes regarding the taxonomy information the shared core asvs were mainly assigned to nitrospira spp methylomagnum spp methylocytis spp and iheb2 23 spp the beta diversity analysis conducted using bray curtis distances exhibited clear grouping among the three sample types pcoa plot fig 4 a the biofilm samples from mains and filter bags were grouped into two separate clusters implying their clear dissimilarity permanova p 0 001 the cluster of biofilms on service line fell between the biofilms on main pipes and filter bags indicating its similarity and connection with the other two groups the paired distance calculation based on bray curtis also confirmed that the similarity between the filter bag and service line was higher than that between the filter bag and main pipes fig 4b within each group no clear changes in microbial community composition were observed in other words despite biofilm sloughing the relatively stable microbial community composition of the biofilm was maintained this suggested that the release detachment of the biofilm was not member specific and did not have a significant influence on the general composition of the bacterial community in addition the mains were made mostly of pvc except for the samples from l1 which were made of hdpe material shown as bordered yellow dots in the pcoa plot fig 4a the observed apparent overlap between hdpe and pvc in the main pipe group elucidated that the microbial community of biofilm was not significantly influenced by the pipe material permanova p 0 05 but was influenced by the pipe type main vs service line p 0 001 3 5 immigrant source apportionment by sourcetracker2 bacteria in the biofilm matrices on the main and service line can be potential sources of biofilm in filter bag filtrates the sourcetracker2 results showed that the main and service line samples contributed 51 86 of the collected microbes on filter bags 72 86 at t mid 51 77 at t end fig 5 regardless of the sampling time and location the service line samples outnumbered the main samples as the major contributor of sloughing particles immigrated to end users hinting that these pipes would be hotspots releasing particulate matter e g elements and microbes and deteriorating water quality when the dwds was subjected to disturbances interestingly the proportion of bacteria from service line decreased by 3 l1 from 67 to 64 33 l4 from 72 to 39 from t mid to t end suggesting that the release of cells particles elements was mitigated after t mid the contribution of the main pipes remained at the same level at l1 l3 and l4 but increased significantly at l2 from 16 to 36 indicating that the actual release events in the dwds are likely location and water usage pattern dependent 4 discussion to address how the dwds impacts water quality during water distribution especially during disturbances and compare the contributions of different types of pipes we conducted a comprehensive study in an unchlorinated system after the introduction of ro in the treatment process the sampling method of the main and service line was integrated with in situ filter bag sampling in front of water meters and microbial fingerprint based source tracking the successfully captured large particles in filter bags and sourcetracker2 results demonstrated that service line contributed more than main pipes to the potential water quality deterioration at customers taps 4 1 higher water quality deterioration potential lies in service line according to the sourcetracker2 analysis up to 86 t mid l4 and 78 t end l2 of microbes collected in filter bags came from the upstream main and service line there were other potential contributors not quantified such as loose deposits in main particles fed by treatment plant and the possible growth on particles in the filter bags not likely however based on their absolute high contributions it is reasonable to conclude that main and service line are the major contributors to the large particles and their associated microbes released from the dwds to customers taps particulate matter reaching customers may originate from the breakthrough of particles from the source water the release of particles from filters and the generation of particles during distribution e g the detachment of biofilm and scales from pipes our previous study found that main pipes excluding loose deposits contributed 0 5 19 7 to particle associated bacteria at tap but service line were not considered in that study liu et al 2018 the much higher contribution observed in the present study could be attributed to the inclusion of service line in addition it may also be because this study focused on much larger particles 50 µm than previous work 1 2 µm and or because the sampling was conducted during disturbances induced by the introduction of ro in the treatment moreover it should be noted that biofilms on main and service line were dominated by ca while filter bags were dominated by fe and mn this may indicate the inorganic particles collected on the filter bags could be originated differently than the bio particles for example from loose deposits in main and or service line comparing the contributions of the main and service line although there was a clear decrease in the service line s contribution from t mid 68 4 4 6 to t end 47 7 10 4 they contributed much more than the main pipes regardless of the study period 57 6 13 2 vs 13 0 10 6 table s9 the higher contribution of service line could be attributed to their features of intermittent flow pattern high surface to volume ratio long stagnation and contact time and a short distance to the customer liu et al 2014 prest et al 2016 tsvetanova and hoekstra 2010b the decrease in the service line s contribution from t mid to t end 22 26 weeks might have been due to the fading away of the disturbances induced by introducing partial ro in production this is consistent with the observed changes of diversity and composition of biofilm bacterial communities from t ini to t mid and t end it should be noted that the time period of different weeks may also influence the composition and diversity of bacterial community douterelo et al 2018 however considering the high stability of both source water and produced water especially high biological stability of produced water and the short time period weeks comparing to biofilm age decades it is likely that the introduction of new treatments contributes to the observed differences in bacterial community rather than time moreover service line has attracted very little attention compared to distribution mains and plumbing systems our previous study reported that service line possessed high quality deterioration potential by assuming the one time release of all harbored contaminants e g fe mn as and microbes we found that the release of 10 household biofilm significantly altered the bacterial community composition in water liu et al 2017a to the best of our knowledge the present study provides the first evidence of service line s direct and quantitative contributions to potential water quality deterioration at customers ends weighting the contributions from different pipes is important from a management perspective especially to allow water utility managers to prioritize their efforts and investments and to avoid blindness to potential risks it should be mentioned that both main and service line are important although their contributions are different this is especially true considering that opportunistic pathogens might be released from biofilms in both main and service line and the total length and surface area of main pipes are much larger than those of service line the results of the present study emphasize the importance of considering the contribution of service line to potential water quality deterioration proper actions should be taken on service line to manage the drinking water quality at taps however as service lines are mostly dead ends and connected directly to water meters regular cleaning by flushing or pigging would not be feasible further research on service line cleaning strategies and tools is urgently needed 4 2 beyond dwds monitoring from quantitative to qualitative assessment in the present study 50 µm filter bags were installed in front of water meters to collect large particulate matter immigrated from the dwds for extended periods of time without disturbing daily water consumption this in situ and real time sampling method continuously captured and concentrated any possible episodically released large particles from the dwds thereby allowing a quantitative assessment of how many particles elements and microbes arrived at the customers and their spatiotemporal changes however it was not possible to determine where those particles elements microbes came from treatment or distribution system and neither the proportional contributions of different types of pipes e g main vs service line these questions can be answered by applying sourcetracker2 to paired sink particles on filter bags and source main and service line samples the results pinpointed that the highest contributions risks came from service line 63 79 this demonstrated the advantages of combining in situ preconcentration data with the community based sourcetracker to not only quantify changes but also track and apportion the sources moreover continuous sampling can be conducted in a nondestructive manner making this approach applicable in full scale drinking water distribution systems traditionally water utilities are commonly obligated to conduct highly labor and capital cost demanding monitoring programs in dwdss the results of which are mostly used to ensure that the measured parameters fulfill the regulated standard recently online devices have moved dwds monitoring methods toward the emerging big data era the commonly installed sensors include temperature ph pressure conductivity turbidity and free chlorine sensors applications of online particle counters online flow cytometers and online atp meters have also emerged in dwdss these attempts and efforts at high frequency quantitative assessments have shown great advantages and potential for valuable leakage detection and meaningful water quality dynamics description buysschaert et al 2019 koppanen et al 2022 pan et al 2021 safford and bischel 2019 however such purely quantitative measures can hardly offer insights into what is occurring why deterioration happens and where problems may originate qualitative measures in such cases point out an innovative route for water quality monitoring and management moving dwdss into the big data era one step beyond the current demonstration would be the possibility of combining trackable molecular results with online monitorable parameters adopting the possible advantages of machine learning to overcome the limitation of the long processing times required for gene sequencing another possibility would be promoting fully automated online nanopore sequencing integrated with sourcetracking packages though this method will not be financially feasible cost feasible in the near future 4 3 practical implications this study highlighted the importance of service lines for supplying the high quality drinking water to customers taps the contributions of service line have long been neglected in previous research according to our field experiences these pipes connect houses to distribution water mains that are normally buried under gardens or greens ranging in length from a few meters to a dozen of meters mostly 5 10 m for some special cases where the houses are located slightly further from the water mains these lengths could be more than 20 m to bring this issue under the spotlight the potential risks associated with service lines could be easily mitigated by implementing stricter material selection and length optimization which have not yet been considered in addition as such pipes are neither constructed under roads like water mains are nor in building walls such as premise plumbing are thus they can be cleaned or replaced much easier than other pipes without influencing the water supply to other consumers in short attention should be given to these meter long pipes close to taps and maintenance should be performed on such pipes to avoid water quality deterioration and potential risks especially when the dwdss are subjected to disturbances 5 conclusions following the introduction of ro in the drinking water treatment process in this study we captured large particles using filter bags at customers houses and source tracked their origins based on bacterial community fingerprints based on the results of this study the following conclusions can be drawn the elemental concentrations of the main pipes were higher than those of the service line 54 3 268 5 μg cm2 vs 27 1 44 4 μg cm2 both of which were dominated by ca 97 6 99 4 in main pipes 52 5 99 2 in service line the filter bags were dominated by fe and mn 77 5 98 1 after introducing ro ca significantly decreased from the water mains but not from the service line while released fe mn rather than ca arrived at customers taps the atp concentrations in service line were higher than those in main pipes after introducing ro the atp concentrations decreased on the water mains but increased in the service line there were 24 core asvs 13 24 of which were shared by the service line 13 17 main 13 21 and filter bag 13 17 samples no unique core asv was found in the filter bags but all were shared with either main 16 17 or service line 14 17 samples the shared core asvs were mainly assigned to nitrospira spp methylomagnum spp methylocytis spp and iheb2 23 spp according to sourcetracker2 service lines contributed much higher particulate material than main pipes 57 6 13 2 vs 13 0 11 6 to the filter bags meaning that a higher water quality deterioration potential lies in service lines than in water mains service lines have long been neglected appropriate management is necessary through means such as material selection length optimization and proper regulation declaration of competing interest

14699,biofilm detachment contributes to water quality deterioration however the contributions of biofilm detachment from different pipes have not been quantified or compared following the introduction of partial reverse osmosis ro in drinking water production this study analyzed particles at customers ends and tracked their origins to water distribution mains and service lines for doing so filter bags were installed in front of water meters to capture upstream detached particles while biofilm from water main and service line were sampled by cutting pipe specimens the results showed that elemental concentrations of the biofilm in mains were higher than those of service lines 54 3 268 5 vs 27 1 44 4 μg cm2 both dominated by ca differently filter bags were dominated by fe mn 77 5 98 1 after introducing ro ca significantly decreased in biofilms of mains but not service lines but the released fe mn rather than ca arrived at customers ends the atp concentrations of service lines were higher than mains which decreased on mains but increased in service lines after introducing ro for the core asvs 13 24 were shared by service lines 17 mains 21 and filter bags 17 which were assigned mainly to nitrospira spp methylomagnum spp methylocytis spp and iheb2 23 spp according to source tracking results service lines contributed more than mains to the particulate material collected by filter bags 57 6 13 2 vs 13 0 11 6 to the best of our knowledge the present study provides the first evidence of service lines direct and quantitative contributions to potential water quality

nescerecka et al 2018 prest et al 2016 thom et al 2022 vavourakis et al 2020 for example microbial water quality deterioration has been commonly observed as increases in the total cell concentrations and intact cell proportions el chakhtoura et al 2015 prest et al 2013 in extreme cases water quality deterioration may be accompanied by esthetic and health problems resulting from the detachment release of particles cells and metals in dwdss such as discoloration high concentrations of heavy metals and or the presence of opportunistic pathogens this is especially true when irregular disturbances occur in distribution systems due to hydraulic or water quality changes in general dwdss are pipe networks with varying diameters and materials organized into multiloops that range in length from tens to thousands of kilometers totaling 1 1 million kilometers in china and 19 796 kms in beijing in 2021 120 224 kms in the netherlands in 2020 association of dutch water companies vewin 2022 national bureau of statistics of china 2021 it is difficult to respond to water quality deterioration without knowing where the problems come from to pinpoint the source of particle cell element release and develop efficient tap water quality management strategies it is essential to explore the contributions of different pipe types to water quality deterioration e g transportation pipe typically 200 mm distribution main pipe typically 63 110 mm service line pipe that connecting main to water meter typically 25 32 mm hensley et al 2021 liu et al 2017a these pipes are different in hydraulics condition residence time and surface to volume ratio water quality deterioration has been widely observed in distribution water mains main and premise plumbing which has been observed as increases in cell number and or particulate load and attributed to the long water retention time and high surface to volume ratio lautenschlager et al 2010 ling et al 2018 montagnino et al 2022 tsvetanova and hoekstra 2010a zlatanović et al 2017 the service line service line is characterized as intermittent flow prolonged stagnation and close proximity to consumers comparing to main yet the study on service line is limited our previous study found that the quality deterioration potential of service line is higher than that of main liu et al 2017a however real release events from main and service line have yet been captured quantified or compared in the literature in field distribution systems the challenges in studying particle cell release from pipes include the episodic occurrence of such events the dilution effects caused by the flushing water the limited accessibility of the biofilm matrix and the lack of source apportionment methods these difficulties have been partially overcome in our previous studies such as through the application of preconcentration tools focused on suspended particles and the introduction of microbial community fingerprint based source tracking to investigate the contributions of loose deposits and biofilm in main pipes chen et al 2020 liu et al 2018 however the contribution from service lines remains unknown and no long term study has followed particle cell release from different types of pipes the objectives of this study are to capture and trace the particle cell release from main and service line and to compare their contributions for this purpose filter bags were developed and placed in front of water meters before being sampled together with paired main and service line pipe specimens during the introduction of a new treatment for elemental composition bacterial quantity and community analysis this study provides an important opportunity to advance our understanding of episodic particle cell release from different types of pipes in full scale dwdss thereby allowing water utilities to answer the crucial question of where the major problems may come from 2 material and methods 2 1 drinking water treatments the dutch drinking water treatment plant assessed in this study uses riverbank filtrated water as a source and produces 3 mm3 of drinking water per year the source water abstracted from 2 well fields each contributing 50 is further treated by sprinkler aeration rapid sand filtration activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection before being pumped into the distribution network recently reverse osmosis was introduced to pretreat abstracted source water from one well field thereafter the ro permeate is blended with abstracted source water from another well field before being subjected to subsequent aeration rapid sand filtration activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection treatments the treatments applied before and after introducing ro are shown in figure s1 in the netherlands chlorine is not used in the drinking water treatment and distribution for bacteriological control 2 2 distribution area and sampling program the distribution system in the study area is a branched network as illustrated in fig 1 four locations l1 l2 l3 and l4 were chosen in the distribution system with gradually increasing distances 1 1 km 4 2 km 13 0 km and 18 7 km to the treatment plant wtp at each location integral sample sets were taken including pipe specimens from main and service line and the filter bags installed in front of water meters at household connections loose deposits may have considerable contributions in releasing particles cells since it may be flushed out distribution network by regular hydraulic flushing hence loose deposits were excluded from the present study therefore the objectives of this study are to capture and trace the particle cell release from biofilm in service line and water main and to compare their contributions for this purpose filter bags were developed and placed in front of water meters before being sampled together with paired service line and main pipe specimens during the introduction of a new treatment for elemental composition bacterial quantity and community analysis this study targeted on larger particles released from pipe water biofilm which may lead to water quality deterioration at customers taps therefore a pore size of 50 µm was selected based on pre tested particle size distribution in tap water by particle counter hiac royco 9703 combined with pharm spec version 2 the filter bags used in this study were made of polypropylene pp with a pore size of 50 µm diameter of 10 5 cm height of 20 3 cm and an inner surface area of 500 cm2 manufacturer pentair mexico the vessels used for filter bag accommodation were polypropylene pp filter housing with a diameter of 11 4 cm and height of 25 4 cm manufacturer pentair mexico based on our previous field study of transition effects sampling campaigns were conducted at three stages after introducing ro in wtp for a period of 6 months 26 weeks chen et al 2020 more specifically the 26 weeks were divided into three phases the initial period from week 0 4 t ini middle period from week 5 21 t mid and final period from week 22 26 t end the main and service line pipe specimens were sampled as described previously liu et al 2018 in short duplicate pipe specimens l 20 40 cm were taken after flushing out loose deposits and filled with tap water at the same site water taken after flushing until the temperature was constant and closed by pre disinfected end caps to keep the inner environment humid during transportation considering the biofilm sampling is destructive paired pipe specimens of main and service line were taken from adjacent streets as close as possible to the house installed filter bags at t ini and t mid the service line and main connected directly to filter bags were sampled at t end as we reported earlier chen et al 2022 liu et al 2014 and found in the present study fig 4a reliable and reproducible biofilm results are collected the operation of filter bags was kept as similar as possible between 38 and 40 days for t mid and t end there may be growth during the filtration period but it would be neglectable considering the short filtration time comparing to biofilm formation and high biological stability of drinking water aoc 3 µg c l in the studied system sousi et al 2020 the collected filter bags were sealed in their original housing for transportation and evenly rinsed with 30 ml dna free demi water to keep filtrates from drying out milliq water all samples were transported to the lab on ice stored at 4 c and processed within 24 h after sampling liu et al 2018 2014 in total 23 main samples t ini 7 t mid 8 t end 8 19 service line samples t ini 5 t mid 8 t end 6 and 24 filter bags t mid 12 t end 12 were collected throughout the campaign and were subject to chemical and microbiological analysis general information about sampling location pipe diameter duration of filter bags in the system etc are provided in table s1 2 3 sample preparation the biofilm matrices isolated from pipes and filter bags were detached by pretreatment with low energy ultrasonication as previously described liu et al 2018 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 in short 3 2min ultrasonication treatments at 43 khz were applied branson ultrasonic water bath 180w power output 10l sonification chamber the obtained suspensions were further used for the biomass quantification atp dna extraction and elemental composition analyses ca fe mn al and as considering the uneven distribution of filtrates on filter bags 3 1 cm2 pieces were cut from the upper middle and bottom of the filter bags and treated by the same ultrasonication method to obtain representative results the tailer dividing of three zones upper middle and bottom were based on visually inspected particle distribution over filter bags similar to our previous study on the radial spatial distribution of biofilm over 360 pipe surface liu et al 2020 2 4 inorganic element analysis by icp ms the inorganic elements of calcium ca iron fe manganese mn aluminum al and arsenic as were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer elan drc e icp ms following previously description liu et al 2017a quality control samples were performed for every ten samples assessed including laboratory fortified blanks and laboratory fortified samples for filter bag samples the elemental concentration is the total elements amount divided by the corresponding water volume flowing through it within a sampling period 2 5 adenosine triphosphate atp the adenosine triphosphate atp content as an indicator of active biomass was determined for all samples by combining bactiter glo reagent and a luminometer liu et al 2017a magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 briefly the atp released from bacteria is capable of luminescence after mixing with the atp reagent at 30 c for 2 min therefore the intensity of emitted light was directly measured in a luminometer and converted to atp using a calibration curve based on known atp standards for filter bag samples the atp concentration is the total atp content normalized by the corresponding water volume flowing through it within a sampling period 2 6 dna extraction and illumina 16s rrna gene sequencing dna was extracted from pretreated suspensions using the fastdna spin kit for soil in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions q biogene mp biomedicals solo oh usa amplification of the 16s rrna gene was performed following kozich et al 2013 in short primers 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 785r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 targeting the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene were applied to amplify the extracted genomic dna gdna paired end sequencing of the amplicons 2 300 bp was conducted on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa at a baseclear laboratory in leiden the netherlands the sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi database with reference code prjna922967 2 7 sequencing data processing demultiplexing and adaptor trimming were performed by the sequencing center and the retrieved data were imported into artifacts for use with the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime2 v2020 11 platform bolyen et al 2019 plugins installed in qiime2 were used to perform data preprocessing 16s rrna amplicon sequence variant asv generation and phylogenetic tree construction primer trimming was performed by the q2 cutadapt plugin to optimize the 16s rrna gene trimming parameters and increase the reproducibility of analysis figaro v1 1 2 was used to determine the dada2 trimming parameters with an overlap length of 30 bp sasada et al 2020 denoising dereplication paired read merging and chimera removal were applied using q2 dada2 with flags p trunc len f 251 p trunc len r 206 p max ee f 2 p max ee r 2 callahan et al 2016 in total 1 231 847 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained from 66 samples 42 pipe samples and 24 filter bag samples with an average of 216 611 5 399 34 780 sequences per sample the numbers of quality filtered and chimera free reads in each sample are provided in table s1 and rarefaction curves are provided in figure s2 taxonomy was assigned to the generated asvs using the q2 feature classifier customized for the v3 v4 primer set with silva ssu database release 138 1 quast et al 2013 multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstruction processes were applied using q2 phylogeny alpha diversity and beta diversity indices were calculated based on asv 2 8 microbial source tracking by sourcetracker2 to identify the contribution proportions of potential sources to the sink the bayesian based sourcetracker method was applied using the asv tables as the input files knights et al 2011 in this study the communities of bacteria associated with particles retained by on filter bags were considered sinks while the communities of biofilms from upstream water main and service line were defined as sources the source proportioning is based on bacterial fingerprints of biofilm released particles which would not be influenced by different flow patterns and nutrients availability between filter bags and pipe surface when quantifying the source sink relationships at each location the biofilms collected from upstream water mains and service lines were assumed to be potential independent contributors in this study source apportionment was performed by sourcetracker2 v 2 0 1 using the following parameter settings source rarefaction depth of 11 547 sink rarefaction depth of 4 528 burn in of 100 restart of 10 alpha1 of 0 001 alpha2 of 0 1 and beta of 10 the analysis was repeated in triplicate with the average values derived as described liu et al 2018 mccarthy et al 2017 2 9 statistical analysis all of the downstream analyses including post denoising alpha diversity estimation beta diversity comparisons and further statistical analyses as well as data visualization were carried out in r r core team 2021 rstudio team 2020 by utilizing the packages phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 vegan oksanen et al 2019 data table dowle and srinivasan 2021 and ggplot2 wickham 2016 considering the difference in library size across samples the read count of each asv was normalized by the total number of reads in each sample alpha and beta diversity analyses were conducted to compare the samples based on normalized asvs while alpha diversity was calculated using the simpson index principal coordinate analyses pcoa were performed based on the bray curtis distance matrix calculated for beta diversity comparison statistically significant differences in alpha diversity indices between different groups were evaluated using the wilcoxon rank sum test and permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed using the adonis function with dispersion in the dataset tested by the betadisp function asvs with a maximum abundance greater than 5 across all samples were illustrated in a heatmap using pheatmap kolde 2019 3 results 3 1 elemental composition of biofilms on main and service line and particles captured by filter bags as shown in fig 2 higher elemental concentrations sum of ca fe al mn and as were detected within the biofilm matrix in mains 54 3 268 5 μg cm2 than on the service line 27 1 44 4 μg cm2 at each location both of which were dominated by ca 97 6 99 4 main pipes 52 5 99 2 service lines figure s3 the other elements in descending order were fe al mn and as in the filter bags a total mass of 10 8 96 3 μg was detected resulting in elemental concentrations of 3 5 31 8 μg l different from the biofilm matrix the filter bags were dominated by fe and mn 77 5 98 1 while ca accounted for only 1 4 6 5 taking the observed differences at different time points t ini vs t mid t mid vs t end as indication for biofilm detachment enrichment it is interesting to notice that significant decreases in the measured elements mainly in ca were observed on the water mains from t ini to t mid p 0 05 figure s4 and remained stable until t end this indicates occurrence of release from biofilm matrix on water main shortly after the introduction of the new treatment which stopped after t mid however no clear variance was noticed for service lines for the filter bags significant decreases in fe and mn were observed at l3 and l4 while the content of fe increased at l1 and l4 from t mid to t end this observation suggested that the released fe mn rather than ca arrives at customers locations though the time and the exact level of release might be location dependent 3 2 active biomass quantification for the biofilm matrix in main and service line 0 01 0 7 ng atp cm2 and 0 01 5 6 ng atp cm2 were detected respectively fig 2 in general the atp concentrations were higher in the service line than in the main pipes and this was especially true at t mid and t end after introducing new treatments the atp concentrations on water mains slightly decreased p 0 05 while those of service line slightly increased from t ini to t mid and sharply increased afterward until t end p 0 05 figure s5 the increased atp within service line might have been caused by the deposition and accumulation of the detached biofilm from upstream main pipes the accumulation could be favored by the longer stagnation time and intermittent water usage pattern of service line in addition relatively high standard deviations were observed for service line replicates indicating the uneven biomass distribution within service lines the atp content of the filter bags ranged from 10 8 to 96 3 ng resulting in atp concentrations of 0 3 4 0 ng l the relatively high standard deviations among the top middle and bottom of the filter bags revealed the uneven distribution of particulate matter on the filter bags specifically there were clearly higher atp at bottom of filter bags than other positions indicating bigger particles sedimentation accumulation driven by gravity may occur in premise plumbing from t mid to t end the atp content in filter bags decreased at l1 l2 and l3 but increased at l4 indicating heavier or lighter release of biofilm matrix upstream this process might be location and residential water usage pattern dependent 3 3 bacterial community composition in total 1 231 847 sequences were obtained from 66 samples 42 biofilm samples and 24 filter bag samples and further assigned to 14 692 asvs for taxonomic composition the bacterial community was assigned to 11 core phyla relative abundance 5 fig 3 table s7 procteobacteria 19 4 78 6 was the dominant phylum across all the samples regardless of the sample type for biofilms on main pipes the core phyla in descending order were proteobacteria 25 2 78 6 planctomycetota 1 4 14 7 acidobacteriota 1 4 13 3 patescibacteria 0 4 33 0 nitrospirota 0 9 9 9 actinobacteriota 0 7 10 4 choroflexil 0 5 9 5 verrucomicrobiota 0 6 4 9 myxococcota 0 3 8 4 bacteroidota 0 2 5 2 and firmicutes 0 10 4 similar to the main pipes proteobacteria planctomycetota and acidobacteriota remained the most abundant phyla in the biofilms on service line in contrast compared to mains the relative abundances of bacteroidota verrucomicrobiota and myxococcota were higher while the relative abundances of patescribacteria and actinobacteriota were lower the bacterial communities sampled from the filter bags contained lower proteobacteria and patescribacteria but higher planctomycetota acidobacteriota nitrospirota bacteroidota and verrucomicrobiota interestingly firmicutes was detected in all biofilm samples but not in the filter bag samples until t end indicating its possible late release from the biofilm at the genus level the detected asvs mainly consisted of nitrospira spp 0 4 14 6 is 44 spp 0 1 5 0 methylocystis spp 0 17 1 iheb2 2 spp 0 9 9 methyloglobulus spp 0 7 8 crenothrix spp 0 23 6 and pseudomonas spp 0 27 2 in total 15 core genera maximum relative abundance 5 were found across all samples among which 14 15 and 11 12 core genera in biofilms on main and service line were present in the filter bags figure s6 asv04 0 3 12 8 assigned as nitrospira was the most abundant across all samples especially in the filter bag samples asv10 assigned as methylocystis and asv12 genus unclassified were also abundant but were found mainly in service line biofilms figure s7 3 4 bacterial community diversity for alpha diversity similar trends were observed for species richness asv number figure s8a and diversity simpson index figure s8b for all sample groups specifically the species richness and diversity of the service line community decreased from t ini to t mid and then increased from t mid to t end back to a similar level as t ini differently in the filter bag community they decreased significantly from t mid to t end while the main community showed no clear changes these results indicate the relatively sharp responses of the biofilms on the service line on the main pipes which may have led to a higher contribution of the service line than the main pipes to water quality deterioration moreover 24 asvs 5 were identified as core asvs taxonomy information given in table s6 the venn diagram illustrated that 13 24 core asvs were shared by the service line 13 17 main 13 21 and filter bag 13 17 samples figure s9 interestingly there was no unique asv contained by the filter bags but all were shared with either main 16 17 or service line 14 17 indicating a close relationship among the three sample types and the materials collected by the filter bags may have all originated from upstream service line and main pipes regarding the taxonomy information the shared core asvs were mainly assigned to nitrospira spp methylomagnum spp methylocytis spp and iheb2 23 spp the beta diversity analysis conducted using bray curtis distances exhibited clear grouping among the three sample types pcoa plot fig 4 a the biofilm samples from mains and filter bags were grouped into two separate clusters implying their clear dissimilarity permanova p 0 001 the cluster of biofilms on service line fell between the biofilms on main pipes and filter bags indicating its similarity and connection with the other two groups the paired distance calculation based on bray curtis also confirmed that the similarity between the filter bag and service line was higher than that between the filter bag and main pipes fig 4b within each group no clear changes in microbial community composition were observed in other words despite biofilm sloughing the relatively stable microbial community composition of the biofilm was maintained this suggested that the release detachment of the biofilm was not member specific and did not have a significant influence on the general composition of the bacterial community in addition the mains were made mostly of pvc except for the samples from l1 which were made of hdpe material shown as bordered yellow dots in the pcoa plot fig 4a the observed apparent overlap between hdpe and pvc in the main pipe group elucidated that the microbial community of biofilm was not significantly influenced by the pipe material permanova p 0 05 but was influenced by the pipe type main vs service line p 0 001 3 5 immigrant source apportionment by sourcetracker2 bacteria in the biofilm matrices on the main and service line can be potential sources of biofilm in filter bag filtrates the sourcetracker2 results showed that the main and service line samples contributed 51 86 of the collected microbes on filter bags 72 86 at t mid 51 77 at t end fig 5 regardless of the sampling time and location the service line samples outnumbered the main samples as the major contributor of sloughing particles immigrated to end users hinting that these pipes would be hotspots releasing particulate matter e g elements and microbes and deteriorating water quality when the dwds was subjected to disturbances interestingly the proportion of bacteria from service line decreased by 3 l1 from 67 to 64 33 l4 from 72 to 39 from t mid to t end suggesting that the release of cells particles elements was mitigated after t mid the contribution of the main pipes remained at the same level at l1 l3 and l4 but increased significantly at l2 from 16 to 36 indicating that the actual release events in the dwds are likely location and water usage pattern dependent 4 discussion to address how the dwds impacts water quality during water distribution especially during disturbances and compare the contributions of different types of pipes we conducted a comprehensive study in an unchlorinated system after the introduction of ro in the treatment process the sampling method of the main and service line was integrated with in situ filter bag sampling in front of water meters and microbial fingerprint based source tracking the successfully captured large particles in filter bags and sourcetracker2 results demonstrated that service line contributed more than main pipes to the potential water quality deterioration at customers taps 4 1 higher water quality deterioration potential lies in service line according to the sourcetracker2 analysis up to 86 t mid l4 and 78 t end l2 of microbes collected in filter bags came from the upstream main and service line there were other potential contributors not quantified such as loose deposits in main particles fed by treatment plant and the possible growth on particles in the filter bags not likely however based on their absolute high contributions it is reasonable to conclude that main and service line are the major contributors to the large particles and their associated microbes released from the dwds to customers taps particulate matter reaching customers may originate from the breakthrough of particles from the source water the release of particles from filters and the generation of particles during distribution e g the detachment of biofilm and scales from pipes our previous study found that main pipes excluding loose deposits contributed 0 5 19 7 to particle associated bacteria at tap but service line were not considered in that study liu et al 2018 the much higher contribution observed in the present study could be attributed to the inclusion of service line in addition it may also be because this study focused on much larger particles 50 µm than previous work 1 2 µm and or because the sampling was conducted during disturbances induced by the introduction of ro in the treatment moreover it should be noted that biofilms on main and service line were dominated by ca while filter bags were dominated by fe and mn this may indicate the inorganic particles collected on the filter bags could be originated differently than the bio particles for example from loose deposits in main and or service line comparing the contributions of the main and service line although there was a clear decrease in the service line s contribution from t mid 68 4 4 6 to t end 47 7 10 4 they contributed much more than the main pipes regardless of the study period 57 6 13 2 vs 13 0 10 6 table s9 the higher contribution of service line could be attributed to their features of intermittent flow pattern high surface to volume ratio long stagnation and contact time and a short distance to the customer liu et al 2014 prest et al 2016 tsvetanova and hoekstra 2010b the decrease in the service line s contribution from t mid to t end 22 26 weeks might have been due to the fading away of the disturbances induced by introducing partial ro in production this is consistent with the observed changes of diversity and composition of biofilm bacterial communities from t ini to t mid and t end it should be noted that the time period of different weeks may also influence the composition and diversity of bacterial community douterelo et al 2018 however considering the high stability of both source water and produced water especially high biological stability of produced water and the short time period weeks comparing to biofilm age decades it is likely that the introduction of new treatments contributes to the observed differences in bacterial community rather than time moreover service line has attracted very little attention compared to distribution mains and plumbing systems our previous study reported that service line possessed high quality deterioration potential by assuming the one time release of all harbored contaminants e g fe mn as and microbes we found that the release of 10 household biofilm significantly altered the bacterial community composition in water liu et al 2017a to the best of our knowledge the present study provides the first evidence of service line s direct and quantitative contributions to potential water quality deterioration at customers ends weighting the contributions from different pipes is important from a management perspective especially to allow water utility managers to prioritize their efforts and investments and to avoid blindness to potential risks it should be mentioned that both main and service line are important although their contributions are different this is especially true considering that opportunistic pathogens might be released from biofilms in both main and service line and the total length and surface area of main pipes are much larger than those of service line the results of the present study emphasize the importance of considering the contribution of service line to potential water quality deterioration proper actions should be taken on service line to manage the drinking water quality at taps however as service lines are mostly dead ends and connected directly to water meters regular cleaning by flushing or pigging would not be feasible further research on service line cleaning strategies and tools is urgently needed 4 2 beyond dwds monitoring from quantitative to qualitative assessment in the present study 50 µm filter bags were installed in front of water meters to collect large particulate matter immigrated from the dwds for extended periods of time without disturbing daily water consumption this in situ and real time sampling method continuously captured and concentrated any possible episodically released large particles from the dwds thereby allowing a quantitative assessment of how many particles elements and microbes arrived at the customers and their spatiotemporal changes however it was not possible to determine where those particles elements microbes came from treatment or distribution system and neither the proportional contributions of different types of pipes e g main vs service line these questions can be answered by applying sourcetracker2 to paired sink particles on filter bags and source main and service line samples the results pinpointed that the highest contributions risks came from service line 63 79 this demonstrated the advantages of combining in situ preconcentration data with the community based sourcetracker to not only quantify changes but also track and apportion the sources moreover continuous sampling can be conducted in a nondestructive manner making this approach applicable in full scale drinking water distribution systems traditionally water utilities are commonly obligated to conduct highly labor and capital cost demanding monitoring programs in dwdss the results of which are mostly used to ensure that the measured parameters fulfill the regulated standard recently online devices have moved dwds monitoring methods toward the emerging big data era the commonly installed sensors include temperature ph pressure conductivity turbidity and free chlorine sensors applications of online particle counters online flow cytometers and online atp meters have also emerged in dwdss these attempts and efforts at high frequency quantitative assessments have shown great advantages and potential for valuable leakage detection and meaningful water quality dynamics description buysschaert et al 2019 koppanen et al 2022 pan et al 2021 safford and bischel 2019 however such purely quantitative measures can hardly offer insights into what is occurring why deterioration happens and where problems may originate qualitative measures in such cases point out an innovative route for water quality monitoring and management moving dwdss into the big data era one step beyond the current demonstration would be the possibility of combining trackable molecular results with online monitorable parameters adopting the possible advantages of machine learning to overcome the limitation of the long processing times required for gene sequencing another possibility would be promoting fully automated online nanopore sequencing integrated with sourcetracking packages though this method will not be financially feasible cost feasible in the near future 4 3 practical implications this study highlighted the importance of service lines for supplying the high quality drinking water to customers taps the contributions of service line have long been neglected in previous research according to our field experiences these pipes connect houses to distribution water mains that are normally buried under gardens or greens ranging in length from a few meters to a dozen of meters mostly 5 10 m for some special cases where the houses are located slightly further from the water mains these lengths could be more than 20 m to bring this issue under the spotlight the potential risks associated with service lines could be easily mitigated by implementing stricter material selection and length optimization which have not yet been considered in addition as such pipes are neither constructed under roads like water mains are nor in building walls such as premise plumbing are thus they can be cleaned or replaced much easier than other pipes without influencing the water supply to other consumers in short attention should be given to these meter long pipes close to taps and maintenance should be performed on such pipes to avoid water quality deterioration and potential risks especially when the dwdss are subjected to disturbances 5 conclusions following the introduction of ro in the drinking water treatment process in this study we captured large particles using filter bags at customers houses and source tracked their origins based on bacterial community fingerprints based on the results of this study the following conclusions can be drawn the elemental concentrations of the main pipes were higher than those of the service line 54 3 268 5 μg cm2 vs 27 1 44 4 μg cm2 both of which were dominated by ca 97 6 99 4 in main pipes 52 5 99 2 in service line the filter bags were dominated by fe and mn 77 5 98 1 after introducing ro ca significantly decreased from the water mains but not from the service line while released fe mn rather than ca arrived at customers taps the atp concentrations in service line were higher than those in main pipes after introducing ro the atp concentrations decreased on the water mains but increased in the service line there were 24 core asvs 13 24 of which were shared by the service line 13 17 main 13 21 and filter bag 13 17 samples no unique core asv was found in the filter bags but all were shared with either main 16 17 or service line 14 17 samples the shared core asvs were mainly assigned to nitrospira spp methylomagnum spp methylocytis spp and iheb2 23 spp according to sourcetracker2 service lines contributed much higher particulate material than main pipes 57 6 13 2 vs 13 0 11 6 to the filter bags meaning that a higher water quality deterioration potential lies in service lines than in water mains service lines have long been neglected appropriate management is necessary through means such as material selection length optimization and proper regulation declaration of competing interest
