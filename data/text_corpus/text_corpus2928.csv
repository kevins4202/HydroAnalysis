14640,since the 1930s sulfonamide sa based antibiotics have served as important pharmaceuticals but their widespread detection in water systems threatens aquatic organisms and human health adsorption via graphene its modified form graphene oxide go and related nanocomposites is a promising method to remove sas owing to the strong and selective surface affinity of graphene go with aromatic compounds however a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between the chemical structure of sas and the go surface is required to predict the performance of go based nanostructured materials to adsorb the individual chemicals making up this large class of pharmaceuticals in this research we studied the adsorptive performance of 3d crumpled graphene balls cgbs to remove 10 sas and 13 structural analogs from water the maximum adsorption capacity qm of sas on cgb increased with the number of 1 aromatic rings 2 electron donating functional groups 3 hydrogen bonding acceptor sites furthermore the cgb surface displayed a preference for homocyclic relative to heterocyclic aromatic structures a leading mechanism π π electron donor acceptor interaction combined with hydrogen bonding explains these trends we developed a multiple linear regression model capable of predicting the qm as a function of sa chemical structure and properties and the oxidation level of cgb the model predicted the adsorptive behaviors of sas well with the exception of a chlorinated fluorinated sa the insights afforded by these experiments and modeling will aid in tailoring graphene based adsorbents to remove micropollutants from water and reduce the growing public health threats associated with antibiotic resistance and endocrine disrupting chemicals graphical abstract image graphical

the first commercialization in the 1930s the sulfonamide sa functional group has formed the basis of antibiotic drugs and has saved countless lives from infectious diseases lengthening life spans and improving quality of life however extensive sa manufacturing utilization and discharge have inadvertently contributed to pharmaceutical contamination of surface and groundwaters and the growing threat of antibiotic resistance liu et al 2018 schwarzenbach et al 2006 unfortunately conventional water treatment technologies can only reduce sa concentrations but fail to remove them completely garcía galán et al 2012 gobel et al 2007 balakrishnan et al 2006 as a consequence many sas are detected in municipal wastewater treatment effluents as well as in surface waters and groundwaters meyer et al 2019 ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 although sas are not highly persistent the high and continuous discharges render sas pseudo persistent at very low levels ng l to μg l in water polianciuc et al 2020 onesios et al 2009 several studies have demonstrated that sas have endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms and humans białk bielińska et al 2011 de liguoro et al 2010 leung et al 2013 yet few regulations restrict the level of these pharmaceuticals in source waters or treated effluents epa 2020 clearly advanced treatment techniques are needed to control sa concentrations at points of release points of use or in source separation applications adsorption is an efficient convenient and widely available option to control levels of sas in the aqueous environment without the creation of toxic by products liu et al 2023 cai et al al 2023 chen et al 2023 tina et al 2020 peiris et al 2017 nairi et al 2017 pi et al 2018 liu et al 2016 zhang et 2016a zhang et 2016b liu et al 2014 chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 braschi et al 2010 ji et al 2009 various traditional and novel adsorbents have been applied for sa removal such as powder granular activated carbon zhang et 2016a natural zeolite braschi et al 2010 biochar peiris et al 2017 porous silica nairi et al 2017 metal organic frameworks mofs pi et al 2018 chen et al 2023 carbon nanotubes ji et al 2009 etc graphene graphene oxide go partially oxidized form of graphene and many other graphene based composites collectively called graphene based nanomaterials gnms have attracted tremendous research attention in recent years as materials showing a strong affinity for organic contaminants in water several studies have reported that gnms exhibit robust adsorption of aqueous phase sas ersan et al 2017 zhang et 2016b liu et al 2016 chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 liu et al 2014 however there are several limitations to the reported gnm studies currently more than 150 synthetic chemicals containing the sulfonamide functional group are available in the market as anti bacterial anti inflammatory and anti hyperglycemia agents as well as diuretics and pesticides zhao et al 2019 most of the environmental research attention however is concentrated on one or two sulfonamide structures and typically sulfamethoxazole is the model structure in many studies many other sulfonamide based compounds which are also frequently detected in the water system have been overlooked as illustrated in fig 1 several adsorption mechanisms are proposed to explain the interaction between sa molecules and gnm surface go as the example in water hydrophobic interactions and π π interaction are the two widely reported mechanisms of organic molecule adsorption on graphene and involve the spontaneous attraction of nonpolar and unsaturated poly cyclic molecules to graphene surface in a polar or aqueous environment zhang et 2016b liu et al 2014 2016 chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 furthermore for many functionalized gnms e g go surface substituents create polar electron rich electron deficient regions and promote instead π π electron donor acceptor eda interactions liu et al 2016 also oxygen containing functional groups e g c o c cooh and c o provide hydrogen acceptor donor sites for hydrogen bonding chen et al 2015 and at specific ph these functional groups may be ionized to promote electrostatic interactions liu et al 2016 yet there is a dearth of knowledge about the relationship between the chemical structures of sas and the go surface and the mechanisms of adsorption furthermore due to different synthesis pathways the chemical properties of gnms vary in many studies and as a result the reported maximum adsorption capacity of the same sa such as sulfamethoxazole can vary over a large range from µg g to mg g zhao et al 2019 pristine graphene and go present in 2d sheet structures are not structurally stable adsorbents in the aqueous solution luo kim and huang 2013 szabo et al 2020 wang et al 2016 hua et al 2015 due to the strong van der waals interaction between the two dimensional sheet structures graphene or go sheets tend to stack and aggregate in water reducing the exposed surface area and limiting their efficacy especially under environmental conditions where the presence of natural organic macromolecules and calcium bicarbonate ions in water can increase graphene stacking szabo et al 2020 wang et al 2016 hua et al 2015 hence efforts to modify the 2d structure of graphene go and eliminate stacking have improved adsorption performance fu et al 2021 in this research we specifically explore how such efforts affect sa adsorption previously we fabricated a novel three dimensional 3d form of go crumpled graphene balls cgbs that displays advanced adsorption performance for many micropollutants including sulfamethoxazole particularly in comparison to go or granular activated carbon gac fu et al 2021 the cgb 3d structure minimizes the 2d sheet stacking of go and the cgb surface shows a high affinity for organic chemicals in environmental aqueous media the objective of this study is to explore the application of cgbs for sa removal in aqueous environments and probe how the molecular structure and physicochemical properties of sas affect their adsorption on cgbs we selected 10 sas and 13 structural analogs with similar chemical structures a total of 23 compounds as adsorbates we detailed the adsorptive behavior of these compounds individually and applied two models langmuir and freundlich isotherm models to describe their adsorption performance we also explored how different adsorption mechanisms are correlated with different sa chemical structures and lead to different adsorption performance we studied the effect of ph on sa adsorption behavior and measured the adsorption kinetics we further interrogated the influence of oxygen containing functional groups of cgbs on sa adsorption by deoxygenating cgbs via different annealing processes and measuring resultant sa adsorption finally we formulated a multiple regression model to describe adsorption based on various physicochemical properties of sas e g polar surface area octanol water partition coefficient molecular surface area etc and the carbon oxygen ratio of cgbs we then validated the model by comparing predictions to experimental data for the adsorption of four other sulfonamide compounds 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials and reagents 10 sas and 13 structural analogs were selected in this study mono cyclic compounds include benzene bz aniline al benzoic

the physical and chemical properties of selected sas were estimated from a cheminformatics software marvin package created by chemaxon product version 20 21 0 only the major species of sas at ph 7 5 were considered the temperature was set at 298 k and no presence of ions was considered also the charge densities of sas structural analogs and cgb in figs 3 s5 s6 s7 and s12 were calculated with the same software graphene oxide aqueous suspension 10 mg ml was manufactured by merk lot number 300 43c formic acid emd 98 and ammonia hydroxide honeywell 5 0 m solution were used to adjust ph as in our previous study milli q water was produced with a milli q rg qpak 1 column water resistivity 18 2 mω cm at 25 c 2 2 synthesis and characterization cgbs were synthesized via the nano spray drying method developed in our previous study fu et al 2021 a 200 ml 0 3 mg ml go aqueous suspension was prepared diluted from the 10 mg ml original suspension and ph adjusted to 6 5 and supplied to the spray dryer buchi nano spray dryer b 90 the go suspension was sprayed at 95 c while continuously stirring the suspension the powder sample was collected in the particle collection chamber at the exit of the instrument and annealed at 150 c for 30 min to remove surface impurities and moisture the synthesized cgbs were characterized via a variety of techniques sem tem specific surface area and pore size analysis xps ftir and raman spectra are summarized in fig s1 2 3 sa analytical methods the quantification of the sas and structural analogs was determined by uv spectroscopy eppendorf biospectrometer basic and the uv peak absorbance of each compound is listed in table s1 per beer s law a standard curve of the peak absorbance of each compound was established as a function of concentration

ph of the prepared solutions was adjusted to 7 5 0 1 with formic acid or ammonia hydroxide the prepared solutions were dispensed into 20 ml teflon lined screw top glass vials and 2 0 mg cgb dose 0 1 mg ml was then added all sample vials were mixed on a platform shaker innova 2100 200 rpm room temperature for 24 h to reach equilibrium after 24 h of shaking the vials were sampled via a syringe bd 1 ml tb syringe and 0 2 µm ptfe syringe filter whatman puradisc 4 part 6784 0402 the initial and final concentrations of the samples were then analyzed via the uv vis spectra as described in section 2 3 two isotherm models langmuir and freundlich models were fit to the experimental data more details are listed in table s2 kinetic adsorption studies were conducted on the four sas saa apb sa smz and sdz through batch experiments the kinetic studies were conducted at an initial sa concentration of 20 mg l in 50 ml after the addition of the adsorbent cgb dose of 1 mg ml the solution was sampled at periodic intervals over 30 min 1 2 3 6 9 15 30 min the kinetics of different sas were evaluated via the pseudo first order reaction ln s a 0 ln s a t k t where sa 0 and sa t are the initial sa concentration and concentration mg l at time t min respectively and k is the pseudo first order reaction constant min 1 2 5 partition coefficient at different ph the adsorption performance of three selected sas monocyclic saa bicyclic aps sa and homocyclic heterocyclic smz at different phs was measured by the adsorbent water partition coefficient defined as k d c 0 c e c e v m where kd

2 3 2 6 deoxygenation of cgbs the deoxygenation of cgbs was conducted via a thermal approach klemeyer et al 2021 twenty mg powder cgb samples after the nano spraying procedure were annealed at 150 c for 30 min original cgb 2 4 6 and 8 h and the degree of oxidation was followed with thermo scientific escalab 250xi xps adsorption isotherms were measured for each of the five cgbs on four representative sas saa apb sa smz and sdz which were selected to test the effects of different aromaticity and heterocyclic structure by the same procedure described in section 2 4 2 7 the statistical model to estimate the adsorption behavior of sas an empirical multiple linear regression model based on both the properties of sas and cgbs is described in the following equation log q m b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 b n x n where qm is the estimated langmuir adsorption capacity b0 b1 b2 bn are constant coefficients and x1 x2 xn are molecular descriptors of sas and cgbs shown in table s1 the multiple linear regression model was computed via data analysis add in in excel on microsoft office 365 four extra sas sotalol fomesafen sulfasalazine and sulfanitran were used to validate the accuracy of the statistical model table s1 also lists key chemical information of the four extra sas 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent cgb the intrinsic characteristics of cgb used in the studies are summarized in fig s1 briefly cgbs show the crumpled structure and the pore size analysis indicates a micro mesoporous structure ftir and xps confirm the surface chemical characteristics of cgbs are more similar to graphene oxide than to graphene due to the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface in addition cgb shows structural stability after 24 h of vigorous stirring fig s3a c d while the aggregation stacking of 2d graphene oxide can be easily observed fig s3b e f 3 2 adsorption capacity and affinity of different sas the adsorption isotherms of all selected chemicals are presented in fig s4 the langmuir model provides a better fit than the freundlich model and hence langmuir adsorption capacity qm and adsorption affinity kl were utilized for the basis of comparison details in table s2 fig 2 summarizes the qm for mono cyclic aromatic compounds fig 2a and bi cyclic aromatic compounds fig 2b along with their chemical structures a comparison of fig 2a and b reveals a clear adsorption trend of substituted bi cyclic aromatic rings sorbing to a greater extent than mono cyclic rings this trend can be explained by the increased aromaticity and the influence of functional groups on the electron density in bicyclic compounds which promote more interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate compared to monocyclic compounds among the mono cyclic aromatic compounds fig 2a bz unsubstituted homocyclic aromatic and ix unsubstituted heterocyclic aromatic show negligible adsorption on cgbs in water which is likely due to water mediated steric hindrance namely the hydrogen bonding between h2o molecules and the oxygen containing functional groups on the cgb surface that prevents adsorption of aromatic compounds in the aqueous environment tang et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 thakuria et al 2019 this is explained by the fact that π π interactions which were previously reported as a major mechanism of interaction between aromatic compounds and the graphene surface exhibit weaker binding energy 4 kj mol than hydrogen bonding 0 20 kj mol between h2o molecules cgbs and thus fail to overcome the water mediated steric hindrance tang et al 2018 compared to these simple aromatic compounds bz or ix substituted aromatic compounds show significantly improved adsorption performance among all studied substituents electron donating functional groups edg enhance adsorption to a greater extent than electron withdrawing functional groups ewg for example al and pn with edg nh2 and oh show 1 5 3 fold larger qm in comparison to n bz ba and bsa with ewg no2 cooh and so2nh2 respectively the ch3 group in mix and a mix however is an outliner the ch3 group is a weak electron donating functional group but we observe a negligible effect on adsorption particularly relative to the positive effect of the amino group on a mix also the maximum adsorption qm of a compound with both edg and ewg e g saa and paba is intermediate between the compounds with only one edg substitution al pn and the compounds with only one ewg substitution bsa ba furthermore functional groups such as nh2 must be directly substituted to the aromatic ring to serve as an edg to strengthen the adsorption explaining why the qm of saa nh2 directly substituted is 1 4 times greater than has nh2 indirectly substituted we also note that in the case of a mix the negligible adsorption of heterocyclic aromatic compounds ix and mix is significantly improved by edg substitution nh2 although not to the extent observed in al a homocyclic aromatic structure fig 2b shows the adsorption capacity of bi cyclic compounds including many commercialized sas e g apb sa spy sdz sde sdx and smz all of which have two aromatic rings and multiple edg ewg substituents all bi cyclic sas exhibit large adsorption capacity 1 3 7 times greater than monocyclic qm indicating cgbs are effective adsorbents for sa removal in the aqueous environment several observations from the mono cyclic system are also applicable to the bi cyclic system 1 both edg ewg strengthen the adsorption performance of sas compared to the unsubstituted bp 2 edgs are more favorable than ewgs for example a decreasing trend in qm values is evident with ppe two edg apb sa two edg and one ewg aps one edg and one ewg ds one ewg in another example when the nh2 group edg in smz is replaced with a no2 group ewg in n smz the qm is diminished by 10 3 heterocyclic structures lessen sa adsorption on cgb the qm decreases as a function of introducing heteroatoms nitrogen into the aromatic ring as illustrated by apb sa spy sdz we propose that adsorption on cgb is favored by electron rich edg substitutions into homo cyclic aromatic rings no heteroatoms which promote π π eda interactions fig 3 shows the charge densities of various monocyclic adsorbates on the cgb surface with no substituent bz fig 3a only one edg al fig 3b only one ewg bsa fig 3c and both edg ewg ssa fig 3d different adsorption interactions are also marked with color shaded dashed lines in fig 3 similarly the charge densities of bicyclic compounds bp ppe ds and aps and various adsorption mechanisms are illustrated in fig s5a d in general except for bz bp all bicyclic compounds ppe ds and aps in fig s5b d promote more potential interactions more dashed lines with the cgb surface in comparison to monocyclic compounds al bsa and ssa in fig 3b and c resulting in the larger qm the π π interactions green shaded dotted line are the primary mechanism of adsorption in simple aromatic systems with no substituent bz in fig 3a and bp in fig s5a but these interactions are disrupted by water mediated steric hindrance and result in negligible qm of bz and bp when substituents are present edg can create an electron rich aromatic ring al in fig 3b and ppe in fig s5b while ewg can produce an electron deficient ring bsa in fig 3c and ds in fig s5c meanwhile the polarity of the cgb surface is also modified by the creation of electron rich electron deficient regions due to its functionalization by various oxygen containing groups the alignment of electron rich electron deficient regions figs 3b d and s3b d between the adsorbate and adsorbent generates more favorable interactions than the hydrophobic interactions of bz bp figs 3a and s3a and the energetics associated with π π eda interactions are sufficient to displace h bonded water at the cgb surface yi et al 2020 xiao et al 2015 sutton et al 2017 we also observe that edg is more favorable than ewg in π π eda interaction because the electron rich ring created by edg is attractive to the large electron deficient regions on the cgb surface created by epoxides epoxides are the dominant oxygen containing functional groups on the cgb surface confirmed by xps in fig s1e and are strongly electron withdrawing groups for an aromatic ring shudo et al 1977 as illustrated in fig s6 multiple epoxides create large electron deficient regions on the cgb surface whereas the epoxides themselves are electron rich points which have less effect on π π eda interaction the large electron deficient regions on cgbs are more attractive to sas with edg and electron rich ring s e g al in fig 3b very strong π π eda interactions and large qm than sas with only ewg and electron deficient ring s e g bsa in fig 3c strong π π eda interactions and relatively small qm in the case of ssa fig 3d the presence of both edg ewg only creates a net electron deficient ring and thus ssa exhibits strong π π eda interactions in fig 3d not comparable to very strong π π eda interactions as al but the amino functional groups nh2 and so2nh2 can promote hydrogen bonding blue shaded dotted lines and lead to an intermediate qm in fig 3d in the case of heterocyclic sas fig s5e h heteroatoms e g oxygen and nitrogen create highly electron rich spots while the remaining aromatic ring is electron deficient we propose that the highly electron rich spots of the heteroatoms repel the electron rich regions of cgbs and weaken overall the π π eda interactions between the electron deficient sa ring and the electron rich regions of cgbs we indicate that π π eda interactions for heterocyclic compounds are weak in fig s5e h to show that the heterocyclic structure has less favorable π π eda interactions furthermore substituents do not change the charge density of the heterocyclic rings e g similar charge densities of sdz in fig s5f and sde sdx in fig s5g h which explains why sdz no substituents shows a similar qm compared to sde and sdx two och3 substituents in fig 2b overall we find that qm increases as a function of increasing average electron densities of the aromatic ring fig s7 in the monocyclic system fig s7a qm of al average electron density 0 10e pn 0 07e paba 0 06e ba 0 04e ssa 0 02e bsa 0 00e n bz 0 01e in the bicyclic system fig s7b qm of ppe average charge densities of two rings 0 07e apb sa 0 07e 0 01e aps 0 01e 0 02e ds 0 01e 0 01e in addition an inversely proportional relationship is observed between qm and the number of heteroatoms in the ring fig s7b qm of apb sa no heteroatom spy one n heteroatom sdz two n heteroatoms no substitution sde two n heteroatoms two substitutions sdx two n heteroatoms two substitutions we also list the langmuir adsorption affinity constant kl of all studied compounds shown in fig s8 bi cyclic compounds generally display a stronger affinity kl with cgb than mono cyclic compounds also in both mono cyclic and bi cyclic systems those compounds with homocyclic aromatic rings show stronger affinity than those compounds with heterocyclic aromatic rings those compounds with multiple h acceptor donor sites e g mono cyclic paba with cooh nh2 and bi cyclic ppe with two nh2 show higher adsorption affinity than other compounds which may reflect that in addition to the π π eda interaction hydrogen bonding can further strengthen the adsorption affinity and lead to the large kl values lastly we investigated the kinetics of adsorption on cgb using four model sas saa apb sa sdz and smz fig s9a shows the time dependent adsorption curves with estimated pseudo first order constants fig s9b all sas show the adsorption process is rapid and equilibrium is reached within 15 min among the four sas apb sa bi cyclic aromatic rings shows the fastest adsorption process followed by saa mono cyclic aromatic rings then sdz and smz bi cyclic rings one homocyclic and the other heterocyclic these trends suggest that rapid adsorption is favored by homocyclic structures functionalized with multiple edg ewg and that the presence of a heterocyclic ring may suppress the rate of adsorption regardless of the number of aromatic rings and type of substitution 3 3 the effect of ph on sa adsorption and the role of electrostatic interactions solution ph determines the charge of sas and the cgb surface and thus influences their electrostatic interactions khan et al 2017 generally as illustrated in fig 4 sas are positively charged sa at low ph 0 2 neutral sao between ph 2 8 and negatively charged sa at ph 9 meanwhile cgb is neutral slightly positively charged at ph 1 and becomes more and more negatively charged as the ph increases from 2 to 11 fig s10 the partition coefficient kd of three representative sas saa smz apb sa and their pka values are also shown in fig 4 all three sas show similar adsorption patterns the neutral species sao bears the highest kd compared to the two charged forms sa and sa electrostatic interactions between ionized functional groups have been reported as a potential mechanism for adsorption on graphene based nanomaterials gnm khan et al 2017 yet in our study we do not observe that electrostatic interactions are a major adsorption mechanism between sas and cgb at low ph ph 1 2 sas present as sa while cgb is neutral slightly positively charged between ph 2 9 neutral sao is the dominating species of sa and cgb is negatively charged even worse high ph ph 9 promotes deprotonation of the sulfonamide group of sas or other hydrogen containing functional groups such as oh on cgb suppressing hydrogen bonding and promoting electrostatic repulsion in natural water systems ph varies from 6 to 9 sas are predominantly neutral species sao which show maximum adsorption on cgb indicating that cgb can serve as a practical adsorbent for sa removal in realistic water systems 3 4 the effect of cgb oxidation on sa adsorption as a functionalized form of graphene go bears various oxygen functional groups such as cooh oh c o and primarily c o c groups due to the effects of different synthesis methods the degree of oxidation of go can vary over a large range and lead to very different sa adsorption reynosa martínez et al 2020 carvalho et al 2021 hence in our study we consider the degree of oxidation of our adsorbent cgb as a critical parameter influencing sa adsorption we tune the degree of oxidation of cgb by varying durations of thermal treatments and evaluate their subsequent adsorption performance table s3 summarizes the c o ratio calculated from xps spectra of cgbs undergoing different degrees of calcination original cgb 150 c for 2 4 6 and 8 h deoxygenation of cgb occurs sharply in the first 30 min and continues over the entire 8 h of heating the heating procedure results in a c o ratio increase proportionally to increasing c c fraction and decreasing c o c fraction fig 5 shows the maximum adsorption capacities of four sas saa apb sa smz and sdz at different carbon oxygen ratios of cgb fig 5a c c bonding fraction in the carbon content of cgb fig 5b and c o c bonding fraction in the carbon content of cgb fig 5c with detailed adsorption isotherms in fig s11 in fig 5 the qm for each sa decreases as the c o ratio fig 5a and c c fraction of carbon content fig 5b in cgbs increase in contrast a reverse trend is observed relative to the c o c content fig 5c where qm increased as a function of increasing c o c fraction we propose that the presence of c o c on cgbs plays a number of roles 1 c o c creates a hydrophilic surface that allows greater solvation in water 2 c o ccreates electron rich electron deficient regions on cgb aromatic rings and itself serves as a polar substituent promoting π π eda interaction 3 the oxygen atom in c o c serves as the acceptor for hydrogen bonding 3 5 statistical model to estimate sa structure adsorption performance relationship our study has investigated the adsorption behavior of 10 existing sas but there are many more commercially available sas on the market and rapid product development in the pharmaceutical industry will likely bring more sas into the marketplace hence a predictive model would be helpful to provide accurate estimates of sa adsorption based on their physical chemical properties in the absence of experiments previously single parameter or poly parameter linear free energy relationships sp lfer pp lfer have been utilized to estimate the freundlich affinity coefficients of various organic contaminants based on their physical chemical properties or molecular descriptors the adsorption of organic water contaminants on several carbonaceous adsorbents such as wood char plata et al 2015 activated carbon shih et al 2009 carbon nanotube webb et al 2022 su et al 2020 and beta cyclodextrin ching et al 2022 have been estimated by using sp lfer pp lfer approaches but as far as we know no such predictive model of adsorption has been conducted for graphene or graphene oxide we first evaluated how well a single molecular descriptor can predict sa adsorptive behavior on cgb by using two common molecular descriptors the octanol water coefficient log kow an index of a chemical s hydrophobicity and the polar surface area psa both descriptors are widely employed in pharmacological drug design to quantify changes to the cell membrane permeability of a particular chemical structure harris et al 2014 matsson and kihlberg 2017 fig s12a illustrates the relationship between the experimental qm and the log kow to show two positive but weak correlations one for monocyclic rings and another for bicyclic compounds similar correlations between the experimental qm fig s12b and the psa of each compound show slightly improved negative relationships for the two structural chemical groups overall then single parameter models do not adequately and comprehensively describe the adsorption of these two classes of adsorbates therefore we formulated two predictive poly parameter linear regression models for sa adsorption on cgb based on a series of sa and cgb properties in model i we chose ten molecular descriptors including log kow psa molecular weight mw molecule surface area hydrogen bonding donor acceptor aromatic atomic count aromatic bond count atomic number count and total bond count values listed in table s1 of the 23 compounds we studied to predict the absorption capacity qm and compare it to experimental qm fig 6 a b in addition model ii fig 6c and d incorporated one cgb characteristic the c o ratio discussed in section 3 4 the model details are shown in table s4 overall the predicted qm of both models agrees well with measured values for the 23 sa and structural analog chemicals having r2 values of 0 94 model i and 0 80 model ii furthermore we can evaluate the significance of different descriptors via the calculated p values listed in table s4 a p value of 0 05 or lower is generally considered statistically significant and more relevant descriptors show smaller p values berkson 1942 in model i log kow p value 0 00162 aromatic atomic bond counts p value 0 01102 and 0 00438 polar surface area p value 0 04590 mw p value 0 01228 and molecular surface area p value 0 00843 display the significant p values among all the descriptors two highly relevant descriptors aromatic atomic bond counts and log kow indicate the importance of aromatic structure and hydrophobicity in sa adsorption polar surface area is nearly significant which indicates polarity provided by edg ewg is an important property of sas the size of the sa molecules represented by mw and molecular surface area is also important a large molecule with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups ensures more adsorption interactions at the adsorbent surface compared to model i model ii s predictions generally fit the experimental data less well smaller r2 value which might be caused by the insufficient data around the c o ratio since we only have the experiment data for 4 sas smz saa apb sa and sdz on the original and 4 deoxygenated cgbs in addition to the relevant molecular descriptors identified for model i a few other molecular descriptors are found to be important in model ii for instance the h donor of sas p value 0 02608 and the carbon oxygen ratio of cgb p value 2 36e 06 are also critical parameters and are related to hydrogen bonding between functional groups on sas such as nh2 and the c o c on cgbs finally we validated the accuracy of the models by using the four test chemicals sotalol a monocyclic aromatic having a terminal sulfonamide substitution used as heart medication and beta blocker sulfanitran a bicyclic aromatic with sulfonamide linkage used as an antibiotic in the poultry industry sulfasalazine a three ring structure with two homocyclic aromatics linked to a heterocycle with a sulfonamide linkage used as an anti inflammatory drug fomesafen a bicyclic aromatic with trifluoromethyl chlorine and sulfonamide substitutions used as an herbicide their structures are shown in fig 6 their chemical properties are listed in table s1 and their adsorption isotherms are listed in fig s13 among the four test chemicals sotalol sulfanitran and sulfasalazine show good agreement between the predicted and experimental qm sotalol shows a 3 0 deviation model i and 12 6 deviation model ii sulfanitran shows 26 0 deviation model i and 9 0 model ii sulfasalazine shows 5 5 deviation model i and 26 1 deviation model ii both models however overestimate the adsorption behavior of fomesafen with model ii showing greater deviation between predicted and experimental qm than model i which is probably due to insufficient data for the c o ratio in model ii and inaccurate estimation of the hydrogen bonding between fomesafen and cgbs compared to other sa test chemicals fomeafen has several halogens three fluorine and one chlorine present in the structure both cl and cf3 are ewgs and are substituted into the same aromatic ring creating an electron deficient ring the other aromatic ring has a no2 substitution also an ewg creating another electron deficient ring charge density shown in fig s14 in contrast to fomesafen without halogen substitutions log kow 2 20 the presence of halogen substituents enhances the lipophilicity of the structure increasing the log kow to 3 14 table s1 overall considering π π eda interaction is the dominant mechanism we expected that the adsorption behavior of fomeafen would be comparable to those bicyclic sas with electron deficient rings such as ds or n smz and in fact the experimental qm of fomesafen is 0 68 mmol g which is comparable if slightly less however halogens also contribute to the total molecular weight and molecular surface area fomeafen has a molecular weight of 403 76 g mol and an estimated molecular surface area of 500 11 å both values are 75 100 larger than other bi cyclic sas and closer to the tri cyclic sa sulfasalazine fomesafen adsorption on cgb is greatly overestimated by both our models model i predicted a qm of 2 82 mmol g which was more than 4 fold greater than the measured value for fomesafen and model ii predicted qm 5 21 mmol g which is 7 5 times greater than the measured value our models lack the molecular descriptors that accurately estimate the effects of halogen substitutions in an aromatic ring on adsorptive interactions at a cgb surface future work will focus on explaining this behavior 4 conclusions in this study we probe the adsorption behavior of various sas and structural analogs on an engineered 3d graphene based material cgb π π eda interaction serves as the primary adsorption mechanism contributing to sa adsorption and hydrogen bonding is a plus other mechanisms reported previously in fig 1 may contribute marginally or even negligibly to sa adsorption the adsorption of sa compounds increases with the number of homocyclic aromatic rings and edg substitutions have more favorable interactions with the cgb surface owing to the resultant electron rich structure that promotes π π eda interactions sa adsorption is favorable at ph 6 9 due to the neutral sa charge but is suppressed at phs outside this range due to the like charge repulsion of sa and cgb thermal deoxygenation of cgb increases the c o ratio and decreases the c o c content of cgb which significantly reduces the sa adsorption indicating c o ratio is an important characteristic of the adsorbent to consider kinetic experiments reveal that homocyclic sas functionalized with multiple edg ewg show a fast adsorption process finally we formulated two statistical models aimed at predicting the adsorption capacities of sas based on the structure and chemical properties of the adsorbates and adsorbent and we validated the model with four different sas both models predicted the adsorption of three of the four sas well showing good agreement with experimental data the models overestimated the adsorptive behavior of fomesafen due to the presence of chloro and fluoro substitutions in its structure future research will be directed to i further modification of cgb to create a robust and cost efficient gnm based adsorbent for sa removal for instance the utilization of inexpensive and earth abundant metal oxide to create a metal oxide graphene nanocomposite via nano spray drying is an efficient strategy to create more adsorptive surface

14640,since the 1930s sulfonamide sa based antibiotics have served as important pharmaceuticals but their widespread detection in water systems threatens aquatic organisms and human health adsorption via graphene its modified form graphene oxide go and related nanocomposites is a promising method to remove sas owing to the strong and selective surface affinity of graphene go with aromatic compounds however a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between the chemical structure of sas and the go surface is required to predict the performance of go based nanostructured materials to adsorb the individual chemicals making up this large class of pharmaceuticals in this research we studied the adsorptive performance of 3d crumpled graphene balls cgbs to remove 10 sas and 13 structural analogs from water the maximum adsorption capacity qm of sas on cgb increased with the number of 1 aromatic rings 2 electron donating functional groups 3 hydrogen bonding acceptor sites furthermore the cgb surface displayed a preference for homocyclic relative to heterocyclic aromatic structures a leading mechanism π π electron donor acceptor interaction combined with hydrogen bonding explains these trends we developed a multiple linear regression model capable of predicting the qm as a function of sa chemical structure and properties and the oxidation level of cgb the model predicted the adsorptive behaviors of sas well with the exception of a chlorinated fluorinated sa the insights afforded by these experiments and modeling will aid in tailoring graphene based adsorbents to remove micropollutants from water and reduce the growing public health threats associated with antibiotic resistance and endocrine disrupting chemicals graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfonamides micropollutant removal antibiotics removal adsorption multiple linear regression graphene oxide graphene composites 3d graphene based nanomaterials 1 introduction since the first commercialization in the 1930s the sulfonamide sa functional group has formed the basis of antibiotic drugs and has saved countless lives from infectious diseases lengthening life spans and improving quality of life however extensive sa manufacturing utilization and discharge have inadvertently contributed to pharmaceutical contamination of surface and groundwaters and the growing threat of antibiotic resistance liu et al 2018 schwarzenbach et al 2006 unfortunately conventional water treatment technologies can only reduce sa concentrations but fail to remove them completely garcía galán et al 2012 gobel et al 2007 balakrishnan et al 2006 as a consequence many sas are detected in municipal wastewater treatment effluents as well as in surface waters and groundwaters meyer et al 2019 ma et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 although sas are not highly persistent the high and continuous discharges render sas pseudo persistent at very low levels ng l to μg l in water polianciuc et al 2020 onesios et al 2009 several studies have demonstrated that sas have endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms and humans białk bielińska et al 2011 de liguoro et al 2010 leung et al 2013 yet few regulations restrict the level of these pharmaceuticals in source waters or treated effluents epa 2020 clearly advanced treatment techniques are needed to control sa concentrations at points of release points of use or in source separation applications adsorption is an efficient convenient and widely available option to control levels of sas in the aqueous environment without the creation of toxic by products liu et al 2023 cai et al al 2023 chen et al 2023 tina et al 2020 peiris et al 2017 nairi et al 2017 pi et al 2018 liu et al 2016 zhang et 2016a zhang et 2016b liu et al 2014 chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 braschi et al 2010 ji et al 2009 various traditional and novel adsorbents have been applied for sa removal such as powder granular activated carbon zhang et 2016a natural zeolite braschi et al 2010 biochar peiris et al 2017 porous silica nairi et al 2017 metal organic frameworks mofs pi et al 2018 chen et al 2023 carbon nanotubes ji et al 2009 etc graphene graphene oxide go partially oxidized form of graphene and many other graphene based composites collectively called graphene based nanomaterials gnms have attracted tremendous research attention in recent years as materials showing a strong affinity for organic contaminants in water several studies have reported that gnms exhibit robust adsorption of aqueous phase sas ersan et al 2017 zhang et 2016b liu et al 2016 chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 liu et al 2014 however there are several limitations to the reported gnm studies currently more than 150 synthetic chemicals containing the sulfonamide functional group are available in the market as anti bacterial anti inflammatory and anti hyperglycemia agents as well as diuretics and pesticides zhao et al 2019 most of the environmental research attention however is concentrated on one or two sulfonamide structures and typically sulfamethoxazole is the model structure in many studies many other sulfonamide based compounds which are also frequently detected in the water system have been overlooked as illustrated in fig 1 several adsorption mechanisms are proposed to explain the interaction between sa molecules and gnm surface go as the example in water hydrophobic interactions and π π interaction are the two widely reported mechanisms of organic molecule adsorption on graphene and involve the spontaneous attraction of nonpolar and unsaturated poly cyclic molecules to graphene surface in a polar or aqueous environment zhang et 2016b liu et al 2014 2016 chen et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 furthermore for many functionalized gnms e g go surface substituents create polar electron rich electron deficient regions and promote instead π π electron donor acceptor eda interactions liu et al 2016 also oxygen containing functional groups e g c o c cooh and c o provide hydrogen acceptor donor sites for hydrogen bonding chen et al 2015 and at specific ph these functional groups may be ionized to promote electrostatic interactions liu et al 2016 yet there is a dearth of knowledge about the relationship between the chemical structures of sas and the go surface and the mechanisms of adsorption furthermore due to different synthesis pathways the chemical properties of gnms vary in many studies and as a result the reported maximum adsorption capacity of the same sa such as sulfamethoxazole can vary over a large range from µg g to mg g zhao et al 2019 pristine graphene and go present in 2d sheet structures are not structurally stable adsorbents in the aqueous solution luo kim and huang 2013 szabo et al 2020 wang et al 2016 hua et al 2015 due to the strong van der waals interaction between the two dimensional sheet structures graphene or go sheets tend to stack and aggregate in water reducing the exposed surface area and limiting their efficacy especially under environmental conditions where the presence of natural organic macromolecules and calcium bicarbonate ions in water can increase graphene stacking szabo et al 2020 wang et al 2016 hua et al 2015 hence efforts to modify the 2d structure of graphene go and eliminate stacking have improved adsorption performance fu et al 2021 in this research we specifically explore how such efforts affect sa adsorption previously we fabricated a novel three dimensional 3d form of go crumpled graphene balls cgbs that displays advanced adsorption performance for many micropollutants including sulfamethoxazole particularly in comparison to go or granular activated carbon gac fu et al 2021 the cgb 3d structure minimizes the 2d sheet stacking of go and the cgb surface shows a high affinity for organic chemicals in environmental aqueous media the objective of this study is to explore the application of cgbs for sa removal in aqueous environments and probe how the molecular structure and physicochemical properties of sas affect their adsorption on cgbs we selected 10 sas and 13 structural analogs with similar chemical structures a total of 23 compounds as adsorbates we detailed the adsorptive behavior of these compounds individually and applied two models langmuir and freundlich isotherm models to describe their adsorption performance we also explored how different adsorption mechanisms are correlated with different sa chemical structures and lead to different adsorption performance we studied the effect of ph on sa adsorption behavior and measured the adsorption kinetics we further interrogated the influence of oxygen containing functional groups of cgbs on sa adsorption by deoxygenating cgbs via different annealing processes and measuring resultant sa adsorption finally we formulated a multiple regression model to describe adsorption based on various physicochemical properties of sas e g polar surface area octanol water partition coefficient molecular surface area etc and the carbon oxygen ratio of cgbs we then validated the model by comparing predictions to experimental data for the adsorption of four other sulfonamide compounds 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials and reagents 10 sas and 13 structural analogs were selected in this study mono cyclic compounds include benzene bz aniline al benzoic

same software graphene oxide aqueous suspension 10 mg ml was manufactured by merk lot number 300 43c formic acid emd 98 and ammonia hydroxide honeywell 5 0 m solution were used to adjust ph as in our previous study milli q water was produced with a milli q rg qpak 1 column water resistivity 18 2 mω cm at 25 c 2 2 synthesis and characterization cgbs were synthesized via the nano spray drying method developed in our previous study fu et al 2021 a 200 ml 0 3 mg ml go aqueous suspension was prepared diluted from the 10 mg ml original suspension and ph adjusted to 6 5 and supplied to the spray dryer buchi nano spray dryer b 90 the go suspension was sprayed at 95 c while continuously stirring the suspension the powder sample was collected in the particle collection chamber at the exit of the instrument and annealed at 150 c for 30 min to remove surface impurities and moisture the synthesized cgbs were characterized via a variety of techniques sem tem specific surface area and pore size

two isotherm models langmuir and freundlich models were fit to the experimental data more details are listed in table s2 kinetic adsorption studies were conducted on the four sas saa apb sa smz and sdz through batch experiments the kinetic studies were conducted at an initial sa concentration of 20 mg l in 50 ml after the addition of the adsorbent cgb dose of 1 mg ml the solution was sampled at periodic intervals over 30 min 1 2 3 6 9 15 30 min the kinetics of different sas were evaluated via the pseudo first order reaction ln s a 0 ln s a t k t where sa 0 and sa t are the initial sa

for 30 min original cgb 2 4 6 and 8 h and the degree of oxidation was followed with thermo scientific escalab 250xi xps adsorption isotherms were measured for each of the five cgbs on four representative sas saa apb sa smz and sdz which were selected to test the effects of different aromaticity and heterocyclic structure by the same procedure described in section 2 4 2 7 the statistical model to estimate the adsorption behavior of sas an empirical multiple linear regression model based on both the properties of sas and cgbs is described in the following equation log q m b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b 3 x 3 b n x n where qm is the estimated langmuir adsorption capacity b0 b1 b2 bn are constant coefficients and x1 x2 xn are molecular descriptors of sas and cgbs shown in table s1 the multiple linear regression model was computed via data analysis add in in excel on microsoft office 365 four extra sas sotalol fomesafen sulfasalazine and sulfanitran were used to validate the accuracy of the statistical model table s1 also lists key chemical information of the four extra sas 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent cgb the intrinsic characteristics of cgb used in the studies are summarized in fig s1 briefly cgbs show the crumpled structure and the pore size analysis indicates a micro mesoporous structure ftir and xps confirm the surface chemical characteristics of cgbs are more similar to graphene oxide than to graphene due to the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface in addition cgb shows structural stability after 24 h of vigorous stirring fig s3a c d while the aggregation stacking of 2d graphene oxide can be easily observed fig s3b e f 3 2 adsorption capacity and affinity of different sas the adsorption isotherms of all selected chemicals are presented in fig s4 the langmuir model provides a better fit than the freundlich model and hence langmuir adsorption capacity qm and adsorption affinity kl were utilized for the basis of comparison details in table s2 fig 2 summarizes the qm for mono cyclic aromatic compounds fig 2a and bi cyclic aromatic compounds fig 2b along with their chemical structures a comparison of fig 2a and b reveals a clear adsorption trend of substituted bi cyclic aromatic rings sorbing to a greater extent than mono cyclic rings this trend can be explained by the increased aromaticity and the influence of functional groups on the electron density in bicyclic compounds which promote more interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate compared to monocyclic compounds among the mono cyclic aromatic compounds fig 2a bz unsubstituted homocyclic aromatic and ix unsubstituted heterocyclic aromatic show negligible adsorption on cgbs in water which is likely due to water mediated steric hindrance namely the hydrogen bonding between h2o molecules and the oxygen containing functional groups on the cgb surface that prevents adsorption of aromatic compounds in the aqueous environment tang et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 thakuria et al 2019 this is explained by the fact that π π interactions which were previously reported as a major mechanism of interaction between aromatic compounds and the graphene surface exhibit weaker binding energy 4 kj mol than hydrogen bonding 0 20 kj mol between h2o molecules cgbs and thus fail to overcome the water mediated steric hindrance tang et al 2018 compared to these simple aromatic compounds bz or ix substituted aromatic compounds show significantly improved adsorption performance among all studied substituents electron donating functional groups edg enhance adsorption to a greater extent than electron withdrawing functional groups ewg for example al and pn with edg nh2 and oh show 1 5 3 fold larger qm in comparison to n bz ba and bsa with ewg no2 cooh and so2nh2 respectively the ch3 group in mix and a mix however is an outliner the ch3 group is a weak electron donating functional group but we observe a negligible effect on adsorption particularly relative to the positive effect of the amino group on a mix also the maximum adsorption qm of a compound with both edg and ewg e g saa and paba is intermediate between the compounds with only one edg substitution al pn and the compounds with only one ewg substitution bsa ba furthermore functional groups such as nh2 must be directly substituted to the aromatic ring to serve as an edg to strengthen the adsorption explaining why the qm of saa nh2 directly substituted is 1 4 times greater than has nh2 indirectly substituted we also note that in the case of a mix the negligible adsorption of heterocyclic aromatic compounds ix and mix is significantly improved by edg substitution nh2 although not to the extent observed in al a homocyclic aromatic structure fig 2b shows the adsorption capacity of bi cyclic compounds including many commercialized sas e g apb sa spy sdz sde sdx and smz all of which have two aromatic rings and multiple edg ewg substituents all bi cyclic sas exhibit large adsorption capacity 1 3 7 times greater than monocyclic qm indicating cgbs are effective adsorbents for sa removal in the aqueous environment several observations from the mono cyclic system are also applicable to the bi cyclic system 1 both edg ewg strengthen the adsorption performance of sas compared to the unsubstituted bp 2 edgs are more favorable than ewgs for example a decreasing trend in qm values is evident with ppe two edg apb sa two edg and one ewg aps one edg and one ewg ds one ewg in another example when the nh2 group edg in smz is replaced with a no2 group ewg in n smz the qm is diminished by 10 3 heterocyclic structures lessen sa adsorption on cgb the qm decreases as a function of introducing heteroatoms nitrogen into the aromatic ring as illustrated by apb sa spy sdz we propose that adsorption on cgb is favored by electron rich edg substitutions into homo cyclic aromatic rings no heteroatoms which promote π π eda interactions fig 3 shows the charge densities of various monocyclic adsorbates on the cgb surface with no substituent bz fig 3a only one edg al fig 3b only one ewg bsa fig 3c and both edg ewg ssa fig 3d different adsorption interactions are also marked with color shaded dashed lines in fig 3 similarly the charge densities of bicyclic compounds bp ppe ds and aps and various adsorption mechanisms are illustrated in fig s5a d in general except for bz bp all bicyclic compounds ppe ds and aps in fig s5b d promote more potential interactions more dashed lines with the cgb surface in comparison to monocyclic compounds al bsa and ssa in fig 3b and c resulting in the larger qm the π π interactions green shaded dotted line are the primary mechanism of adsorption in simple aromatic systems with no substituent bz in fig 3a and bp in fig s5a but these interactions are disrupted by water mediated steric hindrance and result in negligible qm of bz and bp when substituents are present edg can create an electron rich aromatic ring al in fig 3b and ppe in fig s5b while ewg can produce an electron deficient ring bsa in fig 3c and ds in fig s5c meanwhile the polarity of the cgb surface is also modified by the creation of electron rich electron deficient regions due to its functionalization by various oxygen containing groups the alignment of electron rich electron deficient regions figs 3b d and s3b d between the adsorbate and adsorbent generates more favorable interactions than the hydrophobic interactions of bz bp figs 3a and s3a and the energetics associated with π π eda interactions are sufficient to displace h bonded water at the cgb surface yi et al 2020 xiao et al 2015 sutton et al 2017 we also observe that edg is more favorable than ewg in π π eda interaction because the electron rich ring created by edg is attractive to the large electron deficient regions on the cgb surface created by epoxides epoxides are the dominant oxygen containing functional groups on the cgb surface confirmed by xps in fig s1e and are strongly electron withdrawing groups for an aromatic ring shudo et al 1977 as illustrated in fig s6 multiple epoxides create large electron deficient regions on the cgb surface whereas the epoxides themselves are electron rich points which have less effect on π π eda interaction the large electron deficient regions on cgbs are more attractive to sas with edg and electron rich ring s e g al in fig 3b very strong π π eda interactions and large qm than sas with only ewg and electron deficient ring s e g bsa in fig 3c strong π π eda interactions and relatively small qm in the case of ssa fig 3d the presence of both edg ewg only creates a net electron deficient ring and thus ssa exhibits strong π π eda interactions in fig 3d not comparable to very strong π π eda interactions as al but the amino functional groups nh2 and so2nh2 can promote hydrogen bonding blue shaded dotted lines and lead to an intermediate qm in fig 3d in the case of heterocyclic sas fig s5e h heteroatoms e g oxygen and nitrogen create highly electron rich spots while the remaining aromatic ring is electron deficient we propose that the highly electron rich spots of the heteroatoms repel the electron rich regions of cgbs and weaken overall the π π eda interactions between the electron deficient sa ring and the electron rich regions of cgbs we indicate that π π eda interactions for heterocyclic compounds are weak in fig s5e h to show that the heterocyclic structure has less favorable π π eda interactions furthermore substituents do not change the charge density of the heterocyclic rings e g similar charge densities of sdz in fig s5f and sde sdx in fig s5g h which explains why sdz no substituents shows a similar qm compared to sde and sdx two och3 substituents in fig 2b overall we find that qm increases as a function of increasing average electron densities of the aromatic ring fig s7 in the monocyclic system fig s7a qm of al average electron density 0 10e pn 0 07e paba 0 06e ba 0 04e ssa 0 02e bsa 0 00e n bz 0 01e in the bicyclic system fig s7b qm of ppe average charge densities of two rings 0 07e apb sa 0 07e 0 01e aps 0 01e 0 02e ds 0 01e 0 01e in addition an inversely proportional relationship is observed between qm and the number of heteroatoms in the ring fig s7b qm of apb sa no heteroatom spy one n heteroatom sdz two n heteroatoms no substitution sde two n heteroatoms two substitutions sdx two n heteroatoms two substitutions we also list the langmuir adsorption affinity constant kl of all studied compounds shown in fig s8 bi cyclic compounds generally display a stronger affinity kl with cgb than mono cyclic compounds also in both mono cyclic and bi cyclic systems those compounds with homocyclic aromatic rings show stronger affinity than those compounds with heterocyclic aromatic rings those compounds with multiple h acceptor donor sites e g mono cyclic paba with cooh nh2 and bi cyclic ppe with two nh2 show higher adsorption affinity than other compounds which may reflect that in addition to the π π eda interaction hydrogen bonding can further strengthen the adsorption affinity and lead to the large kl values lastly we investigated the kinetics of adsorption on cgb using four model sas saa apb sa sdz and smz fig s9a shows the time dependent adsorption curves with estimated pseudo first order constants fig s9b all sas show the adsorption process is rapid and equilibrium is reached within 15 min among the four sas apb sa bi cyclic aromatic rings shows the fastest adsorption process followed by saa mono cyclic aromatic rings then sdz and smz bi cyclic rings one homocyclic and the other heterocyclic these trends suggest that rapid adsorption is favored by homocyclic structures functionalized with multiple edg ewg and that the presence of a heterocyclic ring may suppress the rate of adsorption regardless of the number of aromatic rings and type of substitution 3 3 the effect of ph on sa adsorption and the role of electrostatic interactions solution ph determines the charge of sas and the cgb surface and thus influences their electrostatic interactions khan et al 2017 generally as illustrated in fig 4 sas are positively charged sa at low ph 0 2 neutral sao between ph 2 8 and negatively charged sa at ph 9 meanwhile cgb is neutral slightly positively charged at ph 1 and becomes more and more negatively charged as the ph increases from 2 to 11 fig s10 the partition coefficient kd of three representative sas saa smz apb sa and their pka values are also shown in fig 4 all three sas show similar adsorption patterns the neutral species sao bears the highest kd compared to the two charged forms sa and sa electrostatic interactions between ionized functional groups have been reported as a potential mechanism for adsorption on graphene based nanomaterials gnm khan et al 2017 yet in our study we do not observe that electrostatic interactions are a major adsorption mechanism between sas and cgb at low ph ph 1 2 sas present as sa while cgb is neutral slightly positively charged between ph 2 9 neutral sao is the dominating species of sa and cgb is negatively charged even worse high ph ph 9 promotes deprotonation of the sulfonamide group of sas or other hydrogen containing functional groups such as oh on cgb suppressing hydrogen bonding and promoting electrostatic repulsion in natural water systems ph varies from 6 to 9 sas are predominantly neutral species sao which show maximum adsorption on cgb indicating that cgb can serve as a practical adsorbent for sa removal in realistic water systems 3 4 the effect of cgb oxidation on sa adsorption as a functionalized form of graphene go bears various oxygen functional groups such as cooh oh c o and primarily c o c groups due to the effects of different synthesis methods the degree of oxidation of go can vary over a large range and lead to very different sa adsorption reynosa martínez et al 2020 carvalho et al 2021 hence in our study we consider the degree of oxidation of our adsorbent cgb as a critical parameter influencing sa adsorption we tune the degree of oxidation of cgb by varying durations of thermal treatments and evaluate their subsequent adsorption performance table s3 summarizes the c o ratio calculated from xps spectra of cgbs undergoing different degrees of calcination original cgb 150 c for 2 4 6 and 8 h deoxygenation of cgb occurs sharply in the first 30 min and continues over the entire 8 h of heating the heating procedure results in a c o ratio increase proportionally to increasing c c fraction and decreasing c o c fraction fig 5 shows the maximum adsorption capacities of four sas saa apb sa smz and sdz at different carbon oxygen ratios of cgb fig 5a c c bonding fraction in the carbon content of cgb fig 5b and c o c bonding fraction in the carbon content of cgb fig 5c with detailed adsorption isotherms in fig s11 in fig 5 the qm for each sa decreases as the c o ratio fig 5a and c c fraction of carbon content fig 5b in cgbs increase in contrast a reverse trend is observed relative to the c o c content fig 5c where qm increased as a function of increasing c o c fraction we propose that the presence of c o c on cgbs plays a number of roles 1 c o c creates a hydrophilic surface that allows greater solvation in water 2 c o ccreates electron rich electron deficient regions on cgb aromatic rings and itself serves as a polar substituent promoting π π eda interaction 3 the oxygen atom in c o c serves as the acceptor for hydrogen bonding 3 5 statistical model to estimate sa structure adsorption performance relationship our study has investigated the adsorption behavior of 10 existing sas but there are many more commercially available sas on the market and rapid product development in the pharmaceutical industry will likely bring more sas into the marketplace hence a predictive model would be helpful to provide accurate estimates of sa adsorption based on their physical chemical properties in the absence of experiments previously single parameter or poly parameter linear free energy relationships sp lfer pp lfer have been utilized to estimate the freundlich affinity coefficients of various organic contaminants based on their physical chemical properties or molecular descriptors the adsorption of organic water contaminants on several carbonaceous adsorbents such as wood char plata et al 2015 activated carbon shih et al 2009 carbon nanotube webb et al 2022 su et al 2020 and beta cyclodextrin ching et al 2022 have been estimated by using sp lfer pp lfer approaches but as far as we know no such predictive model of adsorption has been conducted for graphene or graphene oxide we first evaluated how well a single molecular descriptor can predict sa adsorptive behavior on cgb by using two common molecular descriptors the octanol water coefficient log kow an index of a chemical s hydrophobicity and the polar surface area psa both descriptors are widely employed in pharmacological drug design to quantify changes to the cell membrane permeability of a particular chemical structure harris et al 2014 matsson and kihlberg 2017 fig s12a illustrates the relationship between the experimental qm and the log kow to show two positive but weak correlations one for monocyclic rings and another for bicyclic compounds similar correlations between the experimental qm fig s12b and the psa of each compound show slightly improved negative relationships for the two structural chemical groups overall then single parameter models do not adequately and comprehensively describe the adsorption of these two classes of adsorbates therefore we formulated two predictive poly parameter linear regression models for sa adsorption on cgb based on a series of sa and cgb properties in model i we chose ten molecular descriptors including log kow psa molecular weight mw molecule surface area hydrogen bonding donor acceptor aromatic atomic count aromatic bond count atomic number count and total bond count values listed in table s1 of the 23 compounds we studied to predict the absorption capacity qm and compare it to experimental qm fig 6 a b in addition model ii fig 6c and d incorporated one cgb characteristic the c o ratio discussed in section 3 4 the model details are shown in table s4 overall the predicted qm of both models agrees well with measured values for the 23 sa and structural analog chemicals having r2 values of 0 94 model i and 0 80 model ii furthermore we can evaluate the significance of different descriptors via the calculated p values listed in table s4 a p value of 0 05 or lower is generally considered statistically significant and more relevant descriptors show smaller p values berkson 1942 in model i log kow p value 0 00162 aromatic atomic bond counts p value 0 01102 and 0 00438 polar surface area p value 0 04590 mw p value 0 01228 and molecular surface area p value 0 00843 display the significant p values among all the descriptors two highly relevant descriptors aromatic atomic bond counts and log kow indicate the importance of aromatic structure and hydrophobicity in sa adsorption polar surface area is nearly significant which indicates polarity provided by edg ewg is an important property of sas the size of the sa molecules represented by mw and molecular surface area is also important a large molecule with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups ensures more adsorption interactions at the adsorbent surface compared to model i model ii s predictions generally fit the experimental data less well smaller r2 value which might be caused by the insufficient data around the c o ratio since we only have the experiment data for 4 sas smz saa apb sa and sdz on the original and 4 deoxygenated cgbs in addition to the relevant molecular descriptors identified for model i a few other molecular descriptors are found to be important in model ii for instance the h donor of sas p value 0 02608 and the carbon oxygen ratio of cgb p value 2 36e 06 are also critical parameters and are related to hydrogen bonding between functional groups on sas such as nh2 and the c o c on cgbs finally we validated the accuracy of the models by using the four test chemicals sotalol a monocyclic aromatic having a terminal sulfonamide substitution used as heart medication and beta blocker sulfanitran a bicyclic aromatic with sulfonamide linkage used as an antibiotic in the poultry industry sulfasalazine a three ring structure with two homocyclic aromatics linked to a heterocycle with a sulfonamide linkage used as an anti inflammatory drug fomesafen a bicyclic aromatic with trifluoromethyl chlorine and sulfonamide substitutions used as an herbicide their structures are shown in fig 6 their chemical properties are listed in table s1 and their adsorption isotherms are listed in fig s13 among the four test chemicals sotalol sulfanitran and sulfasalazine show good agreement between the predicted and experimental qm sotalol shows a 3 0 deviation model i and 12 6 deviation model ii sulfanitran shows 26 0 deviation model i and 9 0 model ii sulfasalazine shows 5 5 deviation model i and 26 1 deviation model ii both models however overestimate the adsorption behavior of fomesafen with model ii showing greater deviation between predicted and experimental qm than model i which is probably due to insufficient data for the c o ratio in model ii and inaccurate estimation of the hydrogen bonding between fomesafen and cgbs compared to other sa test chemicals fomeafen has several halogens three fluorine and one chlorine present in the structure both cl and cf3 are ewgs and are substituted into the same aromatic ring creating an electron deficient ring the other aromatic ring has a no2 substitution also an ewg creating another electron deficient ring charge density shown in fig s14 in contrast to fomesafen without halogen substitutions log kow 2 20 the presence of halogen substituents enhances the lipophilicity of the structure increasing the log kow to 3 14 table s1 overall considering π π eda interaction is the dominant mechanism we expected that the adsorption behavior of fomeafen would be comparable to those bicyclic sas with electron deficient rings such as ds or n smz and in fact the experimental qm of fomesafen is 0 68 mmol g which is comparable if slightly less however halogens also contribute to the total molecular weight and molecular surface area fomeafen has a molecular weight of 403 76 g mol and an estimated molecular surface area of 500 11 å both values are 75 100 larger than other bi cyclic sas and closer to the tri cyclic sa sulfasalazine fomesafen adsorption on cgb is greatly overestimated by both our models model i predicted a qm of 2 82 mmol g which was more than 4 fold greater than the measured value for fomesafen and model ii predicted qm 5 21 mmol g which is 7 5 times greater than the measured value our models lack the molecular descriptors that accurately estimate the effects of halogen substitutions in an aromatic ring on adsorptive interactions at a cgb surface future work will focus on explaining this behavior 4 conclusions in this study we probe the adsorption behavior of various sas and structural analogs on an engineered 3d graphene based material cgb π π eda interaction serves as the primary adsorption mechanism contributing to sa adsorption and hydrogen bonding is a plus other mechanisms reported previously in fig 1 may contribute marginally or even negligibly to sa adsorption the adsorption of sa compounds increases with the number of homocyclic aromatic rings and edg substitutions have more favorable interactions with the cgb surface owing to the resultant electron rich structure that promotes π π eda interactions sa adsorption is favorable at ph 6 9 due to the neutral sa charge but is suppressed at phs outside this range due to the like charge repulsion of sa and cgb thermal deoxygenation of cgb increases the c o ratio and decreases the c o c content of cgb which significantly reduces the sa adsorption indicating c o ratio is an important characteristic of the adsorbent to consider kinetic experiments reveal that homocyclic sas functionalized with multiple edg ewg show a fast adsorption process finally we formulated two statistical models aimed at predicting the adsorption capacities of sas based on the structure and chemical properties of the adsorbates and adsorbent and we validated the model with four different sas both models predicted the adsorption of three of the four sas well showing good agreement with experimental data the models overestimated the adsorptive behavior of fomesafen due to the presence of chloro and fluoro substitutions in its structure future research will be directed to i further modification of cgb to create a robust and cost efficient gnm based adsorbent for sa removal for instance the utilization of inexpensive and earth abundant metal oxide to create a metal oxide graphene nanocomposite via nano spray drying is an efficient strategy to create more adsorptive surface area while reducing the material cost of the adsorbent fu et al 2023 ii improving the accuracy of the prediction model by investigating how halogens modify π π eda and solvation interactions at the

14641,metallurgical wastewaters are characterized by a low ph 4 high concentrations of sulfate 15 gso4 2 l 1 and metal loid s current treatment requires the consumption of chemicals such as alkali and high levels of waste sludge generation in this study we have shown that combining water electrolysis and sulfate reducing bioreactors enables the in situ generation of base and h2 eliminating the need for base and electron donor addition resulting in the near zero treatment of metallurgical wastewater by extracting cations from the effluent of the system to the bioreactor the bioreactor ph could be maintained by the in situ production of alkali the current for ph control varied between 112 753 mol electrons per m³ wastewater or 5 48 a m 2 electrode area high concentrations of sulfate in the influent and addition of co2 increased the current required to maintain a steady bioreactor ph on the other hand a high sulfate reduction rate and increased influent ph lowered the current required

salinity was lowered from 70 120 ms cm 1 in the influent to 5 20 ms cm 1 in the system effluent the energy consumption of the electrochemical ph control varied between 10 and 100 kwh m 3 and was

scientific icap 6000 2 4 experimental procedure the sulfate reducing bioreactor was continued in operation from ostermeyer et al 2022 with a transition period of 75 days using influent containing 3 gso4 2 l 1 the reactor was operated for 245 days several conditions were maintained to mimic a wide range of conditions relevant for industrial wastewaters and to examine their impact on the process finally the reactor was run for 24 days to deliver a proof of concept using real industrial wastewater during the first period the sulfate concentration in the influent was maintained at 3 gso4 2 l 1 in a second period and third period influent sulfate concentration was increased to 9 and 15 gso4 2 l 1 to evaluate the effect of sulfate on the current demand and current efficiency in the subsequent fourth period ph and cation concentrations of the influent were decreased from 1 65 to 0 92 and from 262 34 mmol l 1 to 21 15 mmol l 1 in the fifth and sixth periods ingoing co2 was lowered from 3 25 to 1 29 and 0 34 ml co2 min 1 during periods vii and viii influent rate was increased from 400 to 576 and 365 ml d 1 in a final period na2so4 was spiked in the middle compartment of the electrochemical cell up to a concentration of 5 gna l 1 resulting in 224 mmol cations l 1 an overview of testing conditions can be seen in table 2 after these nine periods with various operational conditions industrial wastewater was treated in the set up as a proof of concept from days 209 to 279 h2s produced in the middle compartment was degassed and used to precipitate metal loid s from the industrial wastewater after filtering the filtered wastewater was treated in the set up from day 255 to day 279 during this period h2s was again degassed from the middle compartment and used to precipitate metal loid s from raw industrial wastewater closing the loop 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfate removal and sulfide production fig 2 shows the sulfate concentrations in the influent effluent and sulfide concentrations in the effluent of the bioreactor during period i sulfate effluent concentrations were on average 0 2 0 2 gso4 2 l 1 resulting in an average sulfate removal of 3 4 0 2 gso4 2 l 1 and dissolved sulfide concentrations of 0 7 0 3 g ds l 1 once the influent sulfate concentration was increased in period ii sulfate effluent concentrations remained stable at 0 5 0 4 gso4 2 l 1 but sulfate removal increased to 8 0 0 4 gso4 2 l 1 resulting in a reduction rate of 12 8 0 6 gso4 2 l 1 d 1 sulfide concentrations increased to 1 5 0 5 g ds l 1 during period iii the sulfate influent concentration was increased further sulfate reduction was incomplete at 11 1 gso4 2 l 1 or a reduction rate of 18 2 gso4 2 l 1 d 1 on day 95 a power shutdown resulted in temporary failure in sulfate reduction which was re established after 10 days during periods iv v and vi sulfate concentrations in the effluent were stable at 2 3 0 7 gso4 2 l 1 resulting in a removal of 12 5 0 9 gso4 2 l 1 a reduction rate of 20 1 gso4 2 l 1 d 1 and dissolved sulfide concentrations of 2 3 0 4 g ds l 1 when the influent rate was lowered to 356 ml d 1 in periods viii and ix sulfate in the effluent decreased to 0 5 0 5 gso4 2 l 1 and the associated removal and sulfide concentrations increased to 14 3 0 6 gso4 2 l 1 and 3 1 0 5 g ds l 1 the reduction rate remained stable at 20 1 gso4 2 l 1 d 1 3 2 current applied for alkalization is determined by various factors 3 2 1 high influent sulfate concentrations increase the current required for neutralization but can be compensated by increased sulfate reduction period i iii fig 3 shows the current of the cate cell and the cations extracted from the effluent to the bioreactor for the in situ production of alkali during period i an average current of 5 77 mmol electrons h 1 was applied resulting in the average extraction of 3 5 0 9 mmol cations h 1 an average current efficiency of 61 was achieved and 100 of h2 required for sulfate reduction was supplied by the cate cell during this period infrastructure works on day 8 resulted in a temporary increase in co2 addition of 225 ml min 1 as co2 acted as an acid this resulted in an increase in alkali demand temporary increasing the current demand to 140 mmol h 1 when the sulfate concentration was increased to 9 gso4 2 l 1 period ii the current of the cate cell decreased to 1 87 mmol electrons h 1 and 1 7 0 9 mmol cations h 1 were extracted from the bioreactor effluent an improved current efficiency of 91 as a result the cate cell produced only 16 of the h2 required for complete sulfate reduction in period iii influent sulfate concentration was increased to 15 gso4 2 l 1 current increased to 2 8 mmol electrons h 1 while 2 1 mmol cations h 1 were extracted at an average current efficiency of 71 despite the increase in ingoing sulfate concentrations the h2 provided by the cate cell increased to 21 during this period a power failure on day 92 resulted in a temporary current increase up to 11 mmol electrons h 1 these results indicate that the sulfate concentration and sulfate reduction had an effect on the alkali demand and current of the cate cell at a fixed influent ph higher sulfate concentrations in the influent will result in a higher current and alkali demand as the pka of hso4 is 1 99 69 of the sulfate was present as hso4 at a ph of 1 65 chegg 2003 when added to the reactor ph 8 the bisulfate would deprotonate reaction s4 this was however countered by the sulfate reduction reactions s6 s8 during period i 3 4 gso4 2 l 1 or 35 mmol l 1 was reduced and completely reduced while the influent contained 26 mmol hso4 l 1 a net alkalization of 9 mmol oh l 1 during period ii 8 5 gso4 2 l 1 or 89 mmol l 1 was reduced and nearly completely reduced counteracting the acidification of 61 mmolhso4 l 1 in the influent and resulting in a net alkalization of 28 mmol oh l 1 this effect is also exemplified during period iii the ingoing sulfate concentration was increased to ca 15 g gso4 2 l 1 while the effluent contained 4 6 1 3 gso4 2 l 1 as a result the influent contained 112 mmol hso4 l 1 while 111 mmol l 1 sulfate was reduced resulting in a slight acidifying effect and a subsequent increase in current and alkali demand 3 2 2 low influent ph and high co2 addition increase the current and alkali demand period iv vi in period iv the influent ph was lowered from 1 65 to 0 92 and the cation concentration in the influent was lowered from 262 34 to 21 15 mmol l 1 the current and cations extracted increased to 10 mmol electrons h 1 and 7 23 mmol h 1 and as a result the h2 provided by the cate cell increased to 31 to counter the increase in current co2 dosing was lowered from 3 25 to 1 29 ml co2 min 1 average current and alkali demand temporarily dropped to 7 37 mmol electrons h 1 and 1 06 mmol h 1 but afterwards increased again to 16 28 mmol electrons h 1 and 9 04 mmol h 1 due to this increase h2 provided by the cate cell increased further to 48 addition of co2 was lowered again to 0 34 ml co2 min 1 and as a result the current stabilized at 10 17 mmol electrons h 1 while 1 4 mmol of cations h 1 were extracted at a current efficiency of 14 despite lowering the co2 sulfate reduction remained stable at ph 0 92 92 of sulfate in the influent will be present as hso4 compared to 69 at ph 1 65 resulting in a higher alkali or current requirement even at a similar sulfate concentration similarly co2 acts as an acid reaction s5 chegg 2003 it is clear that not only total influent sulfate concentration was a determining factor for the current and alkali demand but also the influent ph and co2 rate determine the alkali or current required to maintain a stable ph 3 2 3 incidental increases in flow rate may result in peaks in current demand period vii viii in period vi the influent rate was increased from 400 ml day 1 to 576 ml day 1 as a result the current increased to 18 06 mmol electrons day 1 while the h2 provided by the cate cell dropped to 19 the increased flow rate resulted in an increased current and alkali demand of the cate cell as more hso4 and h per unit of time needed to be compensated reaction s4 given time sulfate reduction rates may have also increased and resulted in a stabilization of current however as the biological response reaction s7 s8 towards the change in flow rate seemingly lagged behind chemical reaction s4 and current was increasing to levels unsustainable for this lab scale set up the flow rate was lowered to 365 ml day 1 on day 187 period viii during period viii current and cation extraction stabilized at 5 5 mmol electrons h 1 and 1 5 0 4 mmol h 1 these lower values were the result of the decrease in flow rate but were also the result of an increase in sulfate reduction as can be observed in fig 2 3 3 current efficiency matching cation demand and supply cations such as na k nh4 ca2 or mg2 are extracted from the middle compartment to the cathode resulting in the in situ production of alkali in the catholyte bioreactor reaction s10 however when h ions are extracted this results in the generation of h2o at the cathode and the ph remains unchanged the ratio between cations transported and current applied represents the current efficiency of the electrochemical cell reactions s15 from fig 3 and table 3 it can be seen that the average current efficiency varied from lows of 14 period vi to occasional highs of 100 period ii and iv in the cate cell the current applied to satisfy alkali demand and the resulting energy consumption is dependent on the current efficiency for this reason the various factors affecting the current efficiency will be discussed in detail below 3 3 1 high ph values in the middle compartment electrolyte and high buffering capacity of the bioreactor effluent positively affect the current efficiency in the cate cell both alkali cations na k nh4 ca2 or mg2 and h ions were extracted from the middle compartment to the cathode compartment resulting in a competition between them to migrate consequently the concentration of h i e the ph in the middle compartment affects the current efficiency of the system fig 4 shows that periods with low ph were also characterized by high current demand periods iv viii or incidents resulting in high current demand period i due to the incidental high co2 supply during period i current was high and concomitant ph in the middle compartment was low 1 8 0 1 after the system had recovered average ph during period i increased again to an average of 4 5 1 3 a similar effect can be observed during incidental increases in the current of the cate cell at days 92 163 and 186 this indicates that the current of the cate cell and the alkali demand of the system are directly affected by the ph in the middle compartment during periods with high current more cations were extracted from the middle compartment these cations were replaced by h generated at the anode through reaction s9 as cations were extracted and replaced by h the ph in the middle compartment dropped due to the increased h concentration in the middle compartment more h were extracted to the cathode compartment contributing to the lower current efficiencies observed during these periods as a higher current was required to satisfy a similar alkali demand at a lower current efficiency the high current and low current efficiency constituted a negative feedback loop adversely affecting each other through an increase in h concentration in the middle compartment the ph of the middle compartment was not a sole function of the current it is also affected by the buffering capacity of the bioreactor sulfides and carbonates increased the buffer capacity of the liquid through reactions s11 s12 fig 5 shows the co2 supplied to the bioreactor and the buffering capacity of the bioreactor liquid it can be seen that when co2 input was lowered on days 153 and 163 a concomitant drop in buffering capacity occurred as the liquid contained less carbonates it was more prone towards a drop in ph due to h being extracted from the anode compartment 3 3 2 high cation concentrations guarantee high current efficiencies it can be observed in table 3 and fig 4 that during certain periods period i day 15 31 period iii day 97 106 period iv when the ph in middle compartment was low the current efficiency remained relatively high as the proposed system is based on the extraction of cations i e na k nh4 ca2 mg2 from the middle compartment of the cate cell to the bioreactor the cation concentrations the mobility and hydration mantle of the individual ions and ultimately the cation proton ratio in the middle compartment are the factors determining the current efficiency sata et al 2002 stenina et al 2004 fig 6 shows the current of the cate cell and the cation concentration in the influent bioreactor and middle compartment of the cate cell the cation concentration in the bioreactor was at all times higher than the cation concentration in the effluent of the system i e the cation concentration in the middle compartment of the cate cell this shows the core working principle of the system the extraction of cations from the system effluent for in situ generation of alkali in the bioreactor this was also evident by fluctuations in the bioreactor cation concentration which increased during and after peaks in current demand showing that the current and the cate cell were effective in extracting cations from the effluent to the bioreactor during period i an average cation concentration of 66 4 mmol l 1 was maintained in the influent as the sulfate concentration was increased in periods ii and iii while influent ph was kept constant the cation concentrations in the influent increased to 220 17 and 262 34 mmol l 1 during this period the cation concentration in the effluent also steadily increased until equilibrium was reached in general current efficiencies during periods ii and iii were higher than in period i 91 and 71 respectively compared to 61 in period i even though the current of the cate cell during period iii was occasionally high up to levels of 10 mmol electrons h 1 current efficiency remained high periods ii iii and iv were all characterized by relatively high cation concentrations in the middle compartment of the electrochemical cell during period iv cation concentrations in the influent were lowered to 21 15 mmol l 1 however average cation concentrations in the middle compartment remained relatively high at 244 21 mmol l 1 as cations were leaching out and the system was transitioning from a period with high concentrations of cations to a period with low cation concentrations this was contrasted by periods v viii during which cation concentrations in the middle compartment were comparatively low during these periods current efficiencies were low varying between 14 46 the effect of cation concentrations on the current can also be observed in period ix on day 238 60 ml of 250 gna2so4 l 1 was spiked in the middle compartment up to a concentration of 224 mmol cations l 1 increasing the cation concentration almost twentyfold from 12 mmol l 1 the current dropped from a previous 6 mmol h 1 to 3 mmol h 1 as more cations were available for extraction in the middle compartment less current was required to satisfy the alkali demand of the bioreactor from these data it is clear that the cation concentration in the middle compartment was a crucial factor determining the achieved current efficiency the proposed system was also more resilient towards peaks in alkali demand and current when cation concentrations were high as there was a sufficient supply of cations ready to be extracted to the catholyte 3 4 current demand and efficiency an interplay of parameters the proposed system has shown that electrochemical cells can avoid the use of chemicals for the treatment of metallurgical wastewaters it allows for the in situ generation of h2 as electron donor for sulfate reduction alkali for bioreactor ph control and acid for h2s stripping this way the near zero chemical treatment of metallurgical wastewater has been achieved excluding the addition of co2 vitamins and phosphoric acid for biological growth the current and energy consumption are dependent on the influent ph influent sulfate concentration the rate of sulfate reduction achieved and the amount of co2 added they are also dependent on the current efficiency achieved for the extraction of cations from the bioreactor effluent as for a similar alkali demand a higher current will be required at lower current efficiencies the current efficiency is however affected by the current as a high current will result in a more acidic middle compartment the ph of the middle compartment of the electrochemical cell is also affected by the buffering capacity of the bioreactor liquid which is dependent on the sulfide and carbonate concentrations and therefore a function of the sulfate reduction and rate of co2 addition the current efficiency is predominantly affected by the cation proton ratio of the middle compartment as high cation concentrations will result in higher current efficiencies a zero chemical approach allows low conductivities to be achieved table 4 shows the average conductivity of the influent bioreactor liquid and middle compartment of the electrochemical cell similar to the cation concentrations in fig 6 the conductivity in the middle compartment was lower than the conductivity of the bioreactor liquid showing that the proposed technology was capable of lowering the salinity when the ph of the influent was decreased to ph 0 92 the conductivity of the influent increased sharply due to the increase in free h ions during these periods the conductivity of the liquid decreased from high values of 91 120 5 ms cm 1 to values as low as 5 1 ms cm 1 after treatment by the proposed system the ability of the technology to lower the conductivity salinity of the polluted wastewater can be of benefit when the water is intended for discharge into freshwater systems or on onsite reuse crook et al 2012 flemish government 2023 however low conductivities may also imply low cation concentrations which is detrimental for the current efficiency and resiliency of the proposed system 3 5 low conductivities are a challenge for electrified systems instead of consuming alkali such as naoh for ph control in the system energy was consumed to operate the electrochemical cell fig 7 shows the current and energy per volume of treated water consumed by operating the cate cell the energy consumed per volume treated water varies from 13 7 kwh m ³ during period ii to a maximum of 78 11 and 107 27 kwh m ³ during period vi and vii respectively in the fig 7 it can be seen that in general energy used for operating the cate cell was directly proportional to the current during period viii however a higher energy consumption for an equivalent current was required it is noteworthy that during period ix when na2so4 was spiked in the middle compartment of the cate cell power consumption dropped from 74 10 kwh m ³ in period viii to 43 12 and a minimum of 30 kwh m ³ the cations extracted during the experiment can be considered equivalent to the amount of naoh that would have been required for neutralization this varied between 0 08 0 36 mol l 1 see table 3 in best available techniques bat reference document for the production of chlor alkali it is reported that the production of naoh using the chlor alkali process requires 1 885 2 170 kwh ton 1 naoh brinkmann et al 2014 from this it can be concluded that 6 31 kwh m ³ of energy would be required to produce the quantities of naoh required to stabilize the ph of the bioreactor when high current efficiencies were achieved the electrolytic energy consumption of the process described here was similar to that required for production of naoh brinkmann et al 2014 however the in situ production of alkali eliminates transportation and storage associated with the use of naoh during periods iii iv v and vi currents varying from 30 1 000 mol electrons m ³ and corresponded to a voltage of 4 4 0 3 v the cell potential and current density in electrochemical membrane reactors typically exhibit a linear correlation as the voltage for a specific current density is predominantly determined by the electrolyte and membrane resistance díaz nieto et al 2019 fig 8 a shows however that cell potential and current were not linearly correlated r² 0 15 p 0 3 indicating a variable internal resistance of the electrochemical cell in period viii the average voltage was elevated up to 8 2 v with a maximal observed voltage of 9 6 v during this period the conductivity observed in the bioreactor liquid and middle compartment of the electrochemical cell was lower than in other periods see table 4 as can be seen in fig 8b lower conductivities resulted in a higher overall electrical resistance r² 0 81 p 0 05 and a higher voltage and energy consumption the effect of conductivity on cell potential was also observed during period ix when na2so4 was spiked the observed voltages dropped to 5 5 0 5 v 3 6 adding membrane treatment as a way to improve the applicability and efficiency of the system the electrochemical cycling of cations proposed here will be more efficient when dealing with streams containing significant concentrations of cations it is impossible to use this technology to treat streams lacking alkaline cations i e na k ca2 mg2 nh4 the current efficiency of the process can be increased or treatment of streams lacking cations can be achieved when cations are added to the process this could be achieved by using nahco3 as carbon source for the process or adding saline streams produced elsewhere in the plant these brines might also be obtained by adding a membrane treatment step e g reverse osmosis after the proposed treatment the brine can be recycled to the middle compartment of the electrochemical cell as a modest concentrate from the downstream reverse osmosis to minimize energy needs there trishitman et al 2019 given that the high cation concentrations and conductivities can lower the energy consumption from 80 110 kwh m ³ to 10 30 kwh m ³ the additional energy consumption of the membrane treatment estimated at 7 kwh m ³ may be compensated kim et al 2019 in any case this trade off warrants additional research bensadok et al 2008 such a membrane treatment would effectively increase the cation retention of the system while the permeate may be suitable for onsite reuse increased cation concentrations in the middle electrochemical cell compartment will also result in a more resilient system as periodic increases in current demand will not result in complete depletion of cations in the middle compartment high current efficiencies will be maintained and consequently the bioreactor ph will remain stable and the energy consumption will be minimized 3 7 first instance of electrified zero chemical treatment of industrial metallurgical wastewater industrial wastewater sampled from a metallurgical plant was treated to validate the envisioned technology prior to addition to the bioreactor the wastewater was sparged using h2s extracted from the acidified middle compartment of the electrochemical cell this sparging resulted in significant removal of as pb cd cu te and tl ostermeyer et al 2020 after sparging and filtering the wastewater was processed in the bioreactor and electrochemical cell with a similar flow rate and co2 input as during periods viii ix during the treatment sulfate was removed from 6 241 mg so4 2 l 1 to 65 21 mg so4 2 l 1 while the conductivity was lowered from 74 ms cm 1 to 14 1 ms cm 1 on average a current of 4 4 mmol h 1 at a current efficiency of 26 was required to maintain a stable ph of 8 in the bioreactor this was associated with an average energy consumption of 39 7 kwh m 3 in the bioreactor the majority of fe al zn ni and te was removed while pb and se showed some additional minor removal in the bioreactor most metal loid s were removed down to their lowest concentration with the exception of se which was removed from 0 6 0 4 to 0 09 0 2 mg l 1 in the middle compartment some metals showed some slight resolubilization in the middle compartment this was likely due to the ph dependent solubility of some metal sulfides such as zns nis and fes lewis 2010 huisman et al 2006 al showed significant resolubilization which most likely can be explained by the ph dependent solubility behavior of al oh 3 bensadok et al 2008 such a resolubilization can be avoided by implementing a solid removal step after the bioreactor trishitman et al 2019 kim et al 2019 4 conclusion the system proposed here has shown that combining electrochemical cells and bioreactors can be effective in treating polluted metallurgical wastewaters in a using a minimum of chemicals high sulfate concentrations in the influent and addition of co2 increased the current used in the system while high influent ph sulfate reduction rate and current efficiencies lowered the current the current efficiency of the system was determined by the competition between h ions and alkali cations na k nh4 ca2 mg2 for extraction consequently the current and buffering capacity i e sulfide and carbonate concentrations of the bioreactor affect the h concentration which in turn affects the current efficiency while the proposed technology is able to lower the conductivity of the treated water low cation concentrations and low conductivity negatively affect the resiliency and energy consumption of the system at high cation concentrations and conductivity the energy consumption was in the range of 10 kwh m 3 while low cation concentrations and conductivities increased the energy consumption tenfold future research should therefore look into combining these technologies with membrane based treatments with the aim of maintaining a high salinity in the electrochemical cell and low salinity in the effluent when the electricity is produced using renewable technologies this technology also enables the treatment of metallurgical wastewater without the emission of

14641,metallurgical wastewaters are characterized by a low ph 4 high concentrations of sulfate 15 gso4 2 l 1 and metal loid s current treatment requires the consumption of chemicals such as alkali and high levels of waste sludge generation in this study we have shown that combining water electrolysis and sulfate reducing bioreactors enables the in situ generation of base and h2 eliminating the need for base and electron donor addition resulting in the near zero treatment of metallurgical wastewater by extracting cations from the effluent of the system to the bioreactor the bioreactor ph could be maintained by the in situ production of alkali the current for ph control varied between 112 753 mol electrons per m³ wastewater or 5 48 a m 2 electrode area high concentrations of sulfate in the influent and addition of co2 increased the current required to maintain a steady bioreactor ph on the other hand a high sulfate reduction rate and increased influent ph lowered the current required for ph control moreover the current efficiency varied from 14 to 91 and increased with higher ph and cation na nh4 k mg2 ca2 concentrations in the middle compartment of the electrochemical cell the salinity was lowered from 70 120 ms cm 1 in the influent to 5 20 ms cm 1 in the system effluent the energy consumption of the electrochemical ph control varied between 10 and 100 kwh m 3 and was affected by the conductivity of the wastewater industrial wastewater was treated successfully with an average energy consumption of 39 7 kwh m 3 removing sulfate from 15 g so4 2 l 1 to 0 5 0 5 g so4 2

al 1998 bv 2017 foucher et al 2001 stucki et al 1993 furthermore the use of chemicals also increases the conductivity of the wastewater creating more saline wastewater the addition of acids bases and electron donors such as h2 make up for the bulk of the operational costs of sulfate reducing bioreactors van houten 2006 kaksonen and puhakka 2007 the resulting increase in salinity also represents a

titanium based electrode ir mmo magneto special anodes was used as an anode a power source tdk lambda z 20 30 was used to power the cate cell and controlled by labview bioreactor liquid was recirculated over the cathode compartment of the cate cell at a rate of 280 ml h 1 the ph of the bioreactor was adjusted by the cate cell in galvanostatic mode when bioreactor ph dropped below ph 7 85 the power source was turned on and operated under constant current once bioreactor ph had reached 8 15 the power source was turned off the bioreactor effluent was collected in a 0 8 l multi neck

scientific icap 6000 2 4 experimental procedure the sulfate reducing bioreactor was continued in operation from ostermeyer et al 2022 with a transition period of 75 days using influent containing 3 gso4 2 l 1 the reactor was operated for 245 days several conditions were maintained to mimic a wide range of conditions relevant for industrial wastewaters and to examine their impact on the process finally the reactor was run for 24 days to deliver a proof of concept using real industrial wastewater during the first period the sulfate concentration in the influent was maintained at 3 gso4 2 l 1 in a second period and third period influent sulfate concentration was increased to 9 and 15 gso4 2 l 1 to evaluate the effect of sulfate on the current demand and current efficiency in the subsequent fourth period ph and cation concentrations of the influent were decreased from 1 65 to 0 92 and from 262 34 mmol l 1 to 21 15 mmol l 1 in the fifth and sixth periods ingoing co2 was lowered from 3 25 to 1 29 and 0 34 ml co2 min 1 during periods vii and viii influent rate was increased from 400 to 576 and 365 ml d 1 in a final period na2so4 was spiked in the middle compartment of the electrochemical cell up to a concentration of 5 gna l 1 resulting in 224 mmol cations l 1 an overview of testing conditions can be seen in table 2 after these nine periods with various operational conditions industrial wastewater was treated in the set up as a proof of concept from days 209 to 279 h2s produced in the middle compartment was degassed and used to precipitate metal loid s from the industrial wastewater after filtering the filtered wastewater was treated in the set up from day 255 to day 279 during this period h2s was again degassed from the middle compartment and used to precipitate metal loid s from raw industrial wastewater closing the loop 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfate removal and sulfide production fig 2 shows the sulfate concentrations in the influent effluent and sulfide concentrations in the effluent of the bioreactor during period i sulfate effluent concentrations were on average 0 2 0 2 gso4 2 l 1 resulting in an average sulfate removal of 3 4 0 2 gso4 2 l 1 and dissolved sulfide concentrations of 0 7 0 3 g ds l 1 once the influent sulfate concentration was increased in period ii sulfate effluent concentrations remained stable at 0 5 0 4 gso4 2 l 1 but sulfate removal increased to 8 0 0 4 gso4 2 l 1 resulting in a reduction rate of 12 8 0 6 gso4 2 l 1 d 1 sulfide concentrations increased to 1 5 0 5 g ds l 1 during period iii the sulfate influent concentration was increased further sulfate reduction was incomplete at 11 1 gso4 2 l 1 or a reduction rate of 18 2 gso4 2 l 1 d 1 on day 95 a power shutdown resulted in temporary failure in sulfate reduction which was re established after 10 days during periods iv v and vi sulfate concentrations in the effluent were stable at 2 3 0 7 gso4 2 l 1 resulting in a removal of 12 5 0 9 gso4 2 l 1 a reduction rate of 20 1 gso4 2 l 1 d 1 and dissolved sulfide concentrations of 2 3 0 4 g ds l 1 when the influent rate was lowered to 356 ml d 1 in periods viii and ix sulfate in the effluent decreased to 0 5 0 5 gso4 2 l 1 and the associated removal and sulfide concentrations increased to 14 3 0 6 gso4 2 l 1 and 3 1 0 5 g ds l 1 the reduction rate remained stable at 20 1 gso4 2 l 1 d 1 3 2 current applied for alkalization is determined by various factors 3 2 1 high influent sulfate concentrations increase the current required for neutralization but can be compensated by increased sulfate reduction period i iii fig 3 shows the current of the cate cell and the cations extracted from the effluent to the bioreactor for the in situ production of alkali during period i an average current of 5 77 mmol electrons h 1 was applied resulting in the average extraction of 3 5 0 9 mmol cations h 1 an average current efficiency of 61 was achieved and 100 of h2 required for sulfate reduction was supplied by the cate cell during this period infrastructure works on day 8 resulted in a temporary increase in co2 addition of 225 ml min 1 as co2 acted as an acid this resulted in an increase in alkali demand temporary increasing the current demand to 140 mmol h 1 when the sulfate concentration was increased to 9 gso4 2 l 1 period ii the current of the cate cell decreased to 1 87 mmol electrons h 1 and 1 7 0 9 mmol cations h 1 were extracted from the bioreactor effluent an improved current efficiency of 91 as a result the cate cell produced only 16 of the h2 required for complete sulfate reduction in period iii influent sulfate concentration was increased to 15 gso4 2 l 1 current increased to 2 8 mmol electrons h 1 while 2 1 mmol cations h 1 were extracted at an average current efficiency of 71 despite the increase in ingoing sulfate concentrations the h2 provided by the cate cell increased to 21 during this period a power failure on day 92 resulted in a temporary current increase up to 11 mmol electrons h 1 these results indicate that the sulfate concentration and sulfate reduction had an effect on the alkali demand and current of the cate cell at a fixed influent ph higher sulfate concentrations in the influent will result in a higher current and alkali demand as the pka of hso4 is 1 99 69 of the sulfate was present as hso4 at a ph of 1 65 chegg 2003 when added to the reactor ph 8 the bisulfate would deprotonate reaction s4 this was however countered by the sulfate reduction reactions s6 s8 during period i 3 4 gso4 2 l 1 or 35 mmol l 1 was reduced and completely reduced while the influent contained 26 mmol hso4 l 1 a net alkalization of 9 mmol oh l 1 during period ii 8 5 gso4 2 l 1 or 89 mmol l 1 was reduced and nearly completely reduced counteracting the acidification of 61 mmolhso4 l 1 in the influent and resulting in a net alkalization of 28 mmol oh l 1 this effect is also exemplified during period iii the ingoing sulfate concentration was increased to ca 15 g gso4 2 l 1 while the effluent contained 4 6 1 3 gso4 2 l 1 as a result the influent contained 112 mmol hso4 l 1 while 111 mmol l 1 sulfate was reduced resulting in a slight acidifying effect and a subsequent increase in current and alkali demand 3 2 2 low influent ph and high co2 addition increase the current and alkali demand period iv vi in period iv the influent ph was lowered from 1 65 to 0 92 and the cation concentration in the influent was lowered from 262 34 to 21 15 mmol l 1 the current and cations extracted increased to 10 mmol electrons h 1 and 7 23 mmol h 1 and as a result the h2 provided by the cate cell increased to 31 to counter the increase in current co2 dosing was lowered from 3 25 to 1 29 ml co2 min 1 average current and alkali demand temporarily dropped to 7 37 mmol electrons h 1 and 1 06 mmol h 1 but afterwards increased again to 16 28 mmol electrons h 1 and 9 04 mmol h 1 due to this increase h2 provided by the cate cell increased further to 48 addition of co2 was lowered again to 0 34 ml co2 min 1 and as a result the current stabilized at 10 17 mmol electrons h 1 while 1 4 mmol of cations h 1 were extracted at a current efficiency of 14 despite lowering the co2 sulfate reduction remained stable at ph 0 92 92 of sulfate in the influent will be present as hso4 compared to 69 at ph 1 65 resulting in a higher alkali or current requirement even at a similar sulfate concentration similarly co2 acts as an acid reaction s5 chegg 2003 it is clear that not only total influent sulfate concentration was a determining factor for the current and alkali demand but also the influent ph and co2 rate determine the alkali or current required to maintain a stable ph 3 2 3 incidental increases in flow rate may result in peaks in current demand period vii viii in period vi the influent rate was increased from 400 ml day 1 to 576 ml day 1 as a result the current increased to 18 06 mmol electrons day 1 while the h2 provided by the cate cell dropped to 19 the increased flow rate resulted in an increased current and alkali demand of the cate cell as more hso4 and h per unit of time needed to be compensated reaction s4 given time sulfate reduction rates may have also increased and resulted in a stabilization of current however as the biological response reaction s7 s8 towards the change in flow rate seemingly lagged behind chemical reaction s4 and current was increasing to levels unsustainable for this lab scale set up the flow rate was lowered to 365 ml day 1 on day 187 period viii during period viii current and cation extraction stabilized at 5 5 mmol electrons h 1 and 1 5 0 4 mmol h 1 these lower values were the result of the decrease in flow rate but were also the result of an increase in sulfate reduction as can be observed in fig 2 3 3 current efficiency matching cation demand and supply cations such as na k nh4 ca2 or mg2 are extracted from the middle compartment to the cathode resulting in the in situ production of alkali in the catholyte bioreactor reaction s10 however when h ions are extracted this results in the generation of h2o at the cathode and the ph remains unchanged the ratio between cations transported and current applied represents the current efficiency of the electrochemical cell reactions s15 from fig 3 and table 3 it can be seen that the average current efficiency varied from lows of 14 period vi to occasional highs of 100 period ii and iv in the cate cell the current applied to satisfy alkali demand and the resulting energy consumption is dependent on the current efficiency for this reason the various factors affecting the current efficiency will be discussed in detail below 3 3 1 high ph values in the middle compartment electrolyte and high buffering capacity of the bioreactor effluent positively affect the current efficiency in the cate cell both alkali cations na k nh4 ca2 or mg2 and h ions were extracted from the middle compartment to the cathode compartment resulting in a competition between them to migrate consequently the concentration of h i e the ph in the middle compartment affects the current efficiency of the system fig 4 shows that periods with low ph were also characterized by high current demand periods iv viii or incidents resulting in high current demand period i due to the incidental high co2 supply during period i current was high and concomitant ph in the middle compartment was low 1 8 0 1 after the system had recovered average ph during period i increased again to an average of 4 5 1 3 a similar effect can be observed during incidental increases in the current of the cate cell at days 92 163 and 186 this indicates that the current of the cate cell and the alkali demand of the system are directly affected by the ph in the middle compartment during periods with high current more cations were extracted from the middle compartment these cations were replaced by h generated at the anode through reaction s9 as cations were extracted and replaced by h the ph in the middle compartment dropped due to the increased h concentration in the middle compartment more h were extracted to the cathode compartment contributing to the lower current efficiencies observed during these periods as a higher current was required to satisfy a similar alkali demand at a lower current efficiency the high current and low current efficiency constituted a negative feedback loop adversely affecting each other through an increase in h concentration in the middle compartment the ph of the middle compartment was not a sole function of the current it is also affected by the buffering capacity of the bioreactor sulfides and carbonates increased the buffer capacity of the liquid through reactions s11 s12 fig 5 shows the co2 supplied to the bioreactor and the buffering capacity of the bioreactor liquid it can be seen that when co2 input was lowered on days 153 and 163 a concomitant drop in buffering capacity occurred as the liquid contained less carbonates it was more prone towards a drop in ph due to h being extracted from the anode compartment 3 3 2 high cation concentrations guarantee high current efficiencies it can be observed in table 3 and fig 4 that during certain periods period i day 15 31 period iii day 97 106 period iv when the ph in middle compartment was low the current efficiency remained relatively high as the proposed system is based on the extraction of cations i e na k nh4 ca2 mg2 from the middle compartment of the cate cell to the bioreactor the cation concentrations the mobility and hydration mantle of the individual ions and ultimately the cation proton ratio in the middle compartment are the factors determining the current efficiency sata et al 2002 stenina et al 2004 fig 6 shows the current of the cate cell and the cation concentration in the influent bioreactor and middle compartment of the cate cell the cation concentration in the bioreactor was at all times higher than the cation concentration in the effluent of the system i e the cation concentration in the middle compartment of the cate cell this shows the core working principle of the system the extraction of cations from the system effluent for in situ generation of alkali in the bioreactor this was also evident by fluctuations in the bioreactor cation concentration which increased during and after peaks in current demand showing that the current and the cate cell were effective in extracting cations from the effluent to the bioreactor during period i an average cation concentration of 66 4 mmol l 1 was maintained in the influent as the sulfate concentration was increased in periods ii and iii while influent ph was kept constant the cation concentrations in the influent increased to 220 17 and 262 34 mmol l 1 during this period the cation concentration in the effluent also steadily increased until equilibrium was reached in general current efficiencies during periods ii and iii were higher than in period i 91 and 71 respectively compared to 61 in period i even though the current of the cate cell during period iii was occasionally high up to levels of 10 mmol electrons h 1 current efficiency remained high periods ii iii and iv were all characterized by relatively high cation concentrations in the middle compartment of the electrochemical cell during period iv cation concentrations in the influent were lowered to 21 15 mmol l 1 however average cation concentrations in the middle compartment remained relatively high at 244 21 mmol l 1 as cations were leaching out and the system was transitioning from a period with high concentrations of cations to a period with low cation concentrations this was contrasted by periods v viii during which cation concentrations in the middle compartment were comparatively low during these periods current efficiencies were low varying between 14 46 the effect of cation concentrations on the current can also be observed in period ix on day 238 60 ml of 250 gna2so4 l 1 was spiked in the middle compartment up to a concentration of 224 mmol cations l 1 increasing the cation concentration almost twentyfold from 12 mmol l 1 the current dropped from a previous 6 mmol h 1 to 3 mmol h 1 as more cations were available for extraction in the middle compartment less current was required to satisfy the alkali demand of the bioreactor from these data it is clear that the cation concentration in the middle compartment was a crucial factor determining the achieved current efficiency the proposed system was also more resilient towards peaks in alkali demand and current when cation concentrations were high as there was a sufficient supply of cations ready to be extracted to the catholyte 3 4 current demand and efficiency an interplay of parameters the proposed system has shown that electrochemical cells can avoid the use of chemicals for the treatment of metallurgical wastewaters it allows for the in situ generation of h2 as electron donor for sulfate reduction alkali for bioreactor ph control and acid for h2s stripping this way the near zero chemical treatment of metallurgical wastewater has been achieved excluding the addition of co2 vitamins and phosphoric acid for biological growth the current and energy consumption are dependent on the influent ph influent sulfate concentration the rate of sulfate reduction achieved and the amount of co2 added they are also dependent on the current efficiency achieved for the extraction of cations from the bioreactor effluent as for a similar alkali demand a higher current will be required at lower current efficiencies the current efficiency is however affected by the current as a high current will result in a more acidic middle compartment the ph of the middle compartment of the electrochemical cell is also affected by the buffering capacity of the bioreactor liquid which is dependent on the sulfide and carbonate concentrations and therefore a function of the sulfate reduction and rate of co2 addition the current efficiency is predominantly affected by the cation proton ratio of the middle compartment as high cation concentrations will result in higher current efficiencies a zero chemical approach allows low conductivities to be achieved table 4 shows the average conductivity of the influent bioreactor liquid and middle compartment of the electrochemical cell similar to the cation concentrations in fig 6 the conductivity in the middle compartment was lower than the conductivity of the bioreactor liquid showing that the proposed technology was capable of lowering the salinity when the ph of the influent was decreased to ph 0 92 the conductivity of the influent increased sharply due to the increase in free h ions during these periods the conductivity of the liquid decreased from high values of 91 120 5 ms cm 1 to values as low as 5 1 ms cm 1 after treatment by the proposed system the ability of the technology to lower the conductivity salinity of the polluted wastewater can be of benefit when the water is intended for discharge into freshwater systems or on onsite reuse crook et al 2012 flemish government 2023 however low conductivities may also imply low cation concentrations which is detrimental for the current efficiency and resiliency of the proposed system 3 5 low conductivities are a challenge for electrified systems instead of consuming alkali such as naoh for ph control in the system energy was consumed to operate the electrochemical cell fig 7 shows the current and energy per volume of treated water consumed by operating the cate cell the energy consumed per volume treated water varies from 13 7 kwh m ³ during period ii to a maximum of 78 11 and 107 27 kwh m ³ during period vi and vii respectively in the fig 7 it can be seen that in general energy used for operating the cate cell was directly proportional to the current during period viii however a higher energy consumption for an equivalent current was required it is noteworthy that during period ix when na2so4 was spiked in the middle compartment of the cate cell power consumption dropped from 74 10 kwh m ³ in period viii to 43 12 and a minimum of 30 kwh m ³ the cations extracted during the experiment can be considered equivalent to the amount of naoh that would have been required for neutralization this varied between 0 08 0 36 mol l 1 see table 3 in best available techniques bat reference document for the production of chlor alkali it is reported that the production of naoh using the chlor alkali process requires 1 885 2 170 kwh ton 1 naoh brinkmann et al 2014 from this it can be concluded that 6 31 kwh m ³ of energy would be required to produce the quantities of naoh required to stabilize the ph of the bioreactor when high current efficiencies were achieved the electrolytic energy consumption of the process described here was similar to that required for production of naoh brinkmann et al 2014 however the in situ production of alkali eliminates transportation and storage associated with the use of naoh during periods iii iv v and vi currents varying from 30 1 000 mol electrons m ³ and corresponded to a voltage of 4 4 0 3 v the cell potential and current density in electrochemical membrane reactors typically exhibit a linear correlation as the voltage for a specific current density is predominantly determined by the electrolyte and membrane resistance díaz nieto et al 2019 fig 8 a shows however that cell potential and current were not linearly correlated r² 0 15 p 0 3 indicating a variable internal resistance of the electrochemical cell in period viii the average voltage was elevated up to 8 2 v with a maximal observed voltage of 9 6 v during this period the conductivity observed in the bioreactor liquid and middle compartment of the electrochemical cell was lower than in other periods see table 4 as can be seen in fig 8b lower conductivities resulted in a higher overall electrical resistance r² 0 81 p 0 05 and a higher voltage and energy consumption the effect of conductivity on cell potential was also observed during period ix when na2so4 was spiked the observed voltages dropped to 5 5 0 5 v 3 6 adding membrane treatment as a way to improve the applicability and efficiency of the system the electrochemical cycling of cations proposed here will be more efficient when dealing with streams containing significant concentrations of cations it is impossible to use this technology to treat streams lacking alkaline cations i e na k ca2 mg2 nh4 the current efficiency of the process can be increased or treatment of streams lacking cations can be achieved when cations are added to the process this could be achieved by using nahco3 as carbon source for the process or adding saline streams produced elsewhere in the plant these brines might also be obtained by adding a membrane treatment step e g reverse osmosis after the proposed treatment the brine can be recycled to the middle compartment of the electrochemical cell as a modest concentrate from the downstream reverse osmosis to minimize energy needs there trishitman et al 2019 given that the high cation concentrations and conductivities can lower the energy consumption from 80 110 kwh m ³ to 10 30 kwh m ³ the additional energy consumption of the membrane treatment estimated at 7 kwh m ³ may be compensated kim et al 2019 in any case this trade off warrants additional research bensadok et al 2008 such a membrane treatment would effectively increase the cation retention of the system while the permeate may be suitable for onsite reuse increased cation concentrations in the middle electrochemical cell compartment will also result in a more resilient system as periodic increases in current demand will not result in complete depletion of cations in the middle compartment high current efficiencies will be maintained and consequently the bioreactor ph will remain stable and the energy consumption will be minimized 3 7 first instance of electrified zero chemical treatment of industrial metallurgical wastewater industrial wastewater sampled from a metallurgical plant was treated to validate the envisioned technology prior to addition to the bioreactor the wastewater was sparged using h2s extracted from the acidified middle compartment of the electrochemical cell this sparging resulted in significant removal of as pb cd cu te and tl ostermeyer et al 2020 after sparging and filtering the wastewater was processed in the bioreactor and electrochemical cell with a similar flow rate and co2 input as during periods viii ix during the treatment sulfate was removed from 6 241 mg so4 2 l 1 to 65 21 mg so4 2 l 1 while the conductivity was lowered from 74 ms cm 1 to 14 1 ms cm 1 on average a current of 4 4 mmol h 1 at a current efficiency of 26 was required to maintain a stable ph of 8 in the bioreactor this was associated with an average energy consumption of 39 7 kwh m 3 in the bioreactor the majority of fe al zn ni and te was removed while pb and se showed some additional minor removal in the bioreactor most metal loid s were removed down to their lowest concentration with the exception of se which was removed from 0 6 0 4 to 0 09 0 2 mg l 1 in the middle compartment some metals showed some slight resolubilization in the middle compartment this was likely due to the ph dependent solubility of some metal sulfides such as zns nis and fes lewis 2010 huisman et al 2006 al showed significant resolubilization which most likely can be explained by the ph dependent solubility behavior of al oh 3 bensadok et al 2008 such a resolubilization can be avoided by implementing a solid removal step after the bioreactor trishitman et al 2019 kim et al 2019 4 conclusion the system proposed here has shown that combining electrochemical cells and bioreactors can be effective in treating polluted metallurgical wastewaters in a using a minimum of chemicals high sulfate concentrations in the influent and addition of co2 increased the current used in the system while high influent ph sulfate reduction rate and current efficiencies lowered the current the current efficiency of the system was determined by the competition between h ions and alkali cations na k nh4 ca2 mg2 for extraction consequently the current and buffering capacity i e sulfide and carbonate concentrations of the bioreactor affect the h concentration which in turn affects the current efficiency while the proposed technology is able to lower the conductivity of the treated water low cation concentrations and low conductivity negatively affect the resiliency and energy consumption of the system at high cation concentrations and conductivity the energy consumption was in the range of 10 kwh m 3 while low cation concentrations and conductivities increased the energy consumption tenfold future research should therefore look into combining these technologies with membrane based treatments with the aim of maintaining a high salinity in the electrochemical cell and low salinity in the effluent when the electricity is produced using renewable technologies this technology also enables the treatment of metallurgical wastewater without the emission of

14642,denitrifying woodchip bioreactors wbrs are a nature based technology that are increasingly used to control nonpoint source nitrate no3 pollution in agricultural catchments the treatment effectiveness of wbrs depends on temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt both of which are affected by climate change warmer temperatures will increase microbial denitrification rates but the extent to which the resulting benefits to treatment performance may be offset by intensified precipitation and shorter hrts is not clear here we use three years of monitoring data from a wbr in central new york state to train an integrated hydrologic biokinetic model describing links among temperature precipitation bioreactor discharge denitrification kinetics and no3 removal efficiencies effects of climate warming are assessed by first training a stochastic weather generator with eleven years of weather data from our field site and then adjusting the distribution of precipitation intensities according to the clausius clapeyron relationship between water vapor and temperature modeling results indicate in our system faster denitrification rates will outweigh the influence of intensified precipitation and discharge under warming leading to net improvements in no3 load reductions median cumulative no3 load reductions at our study site from may october are projected to increase from 21 7 interquartile range 17 4 26 1 under baseline hydro climate to 41 0 interquartile range 32 6 47 1 with a 4 c change in mean air temperature this improved performance under climate warming is driven by strong nonlinear dependence of no3 removal rates on temperature temperature sensitivity may increase with woodchip age and lead to stronger temperature response in systems like this one with a highly aged woodchip matrix while the impacts of hydro climatic change on wbr performance will depend on site specific properties this hydrologic biokinetic modeling approach provides

of soil organic matter and other nonpoint sources are major global drivers of eutrophication ghane et al 2016 schlesinger 2009 schulte uebbing et al 2022 and there is a great need for cost effective decentralized technologies to improve treatment of reactive n before it is released into aquatic environments the prevalence of engineered under field tile drainage systems in agricultural states of the upper mississippi basin in the u s valayamkunnath et al 2020 provides an opportunity for passive treatment systems to intercept n rich drainage waters before they are released to streams tile drainage from croplands is rich in nitrate no3 with relatively low concentrations of ammonium and a low carbon c n ratio so biological treatment efforts typically focus on sustainable methods to supply bioavailable organic c to denitrifying microorganisms woodchip bioreactors wbrs are nature based technologies that are increasingly employed for the cost effective removal of no3 from agricultural runoff and drainage christianson and schipper 2016 easton et al 2019 pluer et al 2016 schipper et al 2010a 2010b wbrs are trenches that are filled with woodchips which serve as a slow release source of bioavailable c and a biofilm support structure while the expected lifetime of wbrs is 10 years it is common for denitrification rates to become carbon limited due to the recalcitrance of c in lignocellulosic woody biomass abusallout and hua 2017 christianson et al 2020 mcguire et al 2021 schaefer et al 2021 warneke et al 2011 nitrate removal rates in woodchip bioreactors are governed by factors including woodchip age and the bioavailability of woodchip derived organic carbon mcguire et al 2021 robertson 2010 warneke et al 2011 water temperatures which regulate microbial kinetics david et al 2016 halaburka et al 2019 and hydraulic retention times hrts hoover et al 2016 pluer et al 2016 of water in bioreactors no3 dynamics in wbrs have been effectively described using parsimonious zero order biokinetic models if no3 concentrations are 2 mg no3 n l a condition which is usually met in wbrs grießmeier et al 2021 halaburka et al 2017 the resulting model for effluent no3 concentrations is halaburka et al 2017 2019 1 n e f f l u e n t n i n f l u e n t k 0 t h r t where neffluent and ninfluent are effluent and influent no3 n

conditions associated with global climate change fan et al 2022 o neill et al 2016 prein et al 2017 the temperature dependence of denitrification rates is described using the exponential arrhenius equation dawson and murphy 1972 halaburka et al 2019 so small increases in temperature can lead to large increases in biokinetic constants and consequently faster microbial removal of no3 at the same time climate change is widely expected to intensify precipitation trenberth 2011 which can lead to a larger fraction of no3 loads moving through reactors during high flow short hrt events royer et al 2006 when treatment efficiencies are poor the net effects of anticipated hydro climatic change on wbr performance are therefore subject to nonlinear interactions between bioreactor flows and microbial reaction rates and are difficult to predict the significance of abiotic variables like temperature and hrt on wbr no3 removal efficiencies have been explored through structural equation modeling fan et al 2022 but there is a lack of process based modeling exploring effects of hydro climatic change on wbr performance the objective of this study is to describe the joint impacts of warmer temperatures and intensified precipitation discharge on denitrification performance of woodchip bioreactors using predictive models while biokinetic models parameterized with field data have been described previously ghane et al 2015 grießmeier et al 2021 these models have not been used to explore the sensitivity of denitrification performance to hydro climatic variability expected with climate warming here models for bioreactor discharge and biokinetics were calibrated based on precipitation temperature and no3 monitoring data from a wbr on a research farm in central new york state united states synthetic precipitation time series with climate perturbations were then produced using a stochastic weather generator and used to force the bioreactor discharge and biokinetic models this approach was used to disentangle impacts of changing temperature precipitation intensity and mean annual precipitation on no3 load reductions in wbr systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site nitrate removal dynamics were monitored in a wbr at the homer c thompson vegetable farm in freeville new york ny from 2019 2021 paired woodchip bioreactors were constructed in 2012 to treat tile drainage collected from 8 ha of cropland each reactor has a 6 1 3 1 m footprint with a thickness of 0 69 m and was buried under 0 36 m of soil the bioreactors were filled with primarily ash genus fraxnius woodchips hassanpour et al 2017 and wrapped in an impermeable polyethylene sheet in 2018 six wells for collecting pore water samples were installed along the centerline of one of the bioreactors at a depth of 35 cm below the surface of the woodchip matrix for measurement of pore water no3 profiles an additional six wells were installed 50 cm from the inlet manifold perpendicular to the direction of flow in 2022 solinst levelogger pressure transducers were installed in the inlet and outlet control structures to monitor water levels and water temperatures data were logged every 10 min the outlet of the reactor is fitted with a v notch weir which allows water level to be converted to reactor discharge q pluer 2015 in june 2021 woodchips were excavated from the inlet and outlet ends of the bioreactor for c n ratio measurements performed at the cornell stable isotope laboratory with a carlo erba nc2500 elemental analyzer additional details on these bioreactors are available in prior publications on this study site hassanpour et al 2017 pluer et al 2016 2019 and information on the wbr rating curve used to determine q are available in si the hydrodynamics of water flow through wbrs is complex and there is debate over appropriate measures of the porosity of the woodchip matrix to determine accurate hrts cameron and schipper 2012 halaburka et al 2017 jaynes et al 2016 a bromide br tracer test was therefore performed in may 2022 to determine the effective porosity ρ to use in hrt calculations 1 l of a 2 m sodium bromide nabr solution was injected into the set of six wells at the upstream end of the wbr samples were collected from the outlet hourly for two days using an isco 3700 automated water sampler and then every four hours for the next two days the tracer residence time actual residence time ta was calculated using ghane et al 2015 2 t a t i c i δ t i c i δ t i where ti is the time at the ith sample ci is the outlet br concentration in the ith sample and δt is the time interval between sampling the theoretical residence time tth was calculated as 3 t t h w h l ε q where w h and l are the saturated bioreactor width depth and length respectively and ε is the drainable porosity the drainable porosity and specific retention the volume of water held within woodchips also referred to as secondary porosity robertson 2010 of the

perturbations to wbr discharge and temperature an overview of the modeling workflow is shown in fig 1 we used the weagets daily stochastic weather generator chen et al 2010 to generate synthetic precipitation time series using a first order markov chain for precipitation occurrence and a gamma distribution for the amount of precipitation the probability density function for the gamma distribution is 4 f x x λ α 1 e x p x λ λ γ α where x is daily precipitation α is the shape parameter λ is the rate parameter and γ α is the gamma function evaluated at α the model was trained using eleven years of daily precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures from the weather station at the homer thompson vegetable farm from 2011 to 2021 approximately 10 years of weather data have been assessed to be sufficient to train stochastic weather generators fullhart et al 2021 weagets estimates α and λ parameters for 14 day periods which are then used to generate synthetic time series of precipitation precipitation was related to bioreactor discharge using a generalized additive model gam trained on daily precipitation air temperature and bioreactor discharge data collected at the field wbr from 2019 to 2021 the gam was used to translate synthetic time series of daily precipitation generated by weagets into daily average bioreactor discharge q climate change scenarios were simulated by shifting air temperature tair up by 1 2 3 or 4 c the effects of warmer temperatures on precipitation intensity were first modeled by assuming the heaviest precipitation events increase 7 per c of warming while the mean of the precipitation distribution does not change the 7 change per c of warming is based on the clausius clapeyron relationship between temperature and water vapor pall et al 2007 vergara temprado et al 2021 this is implemented by changing the shape and rate parameters of the gamma distribution so that the 99 9th percentile of the rainfall distribution is increased by 7 for each c of warming while the mean is unchanged the gamma distribution parameters were determined based on the weather station precipitation record from 2011 to 2021 the cumulative distribution function of the precipitation distribution shows that large rain events are larger while small rain events are smaller fig s1 a requirement if the mean is unchanged this analysis was then repeated by adding a 3 increase in mean annual precipitation map per c of warming this rate of change in map per c warming was based on the rate of change in total precipitation estimated for a 30 year average centered on 2050 using multi model mean estimates of mean annual temperature and precipitation change from cmip5 under rcp 8 5 downscaled to tompkins county ny using the localized constructed analogs method data taken from the us climate resilience toolkit climate explorer u s federal government 2021 climatic changes in air temperature tair influence water temperature twater with time lags and damping effects a time lagged linear model describing bioreactor twater as a function of tair was parameterized using data from 2019 to 2021 more details on water temperature modeling are available in si and fig s2 this model was used to determine twater when tair was shifted up by 1 2 3 or 4 c in the climate change simulations daily mean air temperatures from 2019 to 2021 recorded at the homer thompson vegetable farm weather station were averaged and used as the baseline air temperature in climate change simulations 2 3 weather discharge relationships synthetic weather data generated by weagets under baseline and climate perturbed conditions were used to predict bioreactor discharge q using a two stage model trained on daily precipitation tair and q at the study site from 2019 to 2021 three years of data are sufficient for robust calibration of parsimonious rainfall runoff models like the one developed here anctil et al 2004 ayzel and heistermann 2021 li et al 2010 the model first predicts the occurrence of zero or non zero q and then for non zero days it predicts discharge magnitude a logistic regression was used to estimate the transition probabilities between dry and wet states 5 p s t s t 1 x t 1 1 e x p x t β here s t 0 1 is a binary indicator for zero or non zero q at time t xt is a vector of covariates with a column of 1 s for the intercept and β is a vector of regression coefficients one model is fit for dry to wet transitions using covariates of concurrent precipitation and a 90 day lagged rolling average of tair and another model is estimated for wet to wet transitions using the same covariates as well as lag 1 q the probabilities of dry to dry and wet to dry transitions can be inferred directly based on the requirement that the transition probabilities sum to unity due to class imbalances i e fewer days of zero q than non zero q we calibrate a threshold probability used to estimate transitions to the wet state using receiver operating characteristic roc curves and maximization of the f1 score lipton et al 2014 we estimate the magnitude of non zero discharge values using linear regression against lag 1 q precipitation and lag 1 precipitation 6 q t β 0 β 1 q t 1 β 1 p t β 1 p t 1 ε t the rating curve eqn s1 is only accurate up to estimated discharge values of 2 6 l s and so all values above this threshold are highly uncertain consequently we estimate the model above as a censored regression for discharge values above this threshold the two stage model predicted the observed bioreactor discharge from 2019 2021 with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 7 when excluding the n 21 censored observations of 979 total observations where the water level was outside of our weir calibration range fig s3 the nse decreased to 0 4 when the censored observations were included but we argue that it is appropriate to exclude these observations because they were highly uncertain and represent only 2 of the record the two stage model is used to translate synthetic time series of daily precipitation generated by weagets and warmed daily temperatures into daily bioreactor discharge q estimated transition probabilities are first used to determine the state wet or dry of each successive day in the simulation followed by predictions of discharge magnitude on wet days to ensure the variance of estimated discharge matched that of the observations regression residuals ε t from eq 6 are sampled from a fitted laplace distribution and added to the model estimated discharge this step is important because removal efficiency is sensitive to variance in pore water velocity and thus variance in discharge 2 4 reactive transport modeling of no3 transport and reaction of no3 in wbrs can be described using one dimensional advection dispersion reaction models halaburka et al 2017 7 n t v n x d 2 n x 2 v n c k c c n k n n where n is the no3 n concentration mg no3 n l 1 c is the labile doc concentration mg c l 1 vn is the maximum denitrification rate mg no3 n l 1 h 1 kn and kc are the half saturation constants mg l 1 for n and c respectively d is the dispersion coefficient m2 hr 1 and v is the pore water velocity m hr 1 this form of the model assumes the inhibition of denitrification by o2 is negligible halaburka et al 2017 determined that eq 7 can be simplified to the zero order biokinetic model described in eq 1 when no3 n 2 mg l while c availability has been shown to be an important control on wbr denitrification rates mcguire et al 2021 this simplification to zero order kinetics assumes that c availability does not vary meaningfully spatially or temporally within the bioreactor so its influence can be neglected hrt is determined as w h l ρ q the temperature dependence of the zero order rate constant k0 is described using a modified arrhenius equation dawson and murphy 1972 lewandoswki 1982 8 k 0 t k t r e f θ t t r e f where k t r e f is the zero order rate constant at a reference water temperature tref and θ is the dimensionless temperature coefficient zero order rate constants k0 for each sampling date were determined by transforming the distance of each sampling well along the bioreactor into a mean travel time li v where li is the distance to well i and v is the mean pore water velocity on the sampling date v was determined as q w h ρ no3 concentration profiles as a function of time were then fit with a least squares linear regression to determine k0 data were included in the model parameterization when the water level above the v notch was within the weir calibration range 1 10 cm and the r2 associated with the k0 model fit was 0 95 θ was then determined by fitting eq 8 to the k0 values using weighted nonlinear regression three points within 0 2 c of 14 c were averaged to

hydro climate conditions were determined by generating 100 years of synthetic precipitation time series and warmed temperature series and using these synthetic data to force the weather discharge and biokinetic models fig 1 differences between mean no3 load reductions in the climate change scenarios and the historical baseline were assessed using unpaired t tests without the assumption of equal variances differences among different climate change scenarios were assessed using kruskal wallis anova devore 2011 3 results 3 1 woodchip bioreactor properties the br breakthrough curve from the tracer test is shown in fig s5 it displays the tailing that is commonly observed in wbr tracer tests ghane et al 2015 jaynes et al 2016 mcguire and reid 2019 the tracer test determined ta 8 23 h while tth 6 02 h giving an ev 1 37 this is very close to ev values determined in prior wbr studies cameron and schipper 2012 halaburka et al 2017 and leads to an effective porosity ρ 0 8 which is in line with prior estimates for woodchip media halaburka et al 2017 the c n ratio of woodchips ranged from 85 4 124 5 and 220 8 243 7 in the inlet and outlet end of the reactor respectively table s1 fresh woodchips have c n ratios between 250 400 and the ratio decreases with a greater degree of decomposition schaefer et al 2021 3 2 biokinetic model parameterization a representative set of no3 concentration profiles measured in pore water at the study site wbr are shown in fig 2 a with distances transformed to mean travel times using pore water velocities v the full set of concentration profiles are shown in figure s6 no3 concentrations were relatively stable or increased slightly from well 1 to well 2 before decreasing linearly from well 2 to well 6 the lack of a no3 concentration decrease from well 1 to well 2 may be due to residual dissolved oxygen or incomplete mixing in the upstream end of the reactor the linearity of the concentration profiles from well 2 well 6 is consistent with zero order kinetics and the slope corresponds to the zero order rate constant k0 because no3 removal was only observed between well 2 and well 6 the effective length of the bioreactor used in estimates of hrt was shortened to 4 8 m the length from well 2 well 6 no3 n concentrations were almost always 2 mg n l fig s6 further justifying the use of zero order kinetic models seventeen dates spanning water temperatures of 8 to 17 c had no3 profiles that met quality control criteria and were fit with linear regression to determine the temperature dependence of k0 fig 2 b θ was determined to be 1 36 0 04 the daily no3 re was then determined based on the parameterized temperature dependence model hrt and mean twater on the date that pore water no3 was measured there was a favorable comparison of modeled res vs observed res with almost all points falling within uncertainty bounds of 30 fig s7 dates falling outside of the uncertainty bounds were typically associated with hydrological transitions figs s8 s9 and the reasons for this are examined in more detail in the discussion 3 3 seasonal wbr performance from 2019 to 2021 the parameterized biokinetic model was used to estimate cumulative no3 load reductions between may october in 2019 2020 and 2021 using observations of bioreactor discharge and twater fig 3 bioreactor discharge varied widely with typical flows ranging from 0 05 0 5 l s during baseflow periods though in the fall of 2021 there was a sustained period of flows from 0 5 1 l s during particularly wet weather no flow conditions were common and during moderate drought conditions in the summer and fall of 2020 there was a long no flow period from early july through november rain events did not necessarily translate into flow in the bioreactor particularly in summer months when multiple days of wet weather were often required to generate flow twater from may october ranged from 7 to 18 c no3 load reductions were usually poor in may and early june due to low temperatures but increased in late june september mean no3 removal rates from may october estimated using the zero order biokinetic model with water temperature and discharge data as inputs were 3 59 0 72 and 5 77 g no3 n m 3 d 1 for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively these model based estimates are in good agreement with direct measurements of mean no3 removal rates of 3 8 and 4 g no3 n m 3 d 1 from the same field site in earlier work from hassanpour et al 2017 and pluer et al 2016 respectively these findings are also in broad agreement with measurements of wbrs in the midwest u s where rates ranged from 0 78 to 7 76 g n m 3 d 1 christianson et al 2012 the low removal rate in 2020 was due to most of the no3 loading occurring in cool conditions in may followed by no flow conditions from june october cumulative percentage load reductions estimated using the model were 26 20 and 22 respectively overall no3 loading to the reactor was high in 2021 due to wet weather in late summer and fall while this led to higher removal rates the relatively short hrts also led to a lower percentage load reduction 3 4 wbr performance under baseline and climate change scenarios statistical properties of no3 load reductions under baseline and climate change perturbed hydro climate were determined by generating 100 years of synthetic precipitation time series and using daily average air temperatures measured from 2019 to 2021 these data were then used to force the weather discharge and biokinetic models the synthetic wbr discharge produced with baseline hydro climate conditions had similar properties to discharge observations from 2019 to 2021 fig s10 example time series of synthetic discharge water temperatures daily res and cumulative no3 load reductions with baseline hydro climate simulations are shown in fig s11 these simulations highlight the potential for daily res up to 100 in mid to late summer with low to moderate flows q 0 5 l s while also illustrating the impacts of storms on decreasing daily res and contributing to no3 loads in the wbr effluent statistical properties of simulated no3 load reductions are shown in fig 4 for the baseline analysis the interquartile range of cumulative no3 load reductions was 17 4 to 26 1 with a median of 21 7 this compared favorably with estimates from 2019 to 2021 shown as yellow stars in fig 4 the effects of climate change on no3 load reductions in the wbr were then evaluated by separately assessing the impacts of changing bioreactor discharge holding water temperature constant and water temperatures holding discharge constant before combining these effects changes to the precipitation gamma distribution to reflect different precipitation intensities while holding map constant increased the median number of days with 25 mm of precipitation from 6 under baseline conditions to 8 in the 4 c case figure s12a b increasing map led to a further increase in the median number of days with 25 mm of precipitation to 10 in the 4 c case median annual precipitation increased by roughly 3 for each c of warming fig s12b perturbations to precipitation intensity alone had only subtle impacts on bioreactor discharge fig s13a c total discharge was unchanged consistent with constant map and there was no change in the number of days with q 0 5 l s there was a small increase in the number of days with q 1 5 l s from 6 interquartile range 2 10 under baseline conditions to 8 interquartile range 2 5 to 14 in the 4 c case when both precipitation intensity and map were adjusted there were more clear impacts on bioreactor discharge fig s13d f with systematic increases in total annual discharge and in the median number of days with both q 0 5 and q 1 5 l s corresponding to air temperatures increases from 1 to 4 c neither changes in precipitation intensity nor map led to significant impacts on wbr performance with the median load reduction remaining steady at 21 1 in all cases involving only hydrological perturbations fig 4 incorporating warmer temperatures into the biokinetic model had a major impact on no3 load reductions however the analysis of air and water temperature data from 2019 to 2021 showed that bioreactor water temperatures were typically damped by 33 compared to time lagged tair in summer fig s2 so a 3 c increase in tair led to a roughly 2 c increase in twater with precipitation held constant and only temperature was adjusted median load reductions increased from 21 7 interquartile range 17 4 26 1 to 39 6 interquartile range 31 7 46 3 in the 4 c case simulations with an increase in air temperature of 1 4 c holding precipitation constant were all significantly different from the baseline fig 4 the incorporation of both hydrological and temperature perturbations in the combined effects models did not lead to significant differences from the cases where only temperatures were adjusted fig 4 the median no3 load reduction in the combined effects 4 c case was 41 interquartile range 32 6 47 1 very similar to the scenario where temperature was adjusted but precipitation was held constant this finding was contrary to expectations that more intense precipitation and bioreactor discharge might decrease wbr performance under certain circumstances due to shorter hrts our results indicate that changes in temperature and not amplification of the hydrological cycle will have a greater role in regulating wbr denitrification dynamics 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of wbr performance to hydro climate variability this hydrologic biokinetic analysis of wbr performance at our site suggests that climate warming will lead to net improvements in no3 load reductions a distinguishing feature of this study is the estimation of the temperature dependence of biokinetic constants using pore water profiles in real world conditions earlier studies have used laboratory flow through reactors with synthetic drainage water halaburka et al 2017 2019 kouanda and hua 2021 maxwell et al 2020b warneke et al 2011 or real drainage pumped through mesocosms containing excavated woodchips schmidt and clark 2013 to estimate biokinetic constants the wbr at our field site which was between 7 and 9 years old during our study was also older than systems examined in prior studies and provides insights into bioreactor functioning in the latter half of their design lifetimes table 1 we determined the temperature coefficient θ for the zero order rate constant to be 1 36 this estimate for θ reflects a very strong dependence of denitrification rates on temperature the temperature response of no3 removal rates in wbrs has been studied extensively using either θ or q10 to model temperature sensitivity q10 is the ratio of rates measured 10 c apart and is related to θ through q10 θ10 our estimate of θ 1 36 equivalent to a q10 of 21 6 is greater than prior wbr studies where θ has usually been found to range from roughly 1 05 1 2 addy et al 2016 ghane et al 2015 grießmeier et al 2021 halaburka et al 2019 equivalent to q10 between 1 6 and 6 2 table 1 several of these studies exhibit greater temperature sensitivity than bio processes in wastewater treatment facilities where θ is typically in the range of 1 07 1 12 equivalent to q10 2 3 rittmann and mccarty 2012 there are two theories that may explain the high temperature sensitivity of wbrs in general and of our aged bioreactor in particular first the ecological carbon quality temperature hypothesis suggests that temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic processes increases with more recalcitrant organic carbon sources craine et al 2010 maxwell et al 2019 sierra 2012 wetterstedt et al 2010 therefore the high temperature sensitivity of wbrs in general could be due to the recalcitrance of c in woody biomass compared to c in municipal wastewater facilities and the particularly high θ of our system could be related to the highly weathered status of the woodchips in our system compared to other wbr studies table 1 a prior study using woodchips between 1 and 2 years in age showed that q10 increased as woodchips aged maxwell et al 2020a the low woodchip c n ratios in our system table s1 reflect a high level of woodchip degradation over the 7 to 9 years that they have aged in the reactor and lost much of their more labile c fractions abusallout and hua 2017 the lower c n ratio in the inlet compared to outlet sides of the wbr has been reported previously ghane et al 2018 schaefer et al 2021 and is possibly due to residual dissolved oxygen near the influent that can facilitate o2 dependent enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic biomass mcguire et al 2023 in a study with 9 year old woodchips excavated from a wbr christianson et al 2020 found lignocellulose indices 0 6 indicating poor carbon quality with little residual cellulose or hemicellulose another possible explanation for the high θ of our system is offered by macromolecular rate theory mmrt which describes the temperature dependence of enzymatic reactions through changes in heat capacity associated with enzyme catalysis hobbs et al 2013 notably mmrt predicts greater relative temperature sensitivity at low temperatures compared to high temperatures with some processes having q10 10 for temperatures below 10 c schipper et al 2014 this could contribute to the greater temperature sensitivity in our system since much of our data were collected at field relevant temperatures of 7 15 c that are below those used in many laboratory based estimates of q10 or θ warneke et al 2011 we nonetheless acknowledge that our θ estimate is significantly higher than those in prior work including field wbr studies and since the temperature dependent kinetics is a key driver of the model outcomes we performed a sensitivity analysis to explore effects of varying θ from 1 0 to 1 4 see fig s14 for respective temperature response curves we kept tref fixed at 13 9 c and varied θ so the resulting models may not be directly comparable to prior studies that use different tref this sensitivity analysis may encompass temperature response dynamics of wbrs with a younger woodchip age that are less sensitive to temperature and serves to address uncertainty in k0 at higher temperature our dataset included relatively few data points at temperature greater than 15 c and no3 removal rates at these higher temperatures may become increasingly important under climate warming at our field site under the historical baseline hydro climate simulations using θ from 1 to 1 2 produce no3 load reductions that are significantly lower than the load reductions resulting from our best fit θ and that underestimate the load reductions estimated from 2019 2021 observations depicted as yellow stars because they do not adequately describe faster removal kinetics with warmer temperatures fig 5 a θ values ranging from 1 3 to 1 4 produce load reductions that are not significantly different than the reductions based on θ 1 36 with the perturbed hydro climate in the 4 c combined effects case no3 load reductions for θ 1 to 1 3 are significantly lower than distributions resulting from the 4 c case with the θ 1 36 estimate θ values of 1 0 to 1 1 in the 4 c combined effects scenario also led to no3 load reductions that were either lower than or unchanged from the baseline case no climate warming while θ values of 1 2 to 1 4 led to an increase in no3 load reductions compared to the no warming baseline this suggests that bioreactors characterized by θ of approximately 1 1 or lower as summarized in table 1 could see negligible changes to their performance under climate warming up to 4 c while reactors with θ values of approximately 1 2 or higher would see improved no3 load reductions we emphasize that our relatively high θ estimate is required to adequately describe the temperature response dynamics of our system and that the outcomes could change somewhat based on different tref and ktref the temperature response model of halaburka et al 2019 θ 1 16 tref 21 c ktref 0 13 mg n l 1 hr 1 is plotted alongside our data and model fit on fig 2 b as an example of the large variation between different wbr studies the reasons for the large differences in the temperature dependence of no3 removal rates in these two systems could be due to differences in woodchip age 15 months vs 7 9 years different weathering conditions in laboratory columns vs in situ environmental conditions or other biogeochemical properties of the woodchip matrix while our no3 removal rates are consistently greater than those in halaburka et al 2019 they are lower than rates measured in the field study of ghane et al 2015 of 0 5 1 0 mg n l 1 hr 1 for water temperatures between 5 and 10 c this analysis underscores the large variability of denitrification kinetics observed in wbr systems and suggests that site to site variations in woodchip age and temperature dependence of denitrification kinetics will play a crucial role in determining the effects of climate warming on wbr performance another feature of the modeling that can contribute to improved no3 load reductions in the climate change scenarios is the inverse relationship between bioreactor discharge and influent no3 concentrations fig s4 leading to smaller influent no3 loads requiring treatment during short hrt storm events similar relationships between no3 concentrations and tile drainage flows during storms have been observed previously and have been attributed to dilution and or greater denitrification in wet soils cuadra and vidon 2011 however there is uncertainty in influent no3 concentrations during large storms at our site because our dataset only includes values of q ranging from 0 05 to 0 45 l s pluer et al 2019 studied storm flows at our site and found that the effects of storm events on influent no3 concentrations were inconsistent with some events leading to lower influent concentrations while others had no effect on influent concentrations to address this uncertainty we tested the effects of a constant influent no3 concentration of 10 5 mg l no3 n the mean influent concentration in our dataset on cumulative load reductions fig 5 b the sensitivity analysis showed that there was no significant effect on no3 load reductions with the exception of the 1 c case where there was a small but significant increase in the no3 load reductions in the constant influent concentration case an improvement in no3 removal with a constant influent concentration was contrary to expectations and may be due to a fixed influent no3 concentration allowing for greater removal of no3 mass compared to a scenario where influent no3 decreases with q particularly when warm temperatures and low to moderate flows can support very high res this analysis showed that assumptions about the dependence of influent no3 concentrations on q for the most part did not have a significant effect on model outcomes predictive modeling of no3 res during storm events remains a challenge given potential uncertainties around influent no3 concentrations during storms as noted above it is possible that removal rates could become no3 limited ghane et al 2015 kouanda and hua 2021 measured no3 profiles that were either under or overestimated by the model tended to occur during hydrological transitions fig s8 s9 in some cases better than expected no3 removal may be due to a dry wet transition in a portion of the woodchip matrix following a storm related increase in the water level this can significantly increase the saturated volume of the woodchip matrix supporting denitrification and previously unsaturated woodchips that had been exposed to air would most likely be better sources of bioavailable carbon due to greater lignocellulose degradation in the presence of oxygen maxwell et al 2019 mcguire et al 2021 2023 depending on the time of year storms can also lead to transient increases in water temperatures as shown in fig s8 there is prior evidence from our site that no3 removal rates are higher during storm events pluer et al 2019 and such dry wet transitions and transient temperature increases may provide explanations in other cases removal rates in the aftermath of storm events were overestimated by the model for reasons that remain unclear fig s9 modeling complex no3 transport and reaction dynamics in wbrs during storms or after abrupt changes in bioreactor water levels should be a priority for ongoing research on wbr systems an important insight of the synthetic discharge and daily no3 removal datasets is that low to moderate flows throughout warm summer months can lead to reasonably strong load reductions of 20 30 while no flow conditions during the summer can decrease load reductions since there is no flow during the periods when the reactor is most effective fig s11 while summers in central new york are expected to be wetter under climate warming the agricultural upper midwest region of the united states is expected to experience drier summers wuebbles et al 2017 it is therefore possible that the improvements in load reductions that we expect to occur at our site under climate warming may not translate in the upper midwest due to drier conditions and less flow during periods when denitrification rates are high 4 2 environmental implications probable impacts of climate change on the denitrification performance of wbrs via changes to temperature and precipitation patterns have been noted in prior studies and identified as a research priority fan et al 2022 this study integrates hydrological and biokinetic modeling to show that anticipated changes to water temperatures and precipitation patterns under climate warming will most likely improve the denitrification performance of our wbr study site with faster biokinetics under warmer temperatures outweighing any impact of shorter hrts resulting from intensified precipitation it should be noted that increased microbial activity under climate warming could also accelerate woodchip degradation and potentially decrease the lifetime of the woodchip media but further research is needed to assess this point because our model is trained with site specific weather discharge and no3 removal data it cannot be directly generalized to other wbr sites the temperature response curve of no3 removal rates is a particularly important parameter that varies widely between studies improved temperature dependence models that account for effects of variations in woodchip quality on temperature sensitivity are needed before a generalizable model for climate change impacts on wbr performance can be built however the framework developed here can be readily applied elsewhere provided the site specific temperature dependence of biokinetic rate constants and precipitation discharge relationships can be adequately parameterized many other nature based treatment technologies e g constructed wetlands stormwater detention basins similarly depend on temperature and hrt as controls on denitrification so the

14642,denitrifying woodchip bioreactors wbrs are a nature based technology that are increasingly used to control nonpoint source nitrate no3 pollution in agricultural catchments the treatment effectiveness of wbrs depends on temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt both of which are affected by climate change warmer temperatures will increase microbial denitrification rates but the extent to which the resulting benefits to treatment performance may be offset by intensified precipitation and shorter hrts is not clear here we use three years of monitoring data from a wbr in central new york state to train an integrated hydrologic biokinetic model describing links among temperature precipitation bioreactor discharge denitrification kinetics and no3 removal efficiencies effects of climate warming are assessed by first training a stochastic weather generator with eleven years of weather data from our field site and then adjusting the distribution of precipitation intensities according to the clausius clapeyron relationship between water vapor and temperature modeling results indicate in our system faster denitrification rates will outweigh the influence of intensified precipitation and discharge under warming leading to net improvements in no3 load reductions median cumulative no3 load reductions at our study site from may october are projected to increase from 21 7 interquartile range 17 4 26 1 under baseline hydro climate to 41 0 interquartile range 32 6 47 1 with a 4 c change in mean air temperature this improved performance under climate warming is driven by strong nonlinear dependence of no3 removal rates on temperature temperature sensitivity may increase with woodchip age and lead to stronger temperature response in systems like this one with a highly aged woodchip matrix while the impacts of hydro climatic change on wbr performance will depend on site specific properties this hydrologic biokinetic modeling approach provides

drainage from croplands is rich in nitrate no3 with relatively low concentrations of ammonium and a low carbon c n ratio so biological treatment efforts typically focus on sustainable methods to supply bioavailable organic c to denitrifying microorganisms woodchip bioreactors wbrs are nature based technologies that are increasingly employed for the cost effective removal of no3 from agricultural runoff and drainage christianson and schipper 2016 easton et al 2019 pluer et al 2016 schipper et al 2010a 2010b wbrs are trenches that are filled with woodchips which serve as a slow release source of bioavailable c and a biofilm support structure while the expected lifetime of wbrs is 10 years it is common for denitrification rates to become carbon limited due to the recalcitrance of c in lignocellulosic woody biomass abusallout and hua 2017 christianson et al 2020 mcguire et al 2021 schaefer et al 2021 warneke et al 2011 nitrate removal rates in woodchip

regulate microbial kinetics david et al 2016 halaburka et al 2019 and hydraulic retention times hrts hoover et al 2016 pluer et al 2016 of water in bioreactors no3 dynamics in wbrs have been effectively described using parsimonious zero order biokinetic models if no3 concentrations are 2 mg no3 n l a condition which is usually met in wbrs grießmeier et al 2021 halaburka et al 2017 the resulting model for effluent no3 concentrations is halaburka et al 2017 2019 1 n e f f l u e n t n i n f l u e n t k 0 t h r t where neffluent and ninfluent are effluent and influent no3 n concentrations respectively k0 t is a temperature sensitive zero order rate constant and h r t is the mean hrt both k0 t and h r t are highly sensitive to hydro climate and changes in hydro climatic conditions associated with global climate change fan et al 2022 o neill et al 2016 prein et al 2017 the temperature dependence of denitrification rates is described using the exponential arrhenius equation dawson and murphy 1972 halaburka et al 2019 so small increases in temperature can lead to large increases in biokinetic constants and consequently faster microbial removal of no3 at the same time climate change is widely expected to intensify precipitation trenberth 2011 which can lead to a larger fraction of no3 loads moving through reactors during high flow short hrt events royer et al 2006 when treatment efficiencies are poor the net effects of anticipated hydro climatic change on wbr performance are therefore subject to nonlinear interactions between bioreactor flows and microbial reaction rates and are difficult to predict the significance of abiotic variables like temperature and hrt on wbr no3 removal efficiencies have been explored through structural equation modeling fan et al 2022 but there is a lack of process based modeling exploring effects of hydro climatic change on wbr performance the objective of this study is to describe the joint impacts of warmer temperatures and intensified precipitation discharge on denitrification performance of woodchip bioreactors using predictive models while biokinetic models parameterized with field data have been described previously ghane et al 2015 grießmeier et al 2021 these models have not been used to explore the sensitivity of denitrification performance to hydro climatic variability expected with climate warming here models for bioreactor discharge and biokinetics were calibrated based on precipitation temperature and no3 monitoring data from a wbr on a research farm in central new york state united states synthetic precipitation time series with climate perturbations were then produced using a stochastic weather generator and used to force the bioreactor discharge and biokinetic models this approach was used to disentangle impacts of changing temperature precipitation intensity and mean annual precipitation on no3 load reductions in wbr systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site nitrate removal dynamics were monitored in a wbr at the homer c thompson vegetable farm in freeville new york ny from 2019 2021 paired woodchip bioreactors were constructed in 2012 to treat tile drainage collected from 8 ha of cropland each reactor has a 6 1 3 1 m footprint with a thickness of 0 69 m and was buried under 0 36 m of soil the bioreactors were filled with primarily ash genus fraxnius woodchips hassanpour et al 2017 and wrapped in an impermeable polyethylene sheet in 2018 six wells for collecting pore water samples were installed along the centerline of one of the bioreactors at a depth of 35 cm below the surface of the woodchip matrix for measurement of pore water no3 profiles an additional six wells were installed 50 cm from the inlet manifold perpendicular to the direction of flow in 2022 solinst levelogger pressure transducers were installed in the inlet and outlet control structures to monitor water levels and water temperatures data were logged every 10 min the outlet of the reactor is fitted with a v notch weir which allows water level to be converted to reactor discharge q pluer 2015 in june 2021 woodchips were excavated from the inlet and outlet ends of the bioreactor for c n ratio measurements performed at the cornell stable isotope laboratory with a carlo erba nc2500 elemental analyzer additional details on these bioreactors are available in prior publications on this study site hassanpour et al 2017 pluer et al 2016 2019 and information on the wbr rating curve used to determine q are available in si the hydrodynamics of water flow through wbrs is complex and there is debate over appropriate measures of the porosity of the woodchip matrix to determine accurate hrts cameron and schipper 2012 halaburka et al 2017 jaynes et al 2016 a bromide br tracer test was therefore performed in may 2022 to determine the effective porosity ρ to use in hrt calculations 1 l of a 2 m sodium bromide nabr solution was injected into the set of six wells at the upstream end of the wbr samples were collected from the outlet hourly for two days using an isco 3700 automated water sampler and then every four hours for the next two days

distribution is 4 f x x λ α 1 e x p x λ λ γ α where x is daily precipitation α is the shape parameter λ is the rate parameter and γ α is the gamma function evaluated at α the model was trained using eleven years of daily precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures from the weather station at the homer thompson vegetable farm from 2011 to 2021 approximately 10 years of weather data have been assessed to be sufficient to train stochastic weather generators fullhart et al 2021 weagets estimates α and λ parameters for 14 day periods which are then used to generate synthetic time series of precipitation precipitation was related to bioreactor discharge using a generalized additive model gam trained on daily precipitation air temperature and bioreactor discharge data collected at the field wbr from 2019 to 2021 the gam was used to translate synthetic time series of daily precipitation generated by weagets into daily average bioreactor discharge q climate change scenarios were simulated by shifting air temperature tair up by 1 2 3 or 4 c the effects of warmer temperatures on precipitation intensity were first modeled by assuming the heaviest precipitation events increase 7 per c of warming while the mean of the precipitation distribution does not change the 7 change per c of warming is based on the clausius clapeyron relationship between temperature and water vapor pall et al 2007 vergara temprado et al 2021 this is implemented by changing the shape and rate parameters of the gamma distribution so that the 99 9th percentile of the rainfall distribution is increased by 7 for each c of warming while the mean is unchanged the gamma distribution parameters were determined based on the weather station precipitation record from 2011 to 2021 the cumulative distribution function of the precipitation distribution shows that large rain events are larger while small rain events are smaller fig s1 a requirement if the mean is unchanged this analysis was then repeated by adding a 3 increase in mean annual precipitation map per c of warming this rate of change in map per c warming was based on the rate of change in total precipitation estimated for a 30 year average centered on 2050 using multi model mean estimates of mean annual temperature and precipitation change from cmip5 under rcp 8 5 downscaled to tompkins county ny using the localized constructed analogs method data taken from the us climate resilience toolkit climate explorer u s federal government 2021 climatic changes in air temperature tair influence water temperature twater with time lags and damping effects a time lagged linear model describing bioreactor twater as a function of tair was parameterized using data from 2019 to 2021 more details on water temperature modeling are available in si and fig s2 this model was used to determine twater when tair was shifted up by 1 2 3 or 4 c in the climate change simulations daily mean air temperatures from 2019 to 2021 recorded at the homer thompson vegetable farm weather station were averaged and used as the baseline air temperature in climate change simulations 2 3 weather discharge relationships synthetic weather data generated by weagets under baseline and climate perturbed conditions were used to predict bioreactor discharge q using a two stage model trained on daily precipitation tair and q at the study site from 2019 to 2021 three years of data are sufficient for robust calibration of parsimonious rainfall runoff models like the one developed here anctil et al 2004 ayzel and heistermann 2021 li et al 2010 the model first predicts the occurrence of zero or non zero q and then for non zero days it predicts discharge magnitude a logistic regression was used to estimate the transition probabilities between dry and wet states 5 p s t s t 1 x t 1 1 e x p x t β here s t 0 1 is a binary indicator for zero or non zero q at time t xt is a vector of covariates with a column of 1 s for the intercept and β is a vector of regression coefficients one model is fit for dry to wet transitions using covariates of concurrent precipitation and a 90 day lagged rolling average of tair and another model is estimated for wet to wet transitions using the same covariates as well as lag 1 q the probabilities of dry to dry and wet to dry transitions can be inferred directly based on the requirement that the transition probabilities sum to unity due to class imbalances i e fewer days of zero q than non zero q we calibrate a threshold probability used to estimate transitions to the wet state using receiver operating characteristic roc curves and maximization of the f1 score lipton et al 2014 we estimate the magnitude of non zero discharge values using linear regression against lag 1 q precipitation and lag 1 precipitation 6 q t β 0 β 1 q t 1 β 1 p t β 1 p t 1 ε t the rating curve eqn s1 is only accurate up to estimated discharge values of 2 6 l s and so all values above this threshold are highly uncertain consequently we estimate the model above as a censored regression for discharge values above this threshold the two stage model predicted the observed bioreactor discharge from 2019 2021 with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 7 when excluding the n 21 censored observations of 979 total observations where the water level was outside of our weir calibration range fig s3 the nse decreased to 0 4 when the censored observations were included but we argue that it is appropriate to exclude these observations because they were highly uncertain and represent only 2 of the record the two stage model is used to translate synthetic time series of daily precipitation generated by weagets and warmed daily temperatures into daily bioreactor discharge q estimated transition probabilities are first used to determine the state wet or dry of each successive day in the simulation followed by predictions of discharge magnitude on wet days to ensure the variance of estimated discharge matched that of the observations regression residuals ε t from eq 6 are sampled from a fitted laplace distribution and added to the model estimated discharge this step is important because removal efficiency is sensitive to variance in pore water velocity and thus variance in discharge 2 4 reactive transport modeling of no3 transport and reaction of no3 in wbrs can be described using one dimensional advection

form of the model assumes the inhibition of denitrification by o2 is negligible halaburka et al 2017 determined that eq 7 can be simplified to the zero order biokinetic model described in eq 1 when no3 n 2 mg l while c availability has been shown to be an important control on wbr denitrification rates mcguire et al 2021 this simplification to zero order kinetics assumes that c availability does not vary meaningfully spatially or temporally within the bioreactor so its influence can be neglected hrt is determined as w h l ρ q the temperature dependence of the zero order rate constant k0 is described using a modified arrhenius equation dawson and murphy 1972 lewandoswki 1982 8 k 0 t k t r e f θ t t r e f where k t r e f is the zero order rate constant at a reference water temperature tref and θ is the dimensionless temperature coefficient zero order rate constants k0 for each sampling date were determined by transforming the distance of each sampling well along the bioreactor into a mean travel time li v where li is the distance to well i and v is the mean pore water velocity on the sampling date v was determined as q w h ρ no3 concentration profiles as a function of time were then fit with a least squares linear regression to determine k0 data were included in the model parameterization when the water level above the v notch was within the weir calibration range 1 10 cm and the r2 associated with the k0 model fit was 0 95 θ was then determined by fitting eq 8 to the k0 values using weighted nonlinear regression three points within 0 2 c of 14 c were averaged to determine tref 13 9 c and k t r e f 0 331 mg no3 n l 1 hr 1 other studies have used tref between 21 and 23 c grießmeier et al 2021 halaburka et al 2019 but those temperatures were outside of our temperature range so could not be used here model based daily removal efficiencies res were determined using 9 re n infl uent n effl uent n infl uent 100 the key performance metric for no3 removal by wbrs is the cumulative no3 n load reduction this was determined using 10 cumu lati ve load redu ction i n q i n infl uent i q i 1 r e i n infl uent i where n is the number of days in the time window

in soils during wet weather ninfluent was therefore determined for each day as a function of daily average q statistical properties of no3 load reductions under baseline and climate change perturbed hydro climate conditions were determined by generating 100 years of synthetic precipitation time series and warmed temperature series and using these synthetic data to force the weather discharge and biokinetic models fig 1 differences between mean no3 load reductions in the climate change scenarios and the historical baseline were assessed using unpaired t tests without the assumption of equal variances differences among different climate change scenarios were assessed using kruskal wallis anova devore 2011 3 results 3 1 woodchip bioreactor properties the br breakthrough curve from the tracer test is shown in fig s5 it displays the tailing that is commonly observed in wbr tracer tests ghane et al 2015 jaynes et al 2016 mcguire and reid 2019 the tracer test determined ta 8 23 h while tth 6 02 h giving an ev 1 37 this is very close to ev values determined in prior wbr studies cameron and schipper 2012 halaburka et al 2017 and leads to an effective porosity ρ 0 8 which is in line with prior estimates for woodchip media halaburka et al 2017 the c n ratio of woodchips ranged from 85 4 124 5 and 220 8 243 7 in the inlet and outlet end of the reactor respectively table s1 fresh woodchips have c n ratios between 250 400 and the ratio decreases with a greater degree of decomposition schaefer et al 2021 3 2 biokinetic model parameterization a representative set of no3 concentration profiles measured in pore water at the study site wbr are shown in fig 2 a with distances transformed to mean travel times using pore water velocities v the full set of concentration profiles are shown in figure s6 no3 concentrations were relatively stable or increased slightly from well 1 to well 2 before decreasing linearly from well 2 to well 6 the lack of a no3 concentration decrease from well 1 to well 2 may be due to residual dissolved oxygen or incomplete mixing in the upstream end of the reactor the linearity of the concentration profiles from well 2 well 6 is consistent with zero order kinetics and the slope corresponds to the zero order rate constant k0 because no3 removal was only observed between well 2 and well 6 the effective length of the bioreactor used in estimates of hrt was shortened to 4 8 m the length from well 2 well 6 no3 n concentrations were almost always 2 mg n l fig s6 further justifying the use of zero order kinetic models seventeen dates spanning water temperatures of 8 to 17 c had no3 profiles that met quality control criteria and were fit with linear regression to determine the temperature dependence of k0 fig 2 b θ was determined to be 1 36 0 04 the daily no3 re was then determined based on the parameterized temperature dependence model hrt and mean twater on the date that pore water no3 was measured there was a favorable comparison of modeled res vs observed res with almost all points falling within uncertainty bounds of 30 fig s7 dates falling outside of the uncertainty bounds were typically associated with hydrological transitions figs s8 s9 and the reasons for this are examined in more detail in the discussion 3 3 seasonal wbr performance from 2019 to 2021 the parameterized biokinetic model was used to estimate cumulative no3 load reductions between may october in 2019 2020 and 2021 using observations of bioreactor discharge and twater fig 3 bioreactor discharge varied widely with typical flows ranging from 0 05 0 5 l s during baseflow periods though in the fall of 2021 there was a sustained period of flows from 0 5 1 l s during particularly wet weather no flow conditions were common and during moderate drought conditions in the summer and fall of 2020 there was a long no flow period from early july through november rain events did not necessarily translate into flow in the bioreactor particularly in summer months when multiple days of wet weather were often required to generate flow twater from may october ranged from 7 to 18 c no3 load reductions were usually poor in may and early june due to low temperatures but increased in late june september mean no3 removal rates from may october estimated using the zero order biokinetic model with water temperature and discharge data as inputs were 3 59 0 72 and 5 77 g no3 n m 3 d 1 for 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively these model based estimates are in good agreement with direct measurements of mean no3 removal rates of 3 8 and 4 g no3 n m 3 d 1 from the same field site in earlier work from hassanpour et al 2017 and pluer et al 2016 respectively these findings are also in broad agreement with measurements of wbrs in the midwest u s where rates ranged from 0 78 to 7 76 g n m 3 d 1 christianson et al 2012 the low removal rate in 2020 was due to most of the no3 loading occurring in cool conditions in may followed by no flow conditions from june october cumulative percentage load reductions estimated using the model were 26 20 and 22 respectively overall no3 loading to the reactor was high in 2021 due to wet weather in late summer and fall while this led to higher removal rates the relatively short hrts also led to a lower percentage load reduction 3 4 wbr performance under baseline and climate change scenarios statistical properties of no3 load reductions under baseline and climate change perturbed hydro climate were determined by generating 100 years of synthetic precipitation time series and using daily average air temperatures measured from 2019 to 2021 these data were then used to force the weather discharge and biokinetic models the synthetic wbr discharge produced with baseline hydro climate conditions had similar properties to discharge observations from 2019 to 2021 fig s10 example time series of synthetic discharge water temperatures daily res and cumulative no3 load reductions with baseline hydro climate simulations are shown in fig s11 these simulations highlight the potential for daily res up to 100 in mid to late summer with low to moderate flows q 0 5 l s while also illustrating the impacts of storms on decreasing daily res and contributing to no3 loads in the wbr effluent statistical properties of simulated no3 load reductions are shown in fig 4 for the baseline analysis the interquartile range of cumulative no3 load reductions was 17 4 to 26 1 with a median of 21 7 this compared favorably with estimates from 2019 to 2021 shown as yellow stars in fig 4 the effects of climate change on no3 load reductions in the wbr were then evaluated by separately assessing the impacts of changing bioreactor discharge holding water temperature constant and water temperatures holding discharge constant before combining these effects changes to the precipitation gamma distribution to reflect different precipitation intensities while holding map constant increased the median number of days with 25 mm of precipitation from 6 under baseline conditions to 8 in the 4 c case figure s12a b increasing map led to a further increase in the median number of days with 25 mm of precipitation to 10 in the 4 c case median annual precipitation increased by roughly 3 for each c of warming fig s12b perturbations to precipitation intensity alone had only subtle impacts on bioreactor discharge fig s13a c total discharge was unchanged consistent with constant map and there was no change in the number of days with q 0 5 l s there was a small increase in the number of days with q 1 5 l s from 6 interquartile range 2 10 under baseline conditions to 8 interquartile range 2 5 to 14 in the 4 c case when both precipitation intensity and map were adjusted there were more clear impacts on bioreactor discharge fig s13d f with systematic increases in total annual discharge and in the median number of days with both q 0 5 and q 1 5 l s corresponding to air temperatures increases from 1 to 4 c neither changes in precipitation intensity nor map led to significant impacts on wbr performance with the median load reduction remaining steady at 21 1 in all cases involving only hydrological perturbations fig 4 incorporating warmer temperatures into the biokinetic model had a major impact on no3 load reductions however the analysis of air and water temperature data from 2019 to 2021 showed that bioreactor water temperatures were typically damped by 33 compared to time lagged tair in summer fig s2 so a 3 c increase in tair led to a roughly 2 c increase in twater with precipitation held constant and only temperature was adjusted median load reductions increased from 21 7 interquartile range 17 4 26 1 to 39 6 interquartile range 31 7 46 3 in the 4 c case simulations with an increase in air temperature of 1 4 c holding precipitation constant were all significantly different from the baseline fig 4 the incorporation of both hydrological and temperature perturbations in the combined effects models did not lead to significant differences from the cases where only temperatures were adjusted fig 4 the median no3 load reduction in the combined effects 4 c case was 41 interquartile range 32 6 47 1 very similar to the scenario where temperature was adjusted but precipitation was held constant this finding was contrary to expectations that more intense precipitation and bioreactor discharge might decrease wbr performance under certain circumstances due to shorter hrts our results indicate that changes in temperature and not amplification of the hydrological cycle will have a greater role in regulating wbr denitrification dynamics 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of wbr performance to hydro climate variability this hydrologic biokinetic analysis of wbr performance at our site suggests that climate warming will lead to net improvements in no3 load reductions a distinguishing feature of this study is the estimation of the temperature dependence of biokinetic constants using pore water profiles in real world conditions earlier studies have used laboratory flow through reactors with synthetic drainage water halaburka et al 2017 2019 kouanda and hua 2021 maxwell et al 2020b warneke et al 2011 or real drainage pumped through mesocosms containing excavated woodchips schmidt and clark 2013 to estimate biokinetic constants the wbr at our field site which was between 7 and 9 years old during our study was also older than systems examined in prior studies and provides insights into bioreactor functioning in the latter half of their design lifetimes table 1 we determined the temperature coefficient θ for the zero order rate constant to be 1 36 this estimate for θ reflects a very strong dependence of denitrification rates on temperature the temperature response of no3 removal rates in wbrs has been studied extensively using either θ or q10 to model temperature sensitivity q10 is the ratio of rates measured 10 c apart and is related to θ through q10 θ10 our estimate of θ 1 36 equivalent to a q10 of 21 6 is greater than prior wbr studies where θ has usually been found to range from roughly 1 05 1 2 addy et al 2016 ghane et al 2015 grießmeier et al 2021 halaburka et al 2019 equivalent to q10 between 1 6 and 6 2 table 1 several of these studies exhibit greater temperature sensitivity than bio processes in wastewater treatment facilities where θ is typically in the range of 1 07 1 12 equivalent to q10 2 3 rittmann and mccarty 2012 there are two theories that may explain the high temperature sensitivity of wbrs in general and of our aged bioreactor in particular first the ecological carbon quality temperature hypothesis suggests that temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic processes increases with more recalcitrant organic carbon sources craine et al 2010 maxwell et al 2019 sierra 2012 wetterstedt et al 2010 therefore the high temperature sensitivity of wbrs in general could be due to the recalcitrance of c in woody biomass compared to c in municipal wastewater facilities and the particularly high θ of our system could be related to the highly weathered status of the woodchips in our system compared to other wbr studies table 1 a prior study using woodchips between 1 and 2 years in age showed that q10 increased as woodchips aged maxwell et al 2020a the low woodchip c n ratios in our system table s1 reflect a high level of woodchip degradation over the 7 to 9 years that they have aged in the reactor and lost much of their more labile c fractions abusallout and hua 2017 the lower c n ratio in the inlet compared to outlet sides of the wbr has been reported previously ghane et al 2018 schaefer et al 2021 and is possibly due to residual dissolved oxygen near the influent that can facilitate o2 dependent enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic biomass mcguire et al 2023 in a study with 9 year old woodchips excavated from a wbr christianson et al 2020 found lignocellulose indices 0 6 indicating poor carbon quality with little residual cellulose or hemicellulose another possible explanation for the high θ of our system is offered by macromolecular rate theory mmrt which describes the temperature dependence of enzymatic reactions through changes in heat capacity associated with enzyme catalysis hobbs et al 2013 notably mmrt predicts greater relative temperature sensitivity at low temperatures compared to high temperatures with some processes having q10 10 for temperatures below 10 c schipper et al 2014 this could contribute to the greater temperature sensitivity in our system since much of our data were collected at field relevant temperatures of 7 15 c that are below those used in many laboratory based estimates of q10 or θ warneke et al 2011 we nonetheless acknowledge that our θ estimate is significantly higher than those in prior work including field wbr studies and since the temperature dependent kinetics is a key driver of the model outcomes we performed a sensitivity analysis to explore effects of varying θ from 1 0 to 1 4 see fig s14 for respective temperature response curves we kept tref fixed at 13 9 c and varied θ so the resulting models may not be directly comparable to prior studies that use different tref this sensitivity analysis may encompass temperature response dynamics of wbrs with a younger woodchip age that are less sensitive to temperature and serves to address uncertainty in k0 at higher temperature our dataset included relatively few data points at temperature greater than 15 c and no3 removal rates at these higher temperatures may become increasingly important under climate warming at our field site under the historical baseline hydro climate simulations using θ from 1 to 1 2 produce no3 load reductions that are significantly lower than the load reductions resulting from our best fit θ and that underestimate the load reductions estimated from 2019 2021 observations depicted as yellow stars because they do not adequately describe faster removal kinetics with warmer temperatures fig 5 a θ values ranging from 1 3 to 1 4 produce load reductions that are not significantly different than the reductions based on θ 1 36 with the perturbed hydro climate in the 4 c combined effects case no3 load reductions for θ 1 to 1 3 are significantly lower than distributions resulting from the 4 c case with the θ 1 36 estimate θ values of 1 0 to 1 1 in the 4 c combined effects scenario also led to no3 load reductions that were either lower than or unchanged from the baseline case no climate warming while θ values of 1 2 to 1 4 led to an increase in no3 load reductions compared to the no warming baseline this suggests that bioreactors characterized by θ of approximately 1 1 or lower as summarized in table 1 could see negligible changes to their performance under climate warming up to 4 c while reactors with θ values of approximately 1 2 or higher would see improved no3 load reductions we emphasize that our relatively high θ estimate is required to adequately describe the temperature response dynamics of our system and that the outcomes could change somewhat based on different tref and ktref the temperature response model of halaburka et al 2019 θ 1 16 tref 21 c ktref 0 13 mg n l 1 hr 1 is plotted alongside our data and model fit on fig 2 b as an example of the large variation between different wbr studies the reasons for the large differences in the temperature dependence of no3 removal rates in these two systems could be due to differences in woodchip age 15 months vs 7 9 years different weathering conditions in laboratory columns vs in situ environmental conditions or other biogeochemical properties of the woodchip matrix while our no3 removal rates are consistently greater than those in halaburka et al 2019 they are lower than rates measured in the field study of ghane et al 2015 of 0 5 1 0 mg n l 1 hr 1 for water temperatures between 5 and 10 c this analysis underscores the large variability of denitrification kinetics observed in wbr systems and suggests that site to site variations in woodchip age and temperature dependence of denitrification kinetics will play a crucial role in determining the effects of climate warming on wbr performance another feature of the modeling that can contribute to improved no3 load reductions in the climate change scenarios is the inverse relationship between bioreactor discharge and influent no3 concentrations fig s4 leading to smaller influent no3 loads requiring treatment during short hrt storm events similar relationships between no3 concentrations and tile drainage flows during storms have been observed previously and have been attributed to dilution and or greater denitrification in wet soils cuadra and vidon 2011 however there is uncertainty in influent no3 concentrations during large storms at our site because our dataset only includes values of q ranging from 0 05 to 0 45 l s pluer et al 2019 studied storm flows at our site and found that the effects of storm events on influent no3 concentrations were inconsistent with some events leading to lower influent concentrations while others had no effect on influent concentrations to address this uncertainty we tested the effects of a constant influent no3 concentration of 10 5 mg l no3 n the mean influent concentration in our dataset on cumulative load reductions fig 5 b the sensitivity analysis showed that there was no significant effect on no3 load reductions with the exception of the 1 c case where there was a small but significant increase in the no3 load reductions in the constant influent concentration case an improvement in no3 removal with a constant influent concentration was contrary to expectations and may be due to a fixed influent no3 concentration allowing for greater removal of no3 mass compared to a scenario where influent no3 decreases with q particularly when warm temperatures and low to moderate flows can support very high res this analysis showed that assumptions about the dependence of influent no3 concentrations on q for the most part did not have a significant effect on model outcomes predictive modeling of no3 res during storm events remains a challenge given potential uncertainties around influent no3 concentrations during storms as noted above it is possible that removal rates could become no3 limited ghane et al 2015 kouanda and hua 2021 measured no3 profiles that were either under or overestimated by the model tended to occur during hydrological transitions fig s8 s9 in some cases better than expected no3 removal may be due to a dry wet transition in a portion of the woodchip matrix following a storm related increase in the water level this can significantly increase the saturated volume of the woodchip matrix supporting denitrification and previously unsaturated woodchips that had been exposed to air would most likely be better sources of bioavailable carbon due to greater lignocellulose degradation in the presence of oxygen maxwell et al 2019 mcguire et al 2021 2023 depending on the time of year storms can also lead to transient increases in water temperatures as shown in fig s8 there is prior evidence from our site that no3 removal rates are higher during storm events pluer et al 2019 and such dry wet transitions and transient temperature increases may provide explanations in other cases removal rates in the aftermath of storm events were overestimated by the model for reasons that remain unclear fig s9 modeling complex no3 transport and reaction dynamics in wbrs during storms or after abrupt changes in bioreactor water levels should be a priority for ongoing research on wbr systems an important insight of the synthetic discharge and daily no3 removal datasets is that low to moderate flows throughout warm summer months can lead to reasonably strong load reductions of 20 30 while no flow conditions during the summer can decrease load reductions since there is no flow during the periods when the reactor is most effective fig s11 while summers in central new york are expected to be wetter under climate warming the agricultural upper midwest region of the united states is expected to experience drier summers wuebbles et al 2017 it is therefore possible that the improvements in load reductions that we expect to occur at our site under climate warming may not translate in the upper midwest due to drier conditions and less flow during periods when denitrification rates are high 4 2 environmental implications probable impacts of climate change on the denitrification performance of wbrs via changes to temperature and precipitation patterns have been noted in prior studies and identified as a research priority fan et al 2022 this study integrates hydrological and biokinetic modeling to show that anticipated changes to water temperatures and precipitation patterns under climate warming will most likely improve the denitrification performance of our wbr study site with faster biokinetics under warmer temperatures outweighing any impact of shorter hrts resulting from intensified precipitation it should be noted that increased microbial activity under climate warming could also accelerate woodchip degradation and potentially decrease the lifetime of the woodchip media but further research is needed to assess this point because our model is trained with site specific weather discharge and no3 removal data it cannot be directly generalized to other wbr sites the temperature response curve of no3 removal rates is a particularly important parameter that varies widely between studies improved temperature dependence models that account for effects of variations in woodchip quality on temperature sensitivity are needed before a generalizable model for climate change impacts on wbr performance can be built however the framework developed here can be readily applied elsewhere provided the site specific temperature dependence of biokinetic rate constants and precipitation discharge relationships can be adequately parameterized many other nature based treatment technologies e g constructed wetlands stormwater detention basins similarly depend on temperature and hrt as controls on denitrification so the

14643,nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation aom is a microbial process of both ecological significance for global methane mitigation and application potential for wastewater treatment it is mediated by organisms belonging to the archaeal family candidatus methanoperedenaceae which have so far mainly been found in freshwater environments their potential distribution in saline environments and their physiological responses to salinity variation were still poorly understood in this study the responses of the freshwater candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens dominated consortium to different salinities were investigated using short and long term setups short term exposure to salt stress significantly affected nitrate reduction and methane oxidation activities over the tested concentration range of 15 200 nacl and ca m nitroreducens showed the higher tolerance to high salinity stress than its partner of anammox bacteria at high salinity concentration near marine conditions of 37 the target organism ca m nitroreducens showed stabilized nitrate reduction activity of 208 5 µmol day 1 gcdw 1 in long term bioreactors over 300 days in comparison to 362 9 and 334 3 µmol day 1 gcdw 1 under low salinity conditions 1 7 nacl and control conditions 15 nacl different partners of ca m nitroreducens evolved in the consortia with three different salinity conditions suggesting the different syntrophic mechanisms shaped by changes in salinity a new syntrophic relationship between ca m nitroreducens and fimicutes and or chloroflexi denitrifying populations was identified under the marine salinity condition metaproteomic analysis shows that the salinity changes lead to higher expression of response regulators and selective ion na h channeling proteins that can regulate the osmotic pressure between the cell and its environment the reverse methanogenesis pathway was however not impacted the finding of this study has important implications for the ecological distribution

analogues cai et al 2018 leu et al 2020 valenzuela et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the availability of electron acceptors shapes the diverse distribution of anme in different ecological systems where aom has been shown to be a primary mitigator for methane emissions in sub surfaces of both marine and freshwater environments hu et al 2014 myllykangas et al 2020 segarra et al 2013 most of the aforementioned electron acceptors are linked to aom in freshwater environments cai et al 2021 the range and diversity amongst freshwater ecosystems from lakes to wetlands from natural to anthropogenic systems widely allow for aom suitable conditions as one of the most prevalent electron acceptors for aom in freshwater systems the co presence of nitrate and methane often occurs due to anthropogenic influence e g fertiliser wash off into the water body shi et al 2017 nitrate dependent aom is microbiologically mediated by members of the archaeal family of ca methanoperedenaceae which have been discovered in diverse freshwater habitats gupta et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 schubert et al 2011 vaksmaa et al 2017 weber et al 2017 ca methanoperedenaceae has also been intensely investigated in anthropogenic freshwater niches for nitrogen removal in wastewater from both groundwater and wastewater treatment plants chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 luo et al 2018 van kessel et al 2018 increasing discoveries of nitrate dependent aom in marine ecosystems seem to dispute the crucial role of salinity as a differentiating factor in the distribution of ca methanoperedenaceae in freshwater and marine environments the first evidence for the existence of ca methanoperedenaceae in marine environments came through microbial community studies on sediments in an intertidal ecosystem as part of the east china sea although showing the lowest relative abundance compared to other anme anme 2d performing denitrifying aom is assumed to account for 65 5 of the total anaerobically oxidised methane wang et al 2019 further evidence came from a more recent study examining the role of nitrite nitrate dependent aom in deep sea cold seeps suggesting a potentially major methane sink jing et al 2020 in another microbial community survey ca methanoperedenaceae related sequences were found on authigenic carbonates in the atlantic and the pacific ocean suggesting a high metabolic flexibility beckmann et al 2021 this slowly appearing evidence suggests that the role of ca methanoperedenaceae in marine environments is still largely unexplored and their characteristic metabolism under high salinity conditions is yet unknown the oceanographic evidence also provides indication for the broader application opportunities of the nitrate dependent aom process in the treatment of saline wastewater often found in chemical pharmaceutical agricultural and aquacultural industries feng et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 however the effect of salinity on other nitrate dependent aom consortia linked to wastewater treatment processes has been sparsely investigated li et al 2022 apart from the haloduric physiology of ca methanoperedenaceae the potential distribution of nitrate dependent aom in saline environments would also be determined by the acclimation of their syntrophic partners to high salinity conditions ca methanoperedenaceae catalyze aom coupled to nitrate reduction to nitrite while their syntrophic partners play a nitrite scavenging role the commonly known partners of ca methanoperedenaceae include anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria and candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera belonging to the nc10 phylum the former reduces nitrite while simultaneously oxidizing ammonium while the latter reduces nitrite by deriving electrons from methane oxidation haroon et al 2013 due to the previously reported presence of some anammox species in marine environments e g scalindua species cai et al 2015 a syntrophic relationship between ca methanoperedenaceae and anammox may be possible in saline environments furthermore the adaptation of freshwater anammox bacteria to high salinities has been intensively investigated in relation to wastewater treatment showing that some species demonstrate resistance and tolerance to saline wastewater dapena mora et al 2010 jin et al 2012 kartal et al 2006 lin et al 2021a b these results provide promising support for a possible adaptation of syntrophic anme anammox consortia in saline wastewater applications the second known syntrophic partner ca methylomirabilis oxyfera has been found to exist in freshwater as well as marine environments conducting nitrite dependent aom he et al 2015a he et al 2015b a syntrophic relationship between ca methylomirabilis oxyfera and ca methanoperedenaceae may therefore be driving nitrate dependent aom in saline environments however whether a stable syntrophic relationship can be adapted to high salinity and how salinity variations affect the syntrophic relationship between ca methanoperedenaceae and different syntrophic partners are not yet clear a representative of the methanoperedenaceae family candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens was initially enriched from freshwater sediment hu et al 2009 a stable consortium mainly consisting of methane oxidizing archaeon ca m nitroreducens and anammox bacteria ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was enriched in stirred suspended biomass reactors through long term cultivation haroon et al 2013 in comparison to geochemical and genetic identification of nitrate dependent aom at high salinity conditions examinations in an enrichment culture allow for a more targeted investigation thus this study investigates the environmental factor salinity on this co culture by testing the effect on methane oxidation nitrate and ammonium removal and activities microbial community responses in terms of syntrophic relationship morphological changes and microbial pathway adaptations batch tests for short term changes after exposure and long term reactors were used and analysed using process parameter investigations microscopy imaging microbial community change and meta proteomic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 biomass and medium biomass used in the experiments was taken from an enrichment bioreactor dominated by ca m nitroreducens 30 together with the anammox bacterium ca k stuttgartiensis 5 cai et al 2019 zhang et al 2022b the volatile suspended solid vss concentration in the reactor was between 2 42 2 67 g l during the experiment period the reactor was operated in a sequencing batch reactor sbr mode with continuous magnetic stirring at 300 rpm a ph probe wd 59 001 65 oakton was installed to monitor ph in the reactor and ph was controlled between 7 0 and 7 5 through dosing of 1 m hcl solution the reactor was operated in a temperature controlled room 24 2 c a gas mixture ch4 n2 co2 90 5 5 coregas australia was used to flush the reactor weekly to provide both the energy and carbon sources the reactor was pressurized to 1 1 atm using the mixed gas after flushing nitrate and ammonium were also fed to the reactor weekly as substrates in the form of nano3 and nh4cl both maintaining concentrations between 7 1 and 14 2 mmol l 1 every two months the reactor was settled overnight and 20 volume of supernatant was exchanged with fresh medium the medium contained kh2po4 0 075 g l 1 cacl2 2h2o 0 3 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l 1 and other acidic and alkaline trace elements raghoebarsing et al 2006 supernatant and medium were removed or injected manually to ensure the culture and medium would not be exposed to air during the exchange as previously reported hu et al 2015 ca m nitroreducens coupled aom with nitrate reduction to nitrite while ca k stuttgartiensis reduced the nitrite formed to dinitrogen gas coupled to ammonium oxidation the ongoing feeding and consumption of the two main chemicals nano3 and nh4cl led to the accumulation of nacl with the periodic exchange of growth media the salinity in the reactor fluctuates between approximately 10 20 in steady state hence the reactor provided an ideal niche to understand the physiological effects of salinity on nitrate dependent aom by a methanoperedenaceae candidate 2 2 short term batch activity assays to assess the immediate response of the ca m nitroreducens dominated consortium to high salinity the activity at different salinity gradients was tested in batch incubations multiple activity assays were set up in three 37 ml serum bottles as biological replicates with 22 ml of biomass from the parent reactor as inoculum the use of an enriched culture adapted to 15 nacl allows for the investigation at significantly higher salinities nano3 and nh4cl were supplied in excess at 14 mmol l 1 and 10 mmol l 1 respectively the bottles were made anoxic with n2 gas before filling with biomass and sealed using a black butyl rubber stopper and crimp cap the biomass was then flushed with a mixed gas ch4 n2 co2 at a 90 5 5 ratio for 10 min to supply methane in excess the headspace was over pressurized via injection of 10 ml of the above mentioned ch4 gas mix to allow for sampling whilst retaining positive headspace pressure nacl was added to the serum bottle before filling with biomass to adjust the different salt concentrations of 37 52 105 196 a low salinity control was set up in parallel by removing salt from the biomass from the parent reactor to be specific biomass to be inoculated was firstly centrifuged 6000 g and resuspended with freshwater medium noted above which ended up with a low salinity of 1 7 2 3 long term incubation activity assays 2 3 1 high salinity reactor to verify if ca m nitroreducens adapts to high salinity metabolic activity was tested in long term incubations at a nacl concentration of 37 mimicking marine salt concentration a bioreactor of a total volume of 355 ml was inoculated with 250 ml biomass from a parent bioreactor and provided with 105 ml of headspace the inoculation biomass was centrifuged 6000 g resuspended in fresh medium and supplied with nacl to achieve a concentration of 37 2 3 2 low salinity reactor a reactor was set up with low salinity conditions to investigate the impact of low salinity compared to the original inoculum with a salinity of 10 20 a 1 l reactor was inoculated with 0 8 l of biomass centrifuged and resuspended with freshwater medium to achieve low salinity conditions 1 7 the larger size compared to the high salinity reactor was chosen due to the need for more biomass for additional metaproteomic analyses as further explained below this reactor was periodically fed with nh4no3 to avoid an increase of salinity 2 3 3 reactor operation both bioreactors were operated at identical conditions operational mode substrate concentration methane pressure temperature ph to the parent reactor as the control reactor as noted above for methane and nitrogen gas measurements gas samples were taken on 3 consecutive days every week following one of the two headspace flushes liquid samples were taken twice per week for nitrate nitrite ammonium and phosphate measurements nano3 and nh4cl were periodically added to the bioreactor with no3 being the sole electron acceptor for aom and nh4 being the electron donor for no2 removal by anammox bacteria 2 4 weeks of rates were averaged and plotted to display the long term performance of the bioreactors 2 4 chemical analysis liquid samples of 0 5 ml taken from the long term reactors and the batch reactors were immediately filtered 0 22 µm

concentrations were determined according to standard methods w rice and public health association 2012 and used to normalize for cell dry weight cdw for the analysis of the gas composition in the reactor headspace a 100 µl gas sample was taken with a gas tight glass syringe hamilton usa through a black rubber stopper the samples were immediately analysed using a gc 7890a agilent usa according to the method described by zhang et al zhang et al 2020 extracellular polymeric substance eps was analysed following the protocol published previously li and yang 2007 in short a heat extraction method was used to extract loosely bound eps lb eps at 50 c for 1 min and tightly bound eps tb eps at 60 c for 30 min after centrifugation the supernatant was analysed for protein content and toc as described by zhang et al zhang et al 2022a and polysaccharide content as published previously using the phenol sulfuric acid method and glucose as the standard kamlage 1994 2 5 mass and electron balance batch tests in serum bottles 37 ml were used to determine the rates of no3 reduction rno3 nh4 oxidation rnh4 n2 production rn2 and ch4 oxidation rch4 rates were calculated for the duration of the experiments via linear regression for ch4 and n2 their presence in both the gas and liquid phases calculated from gas phase concentrations using henry s law were considered in the rate calculation the nitrogen and electron balance were calculated based on the following two eqs 1 2 as explained previously haroon et al 2013 in short the nitrogen balance was calculated as the difference between the measured dinitrogen gas production rate and the sum of the measured ammonium and nitrate consumption rates rn2 n rnh4 n rno3 n the percentage error was calculated as the ratio between the nitrogen balance error and the measured dinitrogen gas production rate rn2 n rnh4 n rno3 n rn2 n the electron balance was calculated as the difference between the electrons required by reducing nitrate to dinitrogen gas and the electrons produced by ammonium oxidation to dinitrogen gas and methane oxidation to carbon dioxide 5 x rno3 3 x rnh4 8 x rch4 the percentage error was calculated as the ratio between the electron balance error and the electrons required by the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas 5 x rno3 3 x rnh4 8 x rch4 5 x rno3 1 1 32 no2 nh4 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 2 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2 h2o in the long term reactors mass and electron balances were done for the duration of stabilized performance from day 200 to day 300 rate of no3 reduction rno3 nh4 oxidation rnh4 n2 production rn2 and ch4 oxidation rch4 were calculated on a weekly basis via linear regression the average rate of each substance during this period was used for the mass and electron balances calculation according to protocols as noted above for short term batch assay to distinguish the contribution of anammox and other denitrifiers to nitrite removal under different salinities contributions of different players were calculated according to the stoichiometries of different potential reactions for nitrite reduction as summarized in supplementary material 2 6 transmission electron microscopy biomass samples were fixed by adding 5 glutaraldehyde ems grade in 25 mm hepes buffer ph 7 5 in a 1 1 volumetric ratio after fixation the slurry was centrifuged at 4 000x for 2 min and 8000x for 2 min

16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and analyses a biomass sample was taken from the inoculum after 121 and 279 days of operation in both the high salinity and the control reactor and after 143 and 276

through blast 2 8 proteomic analysis comparative metaproteomic analysis was conducted for long term operated reactors at three salinity conditions low salinity 1 7 moderate salinity 15 and high salinity condition 37 samples were taken after 250 days of operation using the protein discoverer software thermofisher and a database targeting only ca m nitroreducens it is possible to exclude other organisms from the analysis and generate statistically relevant abundance ratios comparing these three reactors samples were taken as analytical triplicates the protein quantities of key metabolic pathways in the high salinity reactor were compared to that in the low salinity reactor in the supplementary data comprehensive comparisons are shown with changes among three salinity conditions with

petersen et al 2021 sample preparation protein extraction analysis quantification library generation data acquisition and analysis were done as in peterson et al 2021 briefly outlined thawed cell

protein discoverer 2 4 1 15 software thermofisher was used to identify the proteins the mass tolerance values for precursor ions and fragment ions were set to 10 ppm and 0 05 da respectively 3 results 3 1 short term batch activity assay batch tests were performed to understand the initial effect of changing the salinity on a ca m nitroreducens dominated culture results from the batch tests served as experimental design parameters for the long term study i e the high salinity long term reactor at 37 fig 1 a summarises the batch test results showing a strong correlation between methane oxidation and nitrate reduction rates to different salt concentrations the control batch with unchanged inoculum from the parent reactor and the batch with low salinity show the highest performances both with a nitrate reduction rate of 0 47 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 microbial activity of ca m nitroreducens was observed at salinities as high as 105 but activity declined with increasing salinity fig 1b shows consistent no3 and nh4 reduction rates ch4 oxidation and n2 production for 3 biological replicates at near marine salinity of 37 over a 15 day period the no3 reduction rate at marine salinity conditions is about 38 lower and the methane oxidation rate is about 47 lower than the control batch a further increase of salinity to 52 and 105 led to decreased nitrate reduction activity of 0 2 and 0 06 mmol l 1d 1 g 1 cdw respectively at a salinity of 105 the no3 reduction rate dropped by over 87 indicating an immediate inhibitory effect an additional batch at a salinity of 196 showed no signs of denitrification or methane oxidation activity however indicators associated with cell lysis such as phosphate and ammonium increase were not detected mass and electron balancing support the evidence of nitrate dependent aom at different salinities table s1 the nitrogen balances close for all batch tests showing that the systems are closed based on eq 2 the stoichiometric rno3 rch4 ratio for nitrate dependent aom is 4 batch tests at 15 37 averaged rno3 rch4 ratios of 3 75 and 4 27 respectively indicating that nitrate reduction is fully coupled to methane oxidation batch tests at higher salinity 52 showed no2 accumulation and nitrate reduction mostly stopped at nitrite table s1 which indicated more sever inhibition on anammox reaction 3 2 long term bioreactor incubation process performance long term enrichment reactors were set up to investigate if ca m nitroreducens can sustainably survive at different salinities two reactors imitating saline conditions similar to marine high salinity reactor and freshwater low salinity reactor environments are compared to a control reactor with a salinity of 15 biomass in the control reactor can be expected to be adapted to these conditions through yearlong operation no3 reduction nh4 oxidation as well as ch4 oxidation were continuously observed throughout 300 days in all reactors fig 2 the high salinity reactor showed an initial drop in the first 150 days compared to the activity of the inoculum fig 2a following the drop the reactor activity stabilised just above 0 20 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 after 150 days of operation the low salinity reactor operated at a salinity of 1 7 initially showed a drop in nitrate reduction rate from 0 35 to approximate 0 25 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 in the first 3 month after 200 days of operation the performance increased before stabilizing around 0 34 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 the control reactor performed at a relatively consistent no3 reduction rate of around 0 33 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 throughout the entire duration except the fluctuation between day 80 and day 170 which was likely due to biomass sampling for different experiments nh4 oxidation was observed to occur in all bioreactors however it showed significantly different correlations with to nitrate reduction rates at different conditions in the control reactor despite of performance fluctuation the nh4 oxidation rate was always observed to match the no3 reduction rate fig 2c the average no3 reduction rate during the stabilised period 334 3 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 was quantitively 1 13 times the average nh4 oxidation rate 294 5 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 table 1 this correlation constant is consistent with the parent bioreactors operated at similar conditions in our previous studies zhang et al 2022a zhang et al 2022b further calculations showed that the observed nh4 oxidation can support 93 4 of the total nitrite produced through nitrate reduction table s2 revealing that anammox was the dominant support reaction for nitrite removal at a salinity of 15 in contrast the gap between no3 reduction and nh4 oxidation rates was found to be larger for both reactors mimicked marine and freshwater conditions in the low salinity reactor the nh4 oxidation rate aligned with the no3 reduction rate as both consistently experienced a drop for the first 100 days fig 1b continuing on the no3 reduction rate showed a steady increase while the nh4 oxidation rate stayed consistently low this resulted in the no3 reduction rate being 1 6 times higher than the nh4 oxidation rate 362 9 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 vs 229 6 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 during the period with stabilised performance table 1 further calculations showed that nitrite consumption attributable to anammox decreased to 67 1 as an adaptive response of the consortium to low salinity table s2 meanwhile the electron balance for this period table 1 suggested that no2 consumption was still coupled to ch4 oxidation through additional denitrifying microorganisms while the high salinity reactor showed a stable no3 reduction rate for the second half of operation the nh4 oxidation rate dropped further fig 2a the average no3 reduction rate after 200 days 208 5 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 was 1 4 times higher than the nh4 oxidation rate 87 9 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 corresponding to nitrite consumption by anammox of only 44 7 table s2 this also indicates new synergistic relationships between ca m nitroreducens and denitrifying members other than anammox in the community 3 3 microbial communities in long term reactors the microbial communities have been characterised by samples taken from inoculum and from each of the two experimental conditions after 4 and 9 months of reactor operation respectively fig 3 the control reactor showed a stable community with ch4 oxidizing archaeon ca m nitroreducens and anammox bacteria ca kuenenia being the dominant denitrifying organisms in the low salinity reactor ca m nitroreducens was also the dominant organism in the community though a significant drop to 10 8 was observed on day 143 which was probably due to the shock related to the significant salinity change it recovered to the 24 1 percentage which is comparable to the inoculum 25 5 suggesting the acclimation of ca m nitroreducens to the salinity change ca kuenenia co existed alongside ca m nitroreducens however its proportion in the community 1 9 and 2 5 on day 143 and 276 respectively was lower than that in the control reactor interestingly in contrast to the absence of ca methylomirabilis in the control reactor growth from 1 2 on day 143 to 15 2 on day 276 was seen in the low salinity reactor increasing the salinity also led to a microbial community shift over the long term operation ca m nitroreducens stayed the most dominant organism in the community though the conditions seemed to affect its survival seen in the drop on day 121 further operation to day 279 showed a slight increase which may indicate the gradual adaption of ca m nitroreducens to high salinity condition the change of ca m nitroreducens was coherent with the variation of no3 reduction rate which experienced steady decrease before stabilizing fig 2a reflecting the strong decrease of nh4 oxidation fig 2a ca kuenenia also showed a quick drop to only 0 8 on day 121 and ended with 2 in the late operational stage on day 279 by contrast two members affiliated to the phylum of firmicutes were enriched one unclassified firmicutes member was enriched to 8 6 and 5 7 while another firmicutes member of limnochorda represented 2 7 and 3 5 of the taxa for day 121 and 279 respectively except for firmicutes two members belonging to chloroflexi i e sbr1031 and kd4 96 were also enriched in comparison to the inoculum each accounting for 1 9 and 7 5 6 2 and 4 3 on day 121 and 279 respectively 3 4 long term reactor microscopic analysis tem imaging of culture in the high salinity low salinity and control reactors was performed to see if cell shrinkage lysis or the accumulation of structure forming storage compounds could be observed the change of salinity and its physical effect on microorganisms can often be observed in cell morphologies the ionic and osmotic pressure can cause cells to shrink or expand depending on their coping mechanisms and tolerability towards salt stress while higher salt concentrations increase the osmotic potential microorganisms without a compensation mechanism are vulnerable to plasmolysis martin et al 1999 fig 4 shows the ca m nitroreducens dominated mixed cultures at different conditions while most anme is known to form clusters mcglynn et al 2018 some planktonic cells can also be observed samples taken from the control reactor show a large cell cluster fig 4a with only a few cells that store granules fig 4b ca m nitroreducens cells present a similarly large cluster in the high salinity reactor fig 4c showing some cell shrinkage producing a gap between the inner and outer membrane shrinkage can be more clearly seen in the single cell fig 4 d none of the cells in the images of the high salinity reactor can be seen to store granules cells from the low salinity reactor don t form the typical clusters fig 4e while they were located close to each other and were identifiable due to their size and shape most ca m nitroreducens cells in the low salinity reactor seem to be filled with intracellular storage granules fig 4 e and f these granules have previously been reported to be polyhydroxybutyrate phb through combining microscopy and phb staining cai et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a alongside the observed cell shrinkage in the high salinity reactor imaging gives a qualitative indication for higher extracellular polymeric substance eps concentrations loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted from the high salinity low salinity and control reactor with quantitative results presented in fig s1 overall protein was the dominant component of the eps for all salinity conditions the high salinity and low salinity bioreactors had the same level of lb eps which was around twice of lb eps in the control reactor meanwhile approximately twice higher tb eps was recognised under the high salinity condition compared to the that in other two salinities lb eps was similar for both reactors additional eps formation has been recognised as a fundamental microbial adaptation to salinity stress to keep stability saha et al 2020 wang et al 2013 the increase of tb eps in the high salinity reactor indicates that it may be a stress response and further a protective measure 3 5 metaproteomic analysis of salinity effect comparative metaproteomic analysis was conducted for the cultures at the high and low salinity condition to identify the impact of salinity on the methane oxidation pathway and investigate possible stress response mechanisms after 250 days of operation samples were taken and analysed for their protein expressions all proteins involved in the reverse methanogenesis pathway were found in a quantitative comparative study between the high and low salinity reactor fig 5 shows the reverse methanogenesis pathway with the abundance ratio for the proteins involved to compare the high salinity short term low salinity extension reactor a list of the proteins their log2 values adjusted adj p values and further comparisons between the control and the experimental reactors can be seen in the fig s2 all proteins needed for methane oxidation showed adj p values of over 0 05 suggesting no statistically significant difference between both conditions this finding confirms the process observations made for ch4 oxidation and nitrate reduction rates which only differed 30 50 in both reactors see fig 2 no obvious response mechanism was identifiable in the comparison between both conditions however comparing the well acclimatised control reactor separately to both experimental reactors provide more information on possible adaptations this comparison shows a strong overexpression of a response regulator which indicates a stress feedback mechanism abundance ratios between the low salinity reactor versus control reactor and high salinity reactor versus control reactor are 50 2 and 13 3 adj p value 0 05 respectively the na h antiporter enzyme mnh seemed to be a key protein responding to ionic pressure in ca m nitroreducens as these selective channels allow for a rebalance of ionic potential brett et al 2005 warnau et al 2020 the abundance ratios correlating to the response regulator show ratios of 56 5 and 85 0 adj p value 0 05 for the low salinity reactor versus the control reactor and high salinity reactor versus the control reactor respectively another typical response to higher osmotic pressure is the accumulation of osmolytes which can neither be seen in protein expression nor tem imaging for the high salinity reactor surprisingly the opposite is true for the low salt environment tem imaging shows granules that can be seen in many ca m nitroreducens these intracellular storage granules in ca m nitroreducens has previously been shown to be phb cai et al 2019 4 discussion results from this study clearly show that nitrate dependent aom performing organisms ca m nitroreducens can adapt to saline environments stable activity at 37 demonstrated that survival of these microorganisms is possible in marine ecosystems while the initial response to higher salinity might cause a significant activity decrease as seen in the short term batch tests in the long term reduced activity persists ionic pumps and stress regulators have been shown to help organisms react to changing environments 4 1 salinity variations shape different syntrophs in the consortium for nitrate dependent aom besides the performance variations caused by different salinities this study also demonstrates that different syntrophic patterns have evolved in the consortium under different salinity conditions under the salinity of 15 nacl as our previous study haroon et al 2013 nc10 population was outcompeted by ca kuenenia as the community did not show the presence of ca methylomirabilis fig 3 metatranscriptomic resolution in our previous study suggested that the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between ca m nitroreducens and other denitrifying populations in the consortium via multi heme cytochromes could be another mechanism under this salinity condition simon et al 2022 this could be an explanation for the remaining unknown 6 6 of nitrite reduced table s2 rate profile and balance evaluation demonstrated that the anammox reaction is the dominant driver for nitrite removal thus synergetic interaction between ca m nitroreducens and ca kuenenia is the main mechanism for nitrate dependent aom with salinity of 15 nacl fig 6 a under the low salinity condition both ca kuenenia and nc10 ca methylomirabilis co exist with ca m nitroreducens in high abundance the lower relative abundance of ca kuenenia was in line with the declined nh4 oxidation rate in the low salinity reactor when compared to the control reactor fig 2b c table 1 the presence of ca methylomirabilis suggests being responsible for the lack of no2 accumulation while its reduction attributable to anammox declined the electron balance of the ongoing no3 reduction further supports the active role of ca methylomirabilis in the consortium for nitrite dependent aom table 1 and s2 as the community did not see an enrichment of other denitrifying microorganisms fig 4 the synergetic interaction between ca m nitroreducens and both ca kuenenia and nc10 provides the foundation for nitrate dependent aom at low salinity of 1 7 nacl in this scenario ca kuenenia and nc10 were estimated to contribute 67 1 and 32 9 respectively to reduce the nitrite produced by ca m nitroreducens fig 6b under high salinity conditions ca kuenenia still plays a synergetic role however attributing to only 44 7 of the remaining nitrite removal fig 6c although halophilic marine nc10 bacteria has been widely reported he et al 2015a zhu et al 2012 surprisingly no halophilic nc10 species were enriched under high salinity conditions instead the community in the high salinity reactor was shaped by the enrichment of several other populations belonging to fermicutes and chloroflexi denitrifying representatives of fermicutes were previously isolated from active sludge heylen et al 2006b with some strains containing nitrite reductase genes heylen et al 2006a the enrichment of fermicutes members was indicative of the potential denitrifying role of firmicutes enriched in the consortium as a partner of ca m nitroreducens under high salinity condition a recent study found that in a marine niche featuring nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor ca methanoperedens and firmicutes co existed with high abundance beckmann et al 2021 this finding reconciles with the community evolution under marine mimicked salinity condition in this study supporting the hypothetic partnership between ca m nitroreducens and firmicutes for nitrate dependent aom at high salinity for enriched chloroflexi species both sbr1031 and kd4 94 were reported to be functionally related to denitrification sun and zhu 2022 tao et al 2022 van landuyt et al 2021 zuo et al 2020 which also indicates their synergistic roles with ca m nitroreducens thus the remaining 55 3 of nitrite reduced in the high salinity reactor was likely achieved by the salinity adapted denitrifying populations of firmicutes and chloroflexi fig 6c however unlike nc10 species which has the ch4 metabolising pathway it is unknown how firmicutes and chloroflexi derive electrons from ch4 for denitrification a logical hypothesis is that they can directly receive electrons from ca m nitroreducens via uncharacterized extracellular electron pathways fig 6c papers reporting that firmicutes and chloroflexi representatives can use poised electrodes as the electron donor for denitrification seem to support this hypothetic pattern lee et al 2013 sun and zhu 2022 further as the consortium was found to produce extraordinarily high amounts of eps under the high salinity condition fig s1 it is possible that the degradation of eps might provide intermediates as the electron donor for denitrification by firmicutes and chloroflexi zhang et al 2022a further transcriptomic investigation is warranted to verify either electron transfer mechanism between ca m nitroreducens and firmicutes or chloroflexi 4 2 implication for the ecological distribution of nitrate dependent aom in marine environments nitrate dependent aom has primarily been found in freshwater ecosystems cai et al 2021 the results from this study suggest that ca methanoperedenaceae can adapt to actively couple denitrification to aom at a salinity similar to marine environments this was demonstrated through all involved reactions methane oxidation nitrate reduction and dinitrogen gas production the osmoregulatory strategy of ca methanoperedenaceae for high salinity adaptation and the novel syntrophic relationship identified between ca methanoperedenaceae and new putative nitrite reducers supported the extrapolation of existence of nitrate dependent aom in marine environments it indicates that nitrate dependent aom has so far been overlooked in marine environments which has implications for the methane and nitrogen cycle in marine waters with methane in abundance and nitrate possibly produced locally via microbially driven processes such as nitrogen fixation and nitrification thermodynamic feasibility would allow nitrate dependent aom to contribute to methane mitigation in marine environments meanwhile increase of anthropogenic eutrophication in ocean yalçın et al 2017 especially in coastal surface sediments could lead to favourable niches for nitrate dependent aom mcra gene sequences closely related to ca methanoperedenaceae have been detected in the atlantic and the pacific ocean with apparent disconnect to srb due to the lack of srb and the presence of nitrate it was inferred that ca methanoperedenaceae performing nitrate dependent aom might be present beckmann et al 2021 case et al 2015 our study here for the first time shows the physiological evidence for the potential distribution of nitrate dependent aom in marine environments it is noteworthy that the described natural community reported by beckmann et al 2021 for putative nitrate dependent aom in the atlantic and the pacific ocean shows strong similarities to the community in our artificial enrichment bioreactor simulating a marine condition as both contain large amounts of firmicutes and alpha and gammaproteobacteria accompanying ca methanoperedenaceae this coincidence suggests a new syntrophy featured in a marine consortium possibly distinguishing itself from all previously reported freshwater consortia for nitrate dependent aom this finding may have significant implications for the specificity of this process in marine environments 4 3 impact of salinity on the application of nitrate dependent aom the thermodynamic phenomenon of aom has sparked the creativity of many researchers to find potential industrial applications one that came up early in the discovery process is wastewater treatment this might be because some anme have been enriched from wastewater treatment sludge hu et al 2009 or that the combination of anammox bacteria with nitrate dependent aom creates a novel denitrification pathway with promising potential haroon et al 2013 advantages such as reducing aeration requirements and simultaneous reduction of a harmful greenhouse gas methane with the removal of the key eutrophication causing nutrient nitrogen to support this proposed technology on the other hand many unknown factors such as the type of system to deliver gaseous carbon sources to the microbial community contamination potential and further microbial competition need to be assessed systems such as hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactors have the potential to deliver ch4 as the electron donor to the microbial community cai et al 2015 the application of anammox is making significant progress in wastewater treatment with studies looking into many aspects of the science and technology behind the process cho et al 2020 salinity has become a factor of interest mostly in wastewater treatment facilities in coastal cities to reduce freshwater consumption some initiatives foresee the use of seawater for toilet flushing and other applications with lower water quality requirements another issue will be climate change induced sea level rise which will significantly influence coastal wastewater treatment systems hummel et al 2018 liu et al 2016 the effect of salinity on anammox organisms lin et al 2020 and ca m oxyfera he et al 2015a he et al 2015b has been well studied leaving ca m nitroreducens as a single functional organism in this consortium underexplored in order to progress with the development of a nitrogen based aom and anammox process in wastewater treatment this study provides further knowledge on the salinity effect on ca m nitroreducens similar to ca kuenenia there was no negative impact of salinity observable on ca m nitroreducens under a salt concentration of 15 this means that for minor usage and introduction of seawater into the sewer system in coastal regions or industrial regions that produce saline wastewater the use of ca m nitroreducens in the treatment process would still be possible if the total salinity stays below 15 in extreme conditions e g climate change caused seawater rise and flooding of wastewater treatment plants near the ocean even high salinity conditions of up to 35 would not mean a complete stop of biological activity however reduced activity of both ca m nitroreducens and ca kuenenia would require major process adjustments to compensate for the slower rates moreover our results indicated ca m nitroreducens seemed to be more tolerant to high salinity than ca kuenenia and it can form new interactions with halophilic denitrifiers as an adaptive response to compensate for the more severe inhibition on nitrite removal by ca kuenenia 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the effect of salinity on a freshwater derived nitrate reducing and methane oxidizing consortium short term batch tests showed the no3 reduction rate at marine salinity conditions is about 38 lower and the methane oxidation rate is about 47 lower than the control batch with the salinity of 15 salinity of 52 completely inhibited the anammox reaction for nitrite reduction and at a salinity of 105 no3 reduction by ca m nitroreducens was reduced by over 87 long term incubation showed adaptive traits of ca m nitroreducens in saline environments no3 reduction after long term adaption under marine salinity stabilised at an average rate of 208 5 µmol day 1 gcdw 1 versus that of 362 9 and 334 3 µmol day 1 gcdw 1 under freshwater salinity conditions 1 7 nacl and control conditions 15 nacl though anammox activity was more severely suppressed under marine salinity firmicutes and chloroflexi populations evolved as putative denitrifying partners to contribute 55 3 to nitrite removal under this salinity to compensate for the mismatched anammox and nitrate reduction activity the evolution of new additional denitrifiers for nitrite scavenging was also found for freshwater salinity condition in which another denitrifying partners such as nc10 had contributed around 32 9 to the

14643,nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation aom is a microbial process of both ecological significance for global methane mitigation and application potential for wastewater treatment it is mediated by organisms belonging to the archaeal family candidatus methanoperedenaceae which have so far mainly been found in freshwater environments their potential distribution in saline environments and their physiological responses to salinity variation were still poorly understood in this study the responses of the freshwater candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens dominated consortium to different salinities were investigated using short and long term setups short term exposure to salt stress significantly affected nitrate reduction and methane oxidation activities over the tested concentration range of 15 200 nacl and ca m nitroreducens showed the higher tolerance to high salinity stress than its partner of anammox bacteria at high salinity concentration near marine conditions of 37 the target organism ca m nitroreducens showed stabilized nitrate reduction activity of 208 5 µmol day 1 gcdw 1 in long term bioreactors over 300 days in comparison to 362 9 and 334 3 µmol day 1 gcdw 1 under low salinity conditions 1 7 nacl and control conditions 15 nacl different partners of ca m nitroreducens evolved in the consortia with three different salinity conditions suggesting the different syntrophic mechanisms shaped by changes in salinity a new syntrophic relationship between ca m nitroreducens and fimicutes and or chloroflexi denitrifying populations was identified under the marine salinity condition metaproteomic analysis shows that the salinity changes lead to higher expression of response regulators and selective ion na h channeling proteins that can regulate the osmotic pressure between the cell and its environment the reverse methanogenesis pathway was however not impacted the finding of this study has important implications for the ecological distribution of the nitrate dependent aom process in marine environments and the potential of this biotechnological process for the treatment of high salinity industrial wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic oxidation of methane aom candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens anammox salinity nitrate dependent aom syntrophic relationship data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic oxidation of methane aom performed by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme contributes significantly to the mitigation of the greenhouse gas methane ch4 from subsurface environments cai et al 2021 the aom process oxidises methane to the less potent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2 while reducing suitable electron acceptors a large variety of potential electron acceptors has been explored out of which many have been found to co exist with methane in both natural and anthropogenic environments zhang et al 2021 the predominant electron acceptors so far reported include sulfate bhattarai et al 2019 followed by nitrate haroon et al 2013 nitrite ettwig et al 2010 fe iii cai et al 2018 mn iv leu et al 2020 as well as humic acid and its analogues cai et al 2018 leu et al 2020 valenzuela et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the availability of electron acceptors shapes the diverse distribution of anme in different ecological systems where aom has been shown to be a primary mitigator for methane emissions in sub surfaces of both marine and freshwater environments hu et al 2014 myllykangas et al 2020 segarra et al 2013 most of the aforementioned electron acceptors are linked to aom in freshwater environments cai et al 2021 the range and diversity amongst freshwater ecosystems from lakes to wetlands from natural to anthropogenic systems widely allow for aom suitable conditions as one of the most prevalent electron acceptors for aom in freshwater systems the co presence of nitrate and methane often occurs due to anthropogenic influence e g fertiliser wash off into the water body shi et al 2017 nitrate dependent aom is microbiologically mediated by members of the archaeal family of ca methanoperedenaceae which have been discovered in diverse freshwater habitats gupta et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 schubert et al 2011 vaksmaa et al 2017 weber et al 2017 ca methanoperedenaceae has also been intensely investigated in anthropogenic freshwater niches for nitrogen removal in wastewater from both groundwater and wastewater treatment plants chen et al 2020 liu et al 2019 luo et al 2018 van kessel et al 2018 increasing discoveries of nitrate dependent aom in marine ecosystems seem to dispute the crucial role of salinity as a differentiating factor in the distribution of ca methanoperedenaceae in freshwater and marine environments the first evidence for the existence of ca methanoperedenaceae in marine environments came through microbial community studies on sediments in an intertidal ecosystem as part of the east china sea although showing the lowest relative abundance compared to other anme anme 2d performing denitrifying aom is assumed to account for 65 5 of the total anaerobically oxidised methane wang et al 2019 further evidence came from a more recent study examining the role of nitrite nitrate dependent aom in deep sea cold seeps suggesting a potentially major methane sink jing et al 2020 in another microbial community survey ca methanoperedenaceae related sequences were found on authigenic carbonates in the atlantic and the pacific ocean suggesting a high metabolic flexibility beckmann et al 2021 this slowly appearing evidence suggests that the role of ca methanoperedenaceae in marine environments is still largely unexplored and their characteristic metabolism under high salinity conditions is yet unknown the oceanographic evidence also provides indication for the broader application opportunities of the nitrate dependent aom process in the treatment of saline wastewater often found in chemical pharmaceutical agricultural and aquacultural industries feng et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 however the effect of salinity on other nitrate dependent aom consortia linked to wastewater treatment processes has been sparsely investigated li et al 2022 apart from the haloduric physiology of ca methanoperedenaceae the potential distribution of nitrate dependent aom in saline environments would also be determined by the acclimation of their syntrophic partners to high salinity conditions ca methanoperedenaceae catalyze aom coupled to nitrate reduction to nitrite while their syntrophic partners play a nitrite scavenging role the commonly known partners of ca methanoperedenaceae include anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria and candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera belonging to the nc10 phylum the former reduces nitrite while simultaneously oxidizing ammonium while the latter reduces nitrite by deriving electrons from methane oxidation haroon et al 2013 due to the previously reported presence of some anammox species in marine environments e g scalindua species cai et al 2015 a syntrophic relationship between ca methanoperedenaceae and anammox may be possible in saline environments furthermore the adaptation of freshwater anammox bacteria to high salinities has been intensively investigated in relation to wastewater treatment showing that some species demonstrate resistance and tolerance to saline wastewater dapena mora et al 2010 jin et al 2012 kartal et al 2006 lin et al 2021a b these results provide promising support for a possible adaptation of syntrophic anme anammox consortia in saline wastewater applications the second known syntrophic partner ca methylomirabilis oxyfera has been found to exist in freshwater as well as marine environments conducting nitrite dependent aom he et al 2015a he et al 2015b a syntrophic relationship between ca methylomirabilis oxyfera and ca methanoperedenaceae may therefore be driving nitrate dependent aom in saline environments however whether a stable syntrophic relationship can be adapted to high salinity and how salinity variations affect the syntrophic relationship between ca methanoperedenaceae and different syntrophic partners are not yet clear a representative of the methanoperedenaceae family candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens was initially enriched from freshwater sediment hu et al 2009 a stable consortium mainly consisting of methane oxidizing archaeon ca m nitroreducens and anammox bacteria ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis was enriched in stirred suspended biomass reactors through long term cultivation haroon et al 2013 in comparison to geochemical and genetic identification of nitrate dependent aom at high salinity conditions examinations in an enrichment culture allow for a more targeted investigation thus this study investigates the environmental factor salinity on this co culture by testing the effect on methane oxidation nitrate and ammonium removal and activities microbial community responses in terms of syntrophic relationship morphological changes and microbial pathway adaptations batch tests for short term changes after exposure and long term reactors were used and analysed using process parameter investigations microscopy imaging microbial community change and meta proteomic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 biomass and medium biomass used in the experiments was taken from an enrichment bioreactor dominated by ca m nitroreducens 30 together with the anammox bacterium ca k stuttgartiensis 5 cai et al 2019 zhang et al 2022b the volatile suspended solid vss concentration in the reactor was between 2 42 2 67 g l during the experiment period the reactor was operated in a sequencing batch reactor sbr mode with continuous magnetic stirring at 300 rpm a ph probe wd 59 001 65 oakton was installed to monitor ph in the reactor and ph was controlled between 7 0 and 7 5 through dosing of 1 m hcl solution the reactor was operated in a temperature controlled room 24 2 c a gas mixture ch4 n2 co2 90 5 5 coregas australia was used to flush the reactor weekly to provide both the energy and carbon sources the reactor was pressurized to 1 1 atm using the mixed gas after flushing nitrate and ammonium were also fed to the reactor weekly as substrates in the form of nano3 and nh4cl both maintaining concentrations between 7 1 and 14 2 mmol l 1 every two months the reactor was settled overnight and 20 volume of supernatant was exchanged with fresh medium the medium contained kh2po4 0 075 g l 1 cacl2 2h2o 0 3 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l 1 and other acidic and alkaline trace elements raghoebarsing et al 2006 supernatant and medium were removed or injected manually to ensure the culture and medium would not be exposed to air during the exchange as previously reported hu et al 2015 ca m nitroreducens coupled aom with nitrate reduction to nitrite while ca k stuttgartiensis reduced the nitrite formed to dinitrogen gas coupled to ammonium oxidation the ongoing feeding and consumption of the two main chemicals nano3 and nh4cl led to the accumulation of nacl with the periodic exchange of growth media the salinity in the reactor fluctuates between approximately 10 20 in steady state hence the reactor provided an ideal niche to understand the physiological effects of salinity on nitrate dependent aom by a methanoperedenaceae candidate 2 2 short term batch activity assays to assess the immediate response of the ca m nitroreducens dominated consortium to high salinity the activity at different salinity gradients was tested in batch incubations multiple activity assays were set up in three 37 ml serum bottles as biological replicates with 22 ml of biomass from the parent reactor as inoculum the use of an enriched culture adapted to 15 nacl allows for the investigation at significantly higher salinities nano3 and nh4cl were supplied in excess at 14 mmol l 1 and 10 mmol l 1 respectively the bottles were made anoxic with n2 gas before filling with biomass and sealed using a black butyl rubber stopper and crimp cap the biomass was then flushed with a mixed gas ch4 n2 co2 at a 90 5 5 ratio for 10 min to supply methane in excess the headspace was over pressurized via injection of 10 ml of the above mentioned ch4 gas mix to allow for sampling whilst retaining positive headspace pressure nacl was added to the serum bottle before filling with biomass to adjust the different salt concentrations of 37 52 105 196 a low salinity control was set up in parallel by removing salt from the biomass from the parent reactor to be specific biomass to be inoculated was firstly centrifuged 6000 g and resuspended with freshwater medium noted above which ended up with a low salinity of 1 7 2 3 long term incubation activity assays 2 3 1 high salinity reactor to verify if ca m nitroreducens adapts to high salinity metabolic activity was tested in long term incubations at a nacl concentration of 37 mimicking marine salt concentration a bioreactor of a total volume of 355 ml was inoculated with 250 ml biomass from a parent bioreactor and provided with 105 ml of headspace the inoculation biomass was centrifuged 6000 g resuspended in fresh medium and supplied with nacl to achieve a concentration of 37 2 3 2 low salinity reactor a reactor was set up with low salinity conditions to investigate the impact of low salinity compared to the original inoculum with a salinity of 10 20 a 1 l reactor was inoculated with 0 8 l of biomass centrifuged and resuspended with freshwater medium to achieve low salinity conditions 1 7 the larger size compared to the high salinity reactor was chosen due to the need for more biomass for additional metaproteomic analyses as further explained below this reactor was periodically fed with nh4no3 to avoid an increase of salinity 2 3 3 reactor operation both bioreactors were operated at identical conditions operational mode substrate concentration methane pressure temperature ph to the parent reactor as the control reactor as noted above for methane and nitrogen gas measurements gas samples were taken on 3 consecutive days every week following one of the two headspace flushes liquid samples were taken twice per week for nitrate nitrite ammonium and phosphate measurements nano3 and nh4cl were periodically added to the bioreactor with no3 being the sole electron acceptor for aom and nh4 being the electron donor for no2 removal by anammox bacteria 2 4 weeks of rates were averaged and plotted to display the long term performance of the bioreactors 2 4 chemical analysis liquid samples of 0 5 ml taken from the long term reactors and the batch reactors were immediately filtered 0 22 µm

concentrations were determined according to standard methods w rice and public health association 2012 and used to normalize for cell dry weight cdw for the analysis of the gas composition in the reactor headspace a 100 µl gas sample was taken with a gas tight glass syringe hamilton usa through a black rubber stopper the samples were immediately analysed using a gc 7890a agilent usa according to the method described by zhang et al zhang et al 2020 extracellular polymeric substance eps was analysed following the protocol published previously li and yang 2007 in short a heat extraction method was used to extract loosely bound eps lb eps at 50 c for 1 min and tightly bound eps tb eps at 60 c for 30 min after centrifugation the supernatant was analysed for protein content and toc as described by zhang et al zhang et al 2022a and polysaccharide content as published previously using the phenol sulfuric acid method and glucose as the standard kamlage 1994 2 5 mass and electron balance batch tests in serum bottles 37 ml were used to determine the rates of no3 reduction rno3 nh4 oxidation rnh4 n2 production rn2 and ch4 oxidation rch4 rates were calculated for the duration of the experiments via linear regression for ch4 and n2 their presence in both the gas and liquid phases calculated from gas phase concentrations using henry s law were considered in the rate calculation the nitrogen and electron balance were calculated based on the following two eqs 1 2 as explained previously haroon et al 2013 in short the nitrogen balance was calculated as the difference between the measured dinitrogen gas production rate and the sum of the measured ammonium and nitrate consumption rates rn2 n rnh4 n rno3 n the percentage error was calculated as the ratio between the nitrogen balance error and the measured dinitrogen gas production rate rn2 n rnh4 n rno3 n rn2 n the electron balance was calculated as the difference between the electrons required by reducing nitrate to dinitrogen gas and the electrons produced by ammonium oxidation to dinitrogen gas and methane oxidation to carbon dioxide 5 x rno3 3 x rnh4 8 x rch4 the percentage error was calculated as the ratio between the electron balance error and the electrons required by the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas 5 x rno3 3 x rnh4 8 x rch4 5 x rno3 1 1 32 no2 nh4 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 2 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2 h2o in the long term reactors mass and electron balances were done for the duration of stabilized performance from day 200 to day 300 rate of no3 reduction rno3 nh4 oxidation rnh4 n2 production rn2 and ch4 oxidation rch4 were calculated on a weekly basis via linear regression the average rate of each substance during this period was used for the mass and electron balances calculation according to protocols as noted above for short term batch assay to distinguish the contribution of anammox and other denitrifiers to nitrite removal under different salinities contributions of different players were calculated according to the stoichiometries of different potential reactions for nitrite reduction as summarized in supplementary material 2 6 transmission electron microscopy biomass samples were fixed by adding 5 glutaraldehyde ems grade in 25 mm hepes buffer ph 7 5 in a 1 1 volumetric ratio after fixation the slurry was centrifuged at 4 000x for 2 min and 8000x for 2 min

3 1 short term batch activity assay batch tests were performed to understand the initial effect of changing the salinity on a ca m nitroreducens dominated culture results from the batch tests served as experimental design parameters for the long term study i e the high salinity long term reactor at 37 fig 1 a summarises the batch test results showing a strong correlation between methane oxidation and nitrate reduction rates to different salt concentrations the control batch with unchanged inoculum from the parent reactor and the batch with low salinity show the highest performances both with a nitrate reduction rate of 0 47 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 microbial activity of ca m nitroreducens was observed at salinities as high as 105 but activity declined with increasing salinity fig 1b shows consistent no3 and nh4 reduction rates ch4 oxidation and n2 production for 3 biological replicates at near marine salinity of 37 over a 15 day period the no3 reduction rate at marine salinity conditions is about 38 lower and the methane oxidation rate is about 47 lower than the control batch a further increase of salinity to 52 and 105 led to decreased nitrate reduction activity of 0 2 and 0 06 mmol l 1d 1 g 1 cdw respectively at a salinity of 105 the no3 reduction rate dropped by over 87 indicating an immediate inhibitory effect an additional batch at a salinity of 196 showed no signs of denitrification or methane oxidation activity however indicators associated with cell lysis such as phosphate and ammonium increase were not detected mass and electron balancing support the evidence of nitrate dependent aom at different salinities table s1 the nitrogen balances close for all batch tests showing that the systems are closed based on eq 2 the stoichiometric rno3 rch4 ratio for nitrate dependent aom is 4 batch tests at 15 37 averaged rno3 rch4 ratios of 3 75 and 4 27 respectively indicating that nitrate reduction is fully coupled to methane oxidation batch tests at higher salinity 52 showed no2 accumulation and nitrate reduction mostly stopped at nitrite table s1 which indicated more sever inhibition on anammox reaction 3 2 long term bioreactor incubation process performance long term enrichment reactors were set up to investigate if ca m nitroreducens can sustainably survive at different salinities two reactors imitating saline conditions similar to marine high salinity reactor and freshwater low salinity reactor environments are compared to a control reactor with a salinity of 15 biomass in the control reactor can be expected to be adapted to these conditions through yearlong operation no3 reduction nh4 oxidation as well as ch4 oxidation were continuously observed throughout 300 days in all reactors fig 2 the high salinity reactor showed an initial drop in the first 150 days compared to the activity of the inoculum fig 2a following the drop the reactor activity stabilised just above 0 20 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 after 150 days of operation the low salinity reactor operated at a salinity of 1 7 initially showed a drop in nitrate reduction rate from 0 35 to approximate 0 25 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 in the first 3 month after 200 days of operation the performance increased before stabilizing around 0 34 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 the control reactor performed at a relatively consistent no3 reduction rate of around 0 33 mmol l 1d 1 g cdw 1 throughout the entire duration except the fluctuation between day 80 and day 170 which was likely due to biomass sampling for different experiments nh4 oxidation was observed to occur in all bioreactors however it showed significantly different correlations with to nitrate reduction rates at different conditions in the control reactor despite of performance fluctuation the nh4 oxidation rate was always observed to match the no3 reduction rate fig 2c the average no3 reduction rate during the stabilised period 334 3 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 was quantitively 1 13 times the average nh4 oxidation rate 294 5 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 table 1 this correlation constant is consistent with the parent bioreactors operated at similar conditions in our previous studies zhang et al 2022a zhang et al 2022b further calculations showed that the observed nh4 oxidation can support 93 4 of the total nitrite produced through nitrate reduction table s2 revealing that anammox was the dominant support reaction for nitrite removal at a salinity of 15 in contrast the gap between no3 reduction and nh4 oxidation rates was found to be larger for both reactors mimicked marine and freshwater conditions in the low salinity reactor the nh4 oxidation rate aligned with the no3 reduction rate as both consistently experienced a drop for the first 100 days fig 1b continuing on the no3 reduction rate showed a steady increase while the nh4 oxidation rate stayed consistently low this resulted in the no3 reduction rate being 1 6 times higher than the nh4 oxidation rate 362 9 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 vs 229 6 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 during the period with stabilised performance table 1 further calculations showed that nitrite consumption attributable to anammox decreased to 67 1 as an adaptive response of the consortium to low salinity table s2 meanwhile the electron balance for this period table 1 suggested that no2 consumption was still coupled to ch4 oxidation through additional denitrifying microorganisms while the high salinity reactor showed a stable no3 reduction rate for the second half of operation the nh4 oxidation rate dropped further fig 2a the average no3 reduction rate after 200 days 208 5 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 was 1 4 times higher than the nh4 oxidation rate 87 9 µmol d 1 g cdw 1 corresponding to nitrite consumption by anammox of only 44 7 table s2 this also indicates new synergistic relationships between ca m nitroreducens and denitrifying members other than anammox in the community 3 3 microbial communities in long term reactors the microbial communities have been characterised by samples taken from inoculum and from each of the two experimental conditions after 4 and 9 months of reactor operation respectively fig 3 the control reactor showed a stable community with ch4 oxidizing archaeon ca m nitroreducens and anammox bacteria ca kuenenia being the dominant denitrifying organisms in the low salinity reactor ca m nitroreducens was also the dominant organism in the community though a significant drop to 10 8 was observed on day 143 which was probably due to the shock related to the significant salinity change it recovered to the 24 1 percentage which is comparable to the inoculum 25 5 suggesting the acclimation of ca m nitroreducens to the salinity change ca kuenenia co existed alongside ca m nitroreducens however its proportion in the community 1 9 and 2 5 on day 143 and 276 respectively was lower than that in the control reactor interestingly in contrast to the absence of ca methylomirabilis in the control reactor growth from 1 2 on day 143 to 15 2 on day 276 was seen in the low salinity reactor increasing the salinity also led to a microbial community shift over the long term operation ca m nitroreducens stayed the most dominant organism in the community though the conditions seemed to affect its survival seen in the drop on day 121 further operation to day 279 showed a slight increase which may indicate the gradual adaption of ca m nitroreducens to high salinity condition the change of ca m nitroreducens was coherent with the variation of no3 reduction rate which experienced steady decrease before stabilizing fig 2a reflecting the strong decrease of nh4 oxidation fig 2a ca kuenenia also showed a quick drop to only 0 8 on day 121 and ended with 2 in the late operational stage on day 279 by contrast two members affiliated to the phylum of firmicutes were enriched one unclassified firmicutes member was enriched to 8 6 and 5 7 while another firmicutes member of limnochorda represented 2 7 and 3 5 of the taxa for day 121 and 279 respectively except for firmicutes two members belonging to chloroflexi i e sbr1031 and kd4 96 were also enriched in comparison to the inoculum each accounting for 1 9 and 7 5 6 2 and 4 3 on day 121 and 279 respectively 3 4 long term reactor microscopic analysis tem imaging of culture in the high salinity low salinity and control reactors was performed to see if cell shrinkage lysis or the accumulation of structure forming storage compounds could be observed the change of salinity and its physical effect on microorganisms can often be observed in cell morphologies the ionic and osmotic pressure can cause cells to shrink or expand depending on their coping mechanisms and tolerability towards salt stress while higher salt concentrations increase the osmotic potential microorganisms without a compensation mechanism are vulnerable to plasmolysis martin et al 1999 fig 4 shows the ca m nitroreducens dominated mixed cultures at different conditions while most anme is known to form clusters mcglynn et al 2018 some planktonic cells can also be observed samples taken from the control reactor show a large cell cluster fig 4a with only a few cells that store granules fig 4b ca m nitroreducens cells present a similarly large cluster in the high salinity reactor fig 4c showing some cell shrinkage producing a gap between the inner and outer membrane shrinkage can be more clearly seen in the single cell fig 4 d none of the cells in the images of the high salinity reactor can be seen to store granules cells from the low salinity reactor don t form the typical clusters fig 4e while they were located close to each other and were identifiable due to their size and shape most ca m nitroreducens cells in the low salinity reactor seem to be filled with intracellular storage granules fig 4 e and f these granules have previously been reported to be polyhydroxybutyrate phb through combining microscopy and phb staining cai et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a alongside the observed cell shrinkage in the high salinity reactor imaging gives a qualitative indication for higher extracellular polymeric substance eps concentrations loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted from the high salinity low salinity and control reactor with quantitative results presented in fig s1 overall protein was the dominant component of the eps for all salinity conditions the high salinity and low salinity bioreactors had the same level of lb eps which was around twice of lb eps in the control reactor meanwhile approximately twice higher tb eps was recognised under the high salinity condition compared to the that in other two salinities lb eps was similar for both reactors additional eps formation has been recognised as a fundamental microbial adaptation to salinity stress to keep stability saha et al 2020 wang et al 2013 the increase of tb eps in the high salinity reactor indicates that it may be a stress response and further a protective measure 3 5 metaproteomic analysis of salinity effect comparative metaproteomic analysis was conducted for the cultures at the high and low salinity condition to identify the impact of salinity on the methane oxidation pathway and investigate possible stress response mechanisms after 250 days of operation samples were taken and analysed for their protein expressions all proteins involved in the reverse methanogenesis pathway were found in a quantitative comparative study between the high and low salinity reactor fig 5 shows the reverse methanogenesis pathway with the abundance ratio for the proteins involved to compare the high salinity short term low salinity extension reactor a list of the proteins their log2 values adjusted adj p values and further comparisons between the control and the experimental reactors can be seen in the fig s2 all proteins needed for methane oxidation showed adj p values of over 0 05 suggesting no statistically significant difference between both conditions this finding confirms the process observations made for ch4 oxidation and nitrate reduction rates which only differed 30 50 in both reactors see fig 2 no obvious response mechanism was identifiable in the comparison between both conditions however comparing the well acclimatised control reactor separately to both experimental reactors provide more information on possible adaptations this comparison shows a strong overexpression of a response regulator which indicates a stress feedback mechanism abundance ratios between the low salinity reactor versus control reactor and high salinity reactor versus control reactor are 50 2 and 13 3 adj p value 0 05 respectively the na h antiporter enzyme mnh seemed to be a key protein responding to ionic pressure in ca m nitroreducens as these selective channels allow for a rebalance of ionic potential brett et al 2005 warnau et al 2020 the abundance ratios correlating to the response regulator show ratios of 56 5 and 85 0 adj p value 0 05 for the low salinity reactor versus the control reactor and high salinity reactor versus the control reactor respectively another typical response to higher osmotic pressure is the accumulation of osmolytes which can neither be seen in protein expression nor tem imaging for the high salinity reactor surprisingly the opposite is true for the low salt environment tem imaging shows granules that can be seen in many ca m nitroreducens these intracellular storage granules in ca m nitroreducens has previously been shown to be phb cai et al 2019 4 discussion results from this study clearly show that nitrate dependent aom performing organisms ca m nitroreducens can adapt to saline environments stable activity at 37 demonstrated that survival of these microorganisms is possible in marine ecosystems while the initial response to higher salinity might cause a significant activity decrease as seen in the short term batch tests in the long term reduced activity persists ionic pumps and stress regulators have been shown to help organisms react to changing environments 4 1 salinity variations shape different syntrophs in the consortium for nitrate dependent aom besides the performance variations caused by different salinities this study also demonstrates that different syntrophic patterns have evolved in the consortium under different salinity conditions under the salinity of 15 nacl as our previous study haroon et al 2013 nc10 population was outcompeted by ca kuenenia as the community did not show the presence of ca methylomirabilis fig 3 metatranscriptomic resolution in our previous study suggested that the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between ca m nitroreducens and other denitrifying populations in the consortium via multi heme cytochromes could be another mechanism under this salinity condition simon et al 2022 this could be an explanation for the remaining unknown 6 6 of nitrite reduced table s2 rate profile and balance evaluation demonstrated that the anammox reaction is the dominant driver for nitrite removal thus synergetic interaction between ca m nitroreducens and ca kuenenia is the main mechanism for nitrate dependent aom with salinity of 15 nacl fig 6 a under the low salinity condition both ca kuenenia and nc10 ca methylomirabilis co exist with ca m nitroreducens in high abundance the lower relative abundance of ca kuenenia was in line with the declined nh4 oxidation rate in the low salinity reactor when compared to the control reactor fig 2b c table 1 the presence of ca methylomirabilis suggests being responsible for the lack of no2 accumulation while its reduction attributable to anammox declined the electron balance of the ongoing no3 reduction further supports the active role of ca methylomirabilis in the consortium for nitrite dependent aom table 1 and s2 as the community did not see an enrichment of other denitrifying microorganisms fig 4 the synergetic interaction between ca m nitroreducens and both ca kuenenia and nc10 provides the foundation for nitrate dependent aom at low salinity of 1 7 nacl in this scenario ca kuenenia and nc10 were estimated to contribute 67 1 and 32 9 respectively to reduce the nitrite produced by ca m nitroreducens fig 6b under high salinity conditions ca kuenenia still plays a synergetic role however attributing to only 44 7 of the remaining nitrite removal fig 6c although halophilic marine nc10 bacteria has been widely reported he et al 2015a zhu et al 2012 surprisingly no halophilic nc10 species were enriched under high salinity conditions instead the community in the high salinity reactor was shaped by the enrichment of several other populations belonging to fermicutes and chloroflexi denitrifying representatives of fermicutes were previously isolated from active sludge heylen et al 2006b with some strains containing nitrite reductase genes heylen et al 2006a the enrichment of fermicutes members was indicative of the potential denitrifying role of firmicutes enriched in the consortium as a partner of ca m nitroreducens under high salinity condition a recent study found that in a marine niche featuring nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor ca methanoperedens and firmicutes co existed with high abundance beckmann et al 2021 this finding reconciles with the community evolution under marine mimicked salinity condition in this study supporting the hypothetic partnership between ca m nitroreducens and firmicutes for nitrate dependent aom at high salinity for enriched chloroflexi species both sbr1031 and kd4 94 were reported to be functionally related to denitrification sun and zhu 2022 tao et al 2022 van landuyt et al 2021 zuo et al 2020 which also indicates their synergistic roles with ca m nitroreducens thus the remaining 55 3 of nitrite reduced in the high salinity reactor was likely achieved by the salinity adapted denitrifying populations of firmicutes and chloroflexi fig 6c however unlike nc10 species which has the ch4 metabolising pathway it is unknown how firmicutes and chloroflexi derive electrons from ch4 for denitrification a logical hypothesis is that they can directly receive electrons from ca m nitroreducens via uncharacterized extracellular electron pathways fig 6c papers reporting that firmicutes and chloroflexi representatives can use poised electrodes as the electron donor for denitrification seem to support this hypothetic pattern lee et al 2013 sun and zhu 2022 further as the consortium was found to produce extraordinarily high amounts of eps under the high salinity condition fig s1 it is possible that the degradation of eps might provide intermediates as the electron donor for denitrification by firmicutes and chloroflexi zhang et al 2022a further transcriptomic investigation is warranted to verify either electron transfer mechanism between ca m nitroreducens and firmicutes or chloroflexi 4 2 implication for the ecological distribution of nitrate dependent aom in marine environments nitrate dependent aom has primarily been found in freshwater ecosystems cai et al 2021 the results from this study suggest that ca methanoperedenaceae can adapt to actively couple denitrification to aom at a salinity similar to marine environments this was demonstrated through all involved reactions methane oxidation nitrate reduction and dinitrogen gas production the osmoregulatory strategy of ca methanoperedenaceae for high salinity adaptation and the novel syntrophic relationship identified between ca methanoperedenaceae and new putative nitrite reducers supported the extrapolation of existence of nitrate dependent aom in marine environments it indicates that nitrate dependent aom has so far been overlooked in marine environments which has implications for the methane and nitrogen cycle in marine waters with methane in abundance and nitrate possibly produced locally via microbially driven processes such as nitrogen fixation and nitrification thermodynamic feasibility would allow nitrate dependent aom to contribute to methane mitigation in marine environments meanwhile increase of anthropogenic eutrophication in ocean yalçın et al 2017 especially in coastal surface sediments could lead to favourable niches for nitrate dependent aom mcra gene sequences closely related to ca methanoperedenaceae have been detected in the atlantic and the pacific ocean with apparent disconnect to srb due to the lack of srb and the presence of nitrate it was inferred that ca methanoperedenaceae performing nitrate dependent aom might be present beckmann et al 2021 case et al 2015 our study here for the first time shows the physiological evidence for the potential distribution of nitrate dependent aom in marine environments it is noteworthy that the described natural community reported by beckmann et al 2021 for putative nitrate dependent aom in the atlantic and the pacific ocean shows strong similarities to the community in our artificial enrichment bioreactor simulating a marine condition as both contain large amounts of firmicutes and alpha and gammaproteobacteria accompanying ca methanoperedenaceae this coincidence suggests a new syntrophy featured in a marine consortium possibly distinguishing itself from all previously reported freshwater consortia for nitrate dependent aom this finding may have significant implications for the specificity of this process in marine environments 4 3 impact of salinity on the application of nitrate dependent aom the thermodynamic phenomenon of aom has sparked the creativity of many researchers to find potential industrial applications one that came up early in the discovery process is wastewater treatment this might be because some anme have been enriched from wastewater treatment sludge hu et al 2009 or that the combination of anammox bacteria with nitrate dependent aom creates a novel denitrification pathway with promising potential haroon et al 2013 advantages such as reducing aeration requirements and simultaneous reduction of a harmful greenhouse gas methane with the removal of the key eutrophication causing nutrient nitrogen to support this proposed technology on the other hand many unknown factors such as the type of system to deliver gaseous carbon sources to the microbial community contamination potential and further microbial competition need to be assessed systems such as hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactors have the potential to deliver ch4 as the electron donor to the microbial community cai et al 2015 the application of anammox is making significant progress in wastewater treatment with studies looking into many aspects of the science and technology behind the process cho et al 2020 salinity has become a factor of interest mostly in wastewater treatment facilities in coastal cities to reduce freshwater consumption some initiatives foresee the use of seawater for toilet flushing and other applications with lower water quality requirements another issue will be climate change induced sea level rise which will significantly influence coastal wastewater treatment systems hummel et al 2018 liu et al 2016 the effect of salinity on anammox organisms lin et al 2020 and ca m oxyfera he et al 2015a he et al 2015b has been well studied leaving ca m nitroreducens as a single functional organism in this consortium underexplored in order to progress with the development of a nitrogen based aom and anammox process in wastewater treatment this study provides further knowledge on the salinity effect on ca m nitroreducens similar to ca kuenenia there was no negative impact of salinity observable on ca m nitroreducens under a salt concentration of 15 this means that for minor usage and introduction of seawater into the sewer system in coastal regions or industrial regions that produce saline wastewater the use of ca m nitroreducens in the treatment process would still be possible if the total salinity stays below 15 in extreme conditions e g climate change caused seawater rise and flooding of wastewater treatment plants near the ocean even high salinity conditions of up to 35 would not mean a complete stop of biological activity however reduced activity of both ca m nitroreducens and ca kuenenia would require major process adjustments to compensate for the slower rates moreover our results indicated ca m nitroreducens seemed to be more tolerant to high salinity than ca kuenenia and it can form new interactions with halophilic denitrifiers as an adaptive response to compensate for the more severe inhibition on nitrite removal by ca kuenenia 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the effect of salinity on a freshwater derived nitrate reducing and methane oxidizing consortium short term batch tests showed the no3 reduction rate at marine salinity conditions is about 38 lower and the methane oxidation rate is about 47 lower than the control batch with the salinity of 15 salinity of 52 completely inhibited the anammox reaction for nitrite reduction and at a salinity of 105 no3 reduction by ca m nitroreducens was reduced by over 87 long term incubation showed adaptive traits of ca m nitroreducens in saline environments no3 reduction after long term adaption under marine salinity stabilised at an average rate of 208 5 µmol day 1 gcdw 1 versus that of 362 9 and 334 3 µmol day 1 gcdw 1 under freshwater salinity conditions 1 7 nacl and control conditions 15 nacl though anammox activity was more severely suppressed under marine salinity firmicutes and chloroflexi populations evolved as putative denitrifying partners to contribute 55 3 to nitrite removal under this salinity to compensate for the mismatched anammox and nitrate reduction activity the evolution of new additional denitrifiers for nitrite scavenging was also found for freshwater salinity condition in which another denitrifying partners such as nc10 had contributed around 32 9 to the

14644,cr vi contamination has posed severe challenges to water quality food safety and land resources microbial reduction of cr vi to cr iii has drawn considerable attention due to its low cost and environmental friendliness however recent reports have shown that cr vi generates highly migratable organo cr iii rather than stable inorganic chromium minerals during the biological reduction process in this work it was reported for the first time that spinel structure cucr2o4 was formed by bacillus cereus in cr biomineralization process different from known biomineralization models biologically controlled mineralization and biologically induced mineralization the chromium copper minerals here appeared as specialized minerals with extracellular distribution in view of this a possible mechanism of biologically secretory mineralization was proposed in addition bacillus cereus demonstrated a high conversion ability in the treatment of electroplating wastewater the cr vi removal percentage reached 99 7 which satisfied the chinese emission standard of pollutants for electroplating gb 21 900 2008 indicating its application potential altogether our work elucidated a bacterial chromium spinel mineralization pathway and evaluated the potential of this system for application in actual wastewater opening a new avenue in the field of chromium pollution treatment and control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cr vi contamination treatment and control bacterial cr vi mineralization chromium copper spinel bacterial mineralization mechanism wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biomineralization is the conversion of metal ions into diverse nanostructured minerals mediated by bacterial metabolic systems hence it is recognized as a critical process that drives the geochemical cycling of metals couasnon et al 2020 statistically compared to thousands of natural minerals only more than 60 different minerals have been known form biologically generation including calcification silicification iron mineralization and manganese mineralization qin et al 2020 however they have attracted a continuously growing attention in the fields of treatment and control of metal pollution recycling of metal resources in waste and sustainable chemical production qin et al 2020 sakimoto et al 2016 sun et al 2020 uebe and schüler 2016 yu and leadbetter 2020 with chromium wide applications cr vi become a wide known environmental pollutant dhal et al 2013 lei et al 2022 irrational industrial utilization emission or unintentional oxidation of cr iii results in significant challenges to ecosystems and human health from cr vi hausladen et al 2018 liu et al 2020 in the traditional chemical reduction methods cr vi was reduced to cr iii by reducing agent such as fe2 s2 or zero valent iron and further precipitation of cr iii was achieved though ph adjustment dhal et al 2013 lei et al 2022 as a consequence crxfe1 x oh 3 or cr oh 3 is the common end product lei et al 2022 recent work has shown that these cr iii forms pose environmental risk where cr vi was produced and accelerated by some environmental factors such as manganese oxides or visible light lei et al 2022 liu et al 2020 chromium spinel the molecular formula is ab2o4 a is a divalent metal and b is trivalent chromium with an octahedral structure is considered to be a long term stable cr iii form lei et al 2022 nevertheless high temperature and high pressure are necessary conversion conditions from the perspective of either natural formation or anthropogenic synthesis of chromium spinel patron et al 2001 yang et al 2021 which is neither economically competitive nor sustainable therefore it is necessary to develop a facile and green strategy for synthetic chromium spinel due to the self replication of microorganisms and their abundant presence in the open environment the conversion of cr vi to stable trivalent chromium minerals via bacterial biomineralization is one of the ideal strategies with the advantages of low cost raw materials and no secondary contamination dhal et al 2013 jobby et al 2018 regrettably although the tremendous pressure from chromium pollution control has motivated extensive researches focusing on the bacterial mineralization of cr vi the present papers have present that bacteria convert cr vi to organo cr iii rather than chromium hydroxide or minerals chen et al 2012 cheng et al 2010 puzon et al 2005 three possible aspects contribute to the selection preference of bacteria first enzyme mediated reduction of cr vi is the main pathway for bacteria while organo cr iii is the result of enzymatic reduction assfalg et al 2002 puzon et al 2002 it is unknown whether a route exists for the transformation of organo cr iii to chromium minerals secondly organo cr iii is proposed to help bacteria increase their survival under cr vi stress and enhance their capacity to reduce cr vi bencheikh latmani et al 2007 the third factor is the influence of the environment where eutrophic acidic or neutral culture conditions lead to a rise in organo cr iii production probably determined by the ligand competition of trivalent chromium cheng et al 2010 huang et al 2019 further this soluble organo cr iii has also been reported have highly migratory easily reoxidation to harmful cr vi and un biodegradable cao et al 2011 puzon et al 2008 richmond bartlett 1979 it is of great significance to realize the conversion of cr vi to stable chromium spinel by biomineralization inspired by the structure of nature minerals table s1 we hypothesized that bacterial cr mineralization occur in complex systems such as bimetallic or polymetallic cooperative systems for the first time this work revealed the bacterial cr mineralization under the co existence of cu ii the results of supernatant detection electron microscopy techniques and chemical structure characterization indicated that bacteria absorbed cr vi and cu ii into the intracellular and converted them to cucr2o4 interestingly the ultimate characteristics of these minerals which were encapsulated in organic matter membranes and existed independently in the extracellular are different from traditional bacterial mineralization models including biologically induced mineralization bim and biologically controlled mineralization bcm keren et al 2017 qin et al 2020 a possible mechanism of biomineralization biologically secretory mineralization bsm was proposed in this mechanism outer membrane vesicles omvs may be a key factor in the releasing of minerals from the intracellular to the extracellular environment in addition within the cr cu containing wastewater this system exhibited a cr vi reduction rate satisfying with chinese emission standards and a total chromium removal percentage of approximately 95 these results hold enlightenment and reference meaning for design and development of efficient treatment method for chromium pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical agent bacteria and cultivation chemical agents were analytical reagents purchased from aladdin shanghai china

cytoscape 2 6 effect assessment of actual wastewater containing chromium and copper the wastewater was sampled from an electroplating factory located in jiangmen guangdong province china the samples collected from the field were measured by icp oes avio200 perkinelmer to obtain the composition and content of the elements in the wastewater the experiments were all executed by 5 g l dry weight bacillus cereus shaken at 37 c and 180 rpm 3 results and discussion 3 1 accumulation of cr and cu in the secretions of bacillus cereus previously lacking mineral formation was observed after bacillus cereus reduced cr vi and chromium was considered to combined with acyl and amino functional groups as organo cr iii chen et al 2012 in addition the treatment of cr vi by bacillus cereus was evaluated in the presence of nine different common metal ions including zn ii fe iii al iii co ii cd ii ca ii ni ii mg ii and mn ii but no chromium minerals were found either xu et al 2021 here we revealed chromium mineralization by bacillus cereus in the co presence of cu ii our results fig 1 indicated that cu ii positively enhanced the cr vi and total cr removal efficiency of bacillus cereus bacteria were incubated at an initial cr vi concentration of 50 mg l and ph 6 0 control group the cr b c system and after 120 h the supernatant contained 3 08 mg l of cr vi fig 1a after the addition of cu ii 6 4 32 and 64 mg l as the initial conditions cr vi was almost undetectable in the supernatant at 48 h compared to the control group the copper containing system showed a decrease in cr vi removal time of 72 h as well as an increase in the percentage of cr vi removal of more than 29 4 resulting in the removal of 99 of the initial amount the results of the reaction rate analysis showed that the removal of cr vi by bacillus cereus could be divided into three phases the trends of the first and third phases of the reaction rate were generally consistent but the addition of cu ii led to significantly higher treating rate compared to the control group fig s2 the removal rate of second phase were 0 733 3 183 6 917 and 7 350 mg l h in the systems with initial cu ii concentrations of 0 6 4 32 and 64 mg l respectively at 2 h further the kinetic analysis showed that half lives of cr vi removal decreased with increasing initial cu ii concentration fig s3 and table s2 the average half lives of cr vi removal were 15 7 11 0 2 2 and 1 6 h in the systems with initial cu ii concentrations of 0 6 4 32 and 64 mg l respectively these results suggested that cu ii accelerated the rate of cr vi treatment the higher cu ii concentration was in the range of 0 to 64 mg l the greater cr vi treatment rate it could achieve the removal of total chromium was likewise consistent with this trend the concentration of total chromium in the control group reached its lowest value 16 58 mg l at 72 h and then began to rise hitting 20 61 mg l at 120 h and maintaining an increasing trend fig 1b compared to the control group the copper containing system showed a decrease in total cr removal time of 48 h as well as an increase in the percentage of cr vi removal of more than 26 5 resulting in the removal of 93 of the initial amount with the presence of 64 mg l cu ii the total cr reached the maximum removal percentage of 96 2 in the supernatant remaining 1 89 mg l at 72 h although the trend of total cr removal rate is similar to that of cr vi the main difference is that the reaction rate increases with increasing cu ii concentration at 1 h fig s2 kinetically the copper containing system had a lower total cr residual concentration than the cr b c system fig s3 and table s3 moreover the total copper concentrations decreased significantly during the early phase of the reaction and remained steady afterwards fig 1c analysis of reaction rates and kinetics showed insignificant difference between each group fig s2 fig s3 and table s4 on the other hand we monitored the ph during the incubation the ph did not become alkaline in the absence of cu ii or bacteria fig 1d in the case of present cu ii the ph started to increase at 48 h and remained constant above 8 2 after 72 h the intracellular and extracellular ph of bacteria increased in parallel presumably as a consequence of cr iii induction leading to phosphate production supplementary text 1 for further exploration of the possibility of chromium mineralization we conducted an in depth analysis for bacillus cereus culture with initial conditions of 64 mg l cu ii and 50 mg l cr vi the crcu b c system sem eds was able to detect bacterial accumulation of metal ions the results showed that after 72 h the bacterium included minor quantities of chromium highest mass percentage of 0 3 and copper maximum mass percentage of 0 33 at 72 h fig 1f this percentage estimated based on the dry weight of bacteria resulted in the removal of 15 and 16 5 mg l of total chromium and total copper from the supernatant which is inconsistent with the values we measured 48 11 and 41 82 mg l respectively in fig 1f point a showed the bacterial secretion in which the content of chromium copper was much higher than in the cell reaching 2 08 and 1 12 respectively thus a hypothesis was that bacteria accumulated chromium copper in the extracellular secretions after the reduction of cr vi 3 2 bacillus cereus mineralized cr vi cu ii as cucr2o4 in previous researches on the mono metallic mineralization of cr vi by bacteria cr iii generally binds to organic matter and forms organo cr iii as the reduction products cheng et al compared the result to a number of model compounds and determined that gly cr was the best matchable model cheng et al 2010 thus in xanes analysis of k edge gly cr and gly cu were representatives of chromium and copper bound to organic matter the visual representation of standard samples and the characterization of the partial samples are shown in fig s4 according to the data of cr k edge xanes the major peak of the cr b c system was at 5995 2 ev which was roughly consistent with gly cr major peak at 5996 9 ev fig 2 a the main peak of the crcu b c system was identical to that of cucr2o4 at 5992 5 ev on the other hand the highest peak of the cu k edge xanes of crcu b c system was not significant and appeared in the region of 8999 1 9003 3 ev which overlapped with the major peak of cucr2o4 at 9003 4 ev and cu oh 2 at 8999 1 ev respectively fig 2b next the quantitative characterization of cr and cu was obtained by lcf analysis from the perspective of chromium fitting results showed that the crcu b c system contained 74 5 cucr2o4 and 25 5 gly cr whereas the cr b c system had 86 7 gly cr and 13 3 k2cro4 the distribution of cu in crcu b c was 57 5 cucr2o4 29 3 gly cu and 13 2 cu oh 2 fig 2c the results of xanes analysis indicated that bacteria converted cr vi and cu ii to cucr2o4 high angle annular dark field haadf images in scanning transmission electron microscopy stem mode and the corresponding eds mapping further confirmed the presence of cucr2o4 in the crcu b c system based on the elemental distribution and crystallographic distance fig 2d fig s5 in the extracellular secretion we observed spherical particles with a very high electron density the size distribution of pellets was not homogeneous with an average size of d 26 01 12 21 nm fig 2d mapping images showed that chromium and copper were corelated with the distribution of the pellets whereas carbon was associated with the distribution of the secretion as a whole this result suggested that organic matter encased the cr cu pellets corroborating the previous hypothesis that the secretion included cr cu products a closer look at the pellet inside the red box showed that its constituent distribution was consistent with the entire the fast fourier transformations fft of the tem image exhibited polycrystalline diffraction from 202 311 400 430 and 440 zone axes of cucr2o4 the d spacing of the areas of i ii and iii were 0 255 nm 0 288 nm and 0 213 nm respectively which was comparable with cucr2o4 during biomineralization poor crystallinity of minerals is usually interfered by organic matter therefore their crystalline patterns are difficult to identify through xrd keren et al 2017 in order to obtain the x ray diffraction signal of the minerals we used two distinct methods to treat the precipitates drying the precipitates at 50 c for one day fig s6 b and calcining the precipitates at 250 c for 2 h fig s6 c according to the xrd results the principal crystalline phase of the dried sample was na2hpo4 and the calcined sample included nap2o7 and k2co3 undetectable signal of cucr2o4 might due to the interference of the organic matter encapsulation after 30 min of ultrasonication with 6 s pulses separated by 4 s intervals significant amounts of black materials were observed in the precipitates subsequently xrd analysis allowed a successful acquisition of signals attributed to cucr2o4 311 222 and 400 fig s6 e f the untreated bacteria fig s6 h and the cr b c system fig s6 g were treated under the same ultrasonication settings little black material was obtained in the precipitates with hardly peaks detected by xrd this result confirmed the prior tem observation of mineral pellets wrapped in secretions thus we concluded that the crcu b c system generated spherical cucr2o4 particles and was stored in extracellular secretions however mineralization did not occur when the initial concentration of cr vi was increased suggesting that the mineralization strategy of bacteria seemed have a limit supplementary text 2 bacillus cereus conversed cr vi and cu ii into cucr2o4 was compared with the previously reported work on bacterial treatment of cr vi table s5 recent reports presented organic complexation of trivalent chromium is considered to be the main end product this organo cr iii has also been reported to be highly migratory unbiodegradable and could be easily reoxidated to harmful cr vi which poses unignored environmental risks cao et al 2011 puzon et al 2008 richmond bartlett 1979 hence the production of organic chromium is a serious challenge in cr vi contamination treatment and control involving bacteria to the best of our knowledge our work demonstrates for the first time that bacterial mineralization form chromium spinel breaking the bottleneck that bacterial cr vi treatment studies cannot form stable minerals and providing a new perspective for cr vi pollution treatment and control 3 3 hypothesis and analysis for a new model of biomineralization noteworthily the formation of cucr2o4 by bacillus cereus was distinct from bim and bcm keren et al 2017 qin et al 2020 within the cell bcm produces highly organized precipitates whose composition shape and size are controlled by bacteria without outside interference bim occurs when bacterial metabolites react with mineralized elements in bim bacteria are unable of actively regulating the formation of precipitates resulting in a heterogeneous composition and accumulation of disordered minerals or amorphous precipitates in the extracellular region here the specific minerals encapsulated in organic matter membranes and existing independently of the extracellular may be the result of an unknown mineralization route we proposed a new hypothesis about the biomineralization pathway in which bacteria absorbed metal ions into the intracellular compartment then regulated metal ions to unique minerals without environmental influence subsequently the minerals were released from the outer membrane via transmembrane transport we refer it as biologically secretory mineralization bsm to investigate the possibility of this hypothesis ultrathin sections of bacteria allowed us to make observations of their intracellular after 48 h of incubation the distribution of cr and cu overlapped with that of bacteria in the sample sections of the crcu b c system this result indicated that the bacteria had absorbed cr and cu fig 3 a the electron density inside the cell was not uniformly distributed the red circles showed the high density area and the secretion sections also present high electron density fig s7 with the help of ac tem we observed these bright spots at high magnification where microcrystals appeared and its fft detected polycrystalline diffraction fig 3b in further analysis the 311 zone axis of cucr2o4 and the corresponding lattice spacing were observed intracellular observations suggested that bacillus cereus mediated the formation of primitive crystals these bright spots and microcrystals were not significantly observed in the 4 h sections of the bacteria fig s8 this phenomenon implied that the mineralization by bacteria was chronological at 4 h bacteria might have been concentrated on the reduction process of cr vi subsequently the appearance of microcrystals indicated the beginning of chromium mineralization by bacteria this speculation was also consistent with the variations of cr vi concentration although primitive crystals were observed inside the cell it remains unclear why minerals end up in the extracellular medium rather than accumulating directly in the cells omvs are an important transport pathway that allows bacteria to export macromolecules from the intracellular to the extracellular bacterial omvs primarily carry cargoes such as nucleic acids toxins lipoproteins and enzymes these macromolecules are involved in fundamental bacterial functions including bacterial environment interactions promoting pathogenesis and communication between bacteria brown et al 2015 schwechheimer and kuehn 2015 omvs of gram positive bacteria were believed to be impossible due to their hard peptidoglycan layer toyofuku et al 2017 until recently with the reports of the release of omvs by bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus it was demonstrated that gram positive bacteria can accomplish transmembrane transport of biomacromolecules via omvs brown et al 2015 rivera et al 2010 toyofuku et al 2017 wang et al 2018 interestingly during cr cu mineralization by bacillus cereus the images of sem captured that the bacteria were releasing omvs fig 3c this phenotype was also occurred in the addition of 6 4 and 32 mg l cu ii fig s9 we hypothesized that the release of these omvs resulted in the extracellular secretions as omvs were releasing bacteria produced extra membrane protrusions toyofuku et al 2017 stained by star red nhs lucidi et al 2020 bacterial membrane was observed local dye aggregation fig 3d 3d sted provided clearer results about the continuity of membrane components it was shown that omvs were linked to the cell membrane and extracellular secretion fig 3e fig s10 this result suggested that the organic matter encasing the cr cu mineral might be the cell membrane and extracellular secretions were caused by the release of omvs therefore we proposed that omvs provided a possible route for transferring minerals from intracellular to extracellular in addition among the omvs triggering mechanisms is the environmental stress theory especially stimulation from genotoxic stresses schwechheimer and kuehn 2015 toyofuku et al 2017 turnbull et al 2016 as far as our knowledge this work is the first report to demonstrate that gram positive bacteria generate omvs in response to inorganic dna toxicants which complements the hypothesis for omvs environmental stress trigger mechanism 3 4 proteomics based speculation of metabolic mechanisms further the systematic proteomics analysis provided a logical mechanism for cucr2o4 mineralization by bacillus cereus figs 4 and 5 the volcano plot showed that 2052 proteins including 386 differentially expressed proteins deps were detected with 213 up regulated proteins and 173 down regulated proteins in the crcu b c system the experimental group compared to the cr b c system the control group fig 4a gene ontology enrichment analysis allowed for the identification of the relationship between deps and bacterial phenotypes fig 4b and 14 proteins were contained in both translation and regulation of transcription dna templated in biological processes bp the former had more up regulated proteins and the opposite for the latter in cellular component cc deps were predominantly annotated as cytosol cytoplasm extracellular region and membrane labeled as cytosol and cytoplasm proteins were mainly down regulated the former had 41 proteins including 28 down regulated the latter had 33 proteins including 24 down regulated next all proteins associated with extracellular region and membrane were significantly increased the former contained 16 proteins and the latter contained 6 proteins the decrease in intracellular composition and the increase in extracellular region evoked the release of bacterial omvs during the molecular functions mf deps were mostly described to atp binding metal ion binding and dna binding and they were more proteins down regulated than up regulated this phenomenon might be related to the mechanism of cu ii enhanced reductase and cr vi toxicity in order to understand the mechanism of chromium mineralization and the occurrence of bsm an alternative mechanism regarding the bacterial chromium mineralization process is proposed based on protein homology analysis fig 5 supplementary text 3 firstly bacteria absorbed more copper and chromium by regulating the expression of import and efflux transport proteins of metals then cu ii by binding to the reductase enzyme enhanced the cr vi reduction efficiency despite the rose in the quantity of intracellularly cr vi the activated reductase somewhat slowed down the damage of cr vi to dna on the other hand the increased amount of cr vi prompted bacteria to generate more antioxidant stress enzymes furthermore hypothetical mineralization related enzymes might provide a platform for the formation of chromium copper spinel finally bacteria dissolved the peptidoglycan layer by synthesizing n acetylmuramoyl l alanine amidase or its homologue and deformed the cell membrane by controlling the intracellular accumulation of alpha type phenol soluble modulins with the release of omvs accomplished under cytoplasmic swelling pressure which ultimately resulted in the transport of minerals from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment 3 5 treatment evaluation of cr cu industrial wastewater as the laboratory results showed that this system had good treatment effect the performance of bacillus cereus in electroplating wastewater was evaluated the electroplating effluent was collected from jiangmen city guangdong province china the initial state of the wastewater was complex and the results of icp oes showed that 13 elements were detected including a total cr concentration of 71 57 mg l a total cu concentration of 17 352 mg l and ph of 5 7 table s6 after 144 h of incubation the removal percentage of most metals in the wastewater exceeded 90 in the supernatant the ph was maintained above 8 2 and the residual cr vi minimum concentration was 0 25 mg l removal percentage of 99 7 and the total chromium minimum value was 3 81 mg l removal percentage of 94 7 fig s11 the concentrations of various metals after treatment were compliant or close to the concentrations stipulated in the chinese emission standard of pollutants for electroplating gb 21 900 2008 the mild conditions at 37 c and room pressure indicated the potential application of bacillus cereus in chromium and copper wastewater it is difficult to extract and detect the bacterial mineralization products under the complex conditions of the electroplating wastewater in the future work the yield of minerals and quality control of recovery will be the key point on the research of bacterial cr mineralization 4 conclusion in the past decades whether bacterial chromium mineralization exists has been an open question this work firstly reveals its existence and provides a comprehensive analysis of the mineralization products the processes at cellular the physiological levels and proteome bacillus cereus presented excellent cr vi and total chromium removal efficiency with the addition of cu ii compared to the control group the removal time was reduced by 72 and 48 h respectively and the removal percentage exceeded 99 and 93 respectively further the results of the crcu b c system showed that 74 5 of the total chromium removed from solution was converted to cucr2o4 through bacterially mediated conversion based on the study of the physiology of chromium mineralization in bacillus cereus a novel bsm hypothesis was proposed which was different from the known bcm and bim bacterial mineralization models besides the application potential of the crcu b c system was evaluated and the results showed that most of the metal ions were removed by more than 90 in electroplating wastewater the removal percentage of cr vi is approximately 100 and the concentration after reaction satisfies the discharge requirements of chinese emission standard of pollutants for electroplating

14644,cr vi contamination has posed severe challenges to water quality food safety and land resources microbial reduction of cr vi to cr iii has drawn considerable attention due to its low cost and environmental friendliness however recent reports have shown that cr vi generates highly migratable organo cr iii rather than stable inorganic chromium minerals during the biological reduction process in this work it was reported for the first time that spinel structure cucr2o4 was formed by bacillus cereus in cr biomineralization process different from known biomineralization models biologically controlled mineralization and biologically induced mineralization the chromium copper minerals here appeared as specialized minerals with extracellular distribution in view of this a possible mechanism of biologically secretory mineralization was proposed in addition bacillus cereus demonstrated a high conversion ability in the treatment of electroplating wastewater the cr vi removal percentage reached 99 7 which satisfied the chinese emission standard of pollutants for electroplating gb 21 900 2008 indicating its application potential altogether our work elucidated a bacterial chromium spinel mineralization pathway and evaluated the potential of this system for application in actual wastewater opening a new avenue in the field of chromium pollution treatment and control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cr vi contamination treatment and control bacterial cr vi mineralization chromium copper spinel bacterial mineralization mechanism wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biomineralization is the conversion of metal ions into diverse nanostructured minerals mediated by bacterial metabolic systems hence it is recognized as a critical process that drives the geochemical cycling of metals couasnon et al 2020 statistically compared to thousands of natural minerals only more than 60 different minerals have been known form biologically generation including calcification silicification iron mineralization and manganese mineralization qin et al 2020 however they have attracted a continuously growing attention in the fields of treatment and control of metal pollution recycling of metal resources in waste and sustainable chemical production qin et al 2020 sakimoto et al 2016 sun et al 2020 uebe and schüler 2016 yu and leadbetter 2020 with chromium wide applications cr vi become a wide known environmental pollutant dhal et al 2013 lei et al 2022 irrational industrial utilization emission or unintentional oxidation of cr iii results in significant challenges to ecosystems and human health from cr vi hausladen et al 2018 liu et al 2020 in the traditional chemical reduction methods cr vi was reduced to cr iii by reducing agent such as fe2 s2 or zero valent iron and further precipitation of cr iii was achieved though ph adjustment dhal et al 2013 lei et al 2022 as a consequence crxfe1 x oh 3 or cr oh 3 is the common end product lei et al 2022 recent work has shown that these cr iii forms pose environmental risk where cr vi was produced and accelerated by some environmental factors such as manganese oxides or visible light lei et al 2022 liu et al 2020 chromium spinel the molecular formula is ab2o4 a is a divalent metal and b is trivalent chromium with an octahedral structure is considered to be a long term stable cr iii form lei et al 2022 nevertheless high temperature and high pressure are necessary conversion conditions from the perspective of either natural formation or anthropogenic synthesis of chromium spinel patron et al 2001 yang et al 2021 which is neither economically competitive nor sustainable therefore it is necessary to develop a facile and green strategy for synthetic chromium spinel due to the self replication of microorganisms and their abundant presence in the open environment the conversion of cr vi to stable trivalent chromium minerals via bacterial biomineralization is one of the ideal strategies with the advantages of low cost raw materials and no secondary contamination dhal et al 2013 jobby et al 2018 regrettably although the tremendous pressure from chromium pollution control has motivated extensive researches focusing on the bacterial mineralization of cr vi the present papers have present that bacteria convert cr vi to organo cr iii rather than chromium hydroxide or minerals chen et al 2012 cheng et al 2010 puzon et al 2005 three possible aspects contribute to the selection preference of bacteria first enzyme mediated reduction of cr vi is the main pathway for bacteria while organo cr iii is the result of enzymatic reduction assfalg et al 2002 puzon et al 2002 it is unknown whether a route exists for the transformation of organo cr iii to chromium minerals secondly organo cr iii is proposed to help bacteria increase their survival under cr vi stress and enhance their capacity to reduce cr vi bencheikh latmani et al 2007 the third factor is the influence of the environment where eutrophic acidic or neutral culture conditions lead to a rise in organo cr iii production probably determined by the ligand competition of trivalent chromium cheng et al 2010 huang et al 2019 further this soluble organo cr iii has also been reported have highly migratory easily reoxidation to harmful cr vi and un biodegradable cao et al 2011 puzon et al 2008 richmond bartlett 1979 it is of great significance to realize the conversion of cr vi to stable chromium spinel by biomineralization inspired by the structure of nature minerals table s1 we hypothesized that bacterial cr mineralization occur in complex systems such as bimetallic or polymetallic cooperative systems for the first time this work revealed the bacterial cr mineralization under the co existence of cu ii the results of supernatant detection electron microscopy techniques and chemical structure characterization indicated that bacteria absorbed cr vi and cu ii into the intracellular and converted them to cucr2o4 interestingly the ultimate characteristics of these minerals which were encapsulated in organic matter membranes and existed independently in the extracellular are different from traditional bacterial mineralization models including biologically induced mineralization bim and biologically controlled mineralization bcm keren et al 2017 qin et al 2020 a possible mechanism of biomineralization biologically secretory mineralization bsm was proposed in this mechanism outer membrane vesicles omvs may be a key factor in the releasing of minerals from the intracellular to the extracellular environment in addition within the cr cu containing wastewater this system exhibited a cr vi reduction rate satisfying with chinese emission standards and a total chromium removal percentage of approximately 95 these results hold enlightenment and reference meaning for design and development of efficient treatment method for chromium pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical agent bacteria and cultivation chemical agents were analytical reagents purchased from aladdin shanghai china

cgi protein protein interaction ppi network analysis was performed on the string database https cn string db org to analyze preliminary obtained data and visualized network was plotted on the software cytoscape 2 6 effect assessment of actual wastewater containing chromium and copper the wastewater was sampled from an electroplating factory located in jiangmen guangdong province china the samples collected from the field were measured by icp oes avio200 perkinelmer to obtain the composition and content of the elements in the wastewater the experiments were all executed by 5 g l dry weight bacillus cereus shaken at 37 c and 180 rpm 3 results and discussion 3 1 accumulation of cr and cu in the secretions of bacillus cereus previously lacking mineral formation was observed after bacillus cereus reduced cr vi and chromium was considered to combined with acyl and amino functional groups as organo cr iii chen et al 2012 in addition the treatment of cr vi by bacillus cereus was evaluated in the presence of nine different common metal ions including zn ii fe iii al iii co ii cd ii ca ii ni ii mg ii and mn ii but no chromium minerals were found either xu et al 2021 here we revealed chromium mineralization by bacillus cereus in the co presence of cu ii our results fig 1 indicated that cu ii positively enhanced the cr vi and total cr removal efficiency of bacillus cereus bacteria were incubated at an initial cr vi concentration of 50 mg l and ph 6 0 control group the cr b c system and after 120 h the supernatant contained 3 08 mg l of cr vi fig 1a after the addition of cu ii 6 4 32 and 64 mg l as the initial conditions cr vi was almost undetectable in the supernatant at 48 h compared to the control group the copper containing system showed a decrease in cr vi removal time of 72 h as well as an increase in the percentage of cr vi removal of more than 29 4 resulting in the removal of 99 of the initial amount the results of the reaction rate analysis showed that the removal of cr vi by bacillus cereus could be divided into three phases the trends of the first and third phases of the reaction rate were generally consistent but the addition of cu ii led to significantly higher treating rate compared to the control group fig s2 the removal rate of second phase were 0 733 3 183 6 917 and 7 350 mg l h in the systems with initial cu ii concentrations of 0 6 4 32 and 64 mg l respectively at 2 h further the kinetic analysis showed that half lives of cr vi removal decreased with increasing initial cu ii concentration fig s3 and table s2 the average half lives of cr vi removal were 15 7 11 0 2 2 and 1 6 h in the systems with initial cu ii concentrations of 0 6 4 32 and 64 mg l respectively these results suggested that cu ii accelerated the rate of cr vi treatment the higher cu ii concentration was in the range of 0 to 64 mg l the greater cr vi treatment rate it could achieve the removal of total chromium was likewise consistent with this trend the concentration of total chromium in the control group reached its lowest value 16 58 mg l at 72 h and then began to rise hitting 20 61 mg l at 120 h and maintaining an increasing trend fig 1b compared to the control group the copper containing system showed a decrease in total cr removal time of 48 h as well as an increase in the percentage of cr vi removal of more than 26 5 resulting in the removal of 93 of the initial amount with the presence of 64 mg l cu ii the total cr reached the maximum removal percentage of 96 2 in the supernatant remaining 1 89 mg l at 72 h although the trend of total cr removal rate is similar to that of cr vi the main difference is that the reaction rate increases with increasing cu ii concentration at 1 h fig s2 kinetically the copper containing system had a lower total cr residual concentration than the cr b c system fig s3 and table s3 moreover the total copper concentrations decreased significantly during the early phase of the reaction and remained steady afterwards fig 1c analysis of reaction rates and kinetics showed insignificant difference between each group fig s2 fig s3 and table s4 on the other hand we monitored the ph during the incubation the ph did not become alkaline in the absence of cu ii or bacteria fig 1d in the case of present cu ii the ph started to increase at 48 h and remained constant above 8 2 after 72 h the intracellular and extracellular ph of bacteria increased in parallel presumably as a consequence of cr iii induction leading to phosphate production supplementary text 1 for further exploration of the possibility of chromium mineralization we conducted an in depth analysis for bacillus cereus culture with initial conditions of 64 mg l cu ii and 50 mg l cr vi the crcu b c system sem eds was able to detect bacterial accumulation of metal ions the results showed that after 72 h the bacterium included minor quantities of chromium highest mass percentage of 0 3 and copper maximum mass percentage of 0 33 at 72 h fig 1f this percentage estimated based on the dry weight of bacteria resulted in the removal of 15 and 16 5 mg l of total chromium and total copper from the supernatant which is inconsistent with the values we measured 48 11 and 41 82 mg l respectively in fig 1f point a showed the bacterial secretion in which the content of chromium copper was much higher than in the cell reaching 2 08 and 1 12 respectively thus a hypothesis was that bacteria accumulated chromium copper in the extracellular secretions after the reduction of cr vi 3 2 bacillus cereus mineralized cr vi cu ii as cucr2o4 in previous researches on the mono metallic mineralization of cr vi by bacteria cr iii generally binds to organic matter and forms organo cr iii as the reduction products cheng et al compared the result to a number of model compounds and determined that gly cr was the best matchable model cheng et al 2010 thus in xanes analysis of k edge gly cr and gly cu were representatives of chromium and copper bound to organic matter the visual representation of standard samples and the characterization of the partial samples are shown in fig s4 according to the data of cr k edge xanes the major peak of the cr b c system was at 5995 2 ev which was roughly consistent with gly cr major peak at 5996 9 ev fig 2 a the main peak of the crcu b c system was identical to that of cucr2o4 at 5992 5 ev on the other hand the highest peak of the cu k edge xanes of crcu b c system was not significant and appeared in the region of 8999 1 9003 3 ev which overlapped with the major peak of cucr2o4 at 9003 4 ev and cu oh 2 at 8999 1 ev respectively fig 2b next the quantitative characterization of cr and cu was obtained by lcf analysis from the perspective of chromium fitting results showed that the crcu b c system contained 74 5 cucr2o4 and 25 5 gly cr whereas the cr b c system had 86 7 gly cr and 13 3 k2cro4 the distribution of cu in crcu b c was 57 5 cucr2o4 29 3 gly cu and 13 2 cu oh 2 fig 2c the results of xanes analysis indicated that bacteria converted cr vi and cu ii to cucr2o4 high angle annular dark field haadf images in scanning transmission electron microscopy stem mode and the corresponding eds mapping further confirmed the presence of cucr2o4 in the crcu b c system based on the elemental distribution and crystallographic distance fig 2d fig s5 in the extracellular secretion we observed spherical particles with a very high electron density the size distribution of pellets was not homogeneous with an average size of d 26 01 12 21 nm fig 2d mapping images showed that chromium and copper were corelated with the distribution of the pellets whereas carbon was associated with the distribution of the secretion as a whole this result suggested that organic matter encased the cr cu pellets corroborating the previous hypothesis that the secretion included cr cu products a closer look at the pellet inside the red box showed that its constituent distribution was consistent with the entire the fast fourier transformations fft of the tem image exhibited polycrystalline diffraction from 202 311 400 430 and 440 zone axes of cucr2o4 the d spacing of the areas of i ii and iii were 0 255 nm 0 288 nm and 0 213 nm respectively which was comparable with cucr2o4 during biomineralization poor crystallinity of minerals is usually interfered by organic matter therefore their crystalline patterns are difficult to identify through xrd keren et al 2017 in order to obtain the x ray diffraction signal of the minerals we used two distinct methods to treat the precipitates drying the precipitates at 50 c for one day fig s6 b and calcining the precipitates at 250 c for 2 h fig s6 c according to the xrd results the principal crystalline phase of the dried sample was na2hpo4 and the calcined sample included nap2o7 and k2co3 undetectable signal of cucr2o4 might due to the interference of the organic matter encapsulation after 30 min of ultrasonication with 6 s pulses separated by 4 s intervals significant amounts of black materials were observed in the precipitates subsequently xrd analysis allowed a successful acquisition of signals attributed to cucr2o4 311 222 and 400 fig s6 e f the untreated bacteria fig s6 h and the cr b c system fig s6 g were treated under the same ultrasonication settings little black material was obtained in the precipitates with hardly peaks detected by xrd this result confirmed the prior tem observation of mineral pellets wrapped in secretions thus we concluded that the crcu b c system generated spherical cucr2o4 particles and was stored in extracellular secretions however mineralization did not occur when the initial concentration of cr vi was increased suggesting that the mineralization strategy of bacteria seemed have a limit supplementary text 2 bacillus cereus conversed cr vi and cu ii into cucr2o4 was compared with the previously reported work on bacterial treatment of cr vi table s5 recent reports presented organic complexation of trivalent chromium is considered to be the main end product this organo cr iii has also been reported to be highly migratory unbiodegradable and could be easily reoxidated to harmful cr vi which poses unignored environmental risks cao et al 2011 puzon et al 2008 richmond bartlett 1979 hence the production of organic chromium is a serious challenge in cr vi contamination treatment and control involving bacteria to the best of our knowledge our work demonstrates for the first time that bacterial mineralization form chromium spinel breaking the bottleneck that bacterial cr vi treatment studies cannot form stable minerals and providing a new perspective for cr vi pollution treatment and control 3 3 hypothesis and analysis for a new model of biomineralization noteworthily the formation of cucr2o4 by bacillus cereus was distinct from bim and bcm keren et al 2017 qin et al 2020 within the cell bcm produces highly organized precipitates whose composition shape and size are controlled by bacteria without outside interference bim occurs when bacterial metabolites react with mineralized elements in bim bacteria are unable of actively regulating the formation of precipitates resulting in a heterogeneous composition and accumulation of disordered minerals or amorphous precipitates in the extracellular region here the specific minerals encapsulated in organic matter membranes and existing independently of the extracellular may be the result of an unknown mineralization route we proposed a new hypothesis about the biomineralization pathway in which bacteria absorbed metal ions into the intracellular compartment then regulated metal ions to unique minerals without environmental influence subsequently the minerals were released from the outer membrane via transmembrane transport we refer it as biologically secretory mineralization bsm to investigate the possibility of this hypothesis ultrathin sections of bacteria allowed us to make observations of their intracellular after 48 h of incubation the distribution of cr and cu overlapped with that of bacteria in the sample sections of the crcu b c system this result indicated that the bacteria had absorbed cr and cu fig 3 a the electron density inside the cell was not uniformly distributed the red circles showed the high density area and the secretion sections also present high electron density fig s7 with the help of ac tem we observed these bright spots at high magnification where microcrystals appeared and its fft detected polycrystalline diffraction fig 3b in further analysis the 311 zone axis of cucr2o4 and the corresponding lattice spacing were observed intracellular observations suggested that bacillus cereus mediated the formation of primitive crystals these bright spots and microcrystals were not significantly observed in the 4 h sections of the bacteria fig s8 this phenomenon implied that the mineralization by bacteria was chronological at 4 h bacteria might have been concentrated on the reduction process of cr vi subsequently the appearance of microcrystals indicated the beginning of chromium mineralization by bacteria this speculation was also consistent with the variations of cr vi concentration although primitive crystals were observed inside the cell it remains unclear why minerals end up in the extracellular medium rather than accumulating directly in the cells omvs are an important transport pathway that allows bacteria to export macromolecules from the intracellular to the extracellular bacterial omvs primarily carry cargoes such as nucleic acids toxins lipoproteins and enzymes these macromolecules are involved in fundamental bacterial functions including bacterial environment interactions promoting pathogenesis and communication between bacteria brown et al 2015 schwechheimer and kuehn 2015 omvs of gram positive bacteria were believed to be impossible due to their hard peptidoglycan layer toyofuku et al 2017 until recently with the reports of the release of omvs by bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus it was demonstrated that gram positive bacteria can accomplish transmembrane transport of biomacromolecules via omvs brown et al 2015 rivera et al 2010 toyofuku et al 2017 wang et al 2018 interestingly during cr cu mineralization by bacillus cereus the images of sem captured that the bacteria were releasing omvs fig 3c this phenotype was also occurred in the addition of 6 4 and 32 mg l cu ii fig s9 we hypothesized that the release of these omvs resulted in the extracellular secretions as omvs were releasing bacteria produced extra membrane protrusions toyofuku et al 2017 stained by star red nhs lucidi et al 2020 bacterial membrane was observed local dye aggregation fig 3d 3d sted provided clearer results about the continuity of membrane components it was shown that omvs were linked to the cell membrane and extracellular secretion fig 3e fig s10 this result suggested that the organic matter encasing the cr cu mineral might be the cell membrane and extracellular secretions were caused by the release of omvs therefore we proposed that omvs provided a possible route for transferring minerals from intracellular to extracellular in addition among the omvs triggering mechanisms is the environmental stress theory especially stimulation from genotoxic stresses schwechheimer and kuehn 2015 toyofuku et al 2017 turnbull et al 2016 as far as our knowledge this work is the first report to demonstrate that gram positive bacteria generate omvs in response to inorganic dna toxicants which complements the hypothesis for omvs environmental stress trigger mechanism 3 4 proteomics based speculation of metabolic mechanisms further the systematic proteomics analysis provided a logical mechanism for cucr2o4 mineralization by bacillus cereus figs 4 and 5 the volcano plot showed that 2052 proteins including 386 differentially expressed proteins deps were detected with 213 up regulated proteins and 173 down regulated proteins in the crcu b c system the experimental group compared to the cr b c system the control group fig 4a gene ontology enrichment analysis allowed for the identification of the relationship between deps and bacterial phenotypes fig 4b and 14 proteins were contained in both translation and regulation of transcription dna templated in biological processes bp the former had more up regulated proteins and the opposite for the latter in cellular component cc deps were predominantly annotated as cytosol cytoplasm extracellular region and membrane labeled as cytosol and cytoplasm proteins were mainly down regulated the former had 41 proteins including 28 down regulated the latter had 33 proteins including 24 down regulated next all proteins associated with extracellular region and membrane were significantly increased the former contained 16 proteins and the latter contained 6 proteins the decrease in intracellular composition and the increase in extracellular region evoked the release of bacterial omvs during the molecular functions mf deps were mostly described to atp binding metal ion binding and dna binding and they were more proteins down regulated than up regulated this phenomenon might be related to the mechanism of cu ii enhanced reductase and cr vi toxicity in order to understand the mechanism of chromium mineralization and the occurrence of bsm an alternative mechanism regarding the bacterial chromium mineralization process is proposed based on protein homology analysis fig 5 supplementary text 3 firstly bacteria absorbed more copper and chromium by regulating the expression of import and efflux transport proteins of metals then cu ii by binding to the reductase enzyme enhanced the cr vi reduction efficiency despite the rose in the quantity of intracellularly cr vi the activated reductase somewhat slowed down the damage of cr vi to dna on the other hand the increased amount of cr vi prompted bacteria to generate more antioxidant stress enzymes furthermore hypothetical mineralization related enzymes might provide a platform for the formation of chromium copper spinel finally bacteria dissolved the peptidoglycan layer by synthesizing n acetylmuramoyl l alanine amidase or its homologue and deformed the cell membrane by controlling the intracellular accumulation of alpha type phenol soluble modulins with the release of omvs accomplished under cytoplasmic swelling pressure which ultimately resulted in the transport of minerals from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment 3 5 treatment evaluation of cr cu industrial wastewater as the laboratory results showed that this system had good treatment effect the performance of bacillus cereus in electroplating wastewater was evaluated the electroplating effluent was collected from jiangmen city guangdong province china the initial state of the wastewater was complex and the results of icp oes showed that 13 elements were detected including a total cr concentration of 71 57 mg l a total cu concentration of 17 352 mg l and ph of 5 7 table s6 after 144 h of incubation the removal percentage of most metals in the wastewater exceeded 90 in the supernatant the ph was maintained above 8 2 and the residual cr vi minimum concentration was 0 25 mg l removal percentage of 99 7 and the total chromium minimum value was 3 81 mg l removal percentage of 94 7 fig s11 the concentrations of various metals after treatment were compliant or close to the concentrations stipulated in the chinese emission standard of pollutants for electroplating gb 21 900 2008 the mild conditions at 37 c and room pressure indicated the potential application of bacillus cereus in chromium and copper wastewater it is difficult to extract and detect the bacterial mineralization products under the complex conditions of the electroplating wastewater in the future work the yield of minerals and quality control of recovery will be the key point on the research of bacterial cr mineralization 4 conclusion in the past decades whether bacterial chromium mineralization exists has been an open question this work firstly reveals its existence and provides a comprehensive analysis of the mineralization products the processes at cellular the physiological levels and proteome bacillus cereus presented excellent cr vi and total chromium removal efficiency with the addition of cu ii compared to the control group the removal time was reduced by 72 and 48 h respectively and the removal percentage exceeded 99 and 93 respectively further the results of the crcu b c system showed that 74 5 of the total chromium removed from solution was converted to cucr2o4 through bacterially mediated conversion based on the study of the physiology of chromium mineralization in bacillus cereus a novel bsm hypothesis was proposed which was different from the known bcm and bim bacterial mineralization models besides the application potential of the crcu b c system was evaluated and the results showed that most of the metal ions were removed by more than 90 in electroplating wastewater the removal percentage of cr vi is approximately 100 and the concentration after reaction satisfies the discharge requirements of chinese emission standard of pollutants for electroplating gb 21 900 2008 this study provides a highly efficient and environmentally friendly bacterial chromium mineralization strategy for the treatment of electroplating effluent declaration of competing
