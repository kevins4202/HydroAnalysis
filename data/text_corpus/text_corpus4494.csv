22470,helical strakes are widely used to suppress vortex induced vibration viv in offshore engineering however the viv response and suppression efficiency of the straked pipe remain unclear in an oscillatory flow in this paper an experimental study of viv for a flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes was conducted in an oscillatory flow with the keulegan carpenter kc number varying from 21 to 165 and maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 12 the effects of the helical strakes on the viv response strouhal number suppression efficiency and fatigue damage in an oscillatory flow were investigated the results show that the suppression efficiency and fatigue damage reduction ratio are not as ideal in oscillatory flow as those in steady flow moreover the viv dominant frequency is obviously magnified and a large strouhal number is observed reaching 0 439 under a lower reduced velocity of 4 as the reduced velocity further increases to 6 8 12 two branches of strouhal numbers are clearly seen the dominant frequency decreases at the first branch with a small kc number and increases at the second branch with a large kc number keywords vortex induced vibration helical strake flexible pipe oscillatory flow 1 introduction as oil and gas production moves into deeper waters risers are becoming increasingly slender under the action of ocean currents vortices are generated and alternately shed from the sides of these flexible slender risers resulting in a periodic excitation force if the frequency of the vortex induced force is near the natural frequencies of the risers a resonance vibration will occur this is the so called vortex induced vibration viv blevins and saunders 1977 this periodic vibration has been proven to be the main reason for fatigue damage of risers therefore a means to effectively suppress viv has been studied for decades in industry and academia at present there are two main methods to suppress viv of the riser active and passive control the main difference between them is that active control requires additional power he et al 2000 jeon et al 2004 williams and zhao 1989 while passive control does not the latter is more widely used due to its easier manufacture different passive control methods to suppress viv have been studied by many researchers allen et al 2004 bearman and owen 1998 galvao et al 2008 gao et al 2015 trim et al 2005 helical strake is among the most widely used apparatuses in practical projects its high suppression efficiencies in the steady flow have been verified by both numerical simulations and experiment studies vandiver et al 2006 tested three different distributions of strakes in the reduction of the viv amplitude and frequency allen et al 2004 presented the performance of different helical strake geometries at critical reynolds numbers trim et al 2005 studied the suppression effectiveness of the strake on a long flexible riser in both the cf and il directions gao et al 2015 presented the effects of strake configurations in both uniform and linearly sheared flows constantinides and oakley 2006 pinto et al 2006 thiagarajan and constantinides 2005 studied the viv suppression mechanism of helical strakes by using the computational fluid dynamic cfd method they found that helical strake could prevent the interaction between two shear layers and break vortex shedding thus suppressing the viv the aforementioned studies focused on the performance of helical strakes under steady flow and there are extremely few publications regarding the performance of helical strakes under oscillatory flow however the marine risers for instance the steel catenary riser scr and steel lazy wave riser slwr act as the only channel to connect the subsea wellhead and the platform in a real sea state the wave induced periodic motion of the platform always results in a relatively equivalent oscillatory flow around the risers it has been found from recent experimental study that the oscillatory flow induced by the pure motion of the platform can also excite the viv at the sag bend of the scr wang et al 2015 2017a termed vessel motion induced viv vmi viv pesce et al 2017 the vmi viv can cause serious fatigue damage to risers wang et al 2014 to improve the understanding of this phenomenon fu et al 2014 conducted a flexible pipe model test in oscillatory flow by forcing the model to oscillate in still water with different periods and amplitudes a viv developing process in oscillatory flow was first proposed including building up lock in and dying out this novel viv phenomenon has attracted much attention from both industry and academia another experiment with a slwr was presented by cheng et al 2016 and constantinides et al 2016 the similar vmi viv phenomenon was also observed to suppress the viv induced by vessel motion tests of a pipe model fitted with helical strakes with a pitch of 15 d and a height of 0 25 d were further conducted however viv still occurred for the straked pipe which is contrary to the popular belief that helical strakes can nearly fully suppress viv what causes this result is still unclear to further improve the understanding of viv performance for straked pipes in the equivalent oscillatory flow we conducted viv model tests for a straked pipe under oscillatory flow in skloe a straked pipe with pitch of 15 d and height of 0 25 d was forced to harmonically oscillate under various combinations of amplitude and period with keulegan carpenter kc numbers varying between 21 and 165 and maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 12 the effects of the helical strakes on viv response strouhal number suppression efficiency and fatigue damage are discussed 2 model test 2 1 test apparatus a model test was conducted in an ocean basin at shanghai jiao tong university the entire experimental setup primarily containing two horizontal and vertical tracks and a flexible pipe model was installed under the bottom of a sub carriage as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 details of the connection frame at the end side of the experimental apparatus are shown in fig 3 the pipe model was connected to a force sensor through a universal joint the force sensor was connected to a tensioner that was fixed to the slider of the vertical track a pretension force of 500n was applied to the flexible pipe meanwhile two circular endplates were installed to avoid the perturbation caused by the motion of the supporting frame the flexible pipe model was constructed with a polypropylene random ppr pipe outside and a copper cable inside to satisfy the designed mass and bending stiffness silicone gel was placed between different layers to avoid relative slippage as shown in fig 4 the height pitch and number of starts of the helical strake were three of its main geometric parameters which were 0 25d 15d and 3 in the experimental study respectively the helical strakes were tied to the flexible pipe the main properties of the test model are listed in table 1 the 1st and 2nd order eigen frequency of the flexible pipe in still water can be calculated by eq 1 and were 1 77 hz and 3 86 hz respectively 1 f n 0 n 2 l t 0 m n 2 π 2 l 2 e i m m m 1 4 π d 2 ρ c m c m 1 0 n 1 2 where t 0 is the pretension force m and m are the mass per unit length in still water and air respectively l and d are the length and diameter of flexible pipe respectively ei is the bending stiffness of pipe ρ is the density of the water ρ 1000 kg m3 the added mass coefficient c m is assumed to be 1 0 it should be noted that the diameter values are all kept as that of bare pipe four groups of fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors were installed to measure the strain responses in both the cf and il directions each of the fbg groups cf a cf c il b and il d had ten measurement points along the pipe separated by 0 36 m as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 5 2 2 test matrix to investigate the viv response characteristics of the flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes in oscillatory flow the model was forced to oscillate in harmonic motion under various combinations of amplitude and period in the horizontal direction the instantaneous displacement x t and velocity of the forced motion u t can be expressed as follows 2 x t a m sin 2 π t t 3 u t a m 2 π t cos 2 π t t where a m and t are oscillation amplitude and period respectively the kc number and maximum reduced velocity v r are considered two of the main parameters that determine the viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder under oscillatory flow and are represented as 4 k c 2 π a m d 5 v r 2 π a m t f 10 d where f 10 denotes the first natural frequency of the test model in still water f 10 is usually used to calculate the reduced velocity since the first natural mode is the potential excitation mode for all the test cases notably the added mass may deviate from the value of 1 0 in still water and the forced oscillation periods will change with the kc number at the same maximum reduced velocity all the test cases were divided into four groups with different maximum reduced velocities as presented in table 2 the corresponding maximum reynolds number re has been also list in this table which can be calculated by eq 6 each test group had test cases with a kc number ranging from 21 to 165 under the same amplitude of the forced motion velocity the same cases were also conducted for a bare pipe 6 re max u m d υ where u m is the forced motion velocity amplitude υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient in our experiment the ambient temperature is maintained near 15 c and υ is therefore approximately 1 14 10 6 m2 s 1 3 basic theory 3 1 preprocessing for convenience in description the coordinate system is defined as o xyz the origin is at one of the ending points of the riser and the z axis x axis and y axis are along the axis of the riser il direction and cf direction respectively as shown in fig 2 at the start of the experiment a constant pre tension of 500n was exerted at the flexible pipe ends however the pretension periodically varied with pipe oscillation thus the measured strain included three components the initial axial strain ε t0 caused by pre tension the variable axial strain ε t t caused by varying tension and the bending strain ε viv caused by the vortex induced vibration the original measured strains ε cf a z t and ε cf c z t sampled by cf a and cf c measurement points respectively can be correspondingly expressed as 7 ε c f a z t ε t 0 ε t z t ε v i v z t 8 ε c f c z t ε t 0 ε t z t ε v i v z t combing eqs 7 and 8 the pure viv strain at z location ε viv z t can be calculated by 9 ε v i v z t ε c f a z t ε c f c z t 2 fig 6 shows the original viv strain time history of vr 6 and kc 143 the original viv strain obviously contains significant f o and 2f o frequency components which is caused by the swing of the flexible pipe f o refers to the forced oscillation frequency and is equal to 1 t as fig 7 a shows the flexible pipe has an initial deflection under the action of gravity combined with the forced motion the flexible pipe with the initial deflection performs a pendulum movement to further verify this view fig 7 b shows the trajectory of the strain at the 5th gauge points the blue solid line represents the original total strain including the viv strain and bending strain caused by the pendulum movement the red solid line is these bending strain components below 2 5 f o after low pass filtering through fig 7 b an obvious asymmetrical pendulum trajectory presented by red solid line can be observed it also explains the significant f 0 and 2f 0 components that exist in the original viv strains this asymmetrical pendulum movement may be caused by the asymmetrical drag force in an oscillation period to eliminate the effects of the flexible pipe pendulum motion caused by the forced motion and high frequency noise a bandpass filter was utilized the passband cutoff frequencies were set as 2 5f o and 30 hz a comparison of the original viv strain and filtered viv strain at the 5th gauge points vr 6 and kc 143 is shown in fig 8 although the strain caused by the cycloidal motion plays an important role in bending strain response this strain cannot be counted in the viv strain because this strain is not caused by the vortex shedding 3 2 displacement identified method according to the euler bernoulli beam theory the viv displacement response of the flexible pipe under the external load can be expressed as the sum of the mode shapes multiplied by the generalized coordinate values of each step the viv displacement response in the cf direction can be expressed as 10 y z t i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where y z t is the viv displacement response in the cf direction at the z location and p i t is the ith generalized coordinate displacement values at time t ϕ i z is ith displacement modal shape at the z location based on the small deformation assumption the curvature κ z t can be expressed as 11 κ z t 2 y z t z 2 i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where ϕ i is the ith modal shape of the curvature according to the geometric relationship between the curvature and strain the strain can be calculated by 12 ε z t κ z t r r i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where r denotes the radius of the flexible pipe model at the z location in our model mode shapes of the displacement are sinusoidal which can be expressed as 13 ϕ i z sin i π z l i 1 2 from eq 11 the mode shapes of the curvature are also sinusoidal after obtaining the mode shape of the displacement and curvature the modal generalized coordinates can be obtained from eq 12 then the viv displacement response in the cf direction can be calculated by eq 10 fig 9 presents the distribution of root mean square of viv displacement yrms d and viv strain ε rms along the flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 and kc 30 as shown in fig 9 a the blue and red lines present the viv displacement of bare and straked pipe respectively the viv displacement of bare pipe is larger than that of straked pipe it indicates that the helical strakes can also suppress the vortex induced vibration in an oscillatory flow to validate the displacement identification the identified viv strain was recalculated based on the reconstructed viv displacement through eq 11 curvature can be obtained by the second order difference of viv displacement to position z then identified strain values are further calculated by eq 12 as presented in fig 9 b the red dash line and blue solid line are the identified ε rms of straked and bare pipe respectively the red circle and blue square symbols represents the measured ε rms of straked and bare pipe respectively the identified values are in a good agreement with the measured one this consistency demonstrates the validity of displacement identification method for the flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow 3 3 time frequency analysis the shedding frequency changes with the periodic oscillation velocity of the model which can be written as 14 f s t t s t u t d where st refers to the strouhal number typically st 0 2 f st is the vortex shedding frequency under the effect of the periodically varying shedding frequency the viv characteristics in the cf direction vary with time this time varying feature has been reported to be the major difference between the viv in steady flow and that in oscillatory flow fu et al 2014 to investigate the time varying feature of the flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes the wavelet transformation is introduced to help analyze the time frequency distribution of the viv in oscillatory flow the continuous wavelet transform equation is expressed as 15 w t f a τ f t ψ a τ t a 1 2 f t ψ t τ a d t where wt f a τ is the coefficient of the time domain signal after the wavelet transformation which represents the frequency variation at that time scale parameter a is the scale factor τ is the shift factor and ψ t is the mother wavelet in this paper we use the morlet wavelet equation as the mother wavelet which can be defined as 16 ψ t ce t 2 2 cos 5 t 3 4 fatigue damage estimation the viv can cause serious fatigue damage to marine risers therefore it is necessary to estimate the fatigue damage of the flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes under different maximum reduced velocities vr and kc numbers the stresses σ at the outer pipe can be calculated by 17 σ z t e ε z t where e is the elastic modulus of the flexible pipe according to the miner palmgren hypothesis fatigue damage occurs when the accumulation of fatigue damage from the stress time histories with varying amplitudes satisfies eq 18 18 d a i n i n i 1 where n i is the number of cycles with the stress range δσ i n i is the number of cycles to failure for the specific stress range δσ i which can be expressed as eq 19 according to the s n curve 19 n i 10 log a m log δ σ i thus the total fatigue damage d ot can be calculated by the summation of the contribution from all cycles 20 d o t i n t o t d a i where ntot is the total number of the stress cycles in the viv time history the b1 s n curve from dnv rp c203 2011 is applied the main parameters are listed in table 3 4 results and discussions 4 1 viv responses of the bare pipe in oscillatory flow to investigate the effects of helical strakes on viv response in an oscillatory flow an experimental study of a bare pipe was firstly conducted as a benchmark for the bare pipe test cases the first mode is always dominant in our experiments therefore the results measured at the 5th gauge point that is in the middle of the pipe model z 1 73 m is used for further analysis fig 10 and fig 11 show the time history of the viv response and time frequency distribution in the case of vr 6 under a small kc number kc 30 and a large kc number kc 121 respectively each figure contains five subplots figure a is the time varying shedding frequency f st which is calculated based on eq 14 figure b is the viv displacement response which is reconstructed by utilizing the modal superposition method as proposed in section 3 2 figure c shows the time history of the modal weight p t of displacement figure d is the wavelet analysis of the strain signal the depth of the color indicates the concentration level of the strain components figure e presents the time varying natural frequency and viv response dominant frequency the blue dash and red solid lines represent the first and second order eigen frequency while the black line refers to the dominant frequency it should be noted that the first and second order eigen frequency f 1 f 2 have been calculated based on the measured time varying tension assuming the added mass coefficient to be equal to 1 as shown in fig 10 the shedding frequency calculated by eq 14 varies from 0 to 2 hz the viv displacement amplitude is less modulated and the maximum value reaches 0 64 d as seen from the wavelet results shown in fig 10 e the dominant frequency is always close to f 1 this indicates that the lock in occurs at first mode although the response is dominated by the 1st natural mode higher harmonics also occur under the small kc number kc 30 presented in fig 10 d however under the large kc number kc 121 as shown in fig 11 a strong amplitude modulation phenomenon appears and the viv developing process is comprised of three phases building up lock in and dying out the maximum viv displacement amplitude value reaches 0 65 d which is the same as that in the small kc number case these results are consistent with the viv features in oscillatory flow found by fu et al 2014 wang et al 2014 significant differences in the viv response between the small and large kc numbers will provide a good reference for investigating the effects of helical strakes the comparison of these distinct features between the bare and straked pipes will help in improving our understanding of the effects of helical strakes in an oscillatory flow 4 2 viv responses of the straked pipe in oscillatory flow 4 2 1 time varying responses of the straked pipe under a small kc number the effects of the helical strakes on the viv response in an oscillatory flow with a small and large kc number were investigated by comparing them to the experimental results of the bare pipe model fig 12 shows the viv response and time frequency distribution at the 5th gauge points of the straked flexible pipe in the case of a small kc number kc 38 with different reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 12 as shown in fig 12 a an obvious mode transition phenomenon is observed under vr 4 the dominant frequency represented by the black solid line of the straked pipe changes back and forth between the 1st and 2nd natural frequencies assuming the st number is equal to 0 2 the maximum shedding frequency of the straked pipe based on eq 14 should be 1 42 hz however this is much lower than the dominant response frequency found in the experiment as shown in the third subplot in fig 12 a this means that the helical strakes can result in a st number much larger than 0 2 a typical value for a bare pipe and significantly magnify the shedding frequency under a small reduced velocity however as the maximum reduced velocity increases to 6 8 and 12 mode transition and higher harmonic components disappear and the response characteristics are similar to those of the bare pipe as shown in fig 12 b and c the response becomes very steady and is always dominated by the 1st natural mode which is lower than the maximum shedding frequency this finding indicates that the strakes can reduce the dominant frequency and suppress the higher frequency response components under higher reduced velocities which is consistent with the results in uniform flow found by gao et al 2016 the main reason for the difference between the low and high reduced velocities as previously described may be attributed to the competition between the effects of the helical strakes on the breaking vortex and the prevention of interaction between two shear layers breaking vortex effects means the helical strakes break the large orderly vortex into many weak and messy ones the latter effect is that helical strakes prevent the two shear layers from affecting each other and make two layers parallel to the flow direction shown in fig 14 under a lower flow velocity a lower re number the vortex shedding from the two sides of the straked pipe is quite weak and very easily broken the breaking vortex leads to a higher response frequency however the vortex becomes stronger and sheds from the two sides of the straked pipe in parallel under a higher flow velocity a higher re number the interaction of the two shear layers is prevented by the helical strakes constantinides and oakley 2006 pinto et al 2006 the response frequency is reduced under this condition only one effect works under steady flow but two different effects on the response frequency will compete in oscillatory flow for easier understanding a sketch of the competition between the effects of the helical strakes under a small kc number with different reduced velocities is shown in figs 13 and 14 the maximum velocity of the forced motion under a low reduced velocity vr 4 is lower while the period of the forced motion is longer than that under a higher reduced velocity vr 8 the helical strakes always or at most times play the role of a breaking vortex under a lower reduced velocity thus the wake pattern contains many small vortex pairs which leads to a higher viv response frequency and mode transition phenomenon as the maximum velocity of the forced motion increases and the forced motion period decreases the effects of the helical strakes in preventing the interaction between the two shear layers become dominant under a higher reduced velocity as shown in fig 14 for example suppose the forced motion maximum velocity at vr 4 is the critical velocity between the two different effects presented in fig 13 below this critical velocity such as at time i and iii the vortex breaking effects play a leading role while above this critical velocity the shear layer interaction preventing effects dominate as shown in fig 14 the time of the vortex breaking effects is very short whereas the prevention of shear layer effect is long the prevention of shear layer reduces the dominant response frequency and the higher harmonic response frequency more insightful experiments and cfd simulations will be conducted in the near future to further show this interesting phenomenon 4 2 2 time varying responses of the straked pipe under a large kc number to further investigate the viv responses under a large kc number fig 15 shows the viv response and time frequency distribution at the 5th gauge point of the straked flexible pipe in the case of the large kc number which is approximately 100 the reduced velocities vary from 4 to 12 as vr is equal to 4 shown in fig 15 a a mode transition very often occurs and the response frequency is quite unstable a significantly higher response frequency component can be observed there are no obvious viv processes under such a low reduced velocity which is completely different from that of the bare pipe the main reason is that the vortex breaking effects of the helical strakes dominate in the cases of a vr 6 and 8 shown in fig 15 b and c respectively the time frequency distribution becomes very stable the response characteristics are similar to those of the bare pipes a stronger amplitude modulation and obvious viv developing process comprised of building up lock in and dying out can be seen the vortex breaking effects dominant under the low velocity cause higher harmonic responses in this case differing from the bare pipe as the reduced velocity increases to 12 a strong amplitude modulation still occurs while the viv developing process and higher harmonic response disappear the shorter cycle of the forced motion and higher velocity may serve as the main reasons which suppresses the vortex breaking effects in addition the vortex shedding process can be altered when the cylinder reverses its motion direction and encounters the previously shed vortices fu et al 2014 sumer and fredsøe 1988 the interaction stops the viv from developing and leads to a stronger response as previously explained the maximum values of the displacement at vr 6 8 and 12 are 0 07d 0 13d and 0 21d respectively the displacement of vr 12 is obviously larger than that at vr 6 and 8 this is consistent with the previously explained reason 4 2 3 st numbers of the straked pipes from the aforementioned investigation it can be seen that the two different effects of helical strakes have a significant influence on the time frequency distribution of the viv response however the aforementioned analysis can only provide some qualitative conclusions and hence the influence of the competition between the vortex breakage and shear layer interaction prevention needs further study to determine the influence of the helical strakes on the dominant frequency of the straked pipe under oscillatory flow the general frequency spectrum proposed by wang et al 2014 is introduced here and defined as 21 f ω i 1 10 f ˆ i ω where f ˆ i ω is the fft result at the ith gauge points and it is a function of the strain amplitude with respect to the response frequency f ω is the general amplitude frequency spectrum by summing the strain amplitude at the same frequency component for all of the 10 gauge points the general frequency spectrum of the straked pipe in the case of vr 8 and kc 56 is shown in fig 16 there is an obvious frequency peak at 1 75 hz 7f o the dominant frequency in this case contributions from 0 76 hz 3f o 1 0 hz 4f o 1 27 hz 5f o 1 52 hz 6f o 2 01 hz 8f o and 2 27 hz 9f o can also be seen but are quite insignificant typically the viv dominant frequency is governed by the st number to further investigate the exact value of the st number the relationship among the dominant frequency of the straked pipe number of vortex shedding pairs kc number under oscillatory flow and strouhal number can be defined as follows 22 n f d o m i f o 23 n k c f d o m i f o d f o u m f d o m i d u m s t n s t k c where f domi is the dominant frequency f o and u m are the forced oscillation frequency and velocity amplitude respectively it should be noted that the diameters d in eqs 22 and 23 for both bare and straked pipe cases are all adopted the same value of bare pipe the aforementioned relationship was firstly introduced to investigate the st number of a smooth rigid cylinder under oscillatory flow by sumer and fredsøe 1988 it has also been used by wang et al 2015 2016 2017b in the scr and free hanging riser model tests by summarizing the dominant frequency for all of the test cases the variation in the vortex shedding pairs with the kc number is shown in fig 17 the st number can be calculated based on eqs 22 and 23 significant differences between the bare and straked pipe under oscillatory flow are observed as shown in fig 17 a the vortex shedding pairs maintain a good linear relationship with kc numbers under vr 4 which is consistent with the results reported by sumer and fredsøe 1988 the st number is equal to 0 439 and 0 26 for the straked and bare pipes respectively it is unexpected that the st number of the straked pipe would be dramatically larger than that of a bare pipe which can be attributed to the vortex breaking effects of the helical strakes as previously mentioned this finding is contrary to that under uniform flow where the helical strakes can reduce the viv dominant frequency as reported by gao et al 2014 2015 2016 this means that the helical strakes can increase the viv dominant frequency under a low reduced velocity under oscillatory flow which may lead to serious fatigue damage when the reduced velocity increases competition between the effects of the helical strakes in vortex breaking and preventing the interaction between two shear layers appears this competition results in two distinct branches of the st numbers for the straked pipe under oscillatory flow the main phenomena are as follows 1 fig 17 b shows the st number relationship when vr is 6 for the bare pipe the st number is always equal to 0 18 which is slightly lower than the typical value of 0 2 for a straked pipe two branches with st 0 155 first branch and st 0 29 second branch appear the st number of the straked pipe is smaller than that of the bare pipe in the first branch with the kc number ranging from 20 to 70 while it is larger in the second branch with the kc number ranging from 70 to 140 this finding indicates that the helical strakes will decrease the viv dominant frequency in the first branch and increase it in the second branch the turning point kct is at approximately 70 2 similar features are also observed when the reduced velocity is equal to 8 as shown in fig 17 c the st number of the first and second branch is equal to 0 124 and 0 22 respectively the turning point kct is at approximately 80 3 as the reduced velocity reaches 12 two distinct branches still exist for the straked pipe in the first and second branches which are divided by a kct 100 the st number is equal to 0 107 and 0 148 respectively however the st numbers of the straked pipe in these two branches are both lower than that of the bare pipe 4 when the kc number further increases and is larger than the upper limit of that in the second branch vortex shedding pairs n decrease and do not maintain a linear relationship with kc number n decreases from 40 24 18 at kc 140 113 121 to 4 at kc 165 under vr 6 8 12 respectively the st numbers of the straked pipe in the two branches and bare pipe are summarized in table 4 for the straked pipe the st number decreases as the reduced velocity increases while the turning point kct shows an opposite tendency this finding indicates the effect of the helical strakes in preventing the interaction between the shear layers is stronger under a higher reduced velocity due to its dependency on the reynolds number to summarize the competition between the two effects of the helical strakes results in very complicated viv dominant frequency for the pipe under oscillatory flow it is possible that the helical strakes can cause more serious fatigue damage under some conditions and hence more attention should be paid to it during the engineering design process however under real ocean conditions higher mode number of the flexible riser will be excited and the riser will suffer a high re number in our experiments only the 1st mode was excited and it is impossible to systematically investigate the re number effects more experiments and numerical simulation of higher mode number and re number effects should be conducted in the near future 4 3 suppression efficiency of helical strakes in oscillatory flow 4 3 1 reduction ratio of viv amplitude response the vortex induced vibration suppression efficiency of the helical strakes 15 d in pitch and 0 25 d in height was tested in a rigid cylinder experiments under steady flow by schaudt et al 2008 obtaining at least 94 reduction however the suppression efficiency of a helical strake under oscillatory flow has not been studied the efficiency η is usually defined as 24 η y y s y 100 where y and y s are the standard deviation of the displacement for a bare and straked pipe respectively fig 18 shows the maximum displacement standard deviation of the viv of bare and straked pipes decreasing trend of viv response for bare pipe as kc number increases can be found in each test groups this trend is consistent with the results found by wang et al 2015 this is because the pipe encounters the previously shed vortexes as it reverses its directional motion such interaction is much stronger under small kc numbers leading to a larger amplitude this phenomenon can also be observed for a straked pipe under oscillatory flow for the same reason comparing the viv response between the bare and straked pipes the helical strake type can still effectively suppress the viv under oscillatory flow as expected however the suppression efficiency is not as high as that under uniform flow as reported by schaudt et al 2008 under a lower reduced velocity the broken shedding vortexes of the straked pipe are quite weak and cannot excite a significant viv under this condition the viv displacements are stable with the kc number as shown in fig 16 a while the interaction between the shed vortices of the two half cycles for the bare pipe is stronger the viv response decreases as the kc number increases therefore the suppression efficiency can reach 92 7 for a small kc number but decreases to 71 9 for a large kc number however for a higher reduced velocity vr 6 8 and 12 the interaction between the shed vortices of the two half cycles also occurs for the straked pipe but weaker than that for the bare pipe at small kc number thus lower suppression efficiency occurs at a small kc number as shown in fig 18 b c and d the minimum values of the suppression efficiencies are 62 6 50 8 and 64 3 in the small kc number case and the maximum values are 93 5 91 9 and 82 4 in the large kc number case for vr 6 8 12 respectively from above results the suppression efficiencies of straked pipe at large kc number seem to be similar to that in the uniform flow the breaking and messy vortex cannot excite a significant vibration this may be the main reasons for the higher suppression efficiency at larger kc number overall the suppression efficiency of the helical strakes with a pitch equal to 15 d and a height equal to 0 25 d can reach 50 at a minimum this also indicates that the suppression efficiency of other helical strake types should be verified under oscillatory flow 4 3 2 reduction ratio of fatigue damage although effective suppression of the viv of helical strakes studied in this paper can be seen from the amplitude reduction ratio the effects of the helical strakes on fatigue damage need further study by combining them with the complicated frequency characteristics of the helical strakes under oscillatory flow the viv displacement amplitude reduction ratio cannot be considered as the unique criteria to evaluate the suppression efficiency resvanis et al 2016 in our experiment a constant pretension of 500n was applied to the ends of the model to achieve the designed natural frequencies however the tension force t t varied with time due to both varying drag force from forced motions and viv response fig 19 presents the time history of tension forced on the end of flexible pipe measured by the force transducers the red dash line and solid line represent the tension force on straked and bare pipe respectively as shown in fig 19 compared with straked pipe the tension force of bare pipe varies more obviously especially for the case of larger kc number this can be attributed to that bare pipe possess more significant viv response than the straked pipe the time varying tension force can lead to a time varying stress and contribute to the fatigue damage thus the fatigue damage was derived from two parts time varying tension force and viv force to calculate the fatigue damage from measured strain signal in the model test the bending stress and variable tension stress should be first obtained the bending stress induced by viv can be calculated by combing eqs 9 and 17 where the tension stress is obtained from the measured strain signal as previously mentioned the measured strain contains ε t0 ε t z t and ε viv z t according to eqs 7 and 8 the variable tension strain ε t z t can then be expressed by eq 25 25 ε t z t ε c f a z t ε t 0 ε c f c z t ε t 0 2 in the eq 25 the initial tension strain ε t0 is obtained through averaging the initial strain as shown in fig 20 combing eqs 25 and 17 the variable tension stress can be calculated fig 21 presents the distributions of root mean square of stress caused by viv and varying tension force under kc 30 and 121 for vr 6 0 the solid line and dash line represent stress of bare and straked pipe respectively the blue line and red line represent the case of kc 30 and 121 respectively as shown in fig 21 a the more obvious viv response of bare pipe possesses more significant viv stress σviv rms than the straked one σviv rms at the middle points is obviously larger than those close to the end of the model while the tension stress σt rms distributes evenly along the pipe as shown in fig 21 b compared with σviv rms the stress derived from variable tension force is relatively smaller and there are no obvious differences under different kc numbers after obtaining the stress the stress cycles can be identified from the time history by the rainflow procedure amzallag et al 1994 then according to eq 20 fatigue damage derived from viv and varying tension force at each gauge point can be calculated based on eqs 18 20 respectively fig 22 shows the fatigue damage distributions along the flexible pipe under kc 30 and 121 for vr 6 as shown in fig 22 a it can be seen that the fatigue damage caused by viv bending strain dot viv at the middle location is larger due to more obvious viv response at this location dot viv of bare pipe is significant larger than that of straked one it indicates that the helical strakes can reduce the dot viv and prolong service life of the riser in an oscillatory flow fig 22 b shows the distribution of fatigue damage derived from the varying tension force dot t compared with dot viv the dot t distributes more evenly along the flexible pipe and very smaller dot t is about 104 orders of magnitude smaller than dot viv it means fatigue damage from variable tension force can be ignored in our experiments beyond that the variable tension force is not only caused by the viv it also affected by varying drag force from forced motions to investigate the effects of helical strakes on reducing fatigue damage caused by pure viv response the maximum fatigue damage of dot viv in each case is summarized fig 23 shows the variation in the maximum fatigue damage of dot viv with kc number for a bare and straked pipe the maximum fatigue damage decreases as the kc number increases for the bare pipe the reason is the same as discussion of the viv response amplitude distribution shown in fig 18 compared to the fatigue damage of the bare pipe we surprisingly found that the maximum fatigue damage of the straked pipe under a low reduced velocity vr 4 is close to that of the bare pipe at a large kc number combining the strouhal relationship shown in fig 17 and response amplitude distribution shown in fig 18 a higher viv dominant frequency caused by the vortex breaking effect of the helical strakes may be the main reason for this phenomenon as shown in fig 23 a the fatigue damage reduction rate is over 95 while it decreases to 41 at a kc 121 when the reduced velocity further increases to 6 8 and 12 as shown in fig 23 b c and d respectively a similar trend of viv response amplitude distribution is also observed in the maximum fatigue damage the fatigue damage of the straked pipe under a small kc number is not as ideal as that under a large kc number although the dominant frequency of the straked pipe at the second branch as previously mentioned is higher than that of the bare pipe the response amplitude is effectively reduced at this branch thus the effects of the two branches on the strouhal number caused by covering the helical strakes cannot be seen in the maximum fatigue damage distribution due to limitation of the length of the flexible pipe higher modes were not excited in our experiments in the future more work to excite higher mode of a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow will be conducted overall the fatigue damage for the straked pipe under oscillatory flow under a low reduced velocity and small kc number is larger and should be paid more attention in practical engineering projects 5 conclusions in this paper an experimental study of a flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes was conducted in oscillatory flow under a kc number ranging from 20 to 160 and a maximum reduced velocity varying from 4 to 12 compared with bare pipe the effects of the helical strakes on the viv response st number suppression efficiency and fatigue damage under oscillatory flow were investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 under a lower reduced velocity the mode transition phenomenon for the straked pipe is quite obvious and the helical strakes can significantly increase the viv dominant frequency the strouhal number of the straked pipe can reach 0 439 which is nearly twice that of the typical st number measured during a steady flow experiment 2 under a higher reduced velocity two distinct branches in the variation of the st number against the kc number are observed the helical strake reduces the dominant frequency in the first branch with a small kc number while it increases it in the second branch with a large kc number 3 the helical strake shows its effects in suppressing viv under oscillatory flow however the suppression efficiency of the viv and fatigue damage particularly under the conditions of a small kc number and low reduced velocity is not as high as that under steady flow more attentions should be paid to this phenomenon in practical engineering projects acknowledgments the authors gratefully

22470,helical strakes are widely used to suppress vortex induced vibration viv in offshore engineering however the viv response and suppression efficiency of the straked pipe remain unclear in an oscillatory flow in this paper an experimental study of viv for a flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes was conducted in an oscillatory flow with the keulegan carpenter kc number varying from 21 to 165 and maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 12 the effects of the helical strakes on the viv response strouhal number suppression efficiency and fatigue damage in an oscillatory flow were investigated the results show that the suppression efficiency and fatigue damage reduction ratio are not as ideal in oscillatory flow as those in steady flow moreover the viv dominant frequency is obviously magnified and a large strouhal number is observed reaching 0 439 under a lower reduced velocity of 4 as the reduced velocity further increases to 6 8 12 two branches of strouhal numbers are clearly seen the dominant frequency decreases at the first branch with a small kc number and increases at the second branch with a large kc number keywords vortex induced vibration helical strake flexible pipe oscillatory flow 1 introduction as oil and gas production moves into deeper waters risers are becoming increasingly slender under the action of ocean currents vortices are generated and alternately shed from the sides of these flexible slender risers resulting in a periodic excitation force if the frequency of the vortex induced force is near the natural frequencies of the risers a resonance vibration will occur this is the so called vortex induced vibration viv blevins and saunders 1977 this periodic vibration has been proven to be the main reason for fatigue damage of risers therefore a means to effectively suppress viv has been studied for decades in industry and academia at present there are two main methods to suppress viv of the riser active and passive control the main difference between them is that active control requires additional power he et al 2000 jeon et al 2004 williams and zhao 1989 while passive control does not the latter is more widely used due to its easier manufacture different passive control methods to suppress viv have been studied by many researchers allen et al 2004 bearman and owen 1998 galvao et al 2008 gao et al 2015 trim et al 2005 helical strake is among the most widely used apparatuses in practical projects its high suppression efficiencies in the steady flow have been verified by both numerical simulations and experiment studies vandiver et al 2006 tested three different distributions of strakes in the reduction of the viv amplitude and frequency allen et al 2004 presented the performance of different helical strake geometries at critical reynolds numbers trim et al 2005 studied the suppression effectiveness of the strake on a long flexible riser in both the cf and il directions gao et al 2015 presented the effects of strake configurations in both uniform and linearly sheared flows constantinides and oakley 2006 pinto et al 2006 thiagarajan and constantinides 2005 studied the viv suppression mechanism of helical strakes by using the computational fluid dynamic cfd method they found that helical strake could prevent the interaction between two shear layers and break vortex shedding thus suppressing the viv the aforementioned studies focused on the performance of helical strakes under steady flow and there are extremely few publications regarding the performance of helical strakes under oscillatory flow however the marine risers for instance the steel catenary riser scr and steel lazy wave riser slwr act as the only channel to connect the subsea wellhead and the platform in a real sea state the wave induced periodic motion of the platform always results in a relatively equivalent oscillatory flow around the risers it has been found from recent experimental study that the oscillatory flow induced by the pure motion of the platform can also excite the viv at the sag bend of the scr wang et al 2015 2017a termed vessel motion induced viv vmi viv pesce et al 2017 the vmi viv can cause serious fatigue damage to risers wang et al 2014 to improve the understanding of this phenomenon fu et al 2014 conducted a flexible pipe model test in oscillatory flow by forcing the model to oscillate in still water with different periods and amplitudes a viv developing process in oscillatory flow was first proposed including building up lock in and dying out this novel viv phenomenon has attracted much attention from both industry and academia another experiment with a slwr was presented by cheng et al 2016 and constantinides et al 2016 the similar vmi viv phenomenon was also observed to suppress the viv induced by vessel motion tests of a pipe model fitted with helical strakes with a pitch of 15 d and a height of 0 25 d were further conducted however viv still occurred for the straked pipe which is contrary to the popular belief that helical strakes can nearly fully suppress viv what causes this result is still unclear to further improve the understanding of viv performance for straked pipes in the equivalent oscillatory flow we conducted viv model tests for a straked pipe under oscillatory flow in skloe a straked pipe with pitch of 15 d and height of 0 25 d was forced to harmonically oscillate under various combinations of amplitude and period with keulegan carpenter kc numbers varying between 21 and 165 and maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 12 the effects of the helical strakes on viv response strouhal number suppression efficiency and fatigue damage are discussed 2 model test 2 1 test apparatus a model test was conducted in an ocean basin at shanghai jiao tong university the entire experimental setup primarily containing two horizontal and vertical tracks and a flexible pipe model was installed under the bottom of a sub carriage as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 details of the connection frame at the end side of the experimental apparatus are shown in fig 3 the pipe model was connected to a force sensor through a universal joint the force sensor was connected to a tensioner that was fixed to the slider of the vertical track a pretension force of 500n was applied to the flexible pipe meanwhile two circular endplates were installed to avoid the perturbation caused by the motion of the supporting frame the flexible pipe model was constructed with a polypropylene random ppr pipe outside and a copper cable inside to satisfy the designed mass and bending stiffness silicone gel was placed between different layers to avoid relative slippage as shown in fig 4 the height pitch and number of starts of the helical strake were three of its main geometric parameters which were 0 25d 15d and 3 in the experimental study respectively the helical strakes were tied to the flexible pipe the main properties of the test model are listed in table 1 the 1st and 2nd order eigen frequency of the flexible pipe in still water can be calculated by eq 1 and were 1 77 hz and 3 86 hz respectively 1 f n 0 n 2 l t 0 m n 2 π 2 l 2 e i m m m 1 4 π d 2 ρ c m c m 1 0 n 1 2 where t 0 is the pretension force m and m are the mass per unit length in still water and air respectively l and d are the length and diameter of flexible pipe respectively ei is the bending stiffness of pipe ρ is the density of the water ρ 1000 kg m3 the added mass coefficient c m is assumed to be 1 0 it should be noted that the diameter values are all kept as that of bare pipe four groups of fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors were installed to measure the strain responses in both the cf and il directions each of the fbg groups cf a cf c il b and il d had ten measurement points along the pipe separated by 0 36 m as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 5 2 2 test matrix to investigate the viv response characteristics of the flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes in oscillatory flow the model was forced to oscillate in harmonic motion under various combinations of amplitude and period in the horizontal direction the instantaneous displacement x t and velocity of the forced motion u t can be expressed as follows 2 x t a m sin 2 π t t 3 u t a m 2 π t cos 2 π t t where a m and t are oscillation amplitude and period respectively the kc number and maximum reduced velocity v r are considered two of the main parameters that determine the viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder under oscillatory flow and are represented as 4 k c 2 π a m d 5 v r 2 π a m t f 10 d where f 10 denotes the first natural frequency of the test model in still water f 10 is usually used to calculate the reduced velocity since the first natural mode is the potential excitation mode for all the test cases notably the added mass may deviate from the value of 1 0 in still water and the forced oscillation periods will change with the kc number at the same maximum reduced velocity all the test cases were divided into four groups with different maximum reduced velocities as presented in table 2 the corresponding maximum reynolds number re has been also list in this table which can be calculated by eq 6 each test group had test cases with a kc number ranging from 21 to 165 under the same amplitude of the forced motion velocity the same cases were also conducted for a bare pipe 6 re max u m d υ where u m is the forced motion velocity amplitude υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient in our experiment the ambient temperature is maintained near 15 c and υ is therefore approximately 1 14 10 6 m2 s 1 3 basic theory 3 1 preprocessing for convenience in description the coordinate system is defined as o xyz the origin is at one of the ending points of the riser and the z axis x axis and y axis are along the axis of the riser il direction and cf direction respectively as shown in fig 2 at the start of the experiment a constant pre tension of 500n was exerted at the flexible pipe ends however the pretension periodically varied with pipe oscillation thus the measured strain included three components the initial axial strain ε t0 caused by pre tension the variable axial strain ε t t caused by varying tension and the bending strain ε viv caused by the vortex induced vibration the original measured strains ε cf a z t and ε cf c z t sampled by cf a and cf c measurement points respectively can be correspondingly expressed as 7 ε c f a z t ε t 0 ε t z t ε v i v z t 8 ε c f c z t ε t 0 ε t z t ε v i v z t combing eqs 7 and 8 the pure viv strain at z location ε viv z t can be calculated by 9 ε v i v z t ε c f a z t ε c f c z t 2 fig 6 shows the original viv strain time history of vr 6 and kc 143 the original viv strain obviously contains significant f o and 2f o frequency components which is caused by the swing of the flexible pipe f o refers to the forced oscillation frequency and is equal to 1 t as fig 7 a shows the flexible pipe has an initial deflection under the action of gravity combined with the forced motion the flexible pipe with the initial deflection performs a pendulum movement to further verify this view fig 7 b shows the trajectory of the strain at the 5th gauge points the blue solid line represents the original total strain including the viv strain and bending strain caused by the pendulum movement the red solid line is these bending strain components below 2 5 f o after low pass filtering through fig 7 b an obvious asymmetrical pendulum trajectory presented by red solid line can be observed it also explains the significant f 0 and 2f 0 components that exist in the original viv strains this asymmetrical pendulum movement may be caused by the asymmetrical drag force in an oscillation period to eliminate the effects of the flexible pipe pendulum motion caused by the forced motion and high frequency noise a bandpass filter was utilized the passband cutoff frequencies were set as 2 5f o and 30 hz a comparison of the original viv strain and filtered viv strain at the 5th gauge points vr 6 and kc 143 is shown in fig 8 although the strain caused by the cycloidal motion plays an important role in bending strain response this strain cannot be counted in the viv strain because this strain is not caused by the vortex shedding 3 2 displacement identified method according to the euler bernoulli beam theory the viv displacement response of the flexible pipe under the external load can be expressed as the sum of the mode shapes multiplied by the generalized coordinate values of each step the viv displacement response in the cf direction can be expressed as 10 y z t i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where y z t is the viv displacement response in the cf direction at the z location and p i t is the ith generalized coordinate displacement values at time t ϕ i z is ith displacement modal shape at the z location based on the small deformation assumption the curvature κ z t can be expressed as 11 κ z t 2 y z t z 2 i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where ϕ i is the ith modal shape of the curvature according to the geometric relationship between the curvature and strain the strain can be calculated by 12 ε z t κ z t r r i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where r denotes the radius of the flexible pipe model at the z location in our model mode shapes of the displacement are sinusoidal which can be expressed as 13 ϕ i z sin i π z l i 1 2 from eq 11 the mode shapes of the curvature are also sinusoidal after obtaining the mode shape of the displacement and curvature the modal generalized coordinates can be obtained from eq 12 then the viv displacement response in the cf direction can be calculated by eq 10 fig 9 presents the distribution of root mean square of viv displacement yrms d and viv strain ε rms along the flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 and kc 30 as shown in fig 9 a the blue and red lines present the viv displacement of bare and straked pipe respectively the viv displacement of bare pipe is larger than that of straked pipe it indicates that the helical strakes can also suppress the vortex induced vibration in an oscillatory flow to validate the displacement identification the identified viv strain was recalculated based on the reconstructed viv displacement through eq 11 curvature can be obtained by the second order difference of viv displacement to position z then identified strain values are further calculated by eq 12 as presented in fig 9 b the red dash line and blue solid line are the identified ε rms of straked and bare pipe respectively the red circle and blue square symbols represents the measured ε rms of straked and bare pipe respectively the identified values are in a good agreement with the measured one this consistency demonstrates the validity of displacement identification method for the flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow 3 3 time frequency analysis the shedding frequency changes with the periodic oscillation velocity of the model which can be written as 14 f s t t s t u t d where st refers to the strouhal number typically st 0 2 f st is the vortex shedding frequency under the effect of the periodically varying shedding frequency the viv characteristics in the cf direction vary with time this time varying feature has been reported to be the major difference between the viv in steady flow and that in oscillatory flow fu et al 2014 to investigate the time varying feature of the flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes the wavelet transformation is introduced to help analyze the time frequency distribution of the viv in oscillatory flow the continuous wavelet transform equation is expressed as 15 w t f a τ f t ψ a τ t a 1 2 f t ψ t τ a d t where wt f a τ is the coefficient of the time domain signal after the wavelet transformation which represents the frequency variation at that time scale parameter a is the scale factor τ is the shift factor and ψ t is the mother wavelet in this paper we use the morlet wavelet equation as the mother wavelet which can be defined as 16 ψ t ce t 2 2 cos 5 t 3 4 fatigue damage estimation the viv can cause serious fatigue damage to marine risers therefore it is necessary to estimate the fatigue damage of the flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes under different maximum reduced velocities vr and kc numbers the stresses σ at the outer pipe can be calculated by 17 σ z t e ε z t where e is the elastic modulus of the flexible pipe according to the miner palmgren hypothesis fatigue damage occurs when the accumulation of fatigue damage from the stress time histories with varying amplitudes satisfies eq 18 18 d a i n i n i 1 where n i is the number of cycles with the stress range δσ i n i is the number of cycles to failure for the specific stress range δσ i which can be expressed as eq 19 according to the s n curve 19 n i 10 log a m log δ σ i thus the total fatigue damage d ot can be calculated by the summation of the contribution from all cycles 20 d o t i n t o t d a i where ntot is the total number of the stress cycles in the viv time history the b1 s n curve from dnv rp c203 2011 is applied the main parameters are listed in table 3 4 results and discussions 4 1 viv responses of the bare pipe in oscillatory flow to investigate the effects of helical strakes on viv response in an oscillatory flow an experimental study of a bare pipe was firstly conducted as a benchmark for the bare pipe test cases the first mode is always dominant in our experiments therefore the results measured at the 5th gauge point that is in the middle of the pipe model z 1 73 m is used for further analysis fig 10 and fig 11 show the time history of the viv response and time frequency distribution in the case of vr 6 under a small kc number kc 30 and a large kc number kc 121 respectively each figure contains five subplots figure a is the time varying shedding frequency f st which is calculated based on eq 14 figure b is the viv displacement response which is reconstructed by utilizing the modal superposition method as proposed in section 3 2 figure c shows the time history of the modal weight p t of displacement figure d is the wavelet analysis of the strain signal the depth of the color indicates the concentration level of the strain components figure e presents the time varying natural frequency and viv response dominant frequency the blue dash and red solid lines represent the first and second order eigen frequency while the black line refers to the dominant frequency it should be noted that the first and second order eigen frequency f 1 f 2 have been calculated based on the measured time varying tension assuming the added mass coefficient to be equal to 1 as shown in fig 10 the shedding frequency calculated by eq 14 varies from 0 to 2 hz the viv displacement amplitude is less modulated and the maximum value reaches 0 64 d as seen from the wavelet results shown in fig 10 e the dominant frequency is always close to f 1 this indicates that the lock in occurs at first mode although the response is dominated by the 1st natural mode higher harmonics also occur under the small kc number kc 30 presented in fig 10 d however under the large kc number kc 121 as shown in fig 11 a strong amplitude modulation phenomenon appears and the viv developing process is comprised of three phases building up lock in and dying out the maximum viv displacement amplitude value reaches 0 65 d which is the same as that in the small kc number case these results are consistent with the viv features in oscillatory flow found by fu et al 2014 wang et al 2014 significant differences in the viv response between the small and large kc numbers will provide a good reference for investigating the effects of helical strakes the comparison of these distinct features between the bare and straked pipes will help in improving our understanding of the effects of helical strakes in an oscillatory flow 4 2 viv responses of the straked pipe in oscillatory flow 4 2 1 time varying responses of the straked pipe under a small kc number the effects of the helical strakes on the viv response in an oscillatory flow with a small and large kc number were investigated by comparing them to the experimental results of the bare pipe model fig 12 shows the viv response and time frequency distribution at the 5th gauge points of the straked flexible pipe in the case of a small kc number kc 38 with different reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 12 as shown in fig 12 a an obvious mode transition phenomenon is observed under vr 4 the dominant frequency represented by the black solid line of the straked pipe changes back and forth between the 1st and 2nd natural frequencies assuming the st number is equal to 0 2 the maximum shedding frequency of the straked pipe based on eq 14 should be 1 42 hz however this is much lower than the dominant response frequency found in the experiment as shown in the third subplot in fig 12 a this means that the helical strakes can result in a st number much larger than 0 2 a typical value for a bare pipe and significantly magnify the shedding frequency under a small reduced velocity however as the maximum reduced velocity increases to 6 8 and 12 mode transition and higher harmonic components disappear and the response characteristics are similar to those of the bare pipe as shown in fig 12 b and c the response becomes very steady and is always dominated by the 1st natural mode which is lower than the maximum shedding frequency this finding indicates that the strakes can reduce the dominant frequency and suppress the higher frequency response components under higher reduced velocities which is consistent with the results in uniform flow found by gao et al 2016 the main reason for the difference between the low and high reduced velocities as previously described may be attributed to the competition between the effects of the helical strakes on the breaking vortex and the prevention of interaction between two shear layers breaking vortex effects means the helical strakes break the large orderly vortex into many weak and messy ones the latter effect is that helical strakes prevent the two shear layers from affecting each other and make two layers parallel to the flow direction shown in fig 14 under a lower flow velocity a lower re number the vortex shedding from the two sides of the straked pipe is quite weak and very easily broken the breaking vortex leads to a higher response frequency however the vortex becomes stronger and sheds from the two sides of the straked pipe in parallel under a higher flow velocity a higher re number the interaction of the two shear layers is prevented by the helical strakes constantinides and oakley 2006 pinto et al 2006 the response frequency is reduced under this condition only one effect works under steady flow but two different effects on the response frequency will compete in oscillatory flow for easier understanding a sketch of the competition between the effects of the helical strakes under a small kc number with different reduced velocities is shown in figs 13 and 14 the maximum velocity of the forced motion under a low reduced velocity vr 4 is lower while the period of the forced motion is longer than that under a higher reduced velocity vr 8 the helical strakes always or at most times play the role of a breaking vortex under a lower reduced velocity thus the wake pattern contains many small vortex pairs which leads to a higher viv response frequency and mode transition phenomenon as the maximum velocity of the forced motion increases and the forced motion period decreases the effects of the helical strakes in preventing the interaction between the two shear layers become dominant under a higher reduced velocity as shown in fig 14 for example suppose the forced motion maximum velocity at vr 4 is the critical velocity between the two different effects presented in fig 13 below this critical velocity such as at time i and iii the vortex breaking effects play a leading role while above this critical velocity the shear layer interaction preventing effects dominate as shown in fig 14 the time of the vortex breaking effects is very short whereas the prevention of shear layer effect is long the prevention of shear layer reduces the dominant response frequency and the higher harmonic response frequency more insightful experiments and cfd simulations will be conducted in the near future to further show this interesting phenomenon 4 2 2 time varying responses of the straked pipe under a large kc number to further investigate the viv responses under a large kc number fig 15 shows the viv response and time frequency distribution at the 5th gauge point of the straked flexible pipe in the case of the large kc number which is approximately 100 the reduced velocities vary from 4 to 12 as vr is equal to 4 shown in fig 15 a a mode transition very often occurs and the response frequency is quite unstable a significantly higher response frequency component can be observed there are no obvious viv processes under such a low reduced velocity which is completely different from that of the bare pipe the main reason is that the vortex breaking effects of the helical strakes dominate in the cases of a vr 6 and 8 shown in fig 15 b and c respectively the time frequency distribution becomes very stable the response characteristics are similar to those of the bare pipes a stronger amplitude modulation and obvious viv developing process comprised of building up lock in and dying out can be seen the vortex breaking effects dominant under the low velocity cause higher harmonic responses in this case differing from the bare pipe as the reduced velocity increases to 12 a strong amplitude modulation still occurs while the viv developing process and higher harmonic response disappear the shorter cycle of the forced motion and higher velocity may serve as the main reasons which suppresses the vortex breaking effects in addition the vortex shedding process can be altered when the cylinder reverses its motion direction and encounters the previously shed vortices fu et al 2014 sumer and fredsøe 1988 the interaction stops the viv from developing and leads to a stronger response as previously explained the maximum values of the displacement at vr 6 8 and 12 are 0 07d 0 13d and 0 21d respectively the displacement of vr 12 is obviously larger than that at vr 6 and 8 this is consistent with the previously explained reason 4 2 3 st numbers of the straked pipes from the aforementioned investigation it can be seen that the two different effects of helical strakes have a significant influence on the time frequency distribution of the viv response however the aforementioned analysis can only provide some qualitative conclusions and hence the influence of the competition between the vortex breakage and shear layer interaction prevention needs further study to determine the influence of the helical strakes on the dominant frequency of the straked pipe under oscillatory flow the general frequency spectrum proposed by wang et al 2014 is introduced here and defined as 21 f ω i 1 10 f ˆ i ω where f ˆ i ω is the fft result at the ith gauge points and it is a function of the strain amplitude with respect to the response frequency f ω is the general amplitude frequency spectrum by summing the strain amplitude at the same frequency component for all of the 10 gauge points the general frequency spectrum of the straked pipe in the case of vr 8 and kc 56 is shown in fig 16 there is an obvious frequency peak at 1 75 hz 7f o the dominant frequency in this case contributions from 0 76 hz 3f o 1 0 hz 4f o 1 27 hz 5f o 1 52 hz 6f o 2 01 hz 8f o and 2 27 hz 9f o can also be seen but are quite insignificant typically the viv dominant frequency is governed by the st number to further investigate the exact value of the st number the relationship among the dominant frequency of the straked pipe number of vortex shedding pairs kc number under oscillatory flow and strouhal number can be defined as follows 22 n f d o m i f o 23 n k c f d o m i f o d f o u m f d o m i d u m s t n s t k c where f domi is the dominant frequency f o and u m are the forced oscillation frequency and velocity amplitude respectively it should be noted that the diameters d in eqs 22 and 23 for both bare and straked pipe cases are all adopted the same value of bare pipe the aforementioned relationship was firstly introduced to investigate the st number of a smooth rigid cylinder under oscillatory flow by sumer and fredsøe 1988 it has also been used by wang et al 2015 2016 2017b in the scr and free hanging riser model tests by summarizing the dominant frequency for all of the test cases the variation in the vortex shedding pairs with the kc number is shown in fig 17 the st number can be calculated based on eqs 22 and 23 significant differences between the bare and straked pipe under oscillatory flow are observed as shown in fig 17 a the vortex shedding pairs maintain a good linear relationship with kc numbers under vr 4 which is consistent with the results reported by sumer and fredsøe 1988 the st number is equal to 0 439 and 0 26 for the straked and bare pipes respectively it is unexpected that the st number of the straked pipe would be dramatically larger than that of a bare pipe which can be attributed to the vortex breaking effects of the helical strakes as previously mentioned this finding is contrary to that under uniform flow where the helical strakes can reduce the viv dominant frequency as reported by gao et al 2014 2015 2016 this means that the helical strakes can increase the viv dominant frequency under a low reduced velocity under oscillatory flow which may lead to serious fatigue damage when the reduced velocity increases competition between the effects of the helical strakes in vortex breaking and preventing the interaction between two shear layers appears this competition results in two distinct branches of the st numbers for the straked pipe under oscillatory flow the main phenomena are as follows 1 fig 17 b shows the st number relationship when vr is 6 for the bare pipe the st number is always equal to 0 18 which is slightly lower than the typical value of 0 2 for a straked pipe two branches with st 0 155 first branch and st 0 29 second branch appear the st number of the straked pipe is smaller than that of the bare pipe in the first branch with the kc number ranging from 20 to 70 while it is larger in the second branch with the kc number ranging from 70 to 140 this finding indicates that the helical strakes will decrease the viv dominant frequency in the first branch and increase it in the second branch the turning point kct is at approximately 70 2 similar features are also observed when the reduced velocity is equal to 8 as shown in fig 17 c the st number of the first and second branch is equal to 0 124 and 0 22 respectively the turning point kct is at approximately 80 3 as the reduced velocity reaches 12 two distinct branches still exist for the straked pipe in the first and second branches which are divided by a kct 100 the st number is equal to 0 107 and 0 148 respectively however the st numbers of the straked pipe in these two branches are both lower than that of the bare pipe 4 when the kc number further increases and is larger than the upper limit of that in the second branch vortex shedding pairs n decrease and do not maintain a linear relationship with kc number n decreases from 40 24 18 at kc 140 113 121 to 4 at kc 165 under vr 6 8 12 respectively the st numbers of the straked pipe in the two branches and bare pipe are summarized in table 4 for the straked pipe the st number decreases as the reduced velocity increases while the turning point kct shows an opposite tendency this finding indicates the effect of the helical strakes in preventing the interaction between the shear layers is stronger under a higher reduced velocity due to its dependency on the reynolds number to summarize the competition between the two effects of the helical strakes results in very complicated viv dominant frequency for the pipe under oscillatory flow it is possible that the helical strakes can cause more serious fatigue damage under some conditions and hence more attention should be paid to it during the engineering design process however under real ocean conditions higher mode number of the flexible riser will be excited and the riser will suffer a high re number in our experiments only the 1st mode was excited and it is impossible to systematically investigate the re number effects more experiments and numerical simulation of higher mode number and re number effects should be conducted in the near future 4 3 suppression efficiency of helical strakes in oscillatory flow 4 3 1 reduction ratio of viv amplitude response the vortex induced vibration suppression efficiency of the helical strakes 15 d in pitch and 0 25 d in height was tested in a rigid cylinder experiments under steady flow by schaudt et al 2008 obtaining at least 94 reduction however the suppression efficiency of a helical strake under oscillatory flow has not been studied the efficiency η is usually defined as 24 η y y s y 100 where y and y s are the standard deviation of the displacement for a bare and straked pipe respectively fig 18 shows the maximum displacement standard deviation of the viv of bare and straked pipes decreasing trend of viv response for bare pipe as kc number increases can be found in each test groups this trend is consistent with the results found by wang et al 2015 this is because the pipe encounters the previously shed vortexes as it reverses its directional motion such interaction is much stronger under small kc numbers leading to a larger amplitude this phenomenon can also be observed for a straked pipe under oscillatory flow for the same reason comparing the viv response between the bare and straked pipes the helical strake type can still effectively suppress the viv under oscillatory flow as expected however the suppression efficiency is not as high as that under uniform flow as reported by schaudt et al 2008 under a lower reduced velocity the broken shedding vortexes of the straked pipe are quite weak and cannot excite a significant viv under this condition the viv displacements are stable with the kc number as shown in fig 16 a while the interaction between the shed vortices of the two half cycles for the bare pipe is stronger the viv response decreases as the kc number increases therefore the suppression efficiency can reach 92 7 for a small kc number but decreases to 71 9 for a large kc number however for a higher reduced velocity vr 6 8 and 12 the interaction between the shed vortices of the two half cycles also occurs for the straked pipe but weaker than that for the bare pipe at small kc number thus lower suppression efficiency occurs at a small kc number as shown in fig 18 b c and d the minimum values of the suppression efficiencies are 62 6 50 8 and 64 3 in the small kc number case and the maximum values are 93 5 91 9 and 82 4 in the large kc number case for vr 6 8 12 respectively from above results the suppression efficiencies of straked pipe at large kc number seem to be similar to that in the uniform flow the breaking and messy vortex cannot excite a significant vibration this may be the main reasons for the higher suppression efficiency at larger kc number overall the suppression efficiency of the helical strakes with a pitch equal to 15 d and a height equal to 0 25 d can reach 50 at a minimum this also indicates that the suppression efficiency of other helical strake types should be verified under oscillatory flow 4 3 2 reduction ratio of fatigue damage although effective suppression of the viv of helical strakes studied in this paper can be seen from the amplitude reduction ratio the effects of the helical strakes on fatigue damage need further study by combining them with the complicated frequency characteristics of the helical strakes under oscillatory flow the viv displacement amplitude reduction ratio cannot be considered as the unique criteria to evaluate the suppression efficiency resvanis et al 2016 in our experiment a constant pretension of 500n was applied to the ends of the model to achieve the designed natural frequencies however the tension force t t varied with time due to both varying drag force from forced motions and viv response fig 19 presents the time history of tension forced on the end of flexible pipe measured by the force transducers the red dash line and solid line represent the tension force on straked and bare pipe respectively as shown in fig 19 compared with straked pipe the tension force of bare pipe varies more obviously especially for the case of larger kc number this can be attributed to that bare pipe possess more significant viv response than the straked pipe the time varying tension force can lead to a time varying stress and contribute to the fatigue damage thus the fatigue damage was derived from two parts time varying tension force and viv force to calculate the fatigue damage from measured strain signal in the model test the bending stress and variable tension stress should be first obtained the bending stress induced by viv can be calculated by combing eqs 9 and 17 where the tension stress is obtained from the measured strain signal as previously mentioned the measured strain contains ε t0 ε t z t and ε viv z t according to eqs 7 and 8 the variable tension strain ε t z t can then be expressed by eq 25 25 ε t z t ε c f a z t ε t 0 ε c f c z t ε t 0 2 in the eq 25 the initial tension strain ε t0 is obtained through averaging the initial strain as shown in fig 20 combing eqs 25 and 17 the variable tension stress can be calculated fig 21 presents the distributions of root mean square of stress caused by viv and varying tension force under kc 30 and 121 for vr 6 0 the solid line and dash line represent stress of bare and straked pipe respectively the blue line and red line represent the case of kc 30 and 121 respectively as shown in fig 21 a the more obvious viv response of bare pipe possesses more significant viv stress σviv rms than the straked one σviv rms at the middle points is obviously larger than those close to the end of the model while the tension stress σt rms distributes evenly along the pipe as shown in fig 21 b compared with σviv rms the stress derived from variable tension force is relatively smaller and there are no obvious differences under different kc numbers after obtaining the stress the stress cycles can be identified from the time history by the rainflow procedure amzallag et al 1994 then according to eq 20 fatigue damage derived from viv and varying tension force at each gauge point can be calculated based on eqs 18 20 respectively fig 22 shows the fatigue damage distributions along the flexible pipe under kc 30 and 121 for vr 6 as shown in fig 22 a it can be seen that the fatigue damage caused by viv bending strain dot viv at the middle location is larger due to more obvious viv response at this location dot viv of bare pipe is significant larger than that of straked one it indicates that the helical strakes can reduce the dot viv and prolong service life of the riser in an oscillatory flow fig 22 b shows the distribution of fatigue damage derived from the varying tension force dot t compared with dot viv the dot t distributes more evenly along the flexible pipe and very smaller dot t is about 104 orders of magnitude smaller than dot viv it means fatigue damage from variable tension force can be ignored in our experiments beyond that the variable tension force is not only caused by the viv it also affected by varying drag force from forced motions to investigate the effects of helical strakes on reducing fatigue damage caused by pure viv response the maximum fatigue damage of dot viv in each case is summarized fig 23 shows the variation in the maximum fatigue damage of dot viv with kc number for a bare and straked pipe the maximum fatigue damage decreases as the kc number increases for the bare pipe the reason is the same as discussion of the viv response amplitude distribution shown in fig 18 compared to the fatigue damage of the bare pipe we surprisingly found that the maximum fatigue damage of the straked pipe under a low reduced velocity vr 4 is close to that of the bare pipe at a large kc number combining the strouhal relationship shown in fig 17 and response amplitude distribution shown in fig 18 a higher viv dominant frequency caused by the vortex breaking effect of the helical strakes may be the main reason for this phenomenon as shown in fig 23 a the fatigue damage reduction rate is over 95 while it decreases to 41 at a kc 121 when the reduced velocity further increases to 6 8 and 12 as shown in fig 23 b c and d respectively a similar trend of viv response amplitude distribution is also observed in the maximum fatigue damage the fatigue damage of the straked pipe under a small kc number is not as ideal as that under a large kc number although the dominant frequency of the straked pipe at the second branch as previously mentioned is higher than that of the bare pipe the response amplitude is effectively reduced at this branch thus the effects of the two branches on the strouhal number caused by covering the helical strakes cannot be seen in the maximum fatigue damage distribution due to limitation of the length of the flexible pipe higher modes were not excited in our experiments in the future more work to excite higher mode of a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow will be conducted overall the fatigue damage for the straked pipe under oscillatory flow under a low reduced velocity and small kc number is larger and should be paid more attention in practical engineering projects 5 conclusions in this paper an experimental study of a flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes was conducted in oscillatory flow under a kc number ranging from 20 to 160 and a maximum reduced velocity varying from 4 to 12 compared with bare pipe the effects of the helical strakes on the viv response st number suppression efficiency and fatigue damage under oscillatory flow were investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 under a lower reduced velocity the mode transition phenomenon for the straked pipe is quite obvious and the helical strakes can significantly increase the viv dominant frequency the strouhal number of the straked pipe can reach 0 439 which is nearly twice that of the typical st number measured during a steady flow experiment 2 under a higher reduced velocity two distinct branches in the variation of the st number against the kc number are observed the helical strake reduces the dominant frequency in the first branch with a small kc number while it increases it in the second branch with a large kc number 3 the helical strake shows its effects in suppressing viv under oscillatory flow however the suppression efficiency of the viv and fatigue damage particularly under the conditions of a small kc number and low reduced velocity is not as high as that under steady flow more attentions should be paid to this phenomenon in practical engineering projects acknowledgments the authors gratefully

22471,air cushion vehicle acv flexible seals operate in a complex and chaotic environment dominated by fluid structure interaction an efficient means to explore relationships between interdependent governing parameters that affect performance is through high fidelity numerical simulation as previous numerical efforts have employed separate iterative partitioned solvers or have implemented

is a flexible hull structure that interfaces with the supporting surface and captures a cushion of air beneath a marine surface craft the seal environment is highly dynamic and difficult to characterize with multiple scaling relationships in play thus seal design at present remains an iterative evolutionary process based upon subscale testing and simplistic theoretical models this requires that designs are established early in a craft s development program at great expense with minimal opportunity for modification concurrent to final craft design with recent advancements in computational methods for fluid structure interactions fsi the development and employ of seal design tools can supplement the traditional design approach and consequently be relevant at all stages of craft development while recent experimental research has focused on the problem of seal resistance doctors et al 2014 wiggins 2014 zalek and doctors 2010 concurrent computational approaches have utilized physical and algorithmic simplifications for both the fluid and structural models for example kramer 2013 studied interactions between the bow and stern seals with attention to effects on resistance but at the expense of using hinged rigid seals and linearized potential flow fluid models challa 2015 explored the problem with idealized membrane seals using explicit methods and loose coupling even smoothed particle hydrodynamic approaches have been explored for this application gilbert 2015 yang 2011 in the most detailed computational effort to date where more accurate physical models for the seal fluid and interaction are employed separate partitioned solvers were required at high complexity and computational cost bloxom 2014 thus there remains much to learn regarding how seal materials are chosen how their geometries can be beneficially arranged and what scaling laws are suitable the work described in this paper takes the next step in computational approaches to the problem of acv seal resistance it seeks to verify and validate modeling approaches that accurately represent the physics of the seal fluid interaction within an integrated computational desktop star ccm ver 12 04 011 thus enabling more efficient predictions of resistance for these craft this paper is largely based upon a more extensive study documented in doctoral work by cole 2018 in computational approach below details of the numerical physics models employed are described in elastic beam fsi benchmark the canonical fsi problem by turek and hron 2006 is simulated to explore sensitivities to various solver parameters using star ccm in acv planer bow seal a model is developed to replicate the geometry and conditions used in both the experimental work of zalek and doctors et al 2014 and the numerical work of bloxom 2014 descriptions of the model development computational parameters and results follows finally a dimensional analysis identifies key physical variables and scaling dependencies that should be considered when exploring the problem of acv seal resistance 2 computational approach this section describes the computational approach for conducting a numerical simulation of flexible acv seals in a free surface flow with the advancement of computational toolsets that can be applied to fsi problems and the recent success of the related work mentioned above it is logical to investigate seal resistance in this manner observing lessons learned and previous successes by other researchers bloxom 2014 gilbert 2015 yang 2011 a documented and prevalent commercial tool is pursued here rather than devoting resources to write a novel and potentially computationally inefficient research code the computational costs for solving nonlinear large deformation problems implicitly are burdensome bloxom 2014 farhat et al 2010 hubner et al 2004 vierendeels 2006 due to the extreme nonlinearities and structural deformation anticipated a dynamic explicit approach for solving the problem was initially pursued however following significant verification and validation work this approach was abandoned due to the inability to adequately resolve the pressure field and thus the seal resistance as there is great appeal in handling both the fluid and structure in the same computational space star ccm was initially discounted for this effort due to the cost and complexity of co simulating a separate structural solver however in mid 2015 star ccm made available a linear elastic finite element solver capable of nonlinear geometry deformation with this software advancement a partitioned fsi simulation could now be conducted all within star ccm this is a significant advantage especially in a production type environment where limited resources are available to develop the coupling algorithm additionally only a single license is required an incompressible segregated approach for solving the navier stokes equations simple algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 is used for the fluid for turbulent flow simulations a reynolds averaged navier stokes formulation is used as large seal deformations will result in cell skewness and an unstructured grid the standard spalart allmaras ssa model spalart and allmaras 1992 is chosen to solve the turbulent eddy viscosity parameter for the reynolds stress tensor while other turbulence models were considered previous research has shown the ratio of frictional force to pressure force is small bloxom 2014 thus minimizing the sensitivity to turbulence model further as a small near wall mesh size can decrease stability of a partitioned fsi simulation and limit the stable timestep size the simplistic ssa model is justified accurate modeling of the fluid vorticity is important in turbulent flow and it is important to consider the treatment of the wall boundary layer the boundary layer can be divided into the laminar sublayer y 5 buffer layer 5 y 30 and the log law layer 30 y 500 where y is the non dimensional wall distance popovac and hanjalic 2007 each sublayer is characterized by a different relationship between velocity and y for rans simulations in star ccm an all y treatment can be specified to blend the various relationships as dictated by the mesh size adjacent to the wall this is especially useful for fsi simulations where grid size may be limited and where mesh deformation is present near moving boundaries in star ccm numerous discretization schemes are offered to solve the transport equations in this work the transient term is typically evaluated using a first order scheme euler implicit when steady state is sought and a second order backwards differentiation scheme when a time accurate unsteady solution is sought for the convective flux term second order upwind is generally specified except in cases where additional spatial dissipation afforded by the first order upwind scheme is helpful the diffusive term is approximated using a second order expression additional descriptions of the numerical methodologies implemented within star ccm are found in the code s documentation siemens 2018 the volume of fluids vof method hird and nichols 1981 is implemented to deduce the boundary surface by the makeup of individual cell volume fractions in many modern cfd codes the vof method has become a popular approach due to its ability to handle both large deformations of the free surface as well as problems where multiple immiscible fluid species are present to resolve a sharply defined surface at the air water interface star ccm employs a blend of a first order upwind fou scheme and the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme muzaferija et al 1999 this combination of hric and fou provides sharpness when the local courant number c is small and stability when it is high at the expense of a smeared interface thus it is important to solve the transport equation with sufficiently small timesteps to maintain a resolved interface to control the fou hric blending a user defined upper courant limit c u and lower courant limit c l is compared to the local courant number when c c l hric is used when c l c c u the schemes are blended via interpolation when c u c fou is used in this work the c l is raised artificially high to force exclusive use of the hric scheme to accommodate large structural deformation without successive remeshing mesh motion technology is employed in star ccm via multiquadric interpolation hardy 1990 to reduce the computational cost of this operation control vertex thinning is applied to reduce the number of vertices in the displacement field interpolation geometric conservation is then achieved by applying a grid flux correction to the convective flux term in the finite volume discretization to account for the volume change as the strength of the numerical coupling required will vary according to the problem at hand the fsi coupling solver offered within star ccm provides various means to control and stabilize the interaction for the present work only a two way fully coupled iterative scheme is used this is appropriate for strongly coupled interactions and when the artificial added mass instability influences the solution rugonyi and bathe 2001 hubner et al 2004 lohner et al 2006 vierendeels 2006 farhat et al 2010 it is noted that the fsi coupling solver offers an added mass correction which portends to alleviate the numerical instability due to acceleration of the structure however because of a lack of visibility into the methods of this correction it is not implemented at any time within the present study fig 1 provides an overview of the coupling scheme employed following initialization the fluid solver develops the initial field variables and maps the pressure loading to the contacting structural surface the structural solver updates the nodal displacements and the inner iteration convergence criteria are evaluated if the minimum iterations have not been achieved or the residuals remain above the predetermined limit the fluid solver and structural solver recompute their respective domains in this way the fluid and structure iterate together to find an equilibrium within the time step once the solvers meet the established iteration convergence criteria the mesh morpher solver updates the nodal positions within the fluid domain and the time step is advanced this loop continues until the outer iteration stopping criteria are met 3 elastic beam fsi benchmark the first problem explored is that of an incompressible newtonian fluid interacting with an elastic solid in laminar channel flow turek and hron 2006 first proposed this problem as a means to rigorously evaluate potential fsi coupling schemes and algorithms it consists of a cylinder transverse to the flow with an elastic beam attached to the trailing edge fig 2 while the problem boundaries and conditions appear deceptively simple the fluid solution is complex due to self induced oscillations vortex shedding and added mass effects for this reason this problem is referenced and utilized often within the fsi community breuer et al 2012 giannelis and vio 2015 engels et al 2015 turek et al 2011 while nine variations of the problem are provided in the benchmark reference in this work we focus on three cases cfd3 validates the fluid solution by holding the elastic beam fixed so that only oscillations of the fluid are captured csm2 removes the fluid and allows the structure to freely fall under the influence of gravity only fsi3 allows for full interaction between the fluid and structure due to the transient nature of this problem time histories of the tip position fluid oscillation frequencies as well as lift and drag forces upon the submerged body are captured as the comparative benchmark data the problem parameters are provided in table 1 the problem setup using star ccm 12 04 011 is as follows as the fluid is considered incompressible and transient an implicit unsteady segregated solver is utilized having a second order upwind convection scheme under relaxation factors for the velocity and pressure equations are set to 0 6 and 0 2 respectively for boundary conditions a no slip condition is applied on the channel top and bottom walls and cylinder beam surfaces the sides of the channel z normal are slip walls a pressure outlet of p 0 pa is applied to the exit and the fluid speed and pressure are initialized at zero a time varying parabolic velocity inlet condition is applied pursuant to that of the benchmark problem by means of a user defined field function within star ccm it is given in equations 1 and 2 u is the characteristic velocity and u is the spatially and temporally varying inflow velocity 1 u 0 y t u 0 y 1 cos π 2 t 2 i f t 2 0 s u 0 y o t h e r w i s e 2 u 0 y 1 5 u 4 0 0 1681 y 0 41 y the original benchmark problem is strictly two dimensional and results are presented per unit depth however star ccm requires three dimensions in order to utilize the fluid structure coupling solver therefore the baseline fluid mesh is developed using the automatic mesh functionality nested within the directed mesh approach a volume distribution of a single 1 m element is applied in the z direction to provide the third dimension an unstructured triangle background mesh and two volumetric refinements establish the topology the first refinement volume targets a surface size of 50 of the base size and the second refinement volume targets a surface size of 25 of the base the element length growth rate is limited to 1 1 to ensure smooth transitions between refinement areas simulations are conducted on three grid levels using base sizes of 0 020 m 0 010 m and 0 005 m in order to confirm grid independence as well as verify the observed order of accuracy ooa the solid stress solver is specified to use a 2nd order newmark implicit integration scheme newmark parameter 0 5 to minimize the numerical damping which would occur in the default 1st order backward euler scheme solid displacement motion is specified for the region thus enabling nonlinear geometry via updates of the stiffness matrix at each iteration 3 1 cfd3 benchmark the first scenario benchmarks the fluid solution utilizing the parameters for cfd3 and the geometry above second order temporal discretization is implemented and the time step is fixed at δt 0 005 s cfl based time step control is not applied as initial simulations revealed elevated momentum residuals at this time step additional iteration stopping criteria are established to ensure suitable convergence prior to progressing to the next time step the normalized residual minimum is 1e 1 and the minimum inner iterations per time step are 50 initially the solver had problems achieving these normalized residuals improvements to the convergence is found by reducing the width of the domain in the z direction to 0 01 m thus improving the x z aspect ratio generally the minimum iterations provided a residual convergence of 1e 5 or lower due the problem s transient nature a 10 s simulation is required to establish both fully developed flow and a steady fluid oscillation fig 3 plots lift versus time and reveals the initial instability and eventual steady oscillation by approximately 8 5 s fig 4 shows the magnitude of velocity at the end of the simulation revealing oscillation in the fluid downstream of the structure as the lift and drag results are time dependent and subject to small perturbations they are presented similar to the reference solution as mean amplitude frequency to arrive at the values in this work first the averages of the extreme minimums m i n a v e and extreme maximums m a x a v e are calculated for the period of the final three oscillations then the mean amplitude and frequency are calculated according to equations 3 5 respectively the frequency calculation is also an average as it considers the total number of cycles n c y c that occur between the time of the initial extreme maximum t m a x i n i t and final extreme maximum t m a x f i n a l 3 m e a n 1 2 m a x a v e m i n a v e 4 a m p l i t u d e 1 2 m a x a v e m i n a v e 5 f r e q u e n c y n c y c t m a x i n i t t m a x f i n a l in turek and hron 2006 these values were obtained using a single final interval in the simulation however without a clear indication of the exact time period used it is difficult to maintain consistency between the reference solution and this work thus the averaging approach described above is taken a summary of the lift and drag results for the simulation at each mesh level are tabulated in table 2 at δt 0 005 s the drag result at the finest mesh of 441 44 6 56 n 4 26 hz is a good match to the turek and hron 2006 reference solution of 439 45 5 6183 n 4 40 hz the mean drag differs by only 0 45 while the amplitude differs by 16 7 at the finest mesh level the frequency differs by only 3 19 at the finest mesh level a strouhal analysis is conducted as a separate means to validate the observed shedding frequency at the frequency of 4 26 hz the characteristic velocity and cylinder diameter provide a strouhal number of st 0 22 this is consistent with a long cylinder in uniform flow of re 200 of course the non uniform inflow and constricting channel serves to increase the frequency whereas the fixed trailing beam decreases frequency these off setting features do not appear to have a significantly altered the shedding frequency from that of an ideal cylinder the lift result at the finest mesh of 2 13 462 80 n 4 26 hz varies more considerably from the reference solution of 11 90 437 81 n 4 40 hz the mean lift has shifted to a more neutral value while the amplitude differs by 5 7 at the finest mesh level the magnitude of these differences is not too concerning especially when other researchers have shown similar deviations for this benchmark using other commercial software for instance giannelis and vio 2015 under predicted the amplitudes of lift and drag for cfd3 by 3 3 and 13 3 respectively using ansys fluent the variation in this case was attributed to increasing mesh size downstream of the structure in table 2 the effect of mesh spacing shows the present solutions converge toward the reference solutions with increased refinement as the cell sizes resulting from the automated mesh are specified as a percentage of the base size global refinements are uniformly implemented by simply halving the base size the formal refinement ratio r is 2 however the unstructured mesh results in slightly imperfect successive mesh refinements and thus it is useful to assess convergence using the effective refinement ratio r eff 1 88 kwasniewski 2013 the observed order or accuracy ooa based upon the mean drag value is calculated as 1 84 using methods from roache 1994 this confirms the formal accuracy as second order for the upwind convection scheme using richardson s extrapolation the mean drag exact solution is found as f exact 439 76 n clearly showing agreement 0 07 error with the reference solution of 439 45 n in order to remain consistent with the reference solution the time step utilized above is taken a priori from turek and hron 2006 in order to assess the effect of temporal refinement in the current star ccm implementation additional runs are conducted at a reduced timestep assuming the general practice of using a timestep of 1 100 of the fundamental period δt is set to 0 002275 s the updated results table 2 show improvements in all regards which reveals the importance of time step size in highly transient problems on the finest mesh the mean drag differs by only 0 42 the drag amplitude differs by only 2 13 and the drag frequency differs by 1 01 most improved are results for lift the mean lift differs by 2 52 and the lift amplitude differs by 3 61 the ooa is calculated as 1 87 and the prediction of the exact solution f exact differs from the benchmark result by only 0 034 in summary these cfd3 results show a successful implementation of the fluid solution for the benchmark problem both the spatial and temporal refinements yielded consistent improvements when compared to the benchmark drag result the fluid solution is therefore considered verified based upon ooa and convergence it is considered validated based upon the relative error to the benchmark results for drag and lift additional fluid benchmarks are not attempted here as further verifications can be found in the extensive star ccm verification suite siemens 2018 3 2 csm2 benchmark the next benchmark focuses solely upon the structure using parameters of csm2 with identical geometry to the previous problem the elastic beam remains cantilevered to the cylinder and is allowed to deform under the influence of a gravitational body force 2 m s2 the surrounding fluid is removed from the simulation and there is no numerical material damping the analysis is static dynamics of the beam are not considered and the steady state tip displacement is reported as the reference result a directed mesh operation is used to uniformly discretize the beam both through the thickness and along the length as the simulation is quasi two dimensional only one element is specified in the width for all models the mid side vertex option is activated to achieve quadratic continuum elements which enables increased accuracy in bending when only one element is used through the beam thickness the coarsest mesh uses 1 element through the thickness and 20 elements along the length element counts are doubled in each dimension for successive meshes the linear isotropic elastic material model provides the constitutive relations with properties defined in table 1 above the csm2 benchmark result for the present star ccm implementation is shown in table 3 in general increased refinement appears to converge both the x displacement and y displacement toward the reference solution however a 0 94 error remains even for the finest mesh which is significantly discretized a richardson extrapolation of the exact solution for y displacement based upon the convergence results is given by f exact 1 683e 2 m this result is closer to that obtained by mesh level 1 1 681e 2 m than the reference solution 1 697e 2 m f exact differs from the benchmark by 0 8 at face value the ooa appears to under perform the formal order of 2 however it is quickly observed that the increased bending accuracy afforded by quadratic elements suppresses apparent improvements due to additional thickness discretization for an interesting comparison on the effects of using the mid side vertex option and additional mesh level lb is developed by reducing the thickness discretization to a single element while the level 1 length is maintained the close match of mesh 1b to f exact reveals the relative insensitivity to thickness discretization for this problem when using quadratic elements in summation the solid stress solver is shown to perform adequately and is considered validated based upon tip displacements approaching the benchmark result 3 3 fsi3 benchmark using the solvers geometry boundary conditions and discretization described above the next scenario attempted is fsi3 the specified parameters result in both strong artificial added mass effects and large deflections as the elastic material density provides ρ f ρ s 1 and the characteristic inflow provides re 200 eleven different simulations are used to explore variabilities in time step spatial discretization inner iterations under relaxation of the fsi solver and fsi coupling method a comprehensive set of results are shown in table 4 discussions for each case comparison are provided below 3 3 1 cases 1 through 3 effect of spatial discretization for δt 0 001 s cases 1 through 3 are conducted to investigate the effect of spatial discretization for three mesh levels at a timestep of δt 0 001 s the results provided in table 4 show mixed performance as the mesh is refined at the finest mesh level the mean drag only varies from the reference solution by 2 3 however the frequency of oscillation is significantly lower also the mean lift does not show monotonic convergence toward the reference solution and exhibits even larger errors in amplitude and frequency as a cause for this departure inspection of the fluid residuals achieved using 10 iterations per timestep reveals dramatic differences in convergence achieved between periods when the tip acceleration is small and when it is large a clear indicator of artificial added mass instability the solution is to either reduce the timestep or add additional iterations to bring the residuals down 3 3 2 cases 4 through 6 effect of spatial discretization for δt 5e 4 s cases 4 through 6 are conducted to investigate the effect of spatial discretization for three mesh levels at a reduced timestep of δt 5e 4 s when compared to the previous cases at the larger timestep the results in table 4 show improvements in every category mean force values are in better agreement with the reference solutions and the frequencies are approaching those reported as well while it is obvious that a timestep reduction of 50 results in twice as many total iterations for an equivalent simulated time an improvement to the results is only provided because the timescale of the fluid structure interaction is smaller than the current temporal discretization on the finest mesh level the mean drag error is 0 6 the lift amplitude is over predicted on all meshes achieving the best error of 4 7 on the finest mesh 3 3 3 cases 6 7 and 8 effect of fsi under relaxation for δt 5e 4 s cases 6 7 and 8 are conducted at equal temporal and spatial discretization to investigate the effect of the fsi solver under relaxation ur factor 0 4 0 5 and 0 9 respectively ur factor stabilizes the interaction by reducing the structural displacements provided by the structural solver at each iteration low values of ur increase stability whereas high values reduce it values for ur below 0 4 were attempted but convergence became a problem with inner iterations limited to 10 attempts to run the problem without under relaxation ur 1 0 failed quickly within the first several time steps table 4 shows that as the ur factor is increased the mean drag and mean lift are improved but only marginally the oscillation frequency for all cases remains low indicating elevated numerical damping at these case settings as increased relaxation decreases in ur serves to stabilize the interaction at the cost of accuracy it stands to reason that cases with higher levels of relaxation should be afforded more iterations this is evident by comparing case 6 to case 10 below doubling the iterations from 10 to 20 for the same ur gave improvements in tip displacement mean drag mean lift and frequency the takeaway for this study is that an ur value of 0 5 up to 0 9 should prove adequate when inner iterations are limited and temporal accuracy is not required as in the case when an unsteady approach is used to reach a steady state interaction for accurate solutions of time dependent problems good convergence is required at each time step 3 3 4 cases 6 9 10 and 11 effect of inner iterations for δt 5e 4 s the final cases of 9 10 and 11 are conducted at equal temporal and spatial discretization to investigate the effect of inner iterations as convergence of the fluid equations is concerned it is typical to set a minimum limit to the residuals such as 1e 7 in order to obtain consistent levels of iterative error across various simulations this is especially important when comparative cpu time studies are performed however this can be difficult to achieve for fsi problems with large added mass effects in this work the desire is to explore the capability of the fsi solver when subjected to an explicit number of inner iterations provided the fluid residuals have converged below some minimum level this is because choice of the fsi displacement under relaxation parameter has an effect on the rate of fsi convergence generally a smaller under relaxation parameter slows convergence and increases stability while a larger under relaxation parameter speeds convergence up to a point and decreases stability further the rate of convergence changes throughout the simulation due to the unsteadiness of the problem thus the choice to explicitly hold the previous cases to 10 inner iterations per time step cases 9 10 and 11 explore this factor as an independent variable the results in table 4 generally show improvements in tip displacement mean drag and mean lift as the number of inner iterations increases percent errors in the mean drag are all 1 or less while the best error achieved for mean lift is 4 this is considered acceptable as sheldon et al 2014 achieved drag errors between 2 and 4 in their partitioned solution of fsi2 table 5 shows the percent error between the present results and the benchmark for tip y displacement drag and lift as residuals are reduced with increased iterations the influence of the artificial added mass instability can be seen observe that while the mean and amplitude of y displacement improves consistently with increased iterations the drag and lift forces are not as consistent the percent error of lift amplitude increases with additional inner iterations fig 5 plots the tip y displacement and lift versus time for case 11 where the artificial added mass instability is greatest although the displacement of the seal is clearly stable the artificial added mass effect upon the fluid solution results in a clear beating of the lift result the artificially is demonstrated in that the beating is a numerical pressure result only no oscillation is observed in the y displacement itself regarding the differences between the reference solutions and the present work it should be mentioned that the reference solutions appear to use one oscillation period to determine the values for the mean amplitude and frequency as the time histories reveal small variations in period and amplitude throughout the simulation the only means for an equivalent comparison is for the benchmark to specifically state the time for which the measurements were made which it does not for this reason the present results are averages as defined previously in equation 3 through equation 5 this subtle difference could account for some portion of the relative percent errors the work above clearly shows time accurate results for unsteady fsi problems require judicious selection of the solver parameters despite a finely resolved mesh timestep fsi ur and convergence are all important factors for unsteady periodic solutions when added mass instability is present concessions in levels of convergence and inner iterations can be acceptable when an efficient means to reach steady state is required finally it is demonstrated that high limits on inner iterations can do more harm than good for problems where added mas effect is present in summation the work presented using star ccm for this benchmark verifies the chosen solvers and validates their integrated use for tightly coupled two way fsi simulations 4 acv planer bow seal this validation problem replicates a planer bow seal experiment conducted at the university of michigan as documented in work by zalek and doctors 2010 doctors et al 2014 and wiggins 2014 the effort entailed a large scale experimental approach to develop an ses acv bow seal post buckling model and dataset useful for numerical validation a planer bow seal was instrumented to capture resistance and deflection data at various inflation pressures and immersions doctors 2012 and doctors et al 2014 developed theoretical seal resistance models flat parabolic cubic for comparison with the experimental results good agreement between the cubic seal theory is achieved at low froude numbers but not at higher ones this indicates important physics at higher speeds may not be properly captured in the theoretical model further the large deviations in non dimensional resistance at the highest froude number reveals the difficulty in experimentally collecting meaningful data at some conditions the planer bow seal experiment was also analyzed in numerical work by bloxom 2014 he coupled star ccm and abaqus implicit to simulate the um experiment while this approach provided good agreement to the experiment the complexity and cost of multiple simultaneous simulations could be improved upon for future work this effort removes abaqus and instead uses star ccm s newly available embedded structural solver for the seal as star ccm is a modern commercial multi physics simulation code it offers a large variety of numerical approaches and physics models thus the choice of solvers models and boundary conditions is not as straight forward as the preceding numerical benchmark to maintain the stability of the seal a significant number of test cases and model explorations have been conducted to establish a robust simulation approach this section describes that approach and provides a comparison of the results to the prior experimental and numerical work 4 1 geometry and mesh the computational domain developed is shown in fig 6 and fig 7 in general the geometry parts that define the physical space of both the test platform and tow tank are established to be a near representation of the um experiment particulars are given in table 6 the computational domain can be broken down into the static mesh fluid region the morphing mesh fluid region the seal structural region and the fan region the static mesh fluid region extends 11 5 m downstream of the inlet and 11 0 m upstream of the outlet it surrounds the morphing mesh region and provides surfaces for various wall inlet and outlet boundaries the morphing mesh fluid region is 3 5 m in length and surrounds the seal conforming the mesh to the structural deformation the fan region is 2 m long and interacts with the static mesh fluid region to provide the required cushion pressure the large computational domain length of 26 m is required in order to damp sloshing of the fluid that occurs during startup while initial models utilized an inlet and outlet separated from the platform by only a few meters it was quickly observed that excessively long run times would be required to slowly accelerate the flow without disturbing the volume fraction values in the vicinity of the seal while the beam of the platform used in the um experiment was 1 524 m a two dimensional solution approach using single cell through the beam y direction is used to minimize node count initially a 1 m length was chosen for the beam to simplify scaling to the experimental values however it was soon observed that the y momentum residuals were unstable it is surmised that the spatial aspect ratios led to divergence of the vof solver the problem was solved by reducing the beam cell size to δy 0 01 m various surface and volume meshing tools are provided by star ccm to construct the baseline mesh first an automated meshing operation is established for the static and morphing fluid regions a trimmed cell mesher establishes the basic mesh while a custom surface control refines the mesh as it approaches the seal front surface four volumetric control areas are included to selectively refine the mesh in various regions of interest one refinement area covers the initial free surface and uses a cell height of approximately δz 0 008 m two refinement areas cover the area immediately upstream of the seal and use cell heights of approximately δz 0 008 m and 0 004 m the final refinement area covers the entire free surface within the cushion and downstream and uses a cell height of δz 0 015 m fig 8 shows the results of these refinements in order to more closely resolve the boundary layer along the seal a prism layer mesh is applied to its front surface fig 9 it is six layers deep with an overall thickness of 0 008 m and a constant growth ratio of 1 3 surface mesh and volume mesh extruders discretize the domain upstream and downstream of the seal using 10 and 8 layers respectively and a constant growth ratio of 1 2 finally directed mesh operations are performed on the fan and seal in order to closely control the cell count and node spacing growth the seal structure utilizes 100 cells along the length and is biased to where the cell edge length at the attachment is 10 of the cell edge length at the tip the additional refinement at the location of greatest curvature increases accuracy of the solution two quadratic elements are used through the seal thickness 4 2 fluid physics models and solvers for the bow seal problem the incompressible simplification is made for both the water and air and the rans equations are solved using the simple algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 the ssa turbulence model under relaxation 0 75 is used with an initial turbulent viscosity ratio 10 an all y wall treatment is specified and y values were generally observed to be 30 for the mesh sizes and grid deformations throughout the simulation the implicit unsteady solver with first order temporal discretization is used to advance time in a transient analysis toward a steady state while this study seeks to reach a stable interaction in order to evaluate the steady seal resistance there are two significant restrictions which prevent the use of a steady time model first updates to the seal structural stiffness matrix must be made periodically in order for the structural solver to find a stable solution if the seal displacement is too large for the given timestep the structural solver has significant difficulty bringing the interaction into equilibrium regardless of the number of iterations second the multiple fluid species air water require limitations on the cfl number in order to maintain resolution and stability of the mixing interface moderate cfl numbers 1 0 result in diffusion and smearing of the free surface for this problem therefore convective cfl time step control is activated with a target mean cfl 0 2 and a target max cfl 0 5 the vof solver under relaxation 0 5 is utilized and the hric scheme is maintained for surface tracking by holding the local courant number limits c u and c l to 1 0 and 0 5 respectively the angle factor c θ is modified to 0 5 to improve resolution of the surfaces moving normal to the mesh the flat wave model option within the vof solver is utilized to establish the initialized free surface height and inlet velocities to damp sloshing of the free surface resulting from startup a wave damping boundary option is applied to the inlet and outlet boundaries with damping lengths of 2 0 m the mesh morpher is activated in the morphing fluid region and the fluid nodes at the seal interface are free to move as dictated by motion of the seal nodes a boundary plane constraint is applied to the sides of the morphing fluid region to allow nodal motion in the x z plane only a control vertex thin out factor of 1 0 is used to maximize the number of boundary vertices used in the displacement field interpolation similarly for the seal nodes along the fluid structure interface are free to displace according to the stress field in the x z plane but are constrained in the y direction 4 3 fan physics models in order to build gage pressure within the cushion a fan momentum source region is added just above the cushion fig 7 and a contact interface is established between the regions to allow free exchange to control the source strength a fan curve is prescribed for each of the pressure conditions simulated according to table 7 the developed pressure is reduced with increased volumetric flowrate to provide a stable cushion pressure through a large range of flows to increase cushion stability the flowrate magnitudes are tailored to accommodate momentary periods of venting when the free surface profile falls below the aft seal should the pressure fall too quickly seal stability can be lost this occurrence is more prevalent in the high cushion pressure cases where depression of the free surface is greatest 4 4 seal physics model and solver for the seal the implicit unsteady solid stress solver is activated and specified to use a 2nd order newmark temporal discretization newmark parameter 0 5 newmark 1959 solid displacement motion is specified to enable nonlinear geometry via updates of the stiffness matrix at each iteration to improve stability and reduce the influence of numerical noise in the structure rayleigh damping zienkiewicz and taylor 1991 is activated with the mass coefficient α 10 hz and the stiffness coefficient β 0 86 s as the steady state solution is sought the choice of the damping coefficients is made to moderately over damp the low frequencies of the structure the top edge of the seal is spatially fixed the edges are constrained normal to the domain sides y direction and the remaining seal surfaces are unconstrained point monitors are attached to the seal front surface to track displacements of these specific points fig 10 previous research has shown that seal materials such as those tested in the um bow seal experiment are more accurately modeled when a hyperelastic description is used for the flexural modulus of the rubber coating wiggins 2014 bloxom 2014 however as of the time of this work only linear elastic material models are offered as part of the solid stress solver within star ccm this adds to the difficulty of replicating the test results exactly further complicating the issue the seal materials are typically laminates consisting of rubber coated nylon fabrics at this time it is not possible to employ a multi layer solid in combination with the partitioned fsi solver for this reason the seal is modeled as a single isotropic linear elastic material rather than the rubber coated fiber bloxom 2014 used a three layer model of the seal with an inextensible fabric layer sandwiched between rubber layers described by the hyperelastic mooney rivlin material model he performed a cantilever bending test of a sample of the seal material used in the experiment in order to determine the mooney rivlin coefficients to validate the choice of linear elastic modulus used in star ccm s solid stress solver a series of cantilever seal simulations is conducted similar to that performed by bloxom in an attempt to match his experimental data the material sample is 0 35 m long 0 00375 m thick and is cantilevered at 45 it is fixed in all degrees of freedom at the attachment and is allowed to deflect only due to its gravitational body force the mesh is constructed using 100 c3d20 cells with a 10 1 bias toward the attachment an implicit solver in abaqus is used to efficiently reach steady state abaqus is chosen to solve this series of simulations as an independent means to tune the seal modulus the seal deflections are compared to bloxom s data in fig 11 for moduli of 2 0 4 0 4 5 and 8 5 mpa the seal is clamped at 0 0 and is allowed to deflect due to gravity while it is observed that tip displacement varies greatly the critical behavior that should be matched is both the general deflection beginning at the attachment where the bending moment is greatest as well as the buckling curvature as the modulus increases the increased rigidity moves the buckling location farther from the attachment from this data 4 0 mpa is chosen as the isotropic elastic modulus used in the star ccm solid stress solver it generally replicates the rate of curvature and the bending location and does not deviate too greatly near the attachment later results will show that stability of the seal can lead to compromise in the choice of seal modulus as the fluid conditions and inflation pressures dominate the deflection and resistance for the planer seal problem further properties utilized in the material model are ρ s 1100 kg m3 and ν 0 4 4 5 fsi coupling to establish an fsi interaction between the seal region and the morphing fluid region a mapped contact interface is specified between the seal surfaces and the morphing fluid surfaces in proximity to the seal the fluid structure coupling solver is activated with the two way iterative coupling scheme specified as the density of the bow seal and contacting fluid are very close and given the fact both fluids are approximated as incompressible achieving fsi stability can be a difficult prospect due to influence of the artificial added mass effect several techniques to increase stability in this regard are provided by star ccm and are utilized herein within the fluid structure coupling solver the fluid load is specified to ramp linearly from 0 at t 0 s to 100 at t 0 25 s this reduces the impulse to the seal and allows it to find its free running position in a more controlled manner loading the seal too quickly causes it to deflect too quickly and eventually part the free surface the subsequent cushion venting and extreme mesh morphing crashes the simulation however if the fluid load is imposed too slowly the seal body force dominates the motion due to its weight the seal rotates downward in the absence of a restoring moment from the fluid which drastically alters the incoming flow field a massive hydraulic jump forms in the cushion leading to a numerical crash because the fsi solver is iterative it typically benefits from some amount of displacement under relaxation investigations into this parameter revealed convergence is problematic without significant under relaxation a factor of 0 25 is found to be a good match for the time step and minimum inner iteration limit 12 used in this simulation to further enhance stability of the interaction during startup the pressure loads are clipped to 2000 pa and the traction loads are clipped to 500 pa evaluation of the maximum loads on the seal in the steady state condition reveal the clipping limits are set high enough to have no effect at the quasi steady state when data are taken 4 6 boundary conditions initial conditions startup the boundary conditions are as follows at the inlet the star ccm wave model is implemented which allows specification of the inlet velocities for the heavy fluid water and light fluid air independently the advantage of this approach is that inflow of the air at the inlet can be activated or deactivated allowing the simulation to replicate data obtained by either tow tank or water channel the inflow velocity u is 2 43 m s for water and 0 m s for air the heavy fluid height specified within the wave model is 2 37 m providing a static seal immersion δ s of 0 2286 m necessary to match the experimental conditions for fδ u g δ s 1 6 at the outlet the wave model imposes the hydrostatic pressure developed by the water column slip walls are implemented on all rigid surfaces within the domain including the side walls no slip conditions are imposed on all surfaces of the deforming seal obtaining a steady fluid structure interaction given the relatively high inlet velocities and numerous physics is difficult observation of fluid residuals mesh motion at each time step and significant trial and error led to a standardized approach for the simulation startup which is applied universally to each simulation the fluid is initialized throughout the domain at t 0 s to the inlet free stream of 2 43 m s to reduce the impulse load on the seal the solid stress solver fluid structure coupling solver and mesh motion solver are frozen while time is allowed to advance to t 10 s this develops the free surface profile throughout the domain and allows the free surface oscillations to dissipate prior to releasing the seal without this stabilization period a breaking wave that forms within the cushion at the larger inflation pressures disturbs the seal beyond recovery beginning at t 10 s all frozen solvers are released and the fluid load on the seal is ramped up as described above the simulation is allowed to run an additional 20 s until t 30 s to verify a steady state condition is reached oscillations in both the seal position and fluid pressure ahead of the seal are checked to ensure they are stable and not increasing with time 4 7 planer bow seal results initial simulations are conducted for cushion gage pressures of 252 475 953 and 997 pa inlet flow velocity is maintained at 2 43 m s for all cases these conditions were initially selected by bloxom as a good representation of the um experimental results for each run data is collected at 100 hz and the final 5 s is averaged to obtain mean values for seal deflection and forces acting on the seal front and back surfaces 4 7 1 seal deflection a comparison of the seal deflection for the various cushion pressures is shown in fig 12 through fig 15 for the current results star ccm each point represents the average position over the final 5 s of the transient simulation the error bars show the extreme maximum and extreme minimum for each point over the same period at the two lowest cushion pressures the average positions are a good match to those reported by both bloxom 2014 and zalek and doctors 2010 at the lowest pressure fig 12 fig 13 there is a significantly larger range of motion in the seal in each of the two larger cushion pressure cases the current results slightly under predict the deflection seen in both the um experiment and bloxom s results there are two hypotheses for the variation first it is a possibility that the sidewalls of the platform in the um experiment slightly accelerate the flow at the seal edges where the position measurement was taken as observed in fig 2 of zalek and doctors 2010 leading to additional deflection this would explain bloxom s slight underprediction of deflection as well second and most likely the underprediction in deflection could result from the difference in the seal hyperelastic behavior versus that of the linear elastic modulus used in the current work as a compromise 4 mpa provided good agreement to the cantilever experiment and is used at the lowest two pressures for the two higher cushion pressures however initial runs revealed large dynamics for the seal with a 4 mpa modulus it was necessary to increase the modulus to 8 mpa in order to minimize the displacement standard deviations and maintain stability this additional stiffness appears to further reduce deflection in fig 14 and fig 15 comprehensive deflection results for all cases are provided in table 8 range indicates the range above the mean whereas range indicates the range below the mean the small standard deviations reveal the seal oscillations are small for all cases except at the lowest pressure of p c 252 pa at this condition the range of the x and z positions show that the seal is very lively upon the free surface flattening as it is pulled by shear forces 4 7 2 dimensional analysis dimensional analysis is a powerful technique used to identify relationships between various parameters within a physical phenomenon that are unknown a priori it assumes that governing equations are dimensionally homogenous and are inter related by fundamental quantities of mechanics its power lies in the fact that the relationships can be revealed with only a partial understanding of the problem the correctness of the analysis is based upon the initial choice of independent physical variables requiring only a qualitative insight examples of dimensional analyses for various hydrodynamic problems are provided by birkhoff 1955 newman 1977 and comstock 1983 the numerous parameters that affect seal drag make an exhaustive computational or experimental investigation very difficult if not impossible for this reason a dimensional analysis can be used to decrease the scope of the investigation and provide guidance for the final form of the governing physical relationships based upon first hand observation and previous seal scaling studies conducted by others wiggins 2014 malakhoff and davis 1981 the following physical parameters are believed to affect seal resistance r s seal width w m seal height h m seal face angle θ radians static immersion depth δ s m cushion pressure p c n m2 material flexural rigidity d f n m2 m fluid velocity u m s dynamic viscosity μ n s m2 fluid density ρ kg m3 and gravitational acceleration g m s2 a symbolic governing equation for seal resistance can be written as equation 6 if we assume a proportional relationship in the form of a power law the process of dimensional analysis can be applied resulting in a non dimensional euler number for seal resistance equation 7 examination of the non dimensional ratios given by the analysis reveals other well known groups such as the froude fn number and reynolds re number 6 r s f w h θ δ s p c d f u μ ρ g 7 r s ρ w 2 u 2 f h w θ δ s w p c ρ u 2 d f ρ w 3 u 2 μ w ρ u w g u 2 although the unspecified exponents remain unknown and the form of the function f must be found empirically the usefulness in this result is that if the non dimensional ratios remain equal for differently sized but geometrically similar seals the value for the non dimensional resistance should be the same the remaining groups are unique to the problem of seal resistance and originate from the choice of independent variables it should be reiterated that due to restrictions of subscale testing it is difficult to simultaneously match all dimensionless groups between full and model scales maintaining a correct fn will lead to an inaccurate re and vice versa achieving dynamic similitude for subscale tests has always been difficult but is even more so for acv seals due to the multitude of physical interactions that must be accounted for such as lift flow rate cushion pressure seal stiffness etc wiggins 2014 previous work by doctors et al 2014 arrived at a different form for resistance for instance as cushion pressure can be written as p c ρ g δ c where δ c is the static depression of the free surface due to cushion pressure we can consider δ c as an independent parameter in lieu of p c additionally if the characteristic length is chosen as the seal static immersion δ s instead of width w then the groups identified by the dimensional analysis will be those of equation 8 8 r s ρ δ s 2 u 2 f h δ s θ w δ s δ c δ s d f ρ δ s 3 u 2 μ ρ δ s u g δ s u 2 4 7 3 seal resistance the total force on the seal front surface results from hydrodynamic pressure and shear loads due to the passing fluid the total force on the seal inner surface results from air pressure within the cushion acting normal to the seal toward the end of the simulation the seal dynamics have largely subsided and the body inertial forces are generally low the seal attachment force is then calculated to satisfy the force balance in equation 9 the seal resistance in the x direction r s is the summation of the hydrodynamic pressure r h y d r o and shear forces r τ acting on the seal front surface in the x direction the cushion pressure force acting on the seal inner surface in the x direction is r c u s h the reaction force due to the attachment in the x direction is r x 9 σ f x 0 r s r c u s h r x r s r h y d r o r τ in a similar fashion to results presented by both bloxom 2014 and zalek and doctors 2010 the resistance results are nondimensionalized for the froude number fδ of 1 6 again the characteristic length chosen for calculation of the froude number equation 10 is the seal static immersion depth δs r s is nondimensionalized according to the form shown in equation 11 where b c is the cushion beam this form is provided by exchanging u 2 for g b c from equation 8 the cushion pressure p c is collected from a cushion pressure monitor located within the cushion region slightly above and behind the seal it is nondimensionalized according to equation 12 10 f δ u g δ s 11 r s ρ g b c δ s 2 12 p c ρ g δ s fig 16 plots non dimensional resistance vs non dimensional cushion pressure using the mean of the final 5 s of the transient simulation as the simulation width consists of a single cell of width 0 01 m all forces are scaled by 152 4 to compare with the experimental seal width of 1 524 m the current approach overpredicts resistance at all cushion pressures when compared to both the bloxom results and the um results 32 59 16 19 for run 1051 1058 1114 and 1121 respectively the most probable explanation for the overprediction in the higher pressure cases is that the linear elastic seal modulus of 8 mpa is overly stiff especially near the attachment a hyperelastic material model could perhaps improve the results as the stiffness would decrease with increased stress this does not explain the resistance delta at the lower pressures however as the average deflections shown previously are a near match for these cases table 9 provides the resistance component breakdown for each cushion pressure as the results for r s are mean values over the final 5 s of the simulation the standard error of the mean is shown as σ x the standard deviations for r s are shown as σ interestingly the values for σ are generally very similar despite the large difference in cushion pressures this may indicate the sources of unsteadiness such as numerical noise or upstream free surface spillage have equal influence across a broad range of conditions also the largest value for σ run 1058 correlates precisely to the greatest percent error for resistance fig 17 plots the results for seal resistance versus cushion pressure using an alternative non dimensional form found by the dimensionless group derivation the left axis makes resistance dimensionless by ρ g b c δ s 2 whereas the right axis makes resistance dimensionless by ρ u 2 b c 2 an interesting result is that both data sets show similar exponents when the relationship is reflected as a power law revealing either form is equally useful for scaling the current star ccm results show resistance as a factor of p c 2 24 analysis using bloxom s results show resistance as a factor of p c 2 49 5 conclusion this work documents an effort to verify validate and apply a commercial multi physics tool star ccm toward the difficult problem of acv seal resistance upon a free surface first the work uses comparative results for the elastic beam fsi numerical benchmark proposed by turek and hron 2006 using case cfd3 the observed order of accuracy is demonstrated to be just below the formal order and the lift and drag values are shown to converge which verifies the fluid solver the solver is validated based upon the 0 034 difference between the benchmark and the extrapolated exact solution using case csm2 the structural solver is shown to converge the tip displacement result to within 0 8 of the benchmark providing verification and validation using case fsi3 the integrated fluid structure interaction capability of the program is evaluated results for 11 different cases show the relative influence of the solution parameters and demonstrate improvements in displacement drag and lift with increased inner iterations the best overall comparison is achieved using 30 inner iterations yielding a tip y displacement error of 4 05 mean drag error of 1 02 and mean lift error of 4 05 next this work simulates an acv planer bow seal experiment to verify and validate its use for pressurized seals upon a free surface excellent agreement is achieved for seal deflection at the two lowest cushion pressures and acceptable agreement is achieved for the highest two cushion pressures the importance of employing an appropriate material model for the seal is demonstrated as the absence of a hyperelastic model requires the substitution of a linear elastic model the present resistance results agree with the prior numerical and experimental data moderately well and similar scaling characteristics are found using either of the non dimensional forms the primary contribution of this work is the expansion of fsi validation for problems having strong added mass effects in the region of a free surface until recently separate partitioned solvers were required to simulate the various physics needed to achieve these results further fsi validation cases using commercial programs were largely limited to either small deflections or a single fluid as in the case of aero elasticity with this work verification of star ccm as a stand alone partitioned fsi solver drastically speeds up the setup and runtime and reduces the complexity of previous approaches opening the door to designers who may have been computationally limited previously from the work above a great many aspects of acv seal modeling and behavior remain unexplored and the prospects for future work are plentiful for a direct continuation of this research the planer seal parameters should be altered to develop results that more fully explore the parametric relationships identified variations in seal face angle width and height should be explored to build confidence for designers of craft that exceed the state of the practice also a current restriction in the present results is the absence of a hyperelastic material model for the seal continued attention should be paid to the availability of tools that offer hyperelastic models and implicit solvers to accommodate behavior of nonlinear materials lastly although the importance of three dimensional effects will need to be considered for practical applications and more complex seal geometries they were largely unexplored in this study the two dimensional approximation for an ses planer seal is generally acceptable except for large planform sidewall configurations for these cases successful solution of the fluid solvers requires discretization in the beam direction approaching that of the flow direction a thoughtful application of mesh bias could reduce the computation burden in these cases acknowledgments this effort was primarily funded by the dod science mathematics and

22471,air cushion vehicle acv flexible seals operate in a complex and chaotic environment dominated by fluid structure interaction an efficient means to explore relationships between interdependent governing parameters that affect performance is through high fidelity numerical simulation as previous numerical efforts have employed separate iterative partitioned solvers or have implemented

is a flexible hull structure that interfaces with the supporting surface and captures a cushion of air beneath a marine surface craft the seal environment is highly dynamic and difficult to characterize with multiple scaling relationships in play thus seal design at present remains an iterative evolutionary process based upon subscale testing and simplistic theoretical models this requires that designs are established early in a craft s development program at great expense with minimal opportunity for modification concurrent to final craft design with recent advancements in computational methods for fluid structure interactions fsi the development and employ of seal design tools can supplement the traditional design approach and consequently be relevant at all stages of craft development while recent experimental research has focused on the problem of seal resistance doctors et al 2014 wiggins 2014 zalek and doctors 2010 concurrent computational approaches have utilized physical and algorithmic simplifications for both the fluid and structural models for example kramer 2013 studied interactions between the bow and stern seals with attention to effects on resistance but at the expense of using hinged rigid seals and linearized potential flow fluid models challa 2015 explored the problem with idealized membrane seals using explicit methods and loose coupling even smoothed particle hydrodynamic approaches have been explored for this application gilbert 2015 yang 2011 in the most detailed computational effort to date where more accurate physical models for the seal fluid and interaction are employed separate partitioned solvers were required at high complexity and computational cost bloxom 2014 thus there remains much to learn regarding how seal materials are chosen how their geometries can be beneficially arranged and what scaling laws are suitable the work described in this paper takes the next step in computational approaches to the problem of acv seal resistance it seeks to verify and validate modeling approaches that accurately represent the physics of the seal fluid interaction within an integrated computational desktop star ccm ver 12 04 011 thus enabling more efficient predictions of resistance for these craft this paper is largely based upon a more extensive study documented in doctoral work by cole 2018 in computational approach below details of the numerical physics models employed are described in elastic beam fsi benchmark the canonical fsi problem by turek and hron 2006 is simulated to explore sensitivities to various solver parameters using star ccm in acv planer bow seal a model is developed to replicate the geometry and conditions used in both the experimental work of zalek and doctors et al 2014 and the numerical work of bloxom 2014 descriptions of the model development computational parameters and results follows finally a dimensional analysis identifies key physical variables and scaling dependencies that should be considered when exploring the problem of acv seal resistance 2 computational approach this section describes the computational approach for conducting a numerical simulation of flexible acv seals in a free surface flow with the advancement of computational toolsets that can be applied to fsi problems and the recent success of the related work mentioned above it is logical to investigate seal resistance in this manner observing lessons learned and previous successes by other researchers bloxom 2014 gilbert 2015 yang 2011 a documented and prevalent commercial tool is pursued here rather than devoting resources to write a novel and potentially computationally inefficient research code the computational costs for solving nonlinear large deformation problems implicitly are burdensome bloxom 2014 farhat et al 2010 hubner et al 2004 vierendeels 2006 due to the extreme nonlinearities and structural deformation anticipated a dynamic explicit approach for solving the problem was initially pursued however following significant verification and validation work this approach was abandoned due to the inability to adequately resolve the pressure field and thus the seal resistance as there is great appeal in handling both the fluid and structure in the same computational space star ccm was initially discounted for this effort due to the cost and complexity of co simulating a separate structural solver however in mid 2015 star ccm made available a linear elastic finite element solver capable of nonlinear geometry deformation with this software advancement a partitioned fsi simulation could now be conducted all within star ccm this is a significant advantage especially in a production type environment where limited resources are available to develop the coupling algorithm additionally only a single license is required an incompressible segregated approach for solving the navier stokes equations simple algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 is used for the fluid for turbulent flow simulations a reynolds averaged navier stokes formulation is used as large seal deformations will result in cell skewness and an unstructured grid the standard spalart allmaras ssa model spalart and allmaras 1992 is chosen to solve the turbulent eddy viscosity parameter for the reynolds stress tensor while other turbulence models were considered previous research has shown the ratio of frictional force to pressure force is small bloxom 2014 thus minimizing the sensitivity to turbulence model further as a small near wall mesh size can decrease stability of a partitioned fsi simulation and limit the stable timestep size the simplistic ssa model is justified accurate modeling of the fluid vorticity is important in turbulent flow and it is important to consider the treatment of the wall boundary layer the boundary layer can be divided into the laminar sublayer y 5 buffer layer 5 y 30 and the log law layer 30 y 500 where y is the non dimensional wall distance popovac and hanjalic 2007 each sublayer is characterized by a different relationship between velocity and y for rans simulations in star ccm an all y treatment can be specified to blend the various relationships as dictated by the mesh size adjacent to the wall this is especially useful for fsi simulations where grid size may be limited and where mesh deformation is present near moving boundaries in star ccm numerous discretization schemes are offered to solve the transport equations in this work the transient term is typically evaluated using a first order scheme euler implicit when steady state is sought and a second order backwards differentiation scheme when a time accurate unsteady solution is sought for the convective flux term second order upwind is generally specified except in cases where additional spatial dissipation afforded by the first order upwind scheme is helpful the diffusive term is approximated using a second order expression additional descriptions of the numerical methodologies implemented within star ccm are found in the code s documentation siemens 2018 the volume of fluids vof method hird and nichols 1981 is implemented to deduce the boundary surface by the makeup of individual cell volume fractions in many modern cfd codes the vof method has become a popular approach due to its ability to handle both large deformations of the free surface as well as problems where multiple immiscible fluid species are present to resolve a sharply defined surface at the air water interface star ccm employs a blend of a first order upwind fou scheme and the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme muzaferija et al 1999 this combination of hric and fou provides sharpness when the local courant number c is small and stability when it is high at the expense of a smeared interface thus it is important to solve the transport equation with sufficiently small timesteps to maintain a resolved interface to control the fou hric blending a user defined upper courant limit c u and lower courant limit c l is compared to the local courant number when c c l hric is used when c l c c u the schemes are blended via interpolation when c u c fou is used in this work the c l is raised artificially high to force exclusive use of the hric scheme to accommodate large structural deformation without successive remeshing mesh motion technology is employed in star ccm via multiquadric interpolation hardy 1990 to reduce the computational cost of this operation control vertex thinning is applied to reduce the number of vertices in the displacement field interpolation geometric conservation is then achieved by applying a grid flux correction to the convective flux term in the finite volume discretization to account for the volume change as the strength of the numerical coupling required will vary according to the problem at hand the fsi coupling solver offered within star ccm provides various means to control and stabilize the interaction for the present work only a two way fully coupled iterative scheme is used this is appropriate for strongly coupled interactions and when the artificial added mass instability influences the solution rugonyi and bathe 2001 hubner et al 2004 lohner et al 2006 vierendeels 2006 farhat et al 2010 it is noted that the fsi coupling solver offers an added mass correction which portends to alleviate the numerical instability due to acceleration of the structure however because of a lack of visibility into the methods of this correction it is not implemented at any time within the present study fig 1 provides an overview of the coupling scheme employed following initialization the fluid solver develops the initial field variables and maps the pressure loading to the contacting structural surface the structural solver updates the nodal displacements and the inner iteration convergence criteria are evaluated if the minimum iterations have not been achieved or the residuals remain above the predetermined limit the fluid solver and structural solver recompute their respective domains in this way the fluid and structure iterate together to find an equilibrium within the time step once the solvers meet the established iteration convergence criteria the mesh morpher solver updates the nodal positions within the fluid domain and the time step is advanced this loop continues until the outer iteration stopping criteria are met 3 elastic beam fsi benchmark the first problem explored is that of an incompressible newtonian fluid interacting with an elastic solid in laminar channel flow turek and hron 2006 first proposed this problem as a means to rigorously evaluate potential fsi coupling schemes and algorithms it consists of a cylinder transverse to the flow with an elastic beam attached to the trailing edge fig 2 while the problem boundaries and conditions appear deceptively simple the fluid solution is complex due to self induced oscillations vortex shedding and added mass effects for this reason this problem is referenced and utilized often within the fsi community breuer et al 2012 giannelis and vio 2015 engels et al 2015 turek et al 2011 while nine variations of the problem are provided in the benchmark reference in this work we focus on three cases cfd3 validates the fluid solution by holding the elastic beam fixed so that only oscillations of the fluid are captured csm2 removes the fluid and allows the structure to freely fall under the influence of gravity only fsi3 allows for full interaction between the fluid and structure due to the transient nature of this problem time histories of the tip position fluid oscillation frequencies as well as lift and drag forces upon the submerged body are captured as the comparative benchmark data the problem parameters are provided in table 1 the problem setup using star ccm 12 04 011 is as follows as the fluid is considered incompressible and transient an implicit unsteady segregated solver is utilized having a second order upwind convection scheme under relaxation factors for the velocity and pressure equations are set to 0 6 and 0 2 respectively for boundary conditions a no slip condition is applied on the channel top and bottom walls and cylinder beam surfaces the sides of the channel z normal are slip walls a pressure outlet of p 0 pa is applied to the exit and the fluid speed and pressure are initialized at zero a time varying parabolic velocity inlet condition is applied pursuant to that of the benchmark problem by means of a user defined field function within star ccm it is given in equations 1 and 2 u is the characteristic velocity and u is the spatially and temporally varying inflow velocity 1 u 0 y t u 0 y 1 cos π 2 t 2 i f t 2 0 s u 0 y o t h e r w i s e 2 u 0 y 1 5 u 4 0 0 1681 y 0 41 y the original benchmark problem is strictly two dimensional and results are presented per unit depth however star ccm requires three dimensions in order to utilize the fluid structure coupling solver therefore the baseline fluid mesh is developed using the automatic mesh functionality nested within the directed mesh approach a volume distribution of a single 1 m element is applied in the z direction to provide the third dimension an unstructured triangle background mesh and two volumetric refinements establish the topology the first refinement volume targets a surface size of 50 of the base size and the second refinement volume targets a surface size of 25 of the base the element length growth rate is limited to 1 1 to ensure smooth transitions between refinement areas simulations are conducted on three grid levels using base sizes of 0 020 m 0 010 m and 0 005 m in order to confirm grid independence as well as verify the observed order of accuracy ooa the solid stress solver is specified to use a 2nd order newmark implicit integration scheme newmark parameter 0 5 to minimize the numerical damping which would occur in the default 1st order backward euler scheme solid displacement motion is specified for the region thus enabling nonlinear geometry via updates of the stiffness matrix at each iteration 3 1 cfd3 benchmark the first scenario benchmarks the fluid solution utilizing the parameters for cfd3 and the geometry above second order temporal discretization is implemented and the time step is fixed at δt 0 005 s cfl based time step control is not applied as initial simulations revealed elevated momentum residuals at this time step additional iteration stopping criteria are established to ensure suitable convergence prior to progressing to the next time step the normalized residual minimum is 1e 1 and the minimum inner iterations per time step are 50 initially the solver had problems achieving these normalized residuals improvements to the convergence is found by reducing the width of the domain in the z direction to 0 01 m thus improving the x z aspect ratio generally the minimum iterations provided a residual convergence of 1e 5 or lower due the problem s transient nature a 10 s simulation is required to establish both fully developed flow and a steady fluid oscillation fig 3 plots lift versus time and reveals the initial instability and eventual steady oscillation by approximately 8 5 s fig 4 shows the magnitude of velocity at the end of the simulation revealing oscillation in the fluid downstream of the structure as the lift and drag results are time dependent and subject to small perturbations they are presented similar to the reference solution as mean amplitude frequency to arrive at the values in this work first the averages of the extreme minimums m i n a v e and extreme maximums m a x a v e are calculated for the period of the final three oscillations then the mean amplitude and frequency are calculated according to equations 3 5 respectively the frequency calculation is also an average as it considers the total number of cycles n c y c that occur between the time of the initial extreme maximum t m a x i n i t and final extreme maximum t m a x f i n a l 3 m e a n 1 2 m a x a v e m i n a v e 4 a m p l i t u d e 1 2 m a x a v e m i n a v e 5 f r e q u e n c y n c y c t m a x i n i t t m a x f i n a l in turek and hron 2006 these values were obtained using a single final interval in the simulation however without a clear indication of the exact time period used it is difficult to maintain consistency between the reference solution and this work thus the averaging approach described above is taken a summary of the lift and drag results for the simulation at each mesh level are tabulated in table 2 at δt 0 005 s the drag result at the finest mesh of 441 44 6 56 n 4 26 hz is a good match to the turek and hron 2006 reference solution of 439 45 5 6183 n 4 40 hz the mean drag differs by only 0 45 while the amplitude differs by 16 7 at the finest mesh level the frequency differs by only 3 19 at the finest mesh level a strouhal analysis is conducted as a separate means to validate the observed shedding frequency at the frequency of 4 26 hz the characteristic velocity and cylinder diameter provide a strouhal number of st 0 22 this is consistent with a long cylinder in uniform flow of re 200 of course the non uniform inflow and constricting channel serves to increase the frequency whereas the fixed trailing beam decreases frequency these off setting features do not appear to have a significantly altered the shedding frequency from that of an ideal cylinder the lift result at the finest mesh of 2 13 462 80 n 4 26 hz varies more considerably from the reference solution of 11 90 437 81 n 4 40 hz the mean lift has shifted to a more neutral value while the amplitude differs by 5 7 at the finest mesh level the magnitude of these differences is not too concerning especially when other researchers have shown similar deviations for this benchmark using other commercial software for instance giannelis and vio 2015 under predicted the amplitudes of lift and drag for cfd3 by 3 3 and 13 3 respectively using ansys fluent the variation in this case was attributed to increasing mesh size downstream of the structure in table 2 the effect of mesh spacing shows the present solutions converge toward the reference solutions with increased refinement as the cell sizes resulting from the automated mesh are specified as a percentage of the base size global refinements are uniformly implemented by simply halving the base size the formal refinement ratio r is 2 however the unstructured mesh results in slightly imperfect successive mesh refinements and thus it is useful to assess convergence using the effective refinement ratio r eff 1 88 kwasniewski 2013 the observed order or accuracy ooa based upon the mean drag value is calculated as 1 84 using methods from roache 1994 this confirms the formal accuracy as second order for the upwind convection scheme using richardson s extrapolation the mean drag exact solution is found as f exact 439 76 n clearly showing agreement 0 07 error with the reference solution of 439 45 n in order to remain consistent with the reference solution the time step utilized above is taken a priori from turek and hron 2006 in order to assess the effect of temporal refinement in the current star ccm implementation additional runs are conducted at a reduced timestep assuming the general practice of using a timestep of 1 100 of the fundamental period δt is set to 0 002275 s the updated results table 2 show improvements in all regards which reveals the importance of time step size in highly transient problems on the finest mesh the mean drag differs by only 0 42 the drag amplitude differs by only 2 13 and the drag frequency differs by 1 01 most improved are results for lift the mean lift differs by 2 52 and the lift amplitude differs by 3 61 the ooa is calculated as 1 87 and the prediction of the exact solution f exact differs from the benchmark result by only 0 034 in summary these cfd3 results show a successful implementation of the fluid solution for the benchmark problem both the spatial and temporal refinements yielded consistent improvements when compared to the benchmark drag result the fluid solution is therefore considered verified based upon ooa and convergence it is considered validated based upon the relative error to the benchmark results for drag and lift additional fluid benchmarks are not attempted here as further verifications can be found in the extensive star ccm verification suite siemens 2018 3 2 csm2 benchmark the next benchmark focuses solely upon the structure using parameters of csm2 with identical geometry to the previous problem the elastic beam remains cantilevered to the cylinder and is allowed to deform under the influence of a gravitational body force 2 m s2 the surrounding fluid is removed from the simulation and there is no numerical material damping the analysis is static dynamics of the beam are not considered and the steady state tip displacement is reported as the reference result a directed mesh operation is used to uniformly discretize the beam both through the thickness and along the length as the simulation is quasi two dimensional only one element is specified in the width for all models the mid side vertex option is activated to achieve quadratic continuum elements which enables increased accuracy in bending when only one element is used through the beam thickness the coarsest mesh uses 1 element through the thickness and 20 elements along the length element counts are doubled in each dimension for successive meshes the linear isotropic elastic material model provides the constitutive relations with properties defined in table 1 above the csm2 benchmark result for the present star ccm implementation is shown in table 3 in general increased refinement appears to converge both the x displacement and y displacement toward the reference solution however a 0 94 error remains even for the finest mesh which is significantly discretized a richardson extrapolation of the exact solution for y displacement based upon the convergence results is given by f exact 1 683e 2 m this result is closer to that obtained by mesh level 1 1 681e 2 m than the reference solution 1 697e 2 m f exact differs from the benchmark by 0 8 at face value the ooa appears to under perform the formal order of 2 however it is quickly observed that the increased bending accuracy afforded by quadratic elements suppresses apparent improvements due to additional thickness discretization for an interesting comparison on the effects of using the mid side vertex option and additional mesh level lb is developed by reducing the thickness discretization to a single element while the level 1 length is maintained the close match of mesh 1b to f exact reveals the relative insensitivity to thickness discretization for this problem when using quadratic elements in summation the solid stress solver is shown to perform adequately and is considered validated based upon tip displacements approaching the benchmark result 3 3 fsi3 benchmark using the solvers geometry boundary conditions and discretization described above the next scenario attempted is fsi3 the specified parameters result in both strong artificial added mass effects and large deflections as the elastic material density provides ρ f ρ s 1 and the characteristic inflow provides re 200 eleven different simulations are used to explore variabilities in time step spatial discretization inner iterations under relaxation of the fsi solver and fsi coupling method a comprehensive set of results are shown in table 4 discussions for each case comparison are provided below 3 3 1 cases 1 through 3 effect of spatial discretization for δt 0 001 s cases 1 through 3 are conducted to investigate the effect of spatial discretization for three mesh levels at a timestep of δt 0 001 s the results provided in table 4 show mixed performance as the mesh is refined at the finest mesh level the mean drag only varies from the reference solution by 2 3 however the frequency of oscillation is significantly lower also the mean lift does not show monotonic convergence toward the reference solution and exhibits even larger errors in amplitude and frequency as a cause for this departure inspection of the fluid residuals achieved using 10 iterations per timestep reveals dramatic differences in convergence achieved between periods when the tip acceleration is small and when it is large a clear indicator of artificial added mass instability the solution is to either reduce the timestep or add additional iterations to bring the residuals down 3 3 2 cases 4 through 6 effect of spatial discretization for δt 5e 4 s cases 4 through 6 are conducted to investigate the effect of spatial discretization for three mesh levels at a reduced timestep of δt 5e 4 s when compared to the previous cases at the larger timestep the results in table 4 show improvements in every category mean force values are in better agreement with the reference solutions and the frequencies are approaching those reported as well while it is obvious that a timestep reduction of 50 results in twice as many total iterations for an equivalent simulated time an improvement to the results is only provided because the timescale of the fluid structure interaction is smaller than the current temporal discretization on the finest mesh level the mean drag error is 0 6 the lift amplitude is over predicted on all meshes achieving the best error of 4 7 on the finest mesh 3 3 3 cases 6 7 and 8 effect of fsi under relaxation for δt 5e 4 s cases 6 7 and 8 are conducted at equal temporal and spatial discretization to investigate the effect of the fsi solver under relaxation ur factor 0 4 0 5 and 0 9 respectively ur factor stabilizes the interaction by reducing the structural displacements provided by the structural solver at each iteration low values of ur increase stability whereas high values reduce it values for ur below 0 4 were attempted but convergence became a problem with inner iterations limited to 10 attempts to run the problem without under relaxation ur 1 0 failed quickly within the first several time steps table 4 shows that as the ur factor is increased the mean drag and mean lift are improved but only marginally the oscillation frequency for all cases remains low indicating elevated numerical damping at these case settings as increased relaxation decreases in ur serves to stabilize the interaction at the cost of accuracy it stands to reason that cases with higher levels of relaxation should be afforded more iterations this is evident by comparing case 6 to case 10 below doubling the iterations from 10 to 20 for the same ur gave improvements in tip displacement mean drag mean lift and frequency the takeaway for this study is that an ur value of 0 5 up to 0 9 should prove adequate when inner iterations are limited and temporal accuracy is not required as in the case when an unsteady approach is used to reach a steady state interaction for accurate solutions of time dependent problems good convergence is required at each time step 3 3 4 cases 6 9 10 and 11 effect of inner iterations for δt 5e 4 s the final cases of 9 10 and 11 are conducted at equal temporal and spatial discretization to investigate the effect of inner iterations as convergence of the fluid equations is concerned it is typical to set a minimum limit to the residuals such as 1e 7 in order to obtain consistent levels of iterative error across various simulations this is especially important when comparative cpu time studies are performed however this can be difficult to achieve for fsi problems with large added mass effects in this work the desire is to explore the capability of the fsi solver when subjected to an explicit number of inner iterations provided the fluid residuals have converged below some minimum level this is because choice of the fsi displacement under relaxation parameter has an effect on the rate of fsi convergence generally a smaller under relaxation parameter slows convergence and increases stability while a larger under relaxation parameter speeds convergence up to a point and decreases stability further the rate of convergence changes throughout the simulation due to the unsteadiness of the problem thus the choice to explicitly hold the previous cases to 10 inner iterations per time step cases 9 10 and 11 explore this factor as an independent variable the results in table 4 generally show improvements in tip displacement mean drag and mean lift as the number of inner iterations increases percent errors in the mean drag are all 1 or less while the best error achieved for mean lift is 4 this is considered acceptable as sheldon et al 2014 achieved drag errors between 2 and 4 in their partitioned solution of fsi2 table 5 shows the percent error between the present results and the benchmark for tip y displacement drag and lift as residuals are reduced with increased iterations the influence of the artificial added mass instability can be seen observe that while the mean and amplitude of y displacement improves consistently with increased iterations the drag and lift forces are not as consistent the percent error of lift amplitude increases with additional inner iterations fig 5 plots the tip y displacement and lift versus time for case 11 where the artificial added mass instability is greatest although the displacement of the seal is clearly stable the artificial added mass effect upon the fluid solution results in a clear beating of the lift result the artificially is demonstrated in that the beating is a numerical pressure result only no oscillation is observed in the y displacement itself regarding the differences between the reference solutions and the present work it should be mentioned that the reference solutions appear to use one oscillation period to determine the values for the mean amplitude and frequency as the time histories reveal small variations in period and amplitude throughout the simulation the only means for an equivalent comparison is for the benchmark to specifically state the time for which the measurements were made which it does not for this reason the present results are averages as defined previously in equation 3 through equation 5 this subtle difference could account for some portion of the relative percent errors the work above clearly shows time accurate results for unsteady fsi problems require judicious selection of the solver parameters despite a finely resolved mesh timestep fsi ur and convergence are all important factors for unsteady periodic solutions when added mass instability is present concessions in levels of convergence and inner iterations can be acceptable when an efficient means to reach steady state is required finally it is demonstrated that high limits on inner iterations can do more harm than good for problems where added mas effect is present in summation the work presented using star ccm for this benchmark verifies the chosen solvers and validates their integrated use for tightly coupled two way fsi simulations 4 acv planer bow seal this validation problem replicates a planer bow seal experiment conducted at the university of michigan as documented in work by zalek and doctors 2010 doctors et al 2014 and wiggins 2014 the effort entailed a large scale experimental approach to develop an ses acv bow seal post buckling model and dataset useful for numerical validation a planer bow seal was instrumented to capture resistance and deflection data at various inflation pressures and immersions doctors 2012 and doctors et al 2014 developed theoretical seal resistance models flat parabolic cubic for comparison with the experimental results good agreement between the cubic seal theory is achieved at low froude numbers but not at higher ones this indicates important physics at higher speeds may not be properly captured in the theoretical model further the large deviations in non dimensional resistance at the highest froude number reveals the difficulty in experimentally collecting meaningful data at some conditions the planer bow seal experiment was also analyzed in numerical work by bloxom 2014 he coupled star ccm and abaqus implicit to simulate the um experiment while this approach provided good agreement to the experiment the complexity and cost of multiple simultaneous simulations could be improved upon for future work this effort removes abaqus and instead uses star ccm s newly available embedded structural solver for the seal as star ccm is a modern commercial multi physics simulation code it offers a large variety of numerical approaches and physics models thus the choice of solvers models and boundary conditions is not as straight forward as the preceding numerical benchmark to maintain the stability of the seal a significant number of test cases and model explorations have been conducted to establish a robust simulation approach this section describes that approach and provides a comparison of the results to the prior experimental and numerical work 4 1 geometry and mesh the computational domain developed is shown in fig 6 and fig 7 in general the geometry parts that define the physical space of both the test platform and tow tank are established to be a near representation of the um experiment particulars are given in table 6 the computational domain can be broken down into the static mesh fluid region the morphing mesh fluid region the seal structural region and the fan region the static mesh fluid region extends 11 5 m downstream of the inlet and 11 0 m upstream of the outlet it surrounds the morphing mesh region and provides surfaces for various wall inlet and outlet boundaries the morphing mesh fluid region is 3 5 m in length and surrounds the seal conforming the mesh to the structural deformation the fan region is 2 m long and interacts with the static mesh fluid region to provide the required cushion pressure the large computational domain length of 26 m is required in order to damp sloshing of the fluid that occurs during startup while initial models utilized an inlet and outlet separated from the platform by only a few meters it was quickly observed that excessively long run times would be required to slowly accelerate the flow without disturbing the volume fraction values in the vicinity of the seal while the beam of the platform used in the um experiment was 1 524 m a two dimensional solution approach using single cell through the beam y direction is used to minimize node count initially a 1 m length was chosen for the beam to simplify scaling to the experimental values however it was soon observed that the y momentum residuals were unstable it is surmised that the spatial aspect ratios led to divergence of the vof solver the problem was solved by reducing the beam cell size to δy 0 01 m various surface and volume meshing tools are provided by star ccm to construct the baseline mesh first an automated meshing operation is established for the static and morphing fluid regions a trimmed cell mesher establishes the basic mesh while a custom surface control refines the mesh as it approaches the seal front surface four volumetric control areas are included to selectively refine the mesh in various regions of interest one refinement area covers the initial free surface and uses a cell height of approximately δz 0 008 m two refinement areas cover the area immediately upstream of the seal and use cell heights of approximately δz 0 008 m and 0 004 m the final refinement area covers the entire free surface within the cushion and downstream and uses a cell height of δz 0 015 m fig 8 shows the results of these refinements in order to more closely resolve the boundary layer along the seal a prism layer mesh is applied to its front surface fig 9 it is six layers deep with an overall thickness of 0 008 m and a constant growth ratio of 1 3 surface mesh and volume mesh extruders discretize the domain upstream and downstream of the seal using 10 and 8 layers respectively and a constant growth ratio of 1 2 finally directed mesh operations are performed on the fan and seal in order to closely control the cell count and node spacing growth the seal structure utilizes 100 cells along the length and is biased to where the cell edge length at the attachment is 10 of the cell edge length at the tip the additional refinement at the location of greatest curvature increases accuracy of the solution two quadratic elements are used through the seal thickness 4 2 fluid physics models and solvers for the bow seal problem the incompressible simplification is made for both the water and air and the rans equations are solved using the simple algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 the ssa turbulence model under relaxation 0 75 is used with an initial turbulent viscosity ratio 10 an all y wall treatment is specified and y values were generally observed to be 30 for the mesh sizes and grid deformations throughout the simulation the implicit unsteady solver with first order temporal discretization is used to advance time in a transient analysis toward a steady state while this study seeks to reach a stable interaction in order to evaluate the steady seal resistance there are two significant restrictions which prevent the use of a steady time model first updates to the seal structural stiffness matrix must be made periodically in order for the structural solver to find a stable solution if the seal displacement is too large for the given timestep the structural solver has significant difficulty bringing the interaction into equilibrium regardless of the number of iterations second the multiple fluid species air water require limitations on the cfl number in order to maintain resolution and stability of the mixing interface moderate cfl numbers 1 0 result in diffusion and smearing of the free surface for this problem therefore convective cfl time step control is activated with a target mean cfl 0 2 and a target max cfl 0 5 the vof solver under relaxation 0 5 is utilized and the hric scheme is maintained for surface tracking by holding the local courant number limits c u and c l to 1 0 and 0 5 respectively the angle factor c θ is modified to 0 5 to improve resolution of the surfaces moving normal to the mesh the flat wave model option within the vof solver is utilized to establish the initialized free surface height and inlet velocities to damp sloshing of the free surface resulting from startup a wave damping boundary option is applied to the inlet and outlet boundaries with damping lengths of 2 0 m the mesh morpher is activated in the morphing fluid region and the fluid nodes at the seal interface are free to move as dictated by motion of the seal nodes a boundary plane constraint is applied to the sides of the morphing fluid region to allow nodal motion in the x z plane only a control vertex thin out factor of 1 0 is used to maximize the number of boundary vertices used in the displacement field interpolation similarly for the seal nodes along the fluid structure interface are free to displace according to the stress field in the x z plane but are constrained in the y direction 4 3 fan physics models in order to build gage pressure within the cushion a fan momentum source region is added just above the cushion fig 7 and a contact interface is established between the regions to allow free exchange to control the source strength a fan curve is prescribed for each of the pressure conditions simulated according to table 7 the developed pressure is reduced with increased volumetric flowrate to provide a stable cushion pressure through a large range of flows to increase cushion stability the flowrate magnitudes are tailored to accommodate momentary periods of venting when the free surface profile falls below the aft seal should the pressure fall too quickly seal stability can be lost this occurrence is more prevalent in the high cushion pressure cases where depression of the free surface is greatest 4 4 seal physics model and solver for the seal the implicit unsteady solid stress solver is activated and specified to use a 2nd order newmark temporal discretization newmark parameter 0 5 newmark 1959 solid displacement motion is specified to enable nonlinear geometry via updates of the stiffness matrix at each iteration to improve stability and reduce the influence of numerical noise in the structure rayleigh damping zienkiewicz and taylor 1991 is activated with the mass coefficient α 10 hz and the stiffness coefficient β 0 86 s as the steady state solution is sought the choice of the damping coefficients is made to moderately over damp the low frequencies of the structure the top edge of the seal is spatially fixed the edges are constrained normal to the domain sides y direction and the remaining seal surfaces are unconstrained point monitors are attached to the seal front surface to track displacements of these specific points fig 10 previous research has shown that seal materials such as those tested in the um bow seal experiment are more accurately modeled when a hyperelastic description is used for the flexural modulus of the rubber coating wiggins 2014 bloxom 2014 however as of the time of this work only linear elastic material models are offered as part of the solid stress solver within star ccm this adds to the difficulty of replicating the test results exactly further complicating the issue the seal materials are typically laminates consisting of rubber coated nylon fabrics at this time it is not possible to employ a multi layer solid in combination with the partitioned fsi solver for this reason the seal is modeled as a single isotropic linear elastic material rather than the rubber coated fiber bloxom 2014 used a three layer model of the seal with an inextensible fabric layer sandwiched between rubber layers described by the hyperelastic mooney rivlin material model he performed a cantilever bending test of a sample of the seal material used in the experiment in order to determine the mooney rivlin coefficients to validate the choice of linear elastic modulus used in star ccm s solid stress solver a series of cantilever seal simulations is conducted similar to that performed by bloxom in an attempt to match his experimental data the material sample is 0 35 m long 0 00375 m thick and is cantilevered at 45 it is fixed in all degrees of freedom at the attachment and is allowed to deflect only due to its gravitational body force the mesh is constructed using 100 c3d20 cells with a 10 1 bias toward the attachment an implicit solver in abaqus is used to efficiently reach steady state abaqus is chosen to solve this series of simulations as an independent means to tune the seal modulus the seal deflections are compared to bloxom s data in fig 11 for moduli of 2 0 4 0 4 5 and 8 5 mpa the seal is clamped at 0 0 and is allowed to deflect due to gravity while it is observed that tip displacement varies greatly the critical behavior that should be matched is both the general deflection beginning at the attachment where the bending moment is greatest as well as the buckling curvature as the modulus increases the increased rigidity moves the buckling location farther from the attachment from this data 4 0 mpa is chosen as the isotropic elastic modulus used in the star ccm solid stress solver it generally replicates the rate of curvature and the bending location and does not deviate too greatly near the attachment later results will show that stability of the seal can lead to compromise in the choice of seal modulus as the fluid conditions and inflation pressures dominate the deflection and resistance for the planer seal problem further properties utilized in the material model are ρ s 1100 kg m3 and ν 0 4 4 5 fsi coupling to establish an fsi interaction between the seal region and the morphing fluid region a mapped contact interface is specified between the seal surfaces and the morphing fluid surfaces in proximity to the seal the fluid structure coupling solver is activated with the two way iterative coupling scheme specified as the density of the bow seal and contacting fluid are very close and given the fact both fluids are approximated as incompressible achieving fsi stability can be a difficult prospect due to influence of the artificial added mass effect several techniques to increase stability in this regard are provided by star ccm and are utilized herein within the fluid structure coupling solver the fluid load is specified to ramp linearly from 0 at t 0 s to 100 at t 0 25 s this reduces the impulse to the seal and allows it to find its free running position in a more controlled manner loading the seal too quickly causes it to deflect too quickly and eventually part the free surface the subsequent cushion venting and extreme mesh morphing crashes the simulation however if the fluid load is imposed too slowly the seal body force dominates the motion due to its weight the seal rotates downward in the absence of a restoring moment from the fluid which drastically alters the incoming flow field a massive hydraulic jump forms in the cushion leading to a numerical crash because the fsi solver is iterative it typically benefits from some amount of displacement under relaxation investigations into this parameter revealed convergence is problematic without significant under relaxation a factor of 0 25 is found to be a good match for the time step and minimum inner iteration limit 12 used in this simulation to further enhance stability of the interaction during startup the pressure loads are clipped to 2000 pa and the traction loads are clipped to 500 pa evaluation of the maximum loads on the seal in the steady state condition reveal the clipping limits are set high enough to have no effect at the quasi steady state when data are taken 4 6 boundary conditions initial conditions startup the boundary conditions are as follows at the inlet the star ccm wave model is implemented which allows specification of the inlet velocities for the heavy fluid water and light fluid air independently the advantage of this approach is that inflow of the air at the inlet can be activated or deactivated allowing the simulation to replicate data obtained by either tow tank or water channel the inflow velocity u is 2 43 m s for water and 0 m s for air the heavy fluid height specified within the wave model is 2 37 m providing a static seal immersion δ s of 0 2286 m necessary to match the experimental conditions for fδ u g δ s 1 6 at the outlet the wave model imposes the hydrostatic pressure developed by the water column slip walls are implemented on all rigid surfaces within the domain including the side walls no slip conditions are imposed on all surfaces of the deforming seal obtaining a steady fluid structure interaction given the relatively high inlet velocities and numerous physics is difficult observation of fluid residuals mesh motion at each time step and significant trial and error led to a standardized approach for the simulation startup which is applied universally to each simulation the fluid is initialized throughout the domain at t 0 s to the inlet free stream of 2 43 m s to reduce the impulse load on the seal the solid stress solver fluid structure coupling solver and mesh motion solver are frozen while time is allowed to advance to t 10 s this develops the free surface profile throughout the domain and allows the free surface oscillations to dissipate prior to releasing the seal without this stabilization period a breaking wave that forms within the cushion at the larger inflation pressures disturbs the seal beyond recovery beginning at t 10 s all frozen solvers are released and the fluid load on the seal is ramped up as described above the simulation is allowed to run an additional 20 s until t 30 s to verify a steady state condition is reached oscillations in both the seal position and fluid pressure ahead of the seal are checked to ensure they are stable and not increasing with time 4 7 planer bow seal results initial simulations are conducted for cushion gage pressures of 252 475 953 and 997 pa inlet flow velocity is maintained at 2 43 m s for all cases these conditions were initially selected by bloxom as a good representation of the um experimental results for each run data is collected at 100 hz and the final 5 s is averaged to obtain mean values for seal deflection and forces acting on the seal front and back surfaces 4 7 1 seal deflection a comparison of the seal deflection for the various cushion pressures is shown in fig 12 through fig 15 for the current results star ccm each point represents the average position over the final 5 s of the transient simulation the error bars show the extreme maximum and extreme minimum for each point over the same period at the two lowest cushion pressures the average positions are a good match to those reported by both bloxom 2014 and zalek and doctors 2010 at the lowest pressure fig 12 fig 13 there is a significantly larger range of motion in the seal in each of the two larger cushion pressure cases the current results slightly under predict the deflection seen in both the um experiment and bloxom s results there are two hypotheses for the variation first it is a possibility that the sidewalls of the platform in the um experiment slightly accelerate the flow at the seal edges where the position measurement was taken as observed in fig 2 of zalek and doctors 2010 leading to additional deflection this would explain bloxom s slight underprediction of deflection as well second and most likely the underprediction in deflection could result from the difference in the seal hyperelastic behavior versus that of the linear elastic modulus used in the current work as a compromise 4 mpa provided good agreement to the cantilever experiment and is used at the lowest two pressures for the two higher cushion pressures however initial runs revealed large dynamics for the seal with a 4 mpa modulus it was necessary to increase the modulus to 8 mpa in order to minimize the displacement standard deviations and maintain stability this additional stiffness appears to further reduce deflection in fig 14 and fig 15 comprehensive deflection results for all cases are provided in table 8 range indicates the range above the mean whereas range indicates the range below the mean the small standard deviations reveal the seal oscillations are small for all cases except at the lowest pressure of p c 252 pa at this condition the range of the x and z positions show that the seal is very lively upon the free surface flattening as it is pulled by shear forces 4 7 2 dimensional analysis dimensional analysis is a powerful technique used to identify relationships between various parameters within a physical phenomenon that are unknown a priori it assumes that governing equations are dimensionally homogenous and are inter related by fundamental quantities of mechanics its power lies in the fact that the relationships can be revealed with only a partial understanding of the problem the correctness of the analysis is based upon the initial choice of independent physical variables requiring only a qualitative insight examples of dimensional analyses for various hydrodynamic problems are provided by birkhoff 1955 newman 1977 and comstock 1983 the numerous parameters that affect seal drag make an exhaustive computational or experimental investigation very difficult if not impossible for this reason a dimensional analysis can be used to decrease the scope of the investigation and provide guidance for the final form of the governing physical relationships based upon first hand observation and previous seal scaling studies conducted by others wiggins 2014 malakhoff and davis 1981 the following physical parameters are believed to affect seal resistance r s seal width w m seal height h m seal face angle θ radians static immersion depth δ s m cushion pressure p c n m2 material flexural rigidity d f n m2 m fluid velocity u m s dynamic viscosity μ n s m2 fluid density ρ kg m3 and gravitational acceleration g m s2 a symbolic governing equation for seal resistance can be written as equation 6 if we assume a proportional relationship in the form of a power law the process of dimensional analysis can be applied resulting in a non dimensional euler number for seal resistance equation 7 examination of the non dimensional ratios given by the analysis reveals other well known groups such as the froude fn number and reynolds re number 6 r s f w h θ δ s p c d f u μ ρ g 7 r s ρ w 2 u 2 f h w θ δ s w p c ρ u 2 d f ρ w 3 u 2 μ w ρ u w g u 2 although the unspecified exponents remain unknown and the form of the function f must be found empirically the usefulness in this result is that if the non dimensional ratios remain equal for differently sized but geometrically similar seals the value for the non dimensional resistance should be the same the remaining groups are unique to the problem of seal resistance and originate from the choice of independent variables it should be reiterated that due to restrictions of subscale testing it is difficult to simultaneously match all dimensionless groups between full and model scales maintaining a correct fn will lead to an inaccurate re and vice versa achieving dynamic similitude for subscale tests has always been difficult but is even more so for acv seals due to the multitude of physical interactions that must be accounted for such as lift flow rate cushion pressure seal stiffness etc wiggins 2014 previous work by doctors et al 2014 arrived at a different form for resistance for instance as cushion pressure can be written as p c ρ g δ c where δ c is the static depression of the free surface due to cushion pressure we can consider δ c as an independent parameter in lieu of p c additionally if the characteristic length is chosen as the seal static immersion δ s instead of width w then the groups identified by the dimensional analysis will be those of equation 8 8 r s ρ δ s 2 u 2 f h δ s θ w δ s δ c δ s d f ρ δ s 3 u 2 μ ρ δ s u g δ s u 2 4 7 3 seal resistance the total force on the seal front surface results from hydrodynamic pressure and shear loads due to the passing fluid the total force on the seal inner surface results from air pressure within the cushion acting normal to the seal toward the end of the simulation the seal dynamics have largely subsided and the body inertial forces are generally low the seal attachment force is then calculated to satisfy the force balance in equation 9 the seal resistance in the x direction r s is the summation of the hydrodynamic pressure r h y d r o and shear forces r τ acting on the seal front surface in the x direction the cushion pressure force acting on the seal inner surface in the x direction is r c u s h the reaction force due to the attachment in the x direction is r x 9 σ f x 0 r s r c u s h r x r s r h y d r o r τ in a similar fashion to results presented by both bloxom 2014 and zalek and doctors 2010 the resistance results are nondimensionalized for the froude number fδ of 1 6 again the characteristic length chosen for calculation of the froude number equation 10 is the seal static immersion depth δs r s is nondimensionalized according to the form shown in equation 11 where b c is the cushion beam this form is provided by exchanging u 2 for g b c from equation 8 the cushion pressure p c is collected from a cushion pressure monitor located within the cushion region slightly above and behind the seal it is nondimensionalized according to equation 12 10 f δ u g δ s 11 r s ρ g b c δ s 2 12 p c ρ g δ s fig 16 plots non dimensional resistance vs non dimensional cushion pressure using the mean of the final 5 s of the transient simulation as the simulation width consists of a single cell of width 0 01 m all forces are scaled by 152 4 to compare with the experimental seal width of 1 524 m the current approach overpredicts resistance at all cushion pressures when compared to both the bloxom results and the um results 32 59 16 19 for run 1051 1058 1114 and 1121 respectively the most probable explanation for the overprediction in the higher pressure cases is that the linear elastic seal modulus of 8 mpa is overly stiff especially near the attachment a hyperelastic material model could perhaps improve the results as the stiffness would decrease with increased stress this does not explain the resistance delta at the lower pressures however as the average deflections shown previously are a near match for these cases table 9 provides the resistance component breakdown for each cushion pressure as the results for r s are mean values over the final 5 s of the simulation the standard error of the mean is shown as σ x the standard deviations for r s are shown as σ interestingly the values for σ are generally very similar despite the large difference in cushion pressures this may indicate the sources of unsteadiness such as numerical noise or upstream free surface spillage have equal influence across a broad range of conditions also the largest value for σ run 1058 correlates precisely to the greatest percent error for resistance fig 17 plots the results for seal resistance versus cushion pressure using an alternative non dimensional form found by the dimensionless group derivation the left axis makes resistance dimensionless by ρ g b c δ s 2 whereas the right axis makes resistance dimensionless by ρ u 2 b c 2 an interesting result is that both data sets show similar exponents when the relationship is reflected as a power law revealing either form is equally useful for scaling the current star ccm results show resistance as a factor of p c 2 24 analysis using bloxom s results show resistance as a factor of p c 2 49 5 conclusion this work documents an effort to verify validate and apply a commercial multi physics tool star ccm toward the difficult problem of acv seal resistance upon a free surface first the work uses comparative results for the elastic beam fsi numerical benchmark proposed by turek and hron 2006 using case cfd3 the observed order of accuracy is demonstrated to be just below the formal order and the lift and drag values are shown to converge which verifies the fluid solver the solver is validated based upon the 0 034 difference between the benchmark and the extrapolated exact solution using case csm2 the structural solver is shown to converge the tip displacement result to within 0 8 of the benchmark providing verification and validation using case fsi3 the integrated fluid structure interaction capability of the program is evaluated results for 11 different cases show the relative influence of the solution parameters and demonstrate improvements in displacement drag and lift with increased inner iterations the best overall comparison is achieved using 30 inner iterations yielding a tip y displacement error of 4 05 mean drag error of 1 02 and mean lift error of 4 05 next this work simulates an acv planer bow seal experiment to verify and validate its use for pressurized seals upon a free surface excellent agreement is achieved for seal deflection at the two lowest cushion pressures and acceptable agreement is achieved for the highest two cushion pressures the importance of employing an appropriate material model for the seal is demonstrated as the absence of a hyperelastic model requires the substitution of a linear elastic model the present resistance results agree with the prior numerical and experimental data moderately well and similar scaling characteristics are found using either of the non dimensional forms the primary contribution of this work is the expansion of fsi validation for problems having strong added mass effects in the region of a free surface until recently separate partitioned solvers were required to simulate the various physics needed to achieve these results further fsi validation cases using commercial programs were largely limited to either small deflections or a single fluid as in the case of aero elasticity with this work verification of star ccm as a stand alone partitioned fsi solver drastically speeds up the setup and runtime and reduces the complexity of previous approaches opening the door to designers who may have been computationally limited previously from the work above a great many aspects of acv seal modeling and behavior remain unexplored and the prospects for future work are plentiful for a direct continuation of this research the planer seal parameters should be altered to develop results that more fully explore the parametric relationships identified variations in seal face angle width and height should be explored to build confidence for designers of craft that exceed the state of the practice also a current restriction in the present results is the absence of a hyperelastic material model for the seal continued attention should be paid to the availability of tools that offer hyperelastic models and implicit solvers to accommodate behavior of nonlinear materials lastly although the importance of three dimensional effects will need to be considered for practical applications and more complex seal geometries they were largely unexplored in this study the two dimensional approximation for an ses planer seal is generally acceptable except for large planform sidewall configurations for these cases successful solution of the fluid solvers requires discretization in the beam direction approaching that of the flow direction a thoughtful application of mesh bias could reduce the computation burden in these cases acknowledgments this effort was primarily funded by the dod science mathematics and

22472,this paper assesses the prediction approaches for the roll damping coefficients based on experimental decay tests ikeda s original method himeno 1981 and the simplified approach kawahara et al 2009 that has been proposed for the second generation intact stability criteria in imo the damping coefficients obtained from these procedures have been applied in a time domain nonlinear model for the simulation of ship motions in waves developed to perform direct stability assessments furthermore a set of model test results with a vlcc oil tanker in decay regular and irregular wave tests have

assessment simulations keywords roll damping ikeda 2nd generation intact stability criteria roll decay tests numerical simulation 1 introduction the 2nd generation intact stability criteria has been under development in the imo for around 15 years imo slf 2006 this new set of rules consists of five stability vulnerability modes to be evaluated in three levels as consolidated in the report of the experts group on intact stability imo sdc 2019 in this new approach a more physical and rational analysis is required compared to the prescriptive nature of the current 2009 is code imo 2009 the assessment of vulnerability in the second and third levels requires time domain simulations for some of the failure modes for instance parametric rolling therefore roll damping coefficients estimates are necessary to perform the numerical predictions the explanatory notes developed within imo ship design and construction sdc subcommittee and presented in imo sdc 2016 recommend the use of the simplified ikeda empirical procedure kawahara et al 2009 to estimate the roll damping coefficients for the modes of failure of parametric roll dead ship and excessive acceleration to verify the applicability of this approach the present work have performed a detailed comparison of those results with those from the original or complete ikeda formulation himeno 1981 and from experimental results using a vlcc type oil tanker as case study 2 estimation of roll damping coefficients from decay tests roll damping was already considered by froude froude 1872 froude et al 1955 and since his early contribution this topic has remained in the focus of several researchers the analytical mathematical modelling of roll damping and the corresponding analysis of experimental data has been the basis for many studies and text books e g bulian 2004 cardo et al 1982 dalzell 1978 faltinsen 1990 flower 1982 francescutto and contento 1999 haddara and bennett 1989 mathisen and price 1985 moraes pernambuco 1990 park et al 2017 roberts 1985 spyrou and thompson 2000 and a oliva remola et al 2018 the roll motion of a ship in waves can be expressed as a one degree of freedom equation defined as 1 i 44 a 44 ϕ t b ϕ t c 44 ϕ t m ϕ where ϕ t represents roll i 44 is the roll inertia a 44 and c 44 denote the added mass and hydrostatic restoring coefficients respectively and m ϕ is the exciting

squares iterative method 2 1 logarithmic decrement method if the exciting moment in eq 5 is a harmonic function then the resulting roll motion takes the following form 7 φ t φ 0 cos ω t then in the quadratic damping term of eq 6 we get 8 φ φ φ 0 2 ω 2 sin ω t sin ω t it is possible to describe the function sin ωt sin ωt as a fourier series 9 sin ω t sin ω t 8 3 π sin ω t n 3 5 8 π n 2 n n 2 sin

is possible to find the equivalent linear damping 16 p 2 δ k t k for each cycle p versus 16 3tk ϕk will be plotted where ϕk is the initial angle for each cycle by linear regression on p data and eq 6 p1 and p2 can be obtained as shown in fig 1 2 2 froude s energy method this method is based on the energy balance which assumes that the dissipated energy by the damping term in half cycle is equal to the variation of the potential energy as the kinetic energy at the initial and final positions are zero in the roll decay equation assuming linear plus quadratic damping the energy balance gives 17 0

called k method is based on the fitting of the numerical solution of the roll decay equation eq 13 to the time series of the decay test the fitting process is iterative and based on the least squares method using the damping coefficients in the roll decay equation as parameters 3 vlcc tanker data the ship selected for this study is a very large crude carrier vlcc oil tanker its main characteristics at the full loading condition are shown in table 1 a 1 70 scaled model has been tested at the ocean technology laboratory laboceano of the federal university of rio de janeiro the tests included decay tests regular wave and irregular wave tests 3 1 decay tests results the results of b 1 and b 2 that are the dimensional terms of the non dimensional p1 and p2 damping coefficients have been obtained based on three sets of decay tests with different initial heel angles and three repetitions hence the tests with initial angle 5 pt18 00300 pt18 00301 and pt18 00302 10 pt18 00303 pt18 00304 and pt18 00305 and 15 pt18 00306 pt18 00307 and pt18 00308 a typical decay test is illustrated in fig 3 tables 2 4 show the results of the analyses of the decay tests for the vlcc using the methods described earlier for the three initial conditions for the first set b 1 and b 2 represent the dimensional coefficients corresponding to p 1 and p 2 tables 5 7 summarize the results for each method considering the average results with the 3 repetitions included from tables 5 7 one can notice that each of the three procedures resulted in different pairs b1 and b2 based on the same time history of the decay test for each initial angle the initial angle showed different influence in each of the three procedures to estimate the damping coefficients in the energy method there is a larger influence particularly in the quadratic term b2 whereas in the logarithmic method the impact of the initial angle was much smaller 4 ikeda s method 4 1 context and development the equation of roll motion can be expressed as 26 φ b 1 φ b 2 φ φ c 1 φ m an empirical method for roll damping prediction of ships has been proposed by ikeda et al 1978 later himeno 1981 made a comprehensive review of ikeda s method and also presented a computer code for numerical application the method is based on the assumption that roll damping can be separated in components that can be computed independently according to various kinds of fluid flow phenomena namely skin friction of the hull eddy shedding from the hull free surface waves etc it was also pointed out that roll damping may be strongly affected by the presence of bilge keels rudder and other appendages the original method for predicting the roll damping of ships was developed for conventional hull shapes of cargo ships whose block coefficient cb is around 0 56 0 85 and froude number is up to 0 25 in ikeda s method the total roll damping coefficient for an ordinary ship hull form can be divided into five components namely friction eddy lift and wave damping for the naked hull plus bilge keels damping bbk i e 27 b e b f b e b l b w b b k 28 b b k b b k n b b k h b b k w friction damping b f is caused by the skin friction stress on the hull in roll motion the eddy damping b e is caused by the pressure variation on the naked hull due to the formation of eddies b l represents the lift damping which is associated to the lifting effect of the hull itself in roll motion due to ship forward speed the wave damping b w denotes the increment of the hull pressure due to the presence of free surface waves bilge keel damping b bk represents the increment of pressure damping due to the presence of bilge keels this term can be divided in three components b bkn due to the normal force on the bilge keels themselves b bkh which represents the damping due to the pressure change on the hull when bilge keels are installed i e accounts for the interaction between hull and bilge keels and b bkw which is the wave damping due to the presence of bilge keels in summary according to ikeda s method b l b w and b bkw account for non viscous damping whereas b f b e b bkn b bkh represent the viscous effects subsequently kawahara et al 2009 have proposed a simplified procedure for roll damping estimation based on ikeda s original method this simplified approach only requires main ship dimensions and coefficients as input data instead of the detailed hull geometry data as in the original ikeda s method 4 2 numerical tool based on the original ikeda s method himeno 1981 a computer program for the numerical prediction of roll damping and the corresponding damping coefficients b 1 and b 2 have been implemented additionally an option for the calculation of the simplified ikeda s method has been included 4 3 input data for ikeda s method tables 8 10 present the data of the vlcc tanker that was used as input for the damping prediction script based on ikeda s method the test case is a conventional tanker hull form with cb below 0 85 and with froude number 0 therefore the test case is within ikeda s method limits of validity the numbers in brackets in the block coefficient and in the midship

it is also clear that the error was smaller for the test starting with 15 and with 10 another aspect is that the natural period of the oscillations seems to change in the pt18 00300 test what could be the cause of the highest relative error 5 2 regular wave tests figs 11 13 display the time series of the regular wave conditions from model tests and numerical simulations the nomenclature for time

three wave heights from figs 11 13 and table 15 one can notice that the test with the smallest wave height t18 01300 equal to 3 5 m has resulted in smaller errors in the numeric standard deviation compared to the model tests standard deviation the two other regular waves resulted in predicted amplitudes by the numerical simulation smaller than the test amplitudes the damping coefficients predicted by the logarithmic and froude based experimental procedures resulted in the best simulation results smallest errors for each test again the simplified ikeda method resulted in the poorest predictions while the ikeda original or complete remained in the same order of discrepancy of the experimental damping coefficients procedures the regular wave comparison particularly for the 7 0 m

shown a better agreement than the regular wave test comparisons the same tendency for the decay and regular tests comparisons remained with the simplified ikeda method resulting in the worst option with more than 15 below the model test rms the ikeda original or completed has resulted in an error below 2 in the same order of magnitude of the experimental procedures to estimate the roll damping coefficients perhaps due to the irregular nature of the flow around the hull and bilge keel the non linear quadratic roll damping model has come up with a better prediction than the regular wave case see tables 16 20 6 linearization procedure in order to verify if the damping terms prediction procedures can be linearized and used in linear frequency domain programs the following linearization

results the linearization iterative procedure has been applied for the 5 pairs of damping coefficients calculated by the 5 different numerical procedures also the roll rao has been calculated by the uncoupled single degree of freedom roll motion equation and with the 6 degrees of freedom equation leading to the following results including the linearized damping coefficient in the frequency domain analysis using the computer program wamit and the same model test sea state t18 001600 it is possible to determine the roll motion rms and to compare with the model test rms observing table 21 and table 22 one can conclude that the linearized damping coefficient predicts the roll response in the frequency domain method with higher errors than in the non linear simulations the errors range from 12 to 63 overprediction bearing this in mind we calibrate a b2 coefficient in order to attain the correct rms of the model test 3 73 the idea is to perform an inverse way i e knowing the rms we can predict the b2 coefficient that results in exactly the rms measured in the model test it should also be noted the ikeda original complete prediction of the b1 coefficient is exactly the potential damping coefficient see tables 23 28 8 conclusions although some differences were observed in the damping coefficients among the three methods of decay tests analyses all of them in general reproduced well the decay time series the initial angle on decay tests at least for the tested vlcc tanker has a different influence on the obtained damping coefficients being larger in the froude or energy method and smaller in the logarithmic method regarding the assessment of damping coefficients in simulation of decay tests regular and irregular wave tests the conclusions have been summarized in the form of tables and organized by method and type of test using the following colours code to assess the roll motion prediction blue results of the numerical simulations using each method s predicted damping coefficients are greater than the model test series green simulations reasonably agree with model tests red simulations are below the model tests in general ikeda s original approach performed better than the simplified approach indeed in some of the studied conditions the simplified approach failed while the original approach did quite well as the simplified approach is currently the recommended procedure for roll estimation in the context of second generation intact stability criteria it is suggested that to improve the numerical simulations ikeda s original method should be considered especially for direct assessment calculations the roll rms predicted in the time domain simulations for irregular waves predicted by the original ikeda s method were within 5 of the model tests results the simplified approach showed excessive damping leading to small roll angle predictions when linearized damping coefficients are used for frequency domain simulations for irregular waves both damping coefficients from decays tests and form ikeda s prediction showed higher roll rms compared to the irregular wave tests i e damping was under predicted see figs 19 23 acknowledgments

22472,this paper assesses the prediction approaches for the roll damping coefficients based on experimental decay tests ikeda s original method himeno 1981 and the simplified approach kawahara et al 2009 that has been proposed for the second generation intact stability criteria in imo the damping coefficients obtained from these procedures have been applied in a time domain nonlinear model for the simulation of ship motions in waves developed to perform direct stability assessments furthermore a set of model test results with a vlcc oil tanker in decay regular and irregular wave tests have been used as benchmark to assess the accuracy of the damping estimates a single degree of freedom numerical model has also been implemented to compare their results with those of the 6 dof direct assessment simulations keywords roll damping ikeda 2nd generation intact stability criteria roll decay tests numerical simulation 1 introduction the 2nd generation intact stability criteria has been under development in the imo for around 15 years imo slf 2006 this new set of rules consists of five stability vulnerability modes to be evaluated in three levels as consolidated in the report of the experts group on intact stability imo sdc 2019 in this new approach a more physical and rational analysis is required compared to the prescriptive nature of the current 2009 is code imo 2009 the assessment of vulnerability in the second and third levels requires time domain simulations for some of the failure modes for instance parametric rolling therefore roll damping coefficients estimates are necessary to perform the numerical predictions the explanatory notes developed within imo ship design and construction sdc subcommittee and presented in imo sdc 2016 recommend the use of the simplified ikeda empirical procedure kawahara et al 2009 to estimate the roll damping coefficients for the modes of failure of parametric roll dead ship and excessive acceleration to verify the applicability of this approach the present work have performed a detailed comparison of those results with those from the original or complete ikeda formulation himeno 1981 and from experimental results using a vlcc type oil tanker as case study 2 estimation of roll damping coefficients from decay tests roll damping was already considered by froude froude 1872 froude et al 1955 and since his early contribution this topic has remained in the focus of several researchers the analytical mathematical modelling of roll damping and the corresponding analysis of experimental data has been the basis for many studies and text books e g bulian 2004 cardo et al 1982 dalzell 1978 faltinsen 1990 flower 1982 francescutto and contento 1999 haddara and bennett 1989 mathisen and price 1985 moraes pernambuco 1990 park et al 2017 roberts 1985 spyrou and thompson 2000 and a oliva remola et al 2018 the roll motion of a ship in waves can be expressed as a one degree of freedom equation defined as 1 i 44 a 44 ϕ t b ϕ t c 44 ϕ t m ϕ where ϕ t represents roll i 44 is the roll inertia a 44 and c 44 denote the added mass and hydrostatic restoring coefficients respectively and m ϕ is the exciting moment dividing by i 44 a 44 2 ϕ b i 44 a 44 ϕ m g g m i 44 a 44 ϕ m ϕ the natural damped frequency ωn is given by 3 m g g m i 44 a 44 ω n 2 and the normalized damping p is 4 p b i 44 a 44 so that the normalized roll equation is 5 ϕ p ϕ ω n 2 ϕ m ϕ defining the damping term as linear and quadratic as in most contributions reviewed to prepare this paper results in the following term 6 p φ p 1 φ p 2 φ φ three procedures have been applied to obtain the damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 from the decay tests the logarithmic decrement method the froude energy method quadratic form and a numeric least squares iterative method 2 1 logarithmic decrement method if the exciting moment in eq 5 is a harmonic function then the resulting roll motion takes the following form 7 φ t φ 0 cos ω t then in the quadratic damping term of eq 6 we get 8 φ φ φ 0 2 ω 2 sin ω t sin ω t it is possible to describe the function sin ωt sin ωt as a fourier series 9 sin ω t sin ω t 8 3 π sin ω t n 3 5 8 π n 2 n n 2 sin

eq 14 we define the logarithmic decrement in cycle k as 15 δ k ln φ k φ k 2 ln e p 2 t k p 2 t k where ϕk and ϕk 2 are respectively the magnitudes of the roll angles at times t k and t k t k then it is possible to find the equivalent linear damping 16 p 2 δ k t k for each cycle p versus 16 3tk ϕk will be plotted where ϕk is the initial angle for each cycle by linear regression on p data and eq 6 p1 and p2 can be obtained as shown in fig 1 2 2 froude s energy method this method is based on the energy balance which assumes that the dissipated energy by the damping term in half cycle is equal to the variation of the potential energy as the kinetic energy at the initial and final positions are zero in the roll decay equation assuming linear plus quadratic damping the energy balance gives 17 0 t t 2 ϕ p 1 ϕ p 2 ϕ ϕ ω n 2 ϕ d ϕ 0 as d ϕ d t ϕ then d ϕ ϕ d t then 18 0 t t 2 φ p 1 φ p 2 φ φ φ d t φ k φ k 1 ω n 2 φ φ d t 0 integrating and considering k 1 19 0 t t 2 φ t φ t d t 0 20 0 t t 2 p 1

3 t 2 φ 0 3 ω n 2 φ 1 φ 2 φ 1 φ 2 2 with ω n 2 π t and ϕ 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 2 then dividing by 4π2 t 2 we get 24 p 1 t 4 φ 0 p 2 4 3 φ 0 2 φ 1 φ 2 if we also define δ φ φ 1 φ 2 then 25 δ φ p 1 t 4 φ 0 p 2 4 3 φ 0 2 eq 25 denotes a quadratic parabolic function for δϕ against ϕ0 fig 2 illustrates a typical fitting for decay data using the energy method 2 3 least squares iterative method this method here called k method is based on the fitting of the numerical solution of the roll decay equation eq 13 to the time series of the decay test the fitting process is iterative and based on the least squares method using the damping coefficients in the roll decay equation as parameters 3 vlcc tanker data the ship selected for this study is a very large crude carrier vlcc oil tanker its main characteristics at the full loading condition are shown in table 1 a 1 70 scaled model has been tested at the ocean technology laboratory laboceano of the federal university of rio de janeiro the tests included decay tests regular wave and irregular wave tests 3 1 decay tests results the results of b 1 and b 2 that are the dimensional terms of the non dimensional p1 and p2 damping coefficients have been obtained based on three sets of decay tests with different initial heel angles and three repetitions hence the tests with initial angle 5 pt18 00300 pt18 00301 and pt18 00302 10 pt18 00303 pt18 00304 and pt18 00305 and 15 pt18 00306 pt18 00307 and pt18 00308 a typical decay test is illustrated in fig 3 tables 2 4 show the results of the analyses of the decay tests for the vlcc using the methods described earlier for the three initial conditions for the first set b 1 and b 2 represent the dimensional coefficients corresponding to p 1 and p 2 tables 5 7 summarize the results for each method considering the average results with the 3 repetitions included from tables 5 7 one can notice that each of the three procedures resulted in different pairs b1 and b2 based on the same time history of the decay test for each initial angle the initial angle showed different influence in each of the three procedures to estimate the damping coefficients in the energy method there is a larger influence particularly in the quadratic term b2 whereas in the logarithmic method the impact of the initial angle was much smaller 4 ikeda s method 4 1 context and development the equation of roll motion can be expressed as 26 φ b 1 φ b 2 φ φ c 1 φ m an empirical method for roll damping prediction of ships has been proposed by ikeda et al 1978 later himeno 1981 made a comprehensive review of ikeda s method and also presented a computer code for numerical application the method is based on the assumption that roll damping can be separated in components that can be computed independently according to various kinds of fluid flow phenomena namely skin friction of the hull eddy shedding from the hull free surface waves etc it was also pointed out that roll damping may be strongly affected by the presence of bilge keels rudder and other appendages the original method for predicting the roll damping of ships was developed for conventional hull shapes of cargo ships whose block coefficient cb is around 0 56 0 85 and froude number is up to 0 25 in ikeda s method the total roll damping coefficient for an ordinary ship hull form can be divided into five components namely friction eddy lift and wave damping for the naked hull plus bilge keels damping bbk i e 27 b e b f b e b l b w b b k 28 b b k b b k n b b k h b b k w friction damping b f is caused by the skin friction stress on the hull in roll motion the eddy damping b e is caused by the pressure variation on the naked hull due to the formation of eddies b l represents the lift damping which is associated to the lifting effect of the hull itself in roll motion due to ship forward speed the wave damping b w denotes the increment of the hull pressure due to the presence of free surface waves bilge keel damping b bk represents the increment of pressure damping due to the presence of bilge keels this term can be divided in three components b bkn due to the normal force on the bilge keels themselves b bkh which represents the damping due to the pressure change on the hull when bilge keels are installed i e accounts for the interaction between hull and bilge keels and b bkw which is the wave damping due to the presence of bilge keels in summary according to ikeda s method b l b w and b bkw account for non viscous damping whereas b f b e b bkn b bkh represent the viscous effects subsequently kawahara et al 2009 have proposed a simplified procedure for roll damping estimation based on ikeda s original method this simplified approach only requires main ship dimensions and coefficients as input data instead of the detailed hull geometry data as in the original ikeda s method 4 2 numerical tool based on the original ikeda s method himeno 1981 a computer program for the numerical prediction of roll damping and the corresponding damping coefficients b 1 and b 2 have been implemented additionally an option for the calculation of the simplified ikeda s method has been included 4 3 input data for ikeda s method tables 8 10 present the data of the vlcc tanker that was used as input for the damping prediction script based on ikeda s method the test case is a conventional tanker hull form with cb below 0 85 and with froude number 0 therefore the test case is within ikeda s method limits of validity the numbers in brackets in the block coefficient and in the midship coefficient lines in table 10 are the limits of validity for the ikeda procedure 4 4 damping coefficients results the components of the roll damping moment its total value and the corresponding

predict the b2 coefficient that results in exactly the rms measured in the model test it should also be noted the ikeda original complete prediction of the b1 coefficient is exactly the potential damping coefficient see tables 23 28 8 conclusions although some differences were observed in the damping coefficients among the three methods of decay tests analyses all of them in general reproduced well the decay time series the initial angle on decay tests at least for the tested vlcc tanker has a different influence on the obtained damping coefficients being larger in the froude or energy method and smaller in the logarithmic method regarding the assessment of damping coefficients in simulation of decay tests regular and irregular wave tests the conclusions have been summarized in the form of tables and organized by method and type of test using the following colours code to assess the roll motion prediction blue results of the numerical simulations using each method s predicted damping coefficients are greater than the model test series green simulations reasonably agree with model tests red simulations are below the model tests in general ikeda s original approach performed better than the simplified approach indeed in some of the studied conditions the simplified approach failed while the original approach did quite well as the simplified approach is currently the recommended procedure for roll estimation in the context of second generation intact stability criteria it is suggested that to improve the numerical simulations ikeda s original method should be considered especially for direct assessment calculations the roll rms predicted in the time domain simulations for irregular waves predicted by the original ikeda s method were within 5 of the model tests results the simplified approach showed excessive damping leading to small roll angle predictions when linearized damping coefficients are used for frequency domain simulations for irregular waves both damping coefficients from decays tests and form ikeda s prediction showed higher roll rms compared to the irregular wave tests i e damping was under predicted see figs 19 23 acknowledgments

22473,local scour around foundations is a hot research topic in ocean engineering especially for shallow composite bucket foundations in this study a physical model was developed for the scour induced by waves and current around a composite bucket foundation foundation models with scales of 1 40 and 1 60 were placed in a flume and the scour process was monitored at eight points arranged evenly and symmetrically along the model circumference the scoured topography was investigated in detail under different wave and current conditions and the maximum equilibrium scour depths were compared the experimental results showed that the combined wave current condition induced a greater scour range than the wave only or current only condition but it did not necessarily induce a greater equilibrium scour depth than the current only condition in contrast to the current induced scour the combined wave current and wave only conditions induced obvious scour pits in the front of and close to the foundation the effects of dimensionless parameters such as the keulegan carpenter number k c ratio of velocities u c w and froude number f r a on the maximum equilibrium scour depth were considered keywords local scour composite bucket foundation combined wave current action maximum equilibrium scour depth keulegan carpenter number 1 introduction in the near future there are plans for the intensive construction of offshore windfarms in the relatively shallow waters along the coast of china nie and li 2018 the wide shallow composite bucket foundation cbf has been proposed for offshore wind power because of its strong stability against overturning and its suitability for soft soils liu et al 2014 ding et al 2015 however the complex marine environment and interacting factors such as waves and current lead to a complex flow field around the arc transition of cbf that increases the local bed shear stress and scour in contrast to deep foundations like monopiles shallow cbfs are more susceptible to scour which have a negative effect on the capacity of the foundation and the safety of the structure chen et al 2018 liu et al 2018 therefore the local scour characteristics around cbfs due to waves and current need to be investigated at present the research on the scour around offshore wind turbine foundations affected by wave current interactions mainly focuses on pile foundations which are generally suitable for shallow water water depth is less than 30 m therefore domestic and foreign scholars have carried out a considerable amount of research on the characteristics of the flow field around the pile foundation the mechanism of local scour and the equilibrium scour depth under the combined action of waves and current rudolph and bos 2006 jiang et al 2011 zanke et al 2011 qi and gao 2014a dyrseth 2015 chen and li 2018 sumer and fredsøe 2001 conducted a series of scour tests and the results indicated that the scour depth due to combined wave current action is influenced by the keulegan carpenter number k c and ratio of velocities u c w it is also proposed that the scour depth can be reduced significantly with respect to its steady current value for a combination of small values of the k c number and u c w it is worth noting that whether there are such characteristics of the scour around cbfs induced by different wave and current conditions qi and gao 2014b examined experimentally the local scour development for a monopile subjected to the waves plus current and proved that the horseshoe vortex is one of the main factors for the scour process similarly the influence of horseshoe vortex and wake vortex on scour holes also should be concerned as well as the scour mechanism of cbfs however these research results are only aimed at the wind turbine foundation with simple boundary conditions such as pile foundations which cannot be directly applied to the structures with complex boundaries and the extensive research on cbfs has not been carried out thus reference should be made to relevant papers and test methods for scour around foundations with complex boundary conditions yang et al 2010 kim et al 2016 welzel et al 2019 stroescu et al 2016 showed the comparative scour results for monopile and bucket foundations and it proved that the driving parameter for the process of scour is the ratio between large diameter bucket lid and the small diameter shaft tower stroescu and frigaard 2016 further proved by field experience that the mono bucket foundations have good response against scour development under irregular waves superposition with co directional or opposing tidal flow this paper demonstrated good agreement between field measurements and small scale studies which provides guidance for the research method and support for the application of the experimental results of cbfs tavouktsoglou et al 2017 presented a method for predicting equilibrium scour depth around cylindrical structures with uniform and non uniform geometries under the forcing of a unidirectional current in this paper the base diameter was selected to calculate the scour depth which provides a new idea for the selection of characteristic diameter of cbfs with variable diameters these studies provide a strong theoretical basis for investigating the scour around cbfs with the unique arc transition yu et al 2016 identified the scour mechanism of cbfs subjected to a steady and bidirectional current and discussed the relationship between the maximum scour depth and other dimensionless parameters however research on scour characteristics around cbfs under the combined wave current action has not been conducted for some reasons therefore this paper presents a series of experiments to investigate the scour induced by waves and current around a cbf and proposes non dimensional parameters for summarizing common features of the scour process around structures due to wave current interactions the non dimensional parameters of the scour are also compared with pile foundation umeda et al 2003 qi and gao 2014b chen and li 2018 furthermore the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the dimensional analysis experimental setup test conditions and procedure section 3 presents the results of the scour test for a cbf model under different wave and current conditions and compares the maximum equilibrium scour depths the effects of the dimensional parameters on the maximum equilibrium scour depth are discussed in sections 3 3 3 5 finally section 4 gives the conclusions of this study 2 experimental setup and test conditions 2 1 dimensional analysis the scour around a cbf subjected to the combined action of waves and current is a complex interaction among the waves current foundation and neighbouring soil as shown in fig 1 the scour process is mainly related to the foundation sand bed and hydrodynamic load parameters the foundation parameter is the base diameter of arc transition d the sand bed parameters are the median diameter d 50 and density ρ s of the sand the hydrodynamic load parameters are the density of water ρ w kinematic viscosity of water ν water depth h wave period t maximum value of the undisturbed orbital velocity at the sea bottom just above the wave boundary layer u w m and near bed current velocity u c because of the presence of a free surface the gravitational acceleration g should also be included thus there are 10 parameters for the scour around a cbf induced by waves and current the equilibrium scour depth s is described by the following functional relationship 1 s f d d 50 ρ s ρ w ν h t u w m u c g according to the buckingham π theorem d g and ρ w were chosen as the basic quantities then eq 1 can be expressed with dimensionless parameters 2 s d f f r a k c u c w r e d θ d 50 d h d s the froude number f r a based on mean flow velocity k c u c w reynolds number of the cbf r e d and shields parameter θ are respectively defined as follows 3 f r a u a g d 4 k c u m t d 5 u c w u c u c u w m 6 r e d u c u w m d ν 7 θ u f m 2 g s 1 d 50 u a is the average water particle velocity induced by superposing the waves and near bed current for one quarter of a cycle which is defined as u a 1 t 4 0 t 4 u c u w m sin 2 π t t d t u c 2 π u w m u m is calculated by linear theory u m ω a sin k h for random waves k c r m s corresponds to root mean square rms value calculated according to ong et al 2013 k c r m s 2 π a r m s d sin k p h where k p is the wave number corresponding to the peak frequency k p ω p 2 π t p a r m s 2 σ η σ η 2 0 s η f d f where s η f is the wave spectrum of the instantaneous free surface elevation η t u f m is the maximum friction velocity and was computed by referencing soulsby 1997 when d 50 d 0 02 d 50 d is considered to have a negligible effect on the scour development h d is the ratio of the water depth to the diameter of the foundation which has some influence on the downflow and horseshoe vortex around the foundation melville and coleman 2000 s is the specific gravity of sand defined as s ρ s ρ w and the value is 2 063 for the test sand the shields parameter θ reflects the magnitude of the bed shear stress which represents the ratio between the drag force acting on sand particles and the weight of the sand particles the scour is divided into clear water scour where θ θ c r and live bed scour θ c r is the critical shields parameter for sand particles to start to move and is defined as proposed by soulsby 1997 as follows 8 θ c r 0 3 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 exp 0 02 d where the non dimensional grain size d is defined as d d 50 s 1 g ν 2 1 3 the pile reynolds number is not usually considered a significant parameter if the flow is fully turbulent ettema et al 1998 in the present tests the cbf generally has a high reynolds number r e d 10 4 so the flow around the test model is turbulent and the effect of r e d on the maximum equilibrium scour depth can be ignored k c is the controlling parameter for vortex generation and development around a cylindrical structure in waves and is used to correlate the scour depth around a pile with wave only and wave current actions at small k c even a slight current superimposed on a wave will significantly increase the scour depth this is because of the presence of a strong horseshoe vortex in both time and space in front of the pile even in the case of a weak current the effect of k c on the maximum equilibrium scour depth is discussed in section 3 3 u c w represents the proportion of the current velocity to the flow velocity thus a larger value of u c w indicates a stronger influence of the constant flow in sumer et al 1997 experiments an increase in u c w reduced the critical number of horseshoe vortex which was mainly because the back pressure gradient on the upstream side of the foundation increased and favoured the formation of the horseshoe vortex the effect of u c w on the maximum equilibrium scour depth is discussed in section 3 4 f r a is based on a one quarter wave period of the mean flow velocity and is a dimensionless parameter that affects the scour depth it is discussed in section 3 5 2 2 experimental setup physical model experiments were carried out in the wave current flume in shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering ocean university of china the flume was 60 m in length 3 m in width and 1 5 m in height the experimental sand basin was 4 m in length 2 2 m in width and 0 2 m in depth and was located in the middle of the flume as shown in fig 2 the sand had a median diameter of d 50 0 2 mm as shown in fig 3 the angle of repose of the sand was ϕ s 31 7 and the standard deviation of the sand was σ g 1 74 which reflected the particle size gradation of sand the experimental facility consisted of a current generating system wave generating system wave absorbing system and measurement system the measurement system was divided into a scour topography measurement system which comprised a laser rangefinder numerical control slide platform and supporting frame and characteristic points measurement system based on acoustic doppler velocimetry adv 2 3 test conditions table 1 summarises the experimental conditions the experiment was conducted with current only wave only and combined wave current actions two cbf models with bucket skirt diameters of 75 and 50 cm were selected for the experiments these corresponded to length scales of 1 40 and 1 60 respectively with the prototype having a bucket skirt diameter of 30 m based on the principles of froude similarity and the detailed drawing of the cbf with a scale of 1 40 is shown in fig 4 experimental run 1 was conducted with the current only conditions and was compared with runs 2 4 and 6 experimental run 5 was conducted with the wave only conditions and was compared with run 4 experimental runs 3 4 7 8 and 10 were conducted with the combined wave current conditions and were compared with run 2 with regard to the wave height wave period water depth flow velocity and model scale respectively experimental run 6 had irregular waves and was compared with run 4 with regard to the wave pattern for explanatory purposes the model with a bucket skirt diameter of 75 cm is taken here as an example the variation in the scour depth over time was monitored at eight monitoring points at regular time intervals of 1 or 0 5 h in order to accurately monitor the change in topography around the cbf model during the scour process and judge whether an equilibrium scour condition was achieved eight monitoring points were selected that were arranged evenly and symmetrically along the model circumference the distance from each monitoring point to the outer wall of the cbf model was 5 cm fig 5 shows the locations of each monitoring point for convenient illustration the monitoring points were named as follows no 1 was at 0 in the flow direction and no 2 was at 45 monitoring point in the flow direction the rest of the monitoring points were named in order and no 8 was at 315 the scour process was regarded as reaching a state of equilibrium over time if the variation in the scour depths of the eight monitoring points at regular time intervals was the same or the change was very small when each experimental run reached the scour equilibrium the scour topography was determined based on the scour depth of the measurement points within a specific area and confirmed according to the range of actual scour as shown in fig 6 in order to obtain the scour topography in detail while reducing the time required for reading data the scour depth was recorded at the edge of the scour area at distance intervals of 4 cm points with serious scour near the model were measured at distance intervals of 2 cm 2 4 test procedure because the scour depth around the model did not generally exceed 20 cm in this small scale laboratory test the initial bed condition was likely to affect the final results in order to reduce the error caused by the initial bed profile the sand basin was repeatedly levelled until the measured bed profile was within a tolerance range of 5 mm based on the ideal conditions meanwhile 5 cm thick wood blocks were placed in different directions under the model to prevent it from sinking before the sand bed was levelled after the initial sand bed was set water was allowed to rise along the flume until the required still water level was reached and water was added sufficiently slowly to prevent the initial bed conditions from being disturbed the flow depth was monitored throughout the experimental run against graduated scales attached to the flume wall after the recording was completed the water in the scour hole was drained by siphoning then the detailed geometry of the scour hole was photographed and the maximum equilibrium scour depth was measured with a steel ruler 3 results and discussion to investigate the scour process and the topography of the equilibrium scour hole for a cbf subjected to waves and current the experimental runs listed in table 1 were conducted and the results were discussed and compared 3 1 time variation of the scour depth 3 1 1 current only runs fig 7 shows the time variation of the scour depth at the eight monitoring points for experimental run 1 a higher absolute value for the scour depth on the curve indicates a more serious scour the scouring process commenced from the back of the model especially at monitoring point no 1 which had a scour depth that fluctuated from 0 mm to 11 mm and then back to 0 mm finally the scour depth had a stable elevation at no 8 during the initial 10 h of scour and then increased dramatically to 40 mm in the subsequent scour process the scour depth at monitoring point nos 2 7 varied little over time and a small sediment deposit of about 5 mm ultimately occurred at these points finally the fluctuation range of the scour depth varied from large 15 mm to small 2 mm as the scour developed no obvious fluctuation was observed from 22 h to 24 h so the equilibrium scour time was 22 h 3 1 2 runs with wave current interaction fig 8 shows the time variation of the scour depth at the eight monitoring points for experimental run 4 the scouring process commenced from the back of the model just like the current induced scour and it had a greater initial scour rate at monitoring point nos 2 and 8 compared to the other points the scour depth at no 8 fluctuated acutely but consistently increased to 37 mm during the scour process similarly monitoring point nos 4 7 were always in a state of scouring to equilibrium conditions except for a short term sediment deposit at monitoring point no 4 in the initial stage of scouring the scour depths at these four points had almost the same values when the equilibrium condition was achieved this differs from the current only scour results in which a small sediment deposit occurred at the front of the model as shown in fig 7 monitoring point nos 1 and 3 were always in the deposit state and the deposition thickness at these two points was back to zero in the end finally the fluctuation range of the scour depth varied from large 16 mm to small 1 mm as the scour developed no further fluctuation in the elevation was observed at these points from 31 h to 32 h so the equilibrium scour time was 31 h 3 1 3 wave only run fig 9 shows the variation in the scour depth over time at the eight monitoring points for experimental run 5 the scour at monitoring point nos 4 and 6 clearly had almost the same development process and the scour depths were greater than the depths at the other monitoring points and increased with time after 10 h of fluctuation a stable scour depth of 18 mm was reached the process was similar to those of the wave current and current only induced scour nos 2 and 8 also showed scour with a depth fluctuation range within 10 mm and the equilibrium scour depth at no 8 was less than that under the current only and combined wave current conditions the scour process commenced around the model except that the topography near monitoring point no 1 showed a sediment deposit this was different from the wave current and current only scour the variations in the scour over time at monitoring point nos 3 and 7 were almost the same and the sand was slightly silted at these points at the end the scour depth at monitoring point no 5 was even less and varied within 5 mm finally the fluctuation range of the scour depth varied from large 9 mm to small 1 mm as the scour developed no further elevation fluctuation was observed at these points from 20 h to 21 h so the equilibrium scour time was 20 h 3 2 topography of the scour hole 3 2 1 current only runs the scour topography for experimental run 1 is shown in fig 10 a all measurement points of the scour depth obtained by the scour topography measurement system were imported into the tecplot software and the topography of the equilibrium scour was drawn by interpolation where appropriate as shown in fig 10 b there was a small sediment deposit in front of the model and a slight scour on both sides of the foundation two obvious scour holes and some small scour pits formed behind the cbf with a basically symmetrical distribution in terms of morphology the scour hole had a maximum equilibrium scour depth of 67 mm near the foundation and the two wide and fat scour holes were spoon shaped deep in the front and shallow in the back although there were obvious sand ripples approximately perpendicular to the flow direction around these scour holes the bed was always smooth at the bottom of these holes during the scour process a weak horseshoe vortex occurred around the model that induced a slight scour on both sides of the model and strong vortex shedding occurred at the back of the model which led to the obvious scour holes 3 2 2 runs with wave current interaction the scour topography for experimental run 4 is shown in fig 11 the soil around the foundation was scoured which causing the bucket skirt to be exposed a long and narrow scour hole was observed behind the model and was mainly caused by the horseshoe vortex the maximum equilibrium scour depth of 58 mm was near the model and the scour depths in the scour pit decreased with increasing distance from the model compared with run 1 run 4 had a shallower scour depth but greater scour range there was a sedimentation area near the centre axis downstream of the foundation and the surrounding topography was covered with sand ripples that were larger and more obvious compared to the current only topography 3 2 3 wave only run the equilibrium scour topography for experimental run 5 is shown in fig 12 denser sand ripples with a larger range were observed around the model compared to those of the current only and combined wave current runs fig 12 a shows that the maximum equilibrium scour depth was in front of the model near monitoring point no 6 the depth was 27 6 mm which was less than the values of the current only and wave current runs a strip shaped deposition area perpendicular to the wave direction was located 50 150 mm ahead of the model one large scour hole appeared near the centre axis downstream of the model far from the foundation and the scour hole was funnel shaped with the mouth pointing to the model 3 3 effect of k c on the maximum equilibrium scour depth table 2 presents the maximum equilibrium scour depth and ratio of the ultimate equilibrium scour depth to the base diameter of arc transition s d in all of experimental runs fig 13 shows the relationship between the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth and k c for different u c w the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth s d increased with increasing k c runs 2 and 8 had the same k c but s d differed greatly this is because the lower velocity in run 8 resulted in a smaller u c w compared with run 2 which decreased the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth fig 13 shows the data of run 6 off the curve which can be explained by the range of the shields parameter θ the shields parameter θ in experimental run 6 was lower than the critical shields parameter θ c r the run indicated clear water scour which led to a shallower scour depth compared with the live bed scour in other experimental runs fig 14 compares the above results with those of sumer and fredsøe 2001 sumer et al 2013 and qi and gao 2014b the present results were consistent with these previous data for a fixed u c w s d increased with increasing k c for different u c w s d increased with increasing k c at different curve rules and these curves approached an asymptotic value with increasing k c at smaller k c e g k c 1 s d could still be high when u c w was sufficiently large e g u c w 0 5 3 4 effect of u c w on the maximum equilibrium scour depth fig 15 shows the variation in the scour depth with u c w for different k c when u c w 0 this indicated a wave only run when u c w 1 this indicated a current only run for a fixed k c s d increased with increasing u c w adding even a current with small velocity to the waves significantly increased s d in addition the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth when u c w 0 7 was close to the maximum current only value which implies that the local scour around the cbf with the combined wave current action was dominated by the current this is because a larger u c w indicated a stronger wake vortex downstream of the cbf which would have an obvious effect on the scour the horseshoe vortex became weaker and had a smaller impact on the scour in the upstream regions especially for current only scour 3 5 effect of f r a on the maximum equilibrium scour depth previous studies have shown that the froude number f r u c g d which is defined by the pile diameter plays an important role in controlling pile foundation scour in current only runs hosseini and amini 2015 ettema et al 2006 moradi et al 2018 this implies that f r can also be effectively correlated with flow field structures such as horseshoe vortex and wake vortex around a cbf under combined wave current action then a correlation with the scour depth can be established fig 16 shows the relationship between the scour depth and f r a which also includes the data of sumer and fredsøe 2001 sumer et al 2013 and qi and gao 2014b the present results and data in the literature were basically consistent with the same relationship although the ranges of k c water depth and particle size of sandy soil varied in these studies all of the test data were located near the same curve s d increased with the increase of f r a and eventually approached an asymptotic value this means that the cbf has the same relationship between f r a and the scour depth as a pile foundation hence fig 16 can be used for the prediction of the ultimate scour depth for the prototype value range of 8 m h 10 2 m 1 2 m h 2 4 m 6 6 s t 8 0 s however the value of x s was not measured during this scour experiment so expressing the relationship between x s and the maximum equilibrium scour depth in the equilibrium state normalised with the cbf diameter as a function of a 0 is difficult in the present study a 0 was 0 14 0 2 which implies that x s 0 for a 0 0 14 which means a horseshoe vortex was present 4 conclusion in this study a flume experiment was performed to examine the local scour around a cbf and the variations over time in the scour depth and topography of the scour hole were investigated and compared the influence of dimensionless parameters such as k c u c w and f r a on the maximum equilibrium scour depth was analysed the main conclusions are as follows 1 two spoon shaped scour holes were created at the back of the foundation under the current induced scour condition this differed from the scour topography under the combined wave current and wave only conditions which had obvious scour pits in the front of and close to the foundation thus measures are needed to protect the soil matrix all around the foundation under combined wave current and wave only conditions 2 compared with the wave only and current only conditions the combined wave current condition induced a greater scour range the combined wave current condition also had a greater scour depth than the wave only condition but not the current only condition for different wave values 3 k c is a significant parameter that controls the vortex structure around the cbf under the combined wave current condition when k c was small the scour hole was mainly caused by shedding of the wake vortex as k c increased the influence of the horseshoe vortex became stronger and it ultimately became the main factor for the formation of the scour hole 4 under the combined wave current condition s d increased with increasing k c for a fixed u c w even when k c was small s d varied significantly with increasing k c when u c w was high for a fixed k c s d increased with the increasing u c w when u c w 0 7 the local scour around the cbf was dominated by the current 5 f r a had the same influence on scour depth as a 0 defined by u a which can better reflect the strength of the horseshoe vortex around the cbf s d increased with increasing f r a and eventually approached an asymptotic value which is consistent with scour development observed at pile foundations acknowledgements this work was

should also be included thus there are 10 parameters for the scour around a cbf induced by waves and current the equilibrium scour depth s is described by the following functional relationship 1 s f d d 50 ρ s ρ w ν h t u w m u c g according to the buckingham π theorem d g and ρ w were chosen as the basic quantities then eq 1 can be expressed with dimensionless parameters 2 s d f f r a k c u c w r

spectrum of the instantaneous free surface elevation η t u f m is the maximum friction velocity and was computed by referencing soulsby 1997 when d 50 d 0 02 d 50 d is considered to have a negligible effect on the scour development h d is the ratio of the water depth to the diameter of the foundation which has some influence on the downflow and horseshoe vortex around the foundation melville and coleman 2000 s is the specific gravity of sand defined as s ρ s ρ w and the value is 2 063 for the test sand the shields parameter θ reflects the magnitude of the bed shear stress which represents the ratio between the drag force acting on sand particles and the weight of the sand particles the scour is divided into clear water scour where θ θ c r and live bed scour θ c r is the critical shields parameter for sand particles to start to move and is defined as proposed by soulsby 1997 as follows 8 θ c r 0 3 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 exp 0 02 d where the non dimensional grain size d is defined as d d 50 s 1 g ν 2 1 3 the pile reynolds number is not usually considered a significant parameter if the flow is fully turbulent ettema et al 1998 in the present tests the cbf generally has a high reynolds number r e d 10 4 so the flow around the test model is turbulent and the effect of r e d on the maximum equilibrium scour depth can be ignored k c is the controlling parameter for vortex generation and development around a cylindrical structure in waves and is used to correlate the scour depth around a pile with wave only and wave current actions at small k c even a slight current superimposed on a wave will significantly increase the scour depth this is because of the presence of a strong horseshoe vortex in both time and space in front of the pile even in the case of a weak current the effect of k c on the maximum equilibrium scour depth is discussed in section 3 3 u c w represents the proportion of the current velocity to the flow velocity thus a larger value of u c w indicates a stronger influence of the constant flow in sumer et al 1997 experiments an increase in u c w reduced the critical number of horseshoe vortex which was mainly because the back pressure gradient on the upstream side of the foundation increased and favoured the formation of the horseshoe vortex the effect of u c w on the maximum equilibrium scour depth is discussed in section 3 4 f r a is based on a one quarter wave period of the mean flow velocity and is a dimensionless parameter that affects the scour depth it is discussed in section 3 5 2 2 experimental setup physical model experiments were carried out in the wave current flume in shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering ocean university of china the flume was 60 m in length 3 m in width and 1 5 m in height the experimental sand basin was 4 m in length 2 2 m in width and 0 2 m in depth and was located in the middle of the flume as shown in fig 2 the sand had a median diameter of d 50 0 2 mm as shown in fig 3 the angle of repose of the sand was ϕ s 31 7 and the standard deviation of the sand was σ g 1 74 which reflected the particle size gradation of sand the experimental facility consisted of a current generating system wave generating system wave absorbing system and measurement system the measurement system was divided into a scour topography measurement system which comprised a laser rangefinder numerical control slide platform and supporting frame and characteristic points measurement system based on acoustic doppler velocimetry adv 2 3 test conditions table 1 summarises the experimental conditions the experiment was conducted with current only wave only and combined wave current actions two cbf models with bucket skirt diameters of 75 and 50 cm were selected for the experiments these corresponded to length scales of 1 40 and 1 60 respectively with the prototype having a bucket skirt diameter of 30 m based on the principles of froude similarity and the detailed drawing of the cbf with a scale of 1 40 is shown in fig 4 experimental run 1 was conducted with the current only conditions and was compared with runs 2 4 and 6 experimental run 5 was conducted with the wave only conditions and was compared with run 4 experimental runs 3 4 7 8 and 10 were conducted with the combined wave current conditions and were compared with run 2 with regard to the wave height wave period water depth flow velocity and model scale respectively experimental run 6 had irregular waves and was compared with run 4 with regard to the wave pattern for explanatory purposes the model with a bucket skirt diameter of 75 cm is taken here as an example the variation in the scour depth over time was monitored at eight monitoring points at regular time intervals of 1 or 0 5 h in order to accurately monitor the change in topography around the cbf model during the scour process and judge whether an equilibrium scour condition was achieved eight monitoring points were selected that were arranged evenly and symmetrically along the model circumference the distance from each monitoring point to the outer wall of the cbf model was 5 cm fig 5 shows the locations of each monitoring point for convenient illustration the monitoring points were named as follows no 1 was at 0 in the flow direction and no 2 was at 45 monitoring point in the flow direction the rest of the monitoring points were named in order and no 8 was at 315 the scour process was regarded as reaching a state of equilibrium over time if the variation in the scour depths of the eight monitoring points at regular time intervals was the same or the change was very small when each experimental run reached the scour equilibrium the scour topography was determined based on the scour depth of the measurement points within a specific area and confirmed according to the range of actual scour as shown in fig 6 in order to obtain the scour topography in detail while reducing the time required for reading data the scour depth was recorded at the edge of the scour area at distance intervals of 4 cm points with serious scour near the model were measured at distance intervals of 2 cm 2 4 test procedure because the scour depth around the model did not generally exceed 20 cm in this small scale laboratory test the initial bed condition was likely to affect the final results in order to reduce the error caused by the initial bed profile the sand basin was repeatedly levelled until the measured bed profile was within a tolerance range of 5 mm based on the ideal conditions meanwhile 5 cm thick wood blocks were placed in different directions under the model to prevent it from sinking before the sand bed was levelled after the initial sand bed was set water was allowed to rise along the flume until the required still water level was reached and water was added sufficiently slowly to prevent the initial bed conditions from being disturbed the flow depth was monitored throughout the experimental run against graduated scales attached to the flume wall after the recording was completed the water in the scour hole was drained by siphoning then the detailed geometry of the scour hole was photographed and the maximum equilibrium scour depth was measured with a steel ruler 3 results and discussion to investigate the scour process and the topography of the equilibrium scour hole for a cbf subjected to waves and current the experimental runs listed in table 1 were conducted and the results were discussed and compared 3 1 time variation of the scour depth 3 1 1 current only runs fig 7 shows the time variation of the scour depth at the eight monitoring points for experimental run 1 a higher absolute value for the scour depth on the curve indicates a more serious scour the scouring process commenced from the back of the model especially at monitoring point no 1 which had a scour depth that fluctuated from 0 mm to 11 mm and then back to 0 mm finally the scour depth had a stable elevation at no 8 during the initial 10 h of scour and then increased dramatically to 40 mm in the subsequent scour process the scour depth at monitoring point nos 2 7 varied little over time and a small sediment deposit of about 5 mm ultimately occurred at these points finally the fluctuation range of the scour depth varied from large 15 mm to small 2 mm as the scour developed no obvious fluctuation was observed from 22 h to 24 h so the equilibrium scour time was 22 h 3 1 2 runs with wave current interaction fig 8 shows the time variation of the scour depth at the eight monitoring points for experimental run 4 the scouring process commenced from the back of the model just like the current induced scour and it had a greater initial scour rate at monitoring point nos 2 and 8 compared to the other points the scour depth at no 8 fluctuated acutely but consistently increased to 37 mm during the scour process similarly monitoring point nos 4 7 were always in a state of scouring to equilibrium conditions except for a short term sediment deposit at monitoring point no 4 in the initial stage of scouring the scour depths at these four points had almost the same values when the equilibrium condition was achieved this differs from the current only scour results in which a small sediment deposit occurred at the front of the model as shown in fig 7 monitoring point nos 1 and 3 were always in the deposit state and the deposition thickness at these two points was back to zero in the end finally the fluctuation range of the scour depth varied from large 16 mm to small 1 mm as the scour developed no further fluctuation in the elevation was observed at these points from 31 h to 32 h so the equilibrium scour time was 31 h 3 1 3 wave only run fig 9 shows the variation in the scour depth over time at the eight monitoring points for experimental run 5 the scour at monitoring point nos 4 and 6 clearly had almost the same development process and the scour depths were greater than the depths at the other monitoring points and increased with time after 10 h of fluctuation a stable scour depth of 18 mm was reached the process was similar to those of the wave current and current only induced scour nos 2 and 8 also showed scour with a depth fluctuation range within 10 mm and the equilibrium scour depth at no 8 was less than that under the current only and combined wave current conditions the scour process commenced around the model except that the topography near monitoring point no 1 showed a sediment deposit this was different from the wave current and current only scour the variations in the scour over time at monitoring point nos 3 and 7 were almost the same and the sand was slightly silted at these points at the end the scour depth at monitoring point no 5 was even less and varied within 5 mm finally the fluctuation range of the scour depth varied from large 9 mm to small 1 mm as the scour developed no further elevation fluctuation was observed at these points from 20 h to 21 h so the equilibrium scour time was 20 h 3 2 topography of the scour hole 3 2 1 current only runs the scour topography for experimental run 1 is shown in fig 10 a all measurement points of the scour depth obtained by the scour topography measurement system were imported into the tecplot software and the topography of the equilibrium scour was drawn by interpolation where appropriate as shown in fig 10 b there was a small sediment deposit in front of the model and a slight scour on both sides of the foundation two obvious scour holes and some small scour pits formed behind the cbf with a basically symmetrical distribution in terms of morphology the scour hole had a maximum equilibrium scour depth of 67 mm near the foundation and the two wide and fat scour holes were spoon shaped deep in the front and shallow in the back although there were obvious sand ripples approximately perpendicular to the flow direction around these scour holes the bed was always smooth at the bottom of these holes during the scour process a weak horseshoe vortex occurred around the model that induced a slight scour on both sides of the model and strong vortex shedding occurred at the back of the model which led to the obvious scour holes 3 2 2 runs with wave current interaction the scour topography for experimental run 4 is shown in fig 11 the soil around the foundation was scoured which causing the bucket skirt to be exposed a long and narrow scour hole was observed behind the model and was mainly caused by the horseshoe vortex the maximum equilibrium scour depth of 58 mm was near the model and the scour depths in the scour pit decreased with increasing distance from the model compared with run 1 run 4 had a shallower scour depth but greater scour range there was a sedimentation area near the centre axis downstream of the foundation and the surrounding topography was covered with sand ripples that were larger and more obvious compared to the current only topography 3 2 3 wave only run the equilibrium scour topography for experimental run 5 is shown in fig 12 denser sand ripples with a larger range were observed around the model compared to those of the current only and combined wave current runs fig 12 a shows that the maximum equilibrium scour depth was in front of the model near monitoring point no 6 the depth was 27 6 mm which was less than the values of the current only and wave current runs a strip shaped deposition area perpendicular to the wave direction was located 50 150 mm ahead of the model one large scour hole appeared near the centre axis downstream of the model far from the foundation and the scour hole was funnel shaped with the mouth pointing to the model 3 3 effect of k c on the maximum equilibrium scour depth table 2 presents the maximum equilibrium scour depth and ratio of the ultimate equilibrium scour depth to the base diameter of arc transition s d in all of experimental runs fig 13 shows the relationship between the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth and k c for different u c w the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth s d increased with increasing k c runs 2 and 8 had the same k c but s d differed greatly this is because the lower velocity in run 8 resulted in a smaller u c w compared with run 2 which decreased the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth fig 13 shows the data of run 6 off the curve which can be explained by the range of the shields parameter θ the shields parameter θ in experimental run 6 was lower than the critical shields parameter θ c r the run indicated clear water scour which led to a shallower scour depth compared with the live bed scour in other experimental runs fig 14 compares the above results with those of sumer and fredsøe 2001 sumer et al 2013 and qi and gao 2014b the present results were consistent with these previous data for a fixed u c w s d increased with increasing k c for different u c w s d increased with increasing k c at different curve rules and these curves approached an asymptotic value with increasing k c at smaller k c e g k c 1 s d could still be high when u c w was sufficiently large e g u c w 0 5 3 4 effect of u c w on the maximum equilibrium scour depth fig 15 shows the variation in the scour depth with u c w for different k c when u c w 0 this indicated a wave only run when u c w 1 this indicated a current only run for a fixed k c s d increased with increasing u c w adding even a current with small velocity to the waves significantly increased s d in addition the relative maximum equilibrium scour depth when u c w 0 7 was close to the maximum current only value which implies that the local scour around the cbf with the combined wave current action was dominated by the current this is because a larger u c w indicated a stronger wake vortex downstream of the cbf which would have an obvious effect on the scour the horseshoe vortex became weaker and had a smaller impact on the scour in the upstream regions especially for current only scour 3 5 effect of f r a on the maximum equilibrium scour depth previous studies have shown that the froude number f r u c g d which is defined by the pile diameter plays an important role in controlling pile foundation scour in current only runs hosseini and amini 2015 ettema et al 2006 moradi et al 2018 this implies that f r can also be effectively correlated with flow field structures such as horseshoe vortex and wake vortex around a cbf under combined wave current action then a correlation with the scour depth can be established fig 16 shows the relationship between the scour depth and f r a which also includes the data of sumer and fredsøe 2001 sumer et al 2013 and qi and gao 2014b the present results and data in the literature were basically consistent with the same relationship although the ranges of k c water depth and particle size of sandy soil varied in these studies all of the test data were located near the same curve s d increased with the increase of f r a and eventually approached an asymptotic value this means that the cbf has the same relationship between f r a and the scour depth as a pile foundation hence fig 16 can be used for the prediction of the ultimate scour depth for the prototype value range of 8 m h 10 2 m 1 2 m h 2 4 m 6 6 s t 8 0 s however the value of x s was not measured during this scour experiment so expressing the relationship between x s and the maximum equilibrium scour depth in the equilibrium state normalised with the cbf diameter as a function of a 0 is difficult in the present study a 0 was 0 14 0 2 which implies that x s 0 for a 0 0 14 which means a horseshoe vortex was present 4 conclusion in this study a flume experiment was performed to examine the local scour around a cbf and the variations over time in the scour depth and topography of the scour hole were investigated and compared the influence of dimensionless parameters such as k c u c w and f r a on the maximum equilibrium scour depth was analysed the main conclusions are as follows 1 two spoon shaped scour holes were created at the back of the foundation under the current induced scour condition this differed from the scour topography under the combined wave current and wave only conditions which had obvious scour pits in the front of and close to the foundation thus measures are needed to protect the soil matrix all around the foundation under combined wave current and wave only conditions 2 compared with the wave only and current only conditions the combined wave current condition induced a greater scour range the combined wave current condition also had a greater scour depth than the wave only condition but not the current only condition for different wave values 3 k c is a significant parameter that controls the vortex structure around the cbf under the combined wave current condition when k c was small the scour hole was mainly caused by shedding of the wake vortex as k c increased the influence of the horseshoe vortex became stronger and it ultimately became the main factor for the formation of the scour hole 4 under the combined wave current condition s d increased with increasing k c for a fixed u c w even when k c was small s d varied significantly with increasing k c when u c w was high for a fixed k c s d increased with the increasing u c w when u c w 0 7 the local scour around the cbf was dominated by the current 5 f r a had the same influence on scour depth as a 0 defined by u a which can better reflect the strength of the horseshoe vortex around the cbf s d increased with increasing f r a and eventually approached an asymptotic value which is consistent with scour development observed at pile foundations acknowledgements this work was

22474,this paper presents a novel three dimension 3 d underwater trajectory tracking method for an autonomous underwater vehicle auv using model predictive control mpc first the 6 degrees of freedom dof model of a fully actuated auv is represented by both kinematics and dynamics after that the trajectory tracking control is proposed as an optimization problem and then transformed into a standard convex quadratic programming qp problem which can be readily computed online the practical constraints of the system inputs and states are considered effectively in the design phase of the proposed control strategy to make the auv move steadily the control increments are considered as the system input and optimized the receding horizon implementation makes the optimal control inputs be recalculated at each sampling instant which can improve the robustness of the tracking control under the model uncertainties and time varying disturbances simulations are carried out under two different 3 d trajectories to verify the performance of trajectory tracking under random disturbances ocean current disturbances and ocean wave disturbances the simulation results are given to show the feasibility and robustness of the mpc based underwater trajectory tracking algorithm keywords trajectory tracking autonomous underwater vehicle auv receding horizon control model predictive control mpc fully actuated 1 introduction as tools for human beings to explore and develop the ocean autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have drawn a lot of attention from researchers around the world xiang et al 2015 over the past few decades auvs have been increasingly used in scientific industrial commercial and military areas the main applications include oceanographic mapping deep sea exploration zhang et al 2015 offshore oil and gas development pipeline maintenance xiang et al 2010 maritime rescue underwater target tracking ferri et al 2018 and patrolling zhang et al 2007 in order to execute above tasks well it is necessary to implement precise control for auvs refsnes et al 2008 kim et al 2016 however it is a hard task to accurately control the auvs because of the model nonlinearity complex hydrodynamic coefficients and uncertain external disturbances cui et al 2016 that is why the motion control of the auvs attracts a lot of attention from researchers worldwide trajectory tracking is the main technical basis for auvs to perform various underwater tasks which involves the design of a controller so that the auvs can follow a desired time parameterized trajectory starting from a given initial state either on or off the trajectory aguiar and hespanha 2007 wang et al 2017 over the past several decades many kinds of control methods have been proposed to tackle the trajectory tracking problem such as proportional integral derivative pid control backstepping control bsc adaptive control fuzzy logic control flc sliding mode control smc neural network control nnc and model predictive control mpc khodayari and balochian 2015 xiang et al 2017 qiao et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 gan et al 2018 peng et al 2019b pid is a simple control method with low complexity in jalving 1994 a pid based control system was proposed and three autopilots were designed for steering heaving and velocity control in perrier and canudas de wit 1996 a pid controller for subsea robots was introduced which could address the linear constraint caused by the low sampling rate however pid can provide accurate control only if the system model is linear and the interferences are constant smallwood and whitcomb 2004 bsc has been a useful method to control nonlinear systems in xu et al 2014 a bsc controller was proposed which defined a virtual speed error dynamics and could effectively avoid the problem of singularity and simplify the calculations a bsc based 3d trajectory tracking method was designed for underactuated auvs in which the velocity error function was constructed to obtain the proper control force and moments ye et al 2015 however the computing complexity increases rapidly as the system order increases because of the repeated differentiations of virtual controllers park et al 2010 the adaptive control method is presented for plants with uncertain dynamics in antonelli et al 2001 an adaptive approach was proposed for auvs in the complex underwater environment where the parameters are dynamic and difficult to obtain sahu and subudhi 2014 proposed an adaptive controller for underwater vehicles in which the hydrodynamic effects was considered however the adaptive control method is effective only for the system with constant or slow changing parameters and the complexity grows drastically as the system order increases xu et al 2015 smc is a promising control method for accurate trajectory tracking due to its strong robustness against uncertain model and time varying parameters in londhe et al 2017 a smc method based on an uncertainty disturbance estimator was presented which could effectively compensate the hydrodynamic uncertainty and unknown disturbances of an auv in qiao and zhang 2019a a second order fast nonsingular terminal smc method was proposed for the trajectory tracking of fully actuated auvs in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time varying external disturbances a double loop integral terminal smc scheme was designed which could improve the tracking accuracy and enhance the robustness against parameter uncertainties qiao and zhang 2019b however the smc method may incur an undesirable high frequency oscillations called chattering around the sliding surface which can lead to low control accuracy and high energy consumption hammad et al 2017 flc is an intelligent control method which can make machines reason like humans a robust fuzzy inference system was introduced for auv docking which used the fuzzified command and velocity vector fields to control the vehicle teo et al 2012 in sun et al 2018 a fuzzy control method was introduced for auv mission in the complex underwater environment which can obtain an optimal path by incorporating with an optimization algorithm however flc needs existing experience to establish fuzzy rules which is very subjective gan et al 2018 nnc utilizes a neural network as controller which can approximate any nonlinear function peng et al 2019a a robust nonlinear controller for auvs was introduced to approximate the uncertain dynamics based on a linearly parameterized neural network ji et al 2007 park 2015 proposed a tracking control method based on the neural network to cope with the model uncertainties of auv the main disadvantage of nnc is that it has large computation cost and weak real time performance gan et al 2018 there are still some weaknesses of the aforementioned trajectory tracking methods for instance the input and state constraints are hardly to be dealt with conveniently ignoring the system constraints during the design stage may lead to poor performances of the trajectory tracking mpc is a closed loop optimal control strategy which can provide a systematic way to deal with the input and state constraints the system constraints caused by physical or security restrictions widely exist in all control systems in beal and gerdes 2013 a mpc controller was utilized to bound the vehicle motion within a stable region of the state space in gao et al 2016 a nonlinear mpc based adaptive positioning control approach for an underwater vehicle was presented in which the mpc controller are combined with a neural network adaptive controller to achieve the tracking optimization and improve the robustness to model uncertainty and unknown dynamics a standard mpc framework for auv trajectory tracking was proposed to overcome the problem of strong model non linearity and a contraction constraint was considered to theoretically guarantee the stability of closed loop system shen et al 2017 2018 however the authors only designed some simple simulations without any interferences in this paper the analysis of trajectory tracking problem for an auv is conducted and a mpc based 3 d trajectory tracking method is presented the input and state constraints are explicitly considered in the algorithm the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into an optimization problem with input and state constraints the state constraints are transformed into a form of input constraints and then the optimization problem is transformed into a standard quadratic programming problem which can be computed online when the auv reaches a new position the next optimal inputs are recalculated based on the current states and the desired trajectory therefore the mpc based algorithm can still be carried out well even in the complex ocean environment with several uncertain disturbances at last the trajectories used for the illustration during simulations are a raster scan path and a sinusoidal curve simulation results are presented and discussed which verify the effectiveness and robustness of the designed tracking control method the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the reference frames and mathematical model used for auv trajectory tracking in section 3 the formulation of the optimization problem is introduced and the detailed mpc design procedure is formulated simulation results of the mpc based method are illustrated in section 4 finally conclusive remarks of this paper are given in section 5 2 auv modeling 2 1 frames of reference the auv motion is generally described in 6 degrees of freedom dof which includes translational component and rotational component the translational component includes surge sway and heave which describe the auv s position the rotational component consists of roll pitch and yaw which describe the auv s orientation in order to study the motion model an auv can be regarded as a rigid body in 3 d space for the convenience of clearly analyzing the 6 dof motion of auv as depicted in fig 1 an inertial reference frame i frame and a body fixed frame b frame are defined the i frame which is denoted by o g x g y g z g is coincident with the east north up enu coordinate system in this paper within this frame origin o g is a point on the surface of the ocean the x g axis points towards the east the y g axis points towards the north and the z g axis points upwards perpendicular to the earth s surface the b frame is a moving reference frame denoted by o b x b y b z b the origin o b of which coincides with the center of the auv gravity the x b axis is directed from aft to fore along the longitudinal axis of the auv the y b axis points towards larboard and the z b axis is directed from bottom to top 2 2 kinematic model the i frame is used to record the global information of the auv motion therefore the motion of auv need to be described as the motion of the b frame with respect to the i frame in this paper the euler angle parameterization is used to describe the transformations between the two frames as depicted in fig 1 the orientation of the b frame with respect to the i frame is expressed in terms of three successive rotations about the axes z b y b and x b which are yaw ϕ z pitch ϕ y and roll ϕ x respectively let s 1 x y z t and s 2 ϕ x ϕ y ϕ z t be the position vector and orientation vector of the auv in the i frame where x y and z represent the three cartesian coordinates ϕ x ϕ y and ϕ z represent the three attitude components roll pitch and yaw angles respectively in order to avoid the singularity problem of the euler angle the pitch angle ϕ y is bounded satisfying π 2 ϕ y m i n ϕ y ϕ y m a x π 2 where ϕ y m i n and ϕ y m a x represent the predefined lower bound and upper bound of ϕ y respectively in practice the pitch angle is not likely to get close to π 2 because of the metacentric restoring forces do and pan 2009 as a result the constraint of ϕ y is reasonable furthermore let v 1 v x v y v z t and v 2 ω x ω y ω z t be the linear velocity vector and angular velocity vector of the auv in the b frame where v x v y v z are the three translational velocity components and ω x ω y ω z are the three rotational velocity components respectively with these notations the linear velocity vector s 1 along the three coordinate axes in i frame can be represented as 1 s 1 g 1 s 2 v 1 where g 1 s 2 is the translational velocity rotation matrix from the b frame to the i frame which is given as 2 g 1 s 2 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33 where a 11 cos ϕ y cos ϕ z a 12 sin ϕ x sin ϕ y cos ϕ z cos ϕ x sin ϕ z a 13 cos ϕ x sin ϕ y cos ϕ z sin ϕ x sin ϕ z a 21 cos ϕ y sin ϕ z a 22 sin ϕ x sin ϕ y sin ϕ z cos ϕ x cos ϕ z a 23 cos ϕ x sin ϕ y sin ϕ z sin ϕ x cos ϕ z a 31 sin ϕ y a 32 sin ϕ x cos ϕ y a 33 cos ϕ x cos ϕ y in addition the angular velocity vector s 2 around the three coordinate axes in i frame can be described as 3 s 2 g 2 s 2 v 2 where g 2 s 2 is the rotational velocity rotation matrix from b frame to the i frame which is defined as follows 4 g 2 s 2 1 sin ϕ x tan ϕ y cos ϕ x tan ϕ y 0 cos ϕ x sin ϕ x 0 sin ϕ x sec ϕ y cos ϕ x sec ϕ y finally according to eqs 1 4 the kinematic equations of the auv in 3 d space can be formulated as the following compact form 5 s g v with 6 g g 1 s 2 o 3 3 o 3 3 g 2 s 2 7 s s 1 s 2 t 8 v v 1 v 2 t where o 3 3 is a 3 3 zero matrix 2 3 dynamic model dynamics mainly studies the relationship between the force acting on an auv and the auv motion the dynamic equations of a 6 dof auv can be presented based on the newton euler method as follows fossen 2011 9 m v c v v d v v g s τ where τ f v x f v y f v z f ω x f ω y f ω z t represents the generalized external thrust

system model is designed to predict the future control inputs and the future plant responses it has a sound theoretical basis by computing a sequence of future system input adjustment the mpc controller attempts to optimize future plant responses at each regular interval qin and badgwell 2003 a system cost function is constructed which refers to the errors between the predicted system responses and the desired system outputs by minimizing the cost function the optimal control input sequence of the future n sampling instants can be obtained during solving the optimization problem the input and state constraints can be explicitly tackled which can improve the robustness of the system rolling optimization and feedback correction are the main characteristics of mpc which can effectively reduce or even eliminate the time delay in a closed loop system wang et al 2018 therefore the mpc based system can achieve excellent stability optimality and robustness mayne et al 2000 rawlings 2002 in this paper the desired 3 d trajectory is assumed to be known in advance a time parameterized triplet is introduced to determine the absolute position of the trajectory in the i frame the desired trajectory can be described in the following form 14 y d t x d t y d t z d t t we also assume that the desired trajectory is smooth and bounded and appropriate by taking into account the physical limits of the auv 3 1 prediction in order to control the auv motion the kinematic model 5 is redefined in terms of the linear time invariant lti state space representation with a sampling period t as follows 15 s k 1 s k g k v k t where s k g k and v k are the system state vector the rotation matrix and the control input vector at the k th sampling instant respectively with 16 s k x k y k z k ϕ x k ϕ y k ϕ z k t 17 v k v x k v y k v z k ω x k ω y k ω z k t however the velocity of the auv cannot be changed sharply in the actual underwater environment due to physical limits therefore the optimal control inputs obtained by the model predictive control method may not be accepted and executed by the auv to solve this problem an incremental version of 15 is introduced with the control input vector 18 u k v k v k 1 the improved model with state space representation can be expressed as 19 x k 1 a k x k b k u k 20 y k c x k with 21 x k s k v k 1 t 22 a k i 6 g k t o 6 6 i 6 23 b k g k t i 6 24 y k s k 25 c i 3 o 3 9 where i 6 o 6 6 and o 3 6 denote a 6 6 identity matrix a 6 6 zero matrix and a 3 6 zero matrix respectively remark 1 the state x k 1 is derived as follows x k 1 s k 1 v k s k g k v k t v k s k g k v k t g k v k 1 t g k v k 1 t v k v k 1 v k 1 s k g k v k 1 t v k 1 g k v k t g k v k 1 t v k v k 1 i 6 g k t o 6 6 i 6 s k v k 1 g k t i 6 v k v k 1 a k x k b k u k according to the state prediction model 19 given an input sequence the corresponding prediction state sequence of the system can be calculated by simulating the model forward over n sampling intervals where n is termed as prediction horizon for notational convenience the input sequence and predicted state sequence are often stacked into vectors u k and x k respectively u k and x k are described as 26 u k u k k u k 1 k u k n 1 k x k x k 1 k x k 2 k x k n k where u k i k and x k i k are the input vector and state vector at time k i predicted at time k respectively to make the auv move more steadily the rotation along three axes should be decreased during the practical trajectory tracking task for this reason in order to reduce the computational effort we assume that the velocity rotation matrix g k coefficient matrix a k and b k are invariant during the prediction stage then x k i k can be calculated according to 19 by 27 x k i k a k x k i 1 k b k u k i 1 k 28 a k i x k k j 0 i 1 a k i 1 j b k u k j with the initial condition x k k x k based on eqs 27 and 28 the x k can be re expressed as 29 x k a k x k b k u k where 30 a k a k a k 2 a k n t and 31 b k b k 0 0 a k b k b k 0 a k n 1 b k a k n 2 b k b k 3 2 constraints handling in an actual trajectory tracking task the auv faces several constraints these constraints can be either soft constraints or hard constraints if necessary soft constraints may be violated to avoid infeasibility but hard constraints must always be satisfied in the trajectory tracking task the system state vector x k has a lower bound and an upper bound and the range of input vector u k also has constraints thus the following constraints should be imposed on the system 32 u m i n u k u m a x 33 x m i n x k x m a x where u m i n x m i n are the predefined lower bounds and u m a x x m a x are the predefined upper bounds by translating the constraints for state x k into constraints for input u k and stacking everything into a compact matrix form the input and state constraints can be rewritten as 34 u k u m a x 35 u k u m i n 36 a k x k b k u k x m a x 37 a k x k b k u k x m i n constraints 34 37 can be expressed in the following compact linear constraint form 38 l u k l where 39 l i 6 n i 6 n b k b k l u m a x u m i n x m a x a k x k x m i n a k x k 3 3 optimization in this section a controller is designed so that the auv can be steered to a desired trajectory stably and precisely the optimization problem is solved regularly to minimize a predicted performance cost denoted by j by adjusting the current and future inputs of the system the predicted performance cost is defined as follows 40 j 0 t y t y d t q y 2 u t q u 2 d t where x q 2 x t q x y t and y d t are the predicted trajectory and the desired trajectory respectively u t denotes the predicted inputs q y and q u are the symmetric positive definite weight matrices we can see that the performance cost j includes an integral operation to address the optimization problem the integral operation need to be performed numerically in practice here we divide t into n steps and the discretized version of j k at the sampling instant k can be represented as 41 j k i 1 n y k i k y d k i q y 2 u k i 1 k q u 2 where y k i k and u k i 1 k denote the predicted position and system input at time k i predicted at time k y d k i is the desired position at time k i for a given y k x k can be calculated by 42 x k c y k where c denotes the pseudoinverse of matrix c by substituting 42 into 41 we can obtain another discretized version of j k represented by 43 j k i 1 n x k i k x d k i q x 2 u k i 1 k q u 2 where 44 x d k i c y d k i 45 q x c q y c according to 29 a simplified version of j k can be represented by 46 j k x k x d k q x 2 u k q u 2 a k x k b k u k x d k q x 2 u k q u 2 where 47 x d k x d k 1 x d k 2 x d k n 48 q x q x 0 0 0 q x 0 0 0 q s 49 q u q u 0 0 0 q u 0 0 0 q u from 46 it can be noticed that j k is a function of u k then the optimization problem can be expressed as follows 50 u k arg min u k j k s t l u k l where u k denotes the optimal input sequence the constrained optimization problem 50 is rather complicated to calculate fortunately it can be transformed into a convex quadratic programming qp problem which a qp solver can be utilized to solve online over a finite receding horizon it has been proved that the standard convex qp optimization problem has a unique optimal solution boyd and vandenberghe 2004 which shows the stability of our method after a series of deductions the final standard convex qp form of 50 can be represented as follows 51 u k arg min u k 1 2 u t k h k u k f t k u k s t l u k l with h k 2 b t k q x b k q u f k 2 b t k q x a k x k x d k 3 4 receding horizon implementation the qp problem 51 involving linear input and state constraints 38 can be computed online then an predicted optimal input vector u k is obtained however only the first element of u k is used by the auv 52 u k u k k according to 18 the derivative of v k by time can be obtained as 53 v k u k t once v k has been determined the approximate forces and moments vector τ k which are needed to achieve the desired accelerations can be estimated by the dynamic inversion 54 τ k m v k c v k 1 v k 1 d v k 1 v k 1 g s k 1 based on the dynamic eqs 9 13 the independent system control at the k th sampling instant can be expressed as follows 55 f v x k m x v x v x n 1 s k 1 v k 1 56 f v y k m y v y v y n 2 s k 1 v k 1 57 f v z k m z v z v z n 3 s k 1 v k 1 58 f ω x k i x k ω x ω x n 4 s k 1 v k 1 59 f ω y k i y m ω y ω x n 5 s k 1 v k 1 60 f ω z k i z n ω z ω x n 6 s k 1 v k 1 where 61 n s k 1 v k 1 c v k 1 v k 1 d v k 1 v k 1 g s k 1 n i s k 1 v k 1 i 1 2 3 4 5 6 at each sampling instant k the u k is recalculated then the optimal control forces f v x f v y f v z and control moments f ω x f ω y f ω z are computed and executed by the auv repeatedly to achieve the rolling optimization the predicted state vector x k and the optimal input vector u k are only determined by the current state x k therefore the mpc method can provide a degree of robustness to modeling errors and time varying disturbances in complex ocean the optimization process iterates until the auv finish the trajectory tracking task 3 5 algorithm the complete mpc based trajectory tracking control algorithm is summarized in algorithm 1 4 simulation results in this section simulations are performed to verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed mpc based method all simulations are done on a laptop with an intel core i5 4220u 2 30 ghz dual core processor using a simulator developed on matlab r2017a platform two types of desired trajectories are chosen the first is a raster scan trajectory and the second is a sinusoidal trajectory each simulation is performed with or without ocean disturbances let d x d y and d z be the disturbances with respect to x g axis y g axis and z g axis in the i frame respectively there are three kinds of disturbances considered in the following simulations the first is a random disturbance defined as 62 d x 0 4 r a n d n 1 m s d y 0 3 r a n d n 1 m s d z 0 2 r a n d n 1 m s the second is an ocean current disturbance defined as 63 d x 0 2 m s d y 0 2 m s d z 0 2 m s and the third is an ocean wave disturbance defined as 64 d x 0 35 cos t π 8 m s d y 0 35 cos t π 8 m s d z 0 3 cos t π 8 m s where randn 1 is a normal distribution noise signal with 0 mean and 1 variance in all simulations the values of the parameters with respect to the auv dynamics are obtained from the identified dynamic model of falcon proctor 2014 and are shown in table 1 the values of the parameters with respect to the mpc algorithm are as follows the sampling period t 0 5 s the prediction horizon n 10 the weighting matrices q y d i a g 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 q u d i a g 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 the initial state vector s 0 0 6 52 0 0 0 t the initial velocity vector v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t

18 t 4 1 tracking of raster scan trajectory a common trajectory tracking task for an auv equipped with survey instruments to execute is raster scan a raster scan makes the auv to cover an area of interest the raster scan reference trajectory is defined as follows 65 y d t t 0 3 t 22 50 t m 0 s t 60 s 60 t 60 3 t 22 50 t m 60 s t 80 s 140 t 20 3 t 22 50 t m 80 s t 140 s 0 t 120 3 t 22 50 t m 140 s t 160 s t 160 40 3 t 22 50 t m 160 s t 220 s in the raster scan task the auv encounters several straight lines and sharp turns to verify the performance of our algorithm the initial location of the auv is chosen as 0 6 52 t m in the i frame which is not the same with the starting location of the desired trajectory fig 2 shows the trajectory tracking results of the raster scan task in 3 d space the red curve is the simulated tracking result without disturbance the blue curve represents the simulated tracking result with random disturbance the green curve represents the simulated tracking result under ocean current and the pink curve represents the simulated tracking results under ocean wave while the black curve represents the desired raster scan trajectory as can be seen that the auv can successfully achieve the realtime tracking of the desired raster scan trajectory with or without disturbances the curves of position tracking performances in three directions versus time are plotted in fig 3 it can be readily observed that i in all simulations the auv is successfully steered to closely track the desired trajectory despite the presence of initial errors ii the mpc based method can achieve excellent performance in the absence of disturbances iii when the auv deviates from the trajectory due to disturbances the mpc based method can make the auv approach the desired trajectory quickly the main performance metric used in this paper is position tracking error which refers to the distance between the actual position and the desired position in 3 d space the position tracking error at the k th sampling instant is defined as follows 66 e k x k x d k 2 y k y d k 2 z k z d k 2 where x k y k z k are the actual position and x d k y d k z d k are the desired position the position tracking error is a true measurement of the difference between the actual trajectory and the desired trajectory the curves of position tracking error versus time are shown in fig 4 since the initial position of auv is different from the starting point of the desired trajectory the position tracking errors are large in the beginning after about 10 s the errors go to around 0 from fig 4 it can be shown that the position tracking errors suddenly increase at 60 s 80 s 140 s and 160 s this is because the auv encounters sharp turns of 90 degrees another observation can be made is that the position tracking errors with disturbances are larger than those without disturbance this is because these disturbances cause the auv to deviate from the desired trajectory for the sake of clarity the position tracking error measurements after 5 s are listed in table 2 it can be seen that the average of position tracking errors without disturbance is very small about 0 0137 m for an auv with a speed of more than 1 m s moreover the average of position tracking errors with disturbances is about 0 3 m which demonstrates the good performance of our method fig 5 shows the curves of actual control forces and moments versus time under different disturbances the actual control forces and moments without disturbance are stable and change very slowly red curves however the actual control forces and moments with disturbances change significantly this is because the position of the auv deviates from the desired trajectory due to disturbances and the auv needs to change the control forces and moments dramatically to approach the desired trajectory as early as possible 4 2 tracking of sinusoidal trajectory another task for an auv to execute is tracking a curve trajectory which is rather different from the raster scan trajectory the sinusoidal reference trajectory is a curve trajectory defined as follows 67 y d t t m 25 sin 0 1 t m 3 t 10 50 m 0 s t 100 s in the sinusoidal trajectory tracking task the auv encounters several curves with different degrees of curvature the sinusoidal trajectory tracking results in 3 d space are shown in fig 6 the position tracking performances in three directions are plotted in fig 7 the position tracking errors are recorded in fig 8 and the position tracking error measurements after 5 s are listed in table 3 similar observations can be made that the auv can be successfully steered to the desired sinusoidal trajectory in real time with or without disturbances as can be seen from both figs 7 and 8 the actual trajectory of the auv without disturbance basically coincides with the desired trajectory red curves at the beginning of the simulations the position tracking errors are large since the initial position is not the same as the starting point of the desired trajectory but as time goes by the position tracking errors gradually decrease and tend to zero because there are no sharp changes of direction in the sinusoidal trajectory tracking the position tracking errors are very small during the whole task an average of 0 0066 m without disturbance the actual control forces and moments for sinusoidal tracking task under different disturbances are depicted in fig 9 the same as the raster scan trajectory tracking the actual control forces and moments without disturbance are stable and change very slowly red curves the simulation results under various disturbances further illustrate the robustness of our mpc based method 5 conclusion in this paper a novel mpc based 3 d trajectory tracking strategy for auvs has been presented firstly the kinematic analysis of an fully actuated auv is conducted and the 6 dof kinematics and dynamics equation are established secondly the practical input and state constraints are considered explicitly meanwhile for convenience the state constraints are translated into the input constraints thirdly the control increments are introduced as the system input to improve the stability of the auv finally the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into a constrained standard qp problem which can be computed online during an actual trajectory tracking in the complex ocean environment the auv encounters various disturbances such as random disturbances ocean current disturbances and ocean wave disturbances because the optimal control inputs are recalculated at each sampling instant the trajectory tracking task can be well accomplished even though the auv are under these disturbances simulation studies of tracking two different types of reference trajectories have been conducted and have demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of the mpc based algorithm under uncertain disturbances in the complex ocean environment acknowledgments

22474,this paper presents a novel three dimension 3 d underwater trajectory tracking method for an autonomous underwater vehicle auv using model predictive control mpc first the 6 degrees of freedom dof model of a fully actuated auv is represented by both kinematics and dynamics after that the trajectory tracking control is proposed as an optimization problem and then transformed into a standard convex quadratic programming qp problem which can be readily computed online the practical constraints of the system inputs and states are considered effectively in the design phase of the proposed

recalculated at each sampling instant which can improve the robustness of the tracking control under the model uncertainties and time varying disturbances simulations are carried out under two different 3 d trajectories to verify the performance of trajectory tracking under random disturbances ocean current disturbances and ocean wave disturbances the simulation results are given to show the feasibility and robustness of the mpc based underwater trajectory tracking algorithm keywords trajectory tracking autonomous underwater vehicle auv receding horizon control model predictive control mpc fully actuated 1 introduction as tools for human beings to explore and develop the ocean autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have drawn a lot of attention from researchers around the world xiang et al 2015 over the past few decades auvs have been increasingly used in scientific industrial commercial and military areas the main applications include oceanographic mapping deep sea exploration zhang et al 2015 offshore oil and gas development pipeline maintenance xiang et al 2010 maritime rescue underwater target tracking ferri et al 2018 and patrolling zhang et al 2007 in order to execute above tasks well it is necessary to implement precise control for auvs refsnes et al 2008 kim et al 2016 however it is a hard task to accurately control the auvs because of the model nonlinearity complex hydrodynamic coefficients and uncertain external disturbances cui et al 2016 that is why the motion control of the auvs attracts a lot of attention from researchers worldwide trajectory tracking is the main technical basis for auvs to perform various underwater tasks which involves the design of a controller so that the auvs can follow a desired time parameterized trajectory starting from a given initial state either on or off the trajectory aguiar and hespanha 2007 wang et al 2017 over the past several decades many kinds of control methods have been proposed to tackle the trajectory tracking problem such as proportional integral derivative pid control backstepping control bsc adaptive control fuzzy logic control flc sliding mode control smc neural network control nnc and model predictive control mpc khodayari and balochian 2015 xiang et al 2017 qiao et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 gan et al 2018 peng et al 2019b pid is a simple control method with low complexity in jalving 1994 a pid based control system was proposed and three autopilots were designed for steering heaving and velocity control in perrier and canudas de wit 1996 a pid controller for subsea robots was introduced which could address the linear constraint caused by the low sampling rate however pid can provide accurate control only if the system model is linear and the interferences are constant smallwood and whitcomb 2004 bsc has been a useful method to control nonlinear systems in xu et al 2014 a bsc controller was proposed which defined a virtual speed error dynamics and could effectively avoid the problem of singularity and simplify the calculations a bsc based 3d trajectory tracking method was designed for underactuated auvs in which the velocity error function was constructed to obtain the proper control force and moments ye et al 2015 however the computing complexity increases rapidly as the system order increases because of the repeated differentiations of virtual controllers park et al 2010 the adaptive control method is presented for plants with uncertain dynamics in antonelli et al 2001 an adaptive approach was proposed for auvs in the complex underwater environment where the parameters are dynamic and difficult to obtain sahu and subudhi 2014 proposed an adaptive controller for underwater vehicles in which the hydrodynamic effects was considered however the adaptive control method is effective only for the system with constant or slow changing parameters and the complexity grows drastically as the system order increases xu et al 2015 smc is a promising control method for accurate trajectory tracking due to its strong robustness against uncertain model and time varying parameters in londhe et al 2017 a smc method based on an uncertainty disturbance estimator was presented which could effectively compensate the hydrodynamic uncertainty and unknown disturbances of an auv in qiao and zhang 2019a a second order fast nonsingular terminal smc method was proposed for the trajectory tracking of fully actuated auvs in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time varying external disturbances a double loop integral terminal smc scheme was designed which could improve the tracking accuracy and enhance the robustness against parameter uncertainties qiao and zhang 2019b however the smc method may incur an undesirable high frequency oscillations called chattering around the sliding surface which can lead to low control accuracy and high energy consumption hammad et al 2017 flc is an intelligent control method which can make machines reason like humans a robust fuzzy inference system was introduced for auv docking which used the fuzzified command and velocity vector fields to control the vehicle teo et al 2012 in sun et al 2018 a fuzzy control method was introduced for auv mission in the complex underwater environment which can obtain an optimal path by incorporating with an optimization algorithm however flc needs existing experience to establish fuzzy rules which is very subjective gan et al 2018 nnc utilizes a neural network as controller which can approximate any nonlinear function peng et al 2019a a robust nonlinear controller for auvs was introduced to approximate the uncertain dynamics based on a linearly parameterized neural network ji et al 2007 park 2015 proposed a tracking control method based on the neural network to cope with the model uncertainties of auv the main disadvantage of nnc is that it has large computation cost and weak real time performance gan et al 2018 there are still some weaknesses of the aforementioned trajectory tracking methods for instance the input and state constraints are hardly to be dealt with conveniently ignoring the system constraints during the design stage may lead to poor performances of the trajectory tracking mpc is a closed loop optimal control strategy which can provide a systematic way to deal with the input and state constraints the system constraints caused by physical or security restrictions widely exist in all control systems in beal and gerdes 2013 a mpc controller was utilized to bound the vehicle motion within a stable region of the state space in gao et al 2016 a nonlinear mpc based adaptive positioning control approach for an underwater vehicle was presented in which the mpc controller are combined with a neural network adaptive controller to achieve the tracking optimization and improve the robustness to model uncertainty and unknown dynamics a standard mpc framework for auv trajectory tracking was proposed to overcome the problem of strong model non linearity and a contraction constraint was considered to theoretically guarantee the stability of closed loop system shen et al 2017 2018 however the authors only designed some simple simulations without any interferences in this paper the analysis of trajectory tracking problem for an auv is conducted and a mpc based 3 d trajectory tracking method is presented the input and state constraints are explicitly considered in the algorithm the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into an optimization problem with input and state constraints the state constraints are transformed into a form of input constraints and then the optimization problem is transformed into a standard quadratic programming problem which can be computed online when the auv reaches a new position the next optimal inputs are recalculated based on the current states and the desired trajectory therefore the mpc based algorithm can still be carried out well even in the complex ocean environment with several uncertain disturbances at last the trajectories used for the illustration during simulations are a raster scan path and a sinusoidal curve simulation results are presented and discussed which verify the effectiveness and robustness of the designed tracking control method the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the reference frames and mathematical model used for auv trajectory tracking in section 3 the formulation of the optimization problem is introduced and the detailed mpc design procedure is formulated simulation results of the mpc based method are illustrated in section 4 finally conclusive remarks of this paper are given in section 5 2 auv modeling 2 1 frames of reference the auv motion is generally described in 6 degrees of freedom dof which includes translational component and rotational component the translational component includes surge sway and heave which describe the auv s position the rotational component consists of roll pitch and yaw which describe the auv s orientation in order to study the motion model an auv can be regarded as a rigid body in 3 d space for the convenience of clearly analyzing the 6 dof motion of auv as depicted in fig 1 an inertial reference frame i frame and a body fixed frame b frame are defined the i frame which is denoted by o g x g y g z g is coincident with the east north up enu coordinate system in this paper within this frame origin o g is a point on the surface of the ocean the x g axis points towards the east the y g axis points towards the north and the z g axis points upwards perpendicular to the earth s surface the b frame is a moving reference frame denoted by o b x b y b z b the origin o b of which coincides with the center of the auv gravity the x b axis is directed from aft to fore along the longitudinal axis of the auv the y b axis points towards larboard and the z b axis is directed from bottom to top 2 2 kinematic model the i frame is used to record the global information of the auv motion therefore the motion of auv need to be described as the motion of the b frame with respect to the i frame in this paper the euler angle parameterization is used to describe the transformations between the two frames as depicted in fig 1 the orientation of the b frame with respect to the i frame is expressed in terms of three successive rotations about the axes z b y b and x b which are yaw ϕ z pitch ϕ y and roll ϕ x respectively let s 1 x y z t and s 2 ϕ x ϕ y ϕ z t be the position vector and orientation vector of the auv in the i frame where x y and z represent the three cartesian coordinates ϕ x ϕ y and ϕ z represent the three attitude components roll pitch and yaw angles respectively in order to avoid the singularity problem of the euler angle the pitch angle ϕ y is bounded satisfying π 2 ϕ y m i n ϕ y ϕ y m a x π 2 where ϕ y m i n and ϕ y m a x represent the predefined lower bound and upper bound of ϕ y respectively in practice the pitch angle is not likely to get close to π 2 because of the metacentric restoring forces do and pan 2009 as a result the

three translational velocity components and ω x ω y ω z are the three rotational velocity components respectively with these notations the linear velocity vector s 1 along the three coordinate axes in

as 3 s 2 g 2 s 2 v 2 where g 2 s 2 is the rotational velocity rotation matrix from b frame to the i frame which is defined as follows 4 g 2 s 2 1 sin ϕ x tan ϕ y cos ϕ x tan ϕ y 0 cos ϕ x sin ϕ x 0

system model is designed to predict the future control inputs and the future plant responses it has a sound theoretical basis by computing a sequence of future system input adjustment the mpc controller attempts to optimize future plant responses at each regular interval qin and badgwell 2003 a system cost function is constructed which refers to the errors between the predicted system responses and the desired system outputs by minimizing the cost function the optimal control input sequence of the future n sampling instants can be obtained during solving the optimization problem the input and state constraints can be explicitly tackled which can improve the robustness of the system rolling optimization and feedback correction are the main characteristics of mpc which can effectively reduce or even eliminate the time delay in a closed loop system wang et al 2018 therefore the mpc based system can achieve excellent stability optimality and robustness mayne et al 2000 rawlings 2002 in this paper the desired 3 d trajectory is assumed to be known in advance a time parameterized triplet is introduced to determine the absolute position of the trajectory in the i frame the desired trajectory can be described in the following form 14 y d t x d t y d t z d t t we also assume that the desired trajectory is smooth and bounded and appropriate by taking into account the physical limits of the auv 3 1 prediction in order to control the auv motion the kinematic model 5 is redefined in terms of the linear time invariant lti state space representation with a sampling period t as follows 15 s k 1 s k g k v k t where s k g k and v k are the system state vector the rotation matrix and the control input vector at the k th sampling instant respectively with 16 s k x k y k z k ϕ x k ϕ y k ϕ z k t 17 v k v x k v y k v z k ω x k ω y k ω z k t however the velocity of the auv cannot be changed sharply in the actual underwater environment due to physical limits therefore the optimal control inputs obtained by the model predictive control method may not be accepted and executed by the auv to solve this problem an incremental version of 15 is introduced with the control input vector 18 u k v k v k 1 the improved model with state space representation can be expressed as 19 x k 1 a k x k b k u k 20 y k c x k with 21 x k s k v k 1 t 22 a k i 6 g k t o 6 6 i 6 23 b k g k t i 6 24 y k s k 25 c i 3 o 3 9 where i 6 o 6 6 and o 3 6 denote a 6 6 identity matrix a 6 6 zero matrix and a 3 6 zero matrix respectively remark 1 the state x k 1 is derived as follows x k 1 s k 1 v k s k g k v k t v k s k g k v k t g k v k 1 t g k v k 1 t v k v k 1 v k 1 s k g k v k 1 t v k 1 g k v k t g k v k 1 t v k v k 1 i 6 g k t o 6 6 i 6 s k v k 1 g k t i 6 v k v k 1 a k x k b k u k according to the state prediction model 19 given an input sequence the corresponding prediction state sequence of the system can be calculated by simulating the model forward over n sampling intervals where n is termed as prediction horizon for notational convenience the input sequence and predicted state sequence are often stacked into vectors u k and x k respectively u k and x k are described as 26 u k u k k u k 1 k u k n 1 k x k x k 1 k x k 2 k x k n k where u k i k and x k i k are the input vector and state vector at time k i predicted at time k respectively to make the auv move more steadily the rotation along three axes should be decreased during the practical trajectory tracking task for this reason in order to reduce the computational effort we assume that the velocity rotation matrix g k coefficient matrix a k and b k are invariant during the prediction stage then x k i k can be calculated according to 19 by 27 x k i k a k x k i 1 k b k u k i 1 k 28 a k i x k k j 0 i 1 a k i 1 j b k u k j with the initial condition x k k x k based on eqs 27 and 28 the x k can be re expressed as 29 x k a k x k b k u k where 30 a k a k a k 2 a k n t and 31 b k b k 0 0 a k b k b k 0 a k n 1 b k a k n 2 b k b k 3 2 constraints handling in an actual trajectory tracking task the auv faces several constraints these constraints can be either soft constraints or hard constraints if necessary soft constraints may be violated to avoid infeasibility but hard constraints must always be satisfied in the trajectory tracking task the system state vector x k has a lower bound and an upper bound and the range of input vector u k also has constraints thus the following constraints should be imposed on the system 32 u m i n u k u m a x 33 x m i n x k x m a x where u m i n x m i n are the predefined lower bounds and u m a x x m a x are the predefined upper bounds by translating the constraints for state x k into constraints for input u k and stacking everything into a compact matrix form the input and state constraints can be rewritten as 34 u k u m a x 35 u k u m i n 36 a k x k b k u k x m a x 37 a k x k b k u k x m i n constraints 34 37 can be expressed in the following compact linear constraint form 38 l u k l where 39 l i 6 n i 6 n b k b k l u m a x u m i n x m a x a k x k x m i n a k x k 3 3 optimization in this section a controller is designed so that the auv can be steered to a desired trajectory stably and precisely the optimization problem is solved regularly to minimize a predicted performance cost denoted by j by adjusting the current and future inputs of the system the predicted performance cost is defined as follows 40 j 0 t y t y d t q y 2 u t q u 2 d t where x q 2 x t q x y t and y d t are the predicted trajectory and the desired trajectory respectively u t denotes the predicted inputs q y and q u are the symmetric positive definite weight matrices we can see that the performance cost j includes an integral operation to address the optimization problem the integral operation need to be performed numerically in practice here we divide t into n steps and the discretized version of j k at the sampling instant k can be represented as 41 j k i 1 n y k i k y d k i q y 2 u k i 1 k q u 2 where y k i k and u k i 1 k denote the predicted position and system input at time k i predicted at time k y d k i is the desired position at time k i for a given y k x k can be calculated by 42 x k c y k where c denotes the pseudoinverse of matrix c by substituting 42 into 41 we can obtain another discretized version of j k represented by 43 j k i 1 n x k i k x d k i q x 2 u k i 1 k q u 2 where 44 x d k i c y d k i 45 q x c q y c according to 29 a simplified version of j k can be represented by 46 j k x k x d k q x 2 u k q u 2 a k x k b k u k x d k q x 2 u k q u 2 where 47 x d k x d k 1 x d k 2 x d k n 48 q x q x 0 0 0 q x 0 0 0 q s 49 q u q u 0 0 0 q u 0 0 0 q u from 46 it can be noticed that j k is a function of u k then the optimization problem can be expressed as follows 50 u k arg min u k j k s t l u k l where u k denotes the optimal input sequence the constrained optimization problem 50 is rather complicated to calculate fortunately it can be transformed into a convex quadratic programming qp problem which a qp solver can be utilized to solve online over a finite receding horizon it has been proved that the standard convex qp optimization problem has a unique optimal solution boyd and vandenberghe 2004 which shows the stability of our method after a series of deductions the final standard convex qp form of 50 can be represented as follows 51 u k arg min u k 1 2 u t k h k u k f t k u k s t l u k l with h k 2 b t k q x b k q u f k 2 b t k q x a k x k x d k 3 4 receding horizon implementation the qp problem 51 involving linear input and state constraints 38 can be computed online then an predicted optimal input vector u k is obtained however only the first element of u k is used by the auv 52 u k u k k according to 18 the derivative of v k by time can be obtained as 53 v k u k t once v k has been determined the approximate forces and moments vector τ k which are needed to achieve the desired accelerations can be estimated by the dynamic inversion 54 τ k m v k c v k 1 v k 1 d v k 1 v k 1 g s k 1 based on the dynamic eqs 9 13 the independent system control at the k th sampling instant can be expressed as follows 55 f v x k m x v x v x n 1 s k 1 v k 1 56 f v y k m y v y v y n 2 s k 1 v k 1 57 f v z k m z v z v z n 3 s k 1 v k 1 58 f ω x k i x k ω x ω x n 4 s k 1 v k 1 59 f ω y k i y m ω y ω x n 5 s k 1 v k 1 60 f ω z k i z n ω z ω x n 6 s k 1 v k 1 where 61 n s k 1 v k 1 c v k 1 v k 1 d v k 1 v k 1 g s k 1 n i s k 1 v k 1 i 1 2 3 4 5 6 at each sampling instant k the u k is recalculated then the optimal control forces f v x f v y f v z and control moments f ω x f ω y f ω z are computed and executed by the auv repeatedly to achieve the rolling optimization the predicted state vector x k and the optimal input vector u k are only determined by the current state x k therefore the mpc method can provide a degree of robustness to modeling errors and time varying disturbances in complex ocean the optimization process iterates until the auv finish the trajectory tracking task 3 5 algorithm the complete mpc based trajectory tracking control algorithm is summarized in algorithm 1 4 simulation results in this section simulations are performed to verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed mpc based method all simulations are done on a laptop with an intel core i5 4220u 2 30 ghz dual core processor using a simulator developed on matlab r2017a platform two types of desired trajectories are chosen the first is a raster scan trajectory and the second is a sinusoidal trajectory each simulation is performed with or without ocean disturbances let d x d y and d z be the disturbances with respect to x g axis y g axis and z g axis in the i frame respectively there are three kinds of disturbances considered in the following simulations the first is a random disturbance defined as 62 d x 0 4 r a n d n 1 m s d y 0 3 r a n d n 1 m s d z 0 2 r a n d n 1 m s the second is an ocean current disturbance defined as 63 d x 0 2 m s d y 0 2 m s d z 0 2 m s and the third is an ocean wave disturbance defined as 64 d x 0 35 cos t π 8 m s d y 0 35 cos t π 8 m s d z 0 3 cos t π 8 m s where randn 1 is a normal distribution noise signal with 0 mean and 1 variance in all simulations the values of the parameters with respect to the auv dynamics are obtained from the identified dynamic model of falcon proctor 2014 and are shown in table 1 the values of the parameters with respect to the mpc algorithm are as follows the sampling period t 0 5 s the prediction horizon n 10 the weighting matrices q y d i a g 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 q u d i a g 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 the initial state vector s 0 0 6 52 0 0 0 t the initial velocity vector v 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 t

18 t 4 1 tracking of raster scan trajectory a common trajectory tracking task for an auv equipped with survey instruments to execute is raster scan a raster scan makes the auv to cover an area of interest the raster scan reference trajectory is defined as follows 65 y d t t 0 3 t 22 50 t m 0 s t 60 s 60 t 60 3 t 22 50 t m 60 s t 80 s 140 t 20 3 t 22 50 t m 80 s t 140 s 0 t 120 3 t 22 50 t m 140 s t 160 s t 160 40 3 t 22 50 t m 160 s t 220 s in the raster scan task the auv encounters several straight lines and sharp turns to verify the performance of our algorithm the initial location of the auv is chosen as 0 6 52 t m in the i frame which is not the same with the starting location of the desired trajectory fig 2 shows the trajectory tracking results of the raster scan task in 3 d space the red curve is the simulated tracking result without disturbance the blue curve represents the simulated tracking result with random disturbance the green curve represents the simulated tracking result under ocean current and the pink curve represents the simulated tracking results under ocean wave while the black curve represents the desired raster scan trajectory as can be seen that the auv can successfully achieve the realtime tracking of the desired raster scan trajectory with or without disturbances the curves of position tracking performances in three directions versus time are plotted in fig 3 it can be readily observed that i in all simulations the auv is successfully steered to closely track the desired trajectory despite the presence of initial errors ii the mpc based method can achieve excellent performance in the absence of disturbances iii when the auv deviates from the trajectory due to disturbances the mpc based method can make the auv approach the desired trajectory quickly the main performance metric used in this paper is position tracking error which refers to the distance between the actual position and the desired position in 3 d space the position tracking error at the k th sampling instant is defined as follows 66 e k x k x d k 2 y k y d k 2 z k z d k 2 where x k y k z k are the actual position and x d k y d k z d k are the desired position the position tracking error is a true measurement of the difference between the actual trajectory and the desired trajectory the curves of position tracking error versus time are shown in fig 4 since the initial position of auv is different from the starting point of the desired trajectory the position tracking errors are large in the beginning after about 10 s the errors go to around 0 from fig 4 it can be shown that the position tracking errors suddenly increase at 60 s 80 s 140 s and 160 s this is because the auv encounters sharp turns of 90 degrees another observation can be made is that the position tracking errors with disturbances are larger than those without disturbance this is because these disturbances cause the auv to deviate from the desired trajectory for the sake of clarity the position tracking error measurements after 5 s are listed in table 2 it can be seen that the average of position tracking errors without disturbance is very small about 0 0137 m for an auv with a speed of more than 1 m s moreover the average of position tracking errors with disturbances is about 0 3 m which demonstrates the good performance of our method fig 5 shows the curves of actual control forces and moments versus time under different disturbances the actual control forces and moments without disturbance are stable and change very slowly red curves however the actual control forces and moments with disturbances change significantly this is because the position of the auv deviates from the desired trajectory due to disturbances and the auv needs to change the control forces and moments dramatically to approach the desired trajectory as early as possible 4 2 tracking of sinusoidal trajectory another task for an auv to execute is tracking a curve trajectory which is rather different from the raster scan trajectory the sinusoidal reference trajectory is a curve trajectory defined as follows 67 y d t t m 25 sin 0 1 t m 3 t 10 50 m 0 s t 100 s in the sinusoidal trajectory tracking task the auv encounters several curves with different degrees of curvature the sinusoidal trajectory tracking results in 3 d space are shown in fig 6 the position tracking performances in three directions are plotted in fig 7 the position tracking errors are recorded in fig 8 and the position tracking error measurements after 5 s are listed in table 3 similar observations can be made that the auv can be successfully steered to the desired sinusoidal trajectory in real time with or without disturbances as can be seen from both figs 7 and 8 the actual trajectory of the auv without disturbance basically coincides with the desired trajectory red curves at the beginning of the simulations the position tracking errors are large since the initial position is not the same as the starting point of the desired trajectory but as time goes by the position tracking errors gradually decrease and tend to zero because there are no sharp changes of direction in the sinusoidal trajectory tracking the position tracking errors are very small during the whole task an average of 0 0066 m without disturbance the actual control forces and moments for sinusoidal tracking task under different disturbances are depicted in fig 9 the same as the raster scan trajectory tracking the actual control forces and moments without disturbance are stable and change very slowly red curves the simulation results under various disturbances further illustrate the robustness of our mpc based method 5 conclusion in this paper a novel mpc based 3 d trajectory tracking strategy for auvs has been presented firstly the kinematic analysis of an fully actuated auv is conducted and the 6 dof kinematics and dynamics equation are established secondly the practical input and state constraints are considered explicitly meanwhile for convenience the state constraints are translated into the input constraints thirdly the control increments are introduced as the system input to improve the stability of the auv finally the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into a constrained standard qp problem which can be computed online during an actual trajectory tracking in the complex ocean environment the auv encounters various disturbances such as random disturbances ocean current disturbances and ocean wave disturbances because the optimal control inputs are recalculated at each sampling instant the trajectory tracking task can be well accomplished even though the auv are under these disturbances simulation studies of tracking two different types of reference trajectories have been conducted and have demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of the mpc based algorithm under uncertain disturbances in the complex ocean environment acknowledgments
