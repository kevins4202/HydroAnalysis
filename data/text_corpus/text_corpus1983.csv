9915,indicators based on evapotranspiration et provide useful information about surface water status response of vegetation to drought stress and potential growth limitations the capability of et based indicators including actual et and the evaporative stress index esi to predict crop yields of spring barley and winter wheat was analyzed for 33 districts of the czech republic in this study the et based indicators were computed using two different approaches i a prognostic model soilclim which computes the water balance based on ground weather observations and information about soil and land cover ii the diagnostic atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model based primarily on remotely sensed land surface temperature data the capability of both sets of indicators to predict yields of spring barley and winter wheat was tested using artificial neural networks anns applied to the adjusting number and timeframe of inputs during the growing season yield predictions based on anns were computed for both crops for all districts together as well as for individual districts the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 between observed and predicted yields varied with date within the growing season and with the number of ann inputs used for yield prediction the period with the highest predictive capability started from early june to mid june this optimal period for yield prediction was identifiable already at the lower number of ann inputs nevertheless the accuracy of the prediction improved as more inputs were included within anns the rmse values for individual districts varied between 0 4 and 0 7 t ha 1 while r2 reached values of 0 5 0 8 during the optimal period results of the study demonstrated that et based indicators can be used for yield prediction in real time during the growing season and therefore have great potential for decision making at regional and district levels keywords artificial neural network crop yield prediction evapotranspiration evaporative stress index spring barley winter wheat 1 introduction agricultural drought can significantly impact crop yields as demonstrated both recently e g blauhut et al 2016 jakubínský et al 2019 and in the more distant past e g in the pre instrumental period e g brázdil et al 2019 and can have global implications for food production and security trnka et al 2019 the impacts of agricultural drought on crops can be most directly identified by the reduction of yield fiala et al 2014 however not only the quantity but also the quality of production can be affected by drought occurrence jensen et al 1996 understanding of the relationship between water status indicators and crop yields is crucial for assessing the drought impacts on agricultural crops anderson et al 2016a yang et al 2018 while the final impacts of drought on agricultural crop yields can be fully assessed only at harvest yield observation early estimates of yield yield forecasting are very useful for farmers traders and policy makers zhang and kovacs 2012 yield forecasting is typically realized using a set of real time predictor time series with forecast accuracy gradually increasing as the growing season progresses toward the peak performance in the interval prior to harvest bognár et al 2017 in this way the final crop yield can be to some degree predicted several weeks up to months before harvest providing useful support for planning of agricultural operations hlavinka et al 2019 nagy et al 2018 one of the most widely used approaches for monitoring crop conditions is based on remote sensing tucker et al 1980 johnson 2016 wardlow et al 2012 which utilizes the connection between the spectral reflectances of certain plant species and their yield e g tucker et al 1980 this approach has been used since 1972 when landsat 1 was launched rembold et al 2013 representing the first civil satellite orbiting the earth in addition to satellites data from airborne imaging and unmanned aerial vehicle surveys can be used for monitoring of vegetation zhang and kovacs 2012 commonly used remote sensing indicators embody vegetation indices that have the capability to track crop progress and evolution in green biomass becker reshef et al 2010 including the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the enhanced vegetation index evi or its two band version evi2 another effective indicator of crop health is evapotranspiration et which over agricultural lands represents water consumed by crops in the process of transpiration and water evaporated from the soil leaves and other surfaces during the growing cycle anomalously low rates of actual et relative to maximum expected et may indicate depleted soil moisture and stress related reductions in transpiration fluxes anderson et al 2007a therefore et based indicators have been used to monitor agricultural drought anderson et al 2011 2016b potopová et al 2015 and impacts on crop yields anderson et al 2016a yang et al 2018 crocetti et al 2020 including indices based on actual et eta and eta normalized by reference et eto the relationship between et and crop health and productivity has been studied for a long time and provides basis for various approaches to monitor crop water stress these included e g the crop coefficient model allen et al 1998 combined with the approach based on radiation interception and light use efficiency monteith 1977 or a crop simulation model based on the concept of water use efficiency raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 for regional monitoring of et two modeling approaches are generally used e g yilmaz et al 2014 anderson et al 2007a prognostic and diagnostic models each with its advantages and disadvantages et as a water balance component can be estimated by the use of prognostic land surface models yilmaz et al 2014 mendiguren et al 2017 arnold et al 1998 abbott et al 1986 in this study we considered the case of the soilclim water balance model widely used in the czech republic hlavinka et al 2011 trnka et al 2020 other water balance models include the variable infiltration capacity vic model wood et al 1992 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 and the fao model aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 prognostic assessment of et can be also performed using land surface models lsms such as noah lsms e g ek et al 2003 prognostic models use basic weather variables e g precipitation wind radiation air temperature together with information about soil e g field capacity and wilting point and vegetation e g leaf area index lai rooting depth crop coefficient to model the complete water and energy balance in the soil plant and atmosphere interface predicted et rates depend strongly on the accuracy and availability of input weather variables and parameters related to soil and vegetation as well as on the accuracy of the model itself beljaars et al 1996 many of these inputs can be difficult to specify at regional or continental level and biases may result in cumulative errors in soil water content and associated fluxes these biases can even become larger in the long term perspective if there are no mechanisms for periodic correction schaake et al 2004 in contrast diagnostic models of et require less information about soil and vegetation properties and generally do not require precipitation as input to estimate et these models rely on remote sensing retrievals of land surface temperature lst albedo vegetation cover fraction or lai therefore diagnostic models can provide the information about the plant water status whenever remote sensing data are available independently on the previous imaging as estimation of et is based on remote sensing data these models are largely independent from ground measurements and et based indicators can be calculated over the large areas from country to continent e g europe to global scales on the other hand diagnostic models based on thermal and visible near infrared remote sensing data inherently have one significant limitation compared to prognostic ground based models input data can be obtained only during clear sky conditions examples of diagnostic et models include the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the two source energy balance model tseb norman et al 1995 the diagnostic model considered here is the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model anderson et al 1997 2007a which is based on tseb and uses time changes in lst derived from remote sensing to partition the surface energy budget the evaporative stress index esi is an alexi based product representing standardized anomalies in the ratio of actual to reference et eta eto anderson et al 2007b esi has been demonstrated to be consistent with standard precipitation based drought indices while additionaly capable to provide quick response to changes in vegetation health during rapid drought onset events otkin et al 2016 recent efforts toward developing operational yield forecasting systems based on different predictors have been conducted within several regions in central europe in hungary for example several studies have investigated the relationship between remote sensing data and crop yields bognár et al 2017 kern et al 2018 nagy et al 2018 in the czech republic esi was tested for spring barley and winter wheat yields anderson et al 2016a the two most widely cultivated cereal crops in the region based on the study of anderson et al 2016a and several analyses focusing on vegetation indices e g johnson 2016 a prototype remotely sensed forecasting method for key crops for the whole country was put into use in 2018 this system was initially based on vegetation indices ndvi evi evi2 from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis with 250 m spatial resolution calibration of yield forecasts for 2018 were based on yield data and vegetation indices from 2000 to 2017 this operational forecasting method has capability to predict the final yields more than two months prior to harvest in this study we tested the predictive capability of et based indicators eta and esi toward incorporating them into the operational yield forecasting system the et based indicators were tested for the period 2001 2018 over 33 districts in the czech republic and were generated with models representing two different approaches prognostic ground based soilclim versus diagnostic remote sensing based model alexi in the previous study of anderson et al 2016a linear regressions between yields and esi from alexi were tested at regional and district levels in the current study the method of the artificial neural networks anns at the district level was investigated the main objective was to i to determine whether an indicator from a prognostic or diagnostic model is preferable to be included into the operational yield forecasting system the other objective was ii to identify the optimal period during the growing season when the capability to predict yield is the highest this was tested by the adjusting number and timeframe of ann inputs during the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area only districts where yield data were available for all years of the period 2001 2018 were analyzed yield data were available for 33 of total 76 districts of the czech republic table 1 and fig 1 districts of the czech republic are identical with the local administrative units of level 1 used in states of the european union lau 1 https www czso cz csu czso kraje nuts 3 a okresy lau 1 ceske republiky the district area differs within the country with the lowest area around 200 km2 and the largest around 2000 km2 while the usual district

the regions of central south and northeast bohemia stc jhc and hkk respectively south moravia jhm northwest and central moravia olk east moravia zlk and a region located between bohemia and moravia bohemian moravian highlands vys bohemia represents the larger western part of the czech republic while moravia the smaller eastern part the stc jhm and olk regions are located at lower elevations and represent regions where the intensity of cropped area is the highest the vys region is at high elevation with typically higher precipitation amount fig 2 jhc hkk and zlk are regions with lower cropping density and higher proportion of forested terrain bordering with neighboring countries jhc borders with austria and germany hkk with poland and zlk with slovakia most crops in the czech republic are rainfed hlavinka et al 2009 and irrigation is typically applied just to a limited extent as an additional water source irrigation is applied primarily to high value crops such as vegetable orchards vineyards hop fields and potatoes less than 4 of arable land can be irrigated while only about 1 5 is actively irrigated in the czech republic mostly in jhm and stc lowland regions batysta et al 2015 2 2 et modeling approaches in this study we evaluated the relative predictive capability of et based indicators from representative prognostic and diagnostic modeling systems the soilclim and alexi models the tested predictors included eta and esi 2 2 1 soilclim the soilclim model is driven by weather inputs measured in situ together with specific information about land use soil types and topography the soilclim model relies on daily weather data collected in the station network of the czech hydrometeorological institute including potentially up to 400 precipitation stations and almost 200 climate stations trnka et al 2020 the daily data of maximum and minimum air temperature 2 m above ground mean relative air humidity 2 m above ground sum of global radiation or sunshine duration sum of precipitation and mean wind speed 10 m above ground are routinely used for derivation of the daily meteorological model inputs and interpolated into the resolution of 500 m hlavinka et al 2011 daily data are interpolated by a regression via kriging using geographical coordinates elevation and other characteristics related to terrain as predictors trnka et al 2020 soilclim is a bucket type model considering two soil compartments to estimate eta and soil water content the topsoil compartment 0 0 0 4 m and the subsoil compartment 0 4 1 0 m the maximum values of water content are given by the field capacity while the minimum by wilting point these two boundary conditions are representing water holding capacity that is a characteristic of each grid cell hlavinka et al 2011 this parameter is estimated using a combination of digital maps and detailed soil physical data collected by the czech national soil survey e g trnka et al 2015 if the field capacity is reached the additional water surplus is considered as deep percolation in addition a partial percolation approach is adopted in the soilclim model hlavinka et al 2011 allowing a downward water movement from both compartment when their relative available water is greater than 50 this partially percolated water is determined as a function of relative soil water content and the site specific infiltration coefficient that is typically one order of magnitude smaller in the case of the subsoil compartment hlavinka et al 2011 this feature that soil water is allowed to seep into the subsoil compartment and below not only for values above the field capacity but also for lower ones is imitating macropore and preferential water transports within the soil profile hlavinka et al 2011 daily eta was estimated following the crop coefficient approach presented by allen et al 1998 considering the single crop coefficient kc and the water stress coefficient ks computed as eta kc ks eto where ks is a function of the soil water content using the single kc eta was calculated without partitioning into evaporation and transpiration within the model kc is driven by the sum of growing degree days and varies for individual vegetation covers throughout the growing season cf hlavinka et al 2011 to simplify the seasonal variations in crop cover on arable land a fixed proportion of crops spring barley winter wheat and maize on each arable grid is assumed trnka et al 2015 the land cover data at the spatial resolution of 100 m were obtained from the corine land cover 2006 dataset version 16 https www eea europa eu data and maps data clc 2006 vector 4 overall there are seven land use categories considered within soilclim while only six categories were considered for calculation of eta including arable land permanent grasslands other agricultural areas and conifer deciduous and mixed forests and further analysis the inclusion of other landcover categories than arable land was adopted for consistency with alexi data which due to their spatial resolution do not allow to discriminate the individual categories the version of the soilclim model used in this study provides an operational tool for drought monitoring at the national level for the czech republic and slovakia at the spatial resolution of 500 m eta estimated by soilclim was compared previously with eta measured by eddy covariance at two flux sites two seasons and bowen ratio energy balance method at one site six seasons in the czech republic the eta estimates by soilclim demonstrated to explain between 74 and 80 of daily eta variability i e coefficient of determination r2 of 0 74 and 0 80 measured by these two systems with root mean square error rmse between 0 5 and 1 mm day 1 trnka et al 2015 furthermore the soil water content estimated by soilclim was compared with data from the lysimetric station hirschstetten austria for the period 1999 2004 explaining up to 63 topsoil compartment and 74 subsoil compartment of observed soil water variability i e r2 of 0 63 and 0 74 rmse was between 2 8 and 4 2 for both compartments hlavinka et al 2011 trnka et al 2015 2 2 2 alexi alexi is an example of diagnostic model based on time changes in lst and other primarily remote sensing inputs related to meteorological conditions and land cover properties e g solar radiation albedo lai alexi quantifies the evaporative flux and cooling required to keep the soil and vegetation at the observed lst under the known solar radiation input and other meteorological conditions anderson et al 2007a the core of alexi is the tseb model of norman et al 1995 which partitions fluxes and radiometric temperature trad between nominal soil and vegetation components based on the local vegetation cover fraction apparent at the thermal sensor view angle anderson et al 2007a tseb estimates eta by partitioning the energy available at the land surface rn g where rn is net radiation and g is the soil heat flux in w m 2 into turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat h and le respectively in w m 2 1 rn g h le where le λeta with λ being the latent heat of vaporization with information about trad lai albedo and solar radiation tseb can compute system and component fluxes separately for canopy and soil net radiation rn rnc rns sensible and latent heat h hc hs and le lec les and g the eta estimates at the global scale are generated daily from alexi etalexi at the 0 05 spatial resolution roughly 5 km using modis day night lst measurements hain and anderson 2017 twice daily lst measurements 10 30 a m p m local solar time are retrieved using a generalized split window atmospheric compensation technique wan et al 2004 the modis day night lst difference were extracted from the daily l3 global climate modeling grid lst product myd11c1 wan 2014 the lai data were obtained from the 8 day modis lai composite product mod15a myneni et al 2002 and albedo data were retrieved from the 16 day modis albedo composites mod43c moody et al 2005 land cover classification necessary for the tseb model parameterization was derived from the university of maryland global land cover dataset hansen et al 2000 meteorological inputs to alexi including solar radiation wind speed air temperature and vapor pressure were obtained from the climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2010 note that some inputs are common for both models like e g landcover type map or meteorological data since we used these models in the form in which they are available operationally the mentioned input data sources are different e g corine land cover 2006 vs global land cover dataset or in situ meteorological data vs reanalysis using a spatial disaggregation method disalexi norman et al 2003 alexi fluxes have been downscaled for direct comparison with ground based flux measurements at the observations footprint scale typically less than 100 m previous evaluations over flux sites in the united states in a variety of crops corn soybean cotton vineyards alfalfa rice forest pasture and wetland land covers have yielded an average rmse of 1 mm day 1 e g cammalleri et al 2014 semmens et al 2015 yang et al 2017 2018 2 3 yield predictors 2 3 1 et based indicators the esi is expressed as standardized anomalies in the ratio of eta eto normalization by the eto reduces the impact of climate and radiation on the et flux focusing more on soil moisture drivers anderson et al 2016a esi is calculated from 4 week and 12 week composites of eta eto advancing at 7 day intervals 4 week esi and 12 week esi respectively the selections of these composites follow the operationally provided product esi 4wk generally points on short term and rapidly evolving drought while esi 4wk points to more long term agricultural to hydrological droughts the standardized anomalies are computed relative to average conditions over a reference period of record in this study the reference period begins in 2001 the start of continuous lst data from modis and ends in 2017 anomalies with respect to baseline conditions are computed for every compositing interval and normalized by the standard deviation in eta eto for that time of year computed over the period of record see annex 1 for more details about the computation of esi esi values range typically between 3 5 and 3 5 where negative values indicate reduced eta e g stress caused by drought and values close to 0 indicate normal conditions positive values indicate eta above the average meaning high water supply esi can therefore point up the areas with the ratio higher or lower than is normal for the reference period and can provide early warning of declining vegetation health caused e g by drought otkin et al 2016 in this study esi was computed from eta and eto derived from both the soilclim and alexi models esi 4wksoilclim esi 12wksoilclim esi 4wkalexi esi 12wkalexi respectively while eta from direct alexi retrievals is limited to clear sky conditions for soilclim esi eta from all sky conditions was used an anecdotal testing showed that this strategy did not significantly affected the esi results and hence the different number of days within the composites of esisoilclim and esialexi was not considered important for crop yield predictions to preserve the intrinsic spatial characteristics of each model esi was computed at the native model resolution 500 m for soilclim and 0 05 for alexi for both models the same reference period was used for esi computation 2001 2017 eta from soilclim and alexi etsoilclim and etalexi respectively is computed daily by these models and was used as weekly sums in ann etsoilclim and etalexi were tested as unnormalized to preserve the intrinsic characteristics of each model values of all et based indicators etsoilclim etalexi esi 4wksoilclim esi 12wksoilclim esi 4wkalexi esi 12wkalexi were calculated as the weekly averages aggregated over the area of individual districts 2 3 2 elevation the average elevation over each district was tested as one of predictors for yield prediction as it was found to be a factor to understand relationships between et based indicators and crop yields in previous study anderson et al 2016a elevation data at a spatial resolution of 25 m were obtained from a digital surface model from copernicus land monitoring service https www eea europa eu data and maps data copernicus land monitoring service eu dem 2 4 yield data this study focuses on yield of two major cereals grown in the czech republic spring barley hordeum vulgare l and winter wheat triticum aestivum l in 2019 these crops in combination were cultivated on about 41 of arable land 33 for winter wheat and 8 5 for spring barley according to the czech statistical office https vdb czso cz vdbvo2 faces en index jsf spring barley and winter wheat represent crops with the different length of the growing season and sensitivity to drought in conditions of the czech republic winter wheat is usually sown in late september or early october and spring barley in march winter cereals are generally less sensitive to spring and summer droughts because they already have well established root systems at the beginning of spring hlavinka et al 2009 in contrary spring cereals are typically more effected by drought occurring in spring as it is the most sensitive period for their emergence and canopy development žalud et al 2017 due to this fact winter cereals are frequently preferred over spring cereals in adaptation measures for the expected increase in drought occurrence olesen et al 2011 however winter cereal crops are more sensitive to drought occurring in autumn and absence of snow cover during wintertime žalud et al 2017 yield data of both crops at the district level were primarily obtained from the ministry of agriculture of the czech republic http eagri cz for certain districts and years there were not any existing data in such cases yield data from the czech agrarian chamber were used www agrocr cz only districts where yield data were available for all years of the period 2001 2018 were analyzed yield data were available for 33 of total 76 districts of the czech republic these data represented the average yield for each district in t ha 1 table 1 yield data as absolute yield values and as z score were used in this study 2 5 yield prediction approaches the capability of et based indicators was tested by the method of the anns combining all districts and years in this study the neuralnet package v1 44 2 fritsch et al 2019 in r r core team 2019 was used this package utilizes resilient backpropagation with riedmiller 1994 or without weight backtracking riedmiller and braun 1993 or the modified globally convergent version by anastasiadis et al 2005 furthermore the calculation of generalized weights intrator and intrator 1993 is implemented within the package the logistic function was used for transformation of all input data to the neural network into a number from 0 to 1 the hierarchy of anns in the package is composed of three layers an input hidden and output layer three neurons were defined within the hidden layer while the number of input neurons varied for different ann models cf section 2 5 2 2 5 1 training and validation of anns for the training of anns specific inputs were needed for each district i values of et based indicators ii yield data and iii average elevation of the area the et based indicators and average elevation were used as predictors in anns et based indicators were used over 7 day intervals for the period from the end of april to the middle of july 23 april 16 july or doy 113 197 et based indicators were used at weekly timestep as it is the native time step of esi from alexi the period of 23 april 16 july was chosen because it represented a part of the growing season when changes in vegetation development are typically most significant e g hlavinka et al 2009 this period was set based on soilclim that computes standard phenological phases internally based on growing degree days approach as a part of the crop coefficient submodule hlavinka et al 2011 as kc varies during the growing season four main phenological phases are separately defined within soilclim interim ini mid end cf allen et al 1998 hlavinka et al 2011 in case of yield values for each district the average avg and standard deviation sd over the analyzed period were calculated from the annual yield data the z score was then calculated from the avg and sd z score yield avg sd and used for both the training and validation of anns data were then divided into two groups all samples were poled together without any distinction of districts and years and randomly sampled into training and validation data a total of 75 of samples were used for training while the remaining 25 of samples were used for validation of each ann during the training of anns r2 and rmse in t ha 1 were calculated each time then yield in the form of z score was predicted based on the trained anns while only independent data were used for the validation yield prediction the random selection and the entire training process were repeated 20 times to select the best combination for the yield prediction this procedure was applied independently for each et based indicator and each crop 2 5 2 adjusting number and timeframe of inputs for yield prediction the yield prediction was based on adjusting number and timeframe of inputs during the growing season the number of ann inputs was increasing at weekly intervals through the season resulting in overall 13 different sets of anns with increasing number of input neurons yet decreasing number of anns in the set the first type of ann was composed from one et based predictor value for each doy e g 113 120 127 providing 13 individual anns in the set where each ann had only one input neuron the second type of ann used two input values for two succeeding doys e g 113 and 120 120 and 127 190 and 197 and hence resulted in 12 ann in the set where each had two input neurons with et based predictor the third type of ann had three input values from three succeeding doys e g 113 127 120 134 183 197 i e three input neurons with et based predictor and 11 anns in the set then the last and most complex 13th type of ann had 13 values for all available doys from 113 to 197 leading to 13 input neurons with et based predictor and the set reduced to only one ann the final predicted yield in the form of z score was then transformed into yield yield z score sd avg in the form of annual yield value the yield prediction for each combination was repeated 20 times the number of random selections mentioned in the section 2 5 1 20 different anns were calculated together with the r2 and rmse between observed and predicted yield the ann with the lowest rmse were then selected and used for further analysis values of rmse and r2 changed with date during the growing season as doy and the complexity of anns given by the number of inputs the yield prediction based on anns was calculated for each crop for all districts together for the whole country as well as for individual districts the eta 4 week esi and 12 week esi from both soilclim and alexi etsoilclim etalexi esi 4wksoilclim esi 12wksoilclim esi 4wkalexi esi 12wkalexi respectively represented et based indicators used as predictors for both the training and validation of anns predictors and their abbreviations are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 identification of the optimal period for yield prediction for all et based indicators the rmse values decreased and r2 values increased with the higher number of ann inputs and with doy within the growing season as more data were included in the yield prediction for each indicator there could be identified the optimal period for yield prediction this period started when the lowest rmse and highest r2 values were approached and these values did not significantly improve as the growing period proceeded this could be identifiable already at the lower number of ann inputs even though the accuracy of yield estimates improved as more inputs were included within anns for both spring barley and winter wheat the identified optimal period for yield prediction started between doy 155 and 169 representing doy of the last ann input a part of the growing season roughly from early june to mid june this part of growing season typically represents the heading or flowering stage for spring barley and the flowering for winter wheat both crops are usually harvested between early july and the middle of august approximately doy 190 230 these results demonstrate that the et based indicators have capability to predict yield already several weeks prior to harvest annex 2 the rmse values during the growing season generally ranged from 0 45 to 0 85 t ha 1 figs 3 and 4 or about 8 17 of the average observed yield for both crops over 2001 2018 the respective r2 values ranged between 0 5 and 0 8 during this period and all relationships were found to be statistically significant p 0 001 for most of indicators and both crops rmse values were between 0 6 and 0 7 t ha 1 at the beginning of the optimal period for yield prediction in case of esi 4wkalexi etsoilclim and etalexi the rmse reached values below 0 6 t ha 1 at the beginning of this period with the higher number of ann inputs and higher doy included in prediction the rmse reached values between 0 5 and 0 6 t ha 1 the lowest rmse values for spring barley were obtained using etsoilclim and etalexi rmse 0 47 and 0 45 t ha 1 respectively while etalexi performed best for winter wheat rmse 0 44 t ha 1 for both crops the optimal period started between doy 155 and 169 depending on the particular indicator for 4 week and 12 week esi from both models the beginning of the optimal period was identified on doy 169 for both crops for eta from both models and for both crops the beginning of the optimal period was identified one or two weeks earlier than for esi doy 155 and 162 this is likely due to the different length of the temporal aggregation of eta versus esi because eta was used as weekly temporal aggregation while esi was used as 4 week and 12 week aggregation for etsoilclim the optimum started for both crops from doy 162 the optimal period for etalexi started on doy 155 for spring barley and doy 162 for winter wheat the temporal variation in rmse in predicted yield through the growing season was similar for both spring barley and winter wheat however at lower numbers of ann inputs the rmse values were around 0 08 0 1 t ha 1 higher for winter wheat than for spring barley for higher numbers of ann inputs the rmse reached very similar values for both crops for both crops the period with the highest predictive capability was often identifiable at the lower number of ann inputs between two and four but the accuracy of yield estimates tended to increase with more ann inputs included as more data became available to use within the anns however there could be detected the seasonal pattern for the lower number of ann inputs that could not be detected for higher number of ann inputs by definition of the ann structures 3 2 spatial and temporal variability of yield prediction at the district level using the trained ann models selected based on the performance against the validation data yields were predicted for all districts with a continuous record of observed yields in contrast to an analysis presented in figs 3 and 4 where the error statistic was based strictly on the comparison with validation dataset cf section 2 5 1 to allow a temporally and spatially full coverage of the predicted yields which would not be possible by considering only the 25 of validation data we used a bootstrapping approach with subsequent ensemble averaging of the predicted values more specifically 30 of random selections of training and validation data sets were done where for each selection set of 50 anns were constructed evaluated and the best preforming ann identified in the completely same way as described previously i e evaluation based on rmse resulting from comparison with validation data cf section 2 5 1 from these 30 variants of the best performing anns the yield was predicted and averaged for each year and district for this purpose the selected ann model used etalexi as the predictor since this model resulted in the lowest rmse values and highest r2 values during the optimal prediction period cf section 3 1 for both crops the combination of ann model with nine input neurons for doys 134 190 early july was used for yield prediction the example is presented in fig 5 showing the 10 year period of 2009 2018 including both drought years and non drought years agricultural drought events were recorded in central europe in 2011 2012 zahradníček et al 2015 2015 van lanen et al 2016 trnka et al 2020 2017 štěpánek et al 2018 crocetti et al 2020 and 2018 jrc european drought observatory edo 2018 the severe drought event of 2011 2012 lasted from august 2011 to may 2012 in the czech republic žalud et al 2017 the drought event in 2015 occurred in the beginning of july and lasted till mid august for most of the territory of the czech republic zhang and kovacs 2012 the 2015 was particularly severe in the region of central and eastern europe having a significant impact on the agricultural sector van lanen et al 2016 the dry episode of 2017 started in may and was most intensive from mid may through june to the mid july štěpánek et al 2018 the severe drought of 2018 affected mostly central and northern europe in the czech republic this dry episode started in april and lasted till november e g edo 2018 the time series of both observed and predicted yields show characteristic drops in the above listed dry years and hence illustrates the drought impacts and their spatial distribution fig 5 the spring barley yields were typically 3 5 6 5 t ha 1 while winter wheat yields were 4 7 5 t ha 1 for both crops and most of districts predicted yields generally overestimated lower observed yields approximately 2 4 t ha 1 for barley and 2 5 t ha 1 for wheat when predicted yields were typically 0 5 1 t ha 1 higher than observed yields at the same time predicted yields of both crops typically underestimated higher observed yields approximately 4 5 6 5 t ha 1 for barley and 5 5 7 5 t ha 1 for wheat when predicted yields were mostly 0 5 1 t ha 1 higher than observed yields the only exception were non drought years i e 2009 2010 2013 2014 and 2016 for winter wheat yields when predicted yields agreed with or underestimated observed yields at all yield levels all these patterns could be observed for all analyzed districts no matter of their elevation over the whole period of 2009 2018 the lowest observed and predicted yields were typically found in district of jhm region while higher were detected districts in stc vys and olk regions 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies the relationship between esi from alexi in particular esi 12wkalexi and winter wheat and spring barley yields in the czech republic was previously examined by anderson et al 2016a these two crops were analyzed at the district level lau 1 as well as at the regional level nuts 3 anderson et al 2016a calculated yield anomalies at the district level from a linear regression over the period 2002 2014 then computed regression statistics between esi 12wkalexi and observed yields lumped at the regional scale r2 derived from the reported pearson correlation coefficients were peaking around 0 60 and 0 58 for winter wheat and spring barley respectively when individual regions were analyzed when all districts were combined r2 peaked at 0 36 and 0 42 at doy 190 and 200 for wheat and barley respectively in comparison the ann approach used in this study using time series of et based indicators over an 18 year period 2001 2018 yielded the r2 values exceeding 0 7 from doy 155 and 162 for wheat and barley respectively and the r2 values reaching 0 8 from doy 190 and 197 for wheat and barley respectively the higher amount of explained variability r2 in this study can be attributed to more advanced technique of yield predictions capable to capture complex and nonlinear relationships i e ann as compared to linear regression model in the current study the optimal period for yield prediction started between doy 155 and 169 for both crops i e roughly early june to mid june this is generally consistent with previous studies based on vegetation indices johnson 2016 examined relationships between yields of 10 different crops and modis based remote sensing indicators across major farming areas of the united states johnson 2016 ndvi correlations with barley yields both spring and winter peaked in late may with r2 about 0 5 while winter wheat r2 peaked around 0 5 in early june results with evi were similar but with slightly higher r2 for winter wheat around 0 6 higher resolution 250 m modis vegetation indices outperformed coarser products 1000 m similar findings regarding period of optimal grain yield forecasting were obtained in studies conducted in countries of the central europe in the tisza river catchment located in central eastern europe the optimal period for prediction of wheat yield using modis ndvi 250 m was from early to late may between 6 and 8 weeks prior to harvest nagy et al 2018 in hungary modis ndvi 250 m performance for winter wheat yield prediction peaked in the middle of june doy 165 approximately three weeks before harvest bognár et al 2017 errors in yield estimates for 2003 2015 improved from 7 for a prediction date at the end of may doy 150 to less than 5 by doy 165 these findings correspond with results of the current study even though they used different indicators at higher spatial resolution a similar optimum was found in forecasting key crops in the czech republic using modis ndvi evi and evi2 trnka et al 2018 optimal predictability occurred between the end of june and the beginning of july shortly before the onset of harvest in warmer regions of the czech republic this was relevant for both spring barley and winter wheat at the district level 4 2 factors affecting the yield prediction and performance of predictors key to the performance of the yield estimation approach described here was the transformation of yields in the form of z score as an input to the anns and its transformation back into yields during the final yield prediction before the calculation of rmse and r2 without the transformation of yields in the form of z score and its transformation back into yields we reached r2 values lower or around 0 5 while r2 was between 0 5 and 0 8 with this transformation this result reflects the fact that yield dynamics vary from district to district in the czech republic and the z score serves to de emphasize these differences in yield response the spatial analysis of the predicted vs observed yields further suggested that the predicted yields show lower variance and that the model is not capable to capture reliably the extreme values both high and low the predictability of the extreme yield anomalies and especially the yield drops under drought episodes should motivate further studies and initiatives even though the analyzed models have different spatial resolutions 500 m of soilclim vs 0 05 of alexi and represent different modeling approaches et based indicators from both models demonstrated similar performance in the yield prediction this phenomenon would be probably more crucial for analysis at more detailed level field or cadastral level or when specific land use classes are taken into account in this case higher resolution diagnostic et products 30 m could be employed generated by the fusion of landsat and modis derived et time series yang et al 2018 at this scale different crop types can be effectively separated and emergence date determined gao et al 2020 which may prove to be another valuable input for the yield predictions 5 summary and conclusions this study focused on the capability of et based indicators to predict yield of spring barley and winter wheat prior to harvest and identification of the optimal period for the yield prediction the optimal period was defined as the date when the lowest rmse and highest r2 values were reached and these did not significantly improve as the growing season proceeded the optimal period for both key crops of the czech republic started between doys 155 and 169 roughly early june to mid june the et based indicators can therefore predict yield several weeks prior to harvest for both crops the period with the highest predictive capability was often identifiable between two and four ann inputs but accuracy of yield estimates tended to increase with more inputs included within the anns on the other hand the seasonal pattern could be more clearly detected for the lower number of ann inputs than for the higher number of inputs the et based indicators from the prognostic soilclim and diagnostic alexi models demonstrated similar performance despite of their different construction and spatial resolution the difference that was found in identification of the optimal period was the different performance of the soilclim and alexi products for both models and crops the identification of the optimal period was more straightforward for eta than for 4 week and 12 week esi in case of spring barley etalexi and etsoilclim reached the lowest rmse and highest r2 values compared to the rest of indicators in case of winter wheat the period with the highest predictive capability was most clearly identifiable for etalexi reaching the lowest rmse and the highest r2 values from all indicators at the level of individual districts we focused on the 10 year period that included both drought years and non drought years 2009 2018 for both crops and most of districts tested ann approach tended to balance extremes and be close to the average yields predicted yields generally overestimated lower observed yields approximately 2 4 t ha 1 for barley and 2 5 t ha 1 for wheat at the same time predicted yields of both crops typically underestimated higher observed yields approximately 4 5 6 5 t ha 1 for barley and 5 5 7 5 t ha 1 for wheat the only exception were non drought years i e 2009 2010 2013 2014 and 2016 for winter wheat yields when predicted yields often agreed with or underestimated observed yields there is still a need to test the predictive capability for other important agricultural crops of the czech republic such as winter oilseed rape clover grain and silage maize and permanent grasslands however results of the study suggest that et based indicators have capability to predict crop yield several weeks prior to harvest and therefore have great potential for decision making at regional and district levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

9915,indicators based on evapotranspiration et provide useful information about surface water status response of vegetation to drought stress and potential growth limitations the capability of et based indicators including actual et and the evaporative stress index esi to predict crop yields of spring barley and winter wheat was analyzed for 33 districts of the czech republic in this study the et based indicators were computed using two different approaches i a prognostic model soilclim which computes the water balance based on ground weather observations and information about soil and land cover ii the diagnostic atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model based primarily on remotely sensed land surface temperature data the capability of both sets of indicators to predict yields of spring barley and winter wheat was tested using artificial neural networks anns applied to the adjusting number and timeframe of inputs during the growing season yield predictions based on anns were computed for both crops for all districts together as well as for individual districts the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 between observed and predicted yields varied with date within the growing season and with the number of ann inputs used for yield prediction the period with the highest predictive capability started from early june to mid june this optimal period for yield prediction was identifiable already at the lower number of ann inputs nevertheless the accuracy of the prediction improved as more inputs were included within anns the rmse values for individual districts varied between 0 4 and 0 7 t ha 1 while r2 reached values of 0 5 0 8 during the optimal period results of the study demonstrated that et based indicators can be used for yield prediction in real time during the growing season and therefore have great potential for decision making at regional and district levels keywords artificial neural network crop yield prediction evapotranspiration evaporative stress index spring barley winter wheat 1 introduction agricultural drought can significantly impact crop yields as demonstrated both recently e g blauhut et al 2016 jakubínský et al 2019 and in the more distant past e g in the pre instrumental period e g brázdil et al 2019 and can have global implications for food production and security trnka et al 2019 the impacts of agricultural drought on crops can be most directly identified by the reduction of yield fiala et al 2014 however not only the quantity but also the quality of production can be affected by drought occurrence jensen et al 1996 understanding of the relationship between water status indicators and crop yields is crucial for assessing the drought impacts on agricultural crops anderson et al 2016a yang et al 2018 while the final impacts of drought on agricultural crop yields can be fully assessed only at harvest yield observation early estimates of yield yield forecasting are very useful for farmers traders and policy makers zhang and kovacs 2012 yield forecasting is typically realized using a set of real time predictor time series with forecast accuracy gradually increasing as the growing season progresses toward the peak performance in the interval prior to harvest bognár et al 2017 in this way the final crop yield can be to some degree predicted several weeks up to months before harvest providing useful support for planning of agricultural operations hlavinka et al 2019 nagy et al 2018 one of the most widely used approaches for monitoring crop conditions is based on remote sensing tucker et al 1980 johnson 2016 wardlow et al 2012 which utilizes the connection between the spectral reflectances of certain plant species and their yield e g tucker et al 1980 this approach has been used since 1972 when landsat 1 was launched rembold et al 2013 representing the first civil satellite orbiting the earth in addition to satellites data from airborne imaging and unmanned aerial vehicle surveys can be used for monitoring of vegetation zhang and kovacs 2012 commonly used remote sensing indicators embody vegetation indices that have the capability to track crop progress and evolution in green biomass becker reshef et al 2010 including the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the enhanced vegetation index evi or its two band version evi2 another effective indicator of crop health is evapotranspiration et which over agricultural lands represents water consumed by crops in the process of transpiration and water evaporated from the soil leaves and other surfaces during the growing cycle anomalously low rates of actual et relative to maximum expected et may indicate depleted soil moisture and stress related reductions in transpiration fluxes anderson et al 2007a therefore et based indicators have been used to monitor agricultural drought anderson et al 2011 2016b potopová et al 2015 and impacts on crop yields anderson et al 2016a yang et al 2018 crocetti et al 2020 including indices based on actual et eta and eta normalized by reference et eto the relationship between et and crop health and productivity has been studied for a long time and provides basis for various approaches to monitor crop water stress these included e g the crop coefficient model allen et al 1998 combined with the approach based on radiation interception and light use efficiency monteith 1977 or a crop simulation model based on the concept of water use efficiency raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 for regional monitoring of et two modeling approaches are generally used e g yilmaz et al 2014 anderson et al 2007a prognostic and diagnostic models each with its advantages and disadvantages et as a water balance component can be estimated by the use of prognostic land surface models yilmaz et al 2014 mendiguren et al 2017 arnold et al 1998 abbott et al 1986 in this study we considered the case of the soilclim water balance model widely used in the czech republic hlavinka et al 2011 trnka et al 2020 other water balance models include the variable infiltration capacity vic model wood et al 1992 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 and the fao model aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 prognostic assessment of et can be also performed using land surface models lsms such as noah lsms e g ek et al 2003 prognostic models use basic weather variables e g precipitation wind radiation air temperature together with information about soil e g field capacity and wilting point and vegetation e g leaf area index lai rooting depth crop coefficient to model the complete water and energy balance in the soil plant and atmosphere interface predicted et rates depend strongly on the accuracy and availability of input weather variables and parameters related to soil and vegetation as well as on the accuracy of the model itself beljaars et al 1996 many of these inputs can be difficult to specify at regional or continental level and biases may result in cumulative errors in soil water content and associated fluxes these biases can even become larger in the long term perspective if there are no mechanisms for periodic correction schaake et al 2004 in contrast diagnostic models of et require less information about soil and vegetation properties and generally do not require precipitation as input to estimate et these models rely on remote sensing retrievals of land surface temperature lst albedo vegetation cover fraction or lai therefore diagnostic models can provide the information about the plant water status whenever remote sensing data are available independently on the previous imaging as estimation of et is based on remote sensing data these models are largely independent from ground measurements and et based indicators can be calculated over the large areas from country to continent e g europe to global scales on the other hand diagnostic models based on thermal and visible near infrared remote sensing data inherently have one significant limitation compared to prognostic ground based models input data can be obtained only during clear sky conditions examples of diagnostic et models include the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the two source energy balance model tseb norman et al 1995 the diagnostic model considered here is the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model anderson et al 1997 2007a which is based on tseb and uses time changes in lst derived from remote sensing to partition the surface energy budget the evaporative stress index esi is an alexi based product representing standardized anomalies in the ratio of actual to reference et eta eto anderson et al 2007b esi has been demonstrated to be consistent with standard precipitation based drought indices while additionaly capable to provide quick response to changes in vegetation health during rapid drought onset events otkin et al 2016 recent efforts toward developing operational yield forecasting systems based on different predictors have been conducted within several regions in central europe in hungary for example several studies have investigated the relationship between remote sensing data and crop yields bognár et al 2017 kern et al 2018 nagy et al 2018 in the czech republic esi was tested for spring barley and winter wheat yields anderson et al 2016a the two most widely cultivated cereal crops in the region based on the study of anderson et al 2016a and several analyses focusing on vegetation indices e g johnson 2016 a prototype remotely sensed forecasting method for key crops for the whole country was put into use in 2018 this system was initially based on vegetation indices ndvi evi evi2 from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis with 250 m spatial resolution calibration of yield forecasts for 2018 were based on yield data and vegetation indices from 2000 to 2017 this operational forecasting method has capability to predict the final yields more than two months prior to harvest in this study we tested the predictive capability of et based indicators eta and esi toward incorporating them into the operational yield forecasting system the et based indicators were tested for the period 2001 2018 over 33 districts in the czech republic and were generated with models representing two different approaches prognostic ground based soilclim versus diagnostic remote sensing based model alexi in the previous study of anderson et al 2016a linear regressions between yields and esi from alexi were tested at regional and district levels in the current study the method of the artificial neural networks anns at the district level was investigated the main objective was to i to determine whether an indicator from a prognostic or diagnostic model is preferable to be included into the operational yield forecasting system the other objective was ii to identify the optimal period during the growing season when the capability to predict yield is the highest this was tested by the adjusting number and timeframe of ann inputs during the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area only districts where yield data were available for all years of the period 2001 2018 were analyzed yield data were available for 33 of total 76 districts of the czech republic table 1 and fig 1 districts of the czech republic are identical with the local administrative units of level 1 used in states of the european union lau 1 https www

the regions of central south and northeast bohemia stc jhc and hkk respectively south moravia jhm northwest and central moravia olk east moravia zlk and a region located between bohemia and moravia bohemian moravian highlands vys bohemia represents the larger western part of the czech republic while moravia the smaller eastern part the stc jhm and olk regions are located at lower elevations and represent regions where the intensity of cropped area is the highest the vys region is at high elevation with typically higher precipitation amount fig 2 jhc hkk and zlk are regions with lower cropping density and higher proportion of forested terrain bordering with neighboring countries jhc borders with austria and germany hkk with poland and zlk with slovakia most crops in the czech republic are rainfed hlavinka et al 2009 and irrigation is typically applied just to a limited extent as an additional water source irrigation is applied primarily to high value crops such as vegetable orchards vineyards hop fields and potatoes less than 4 of arable land can be irrigated while only about 1 5 is actively irrigated in the czech republic mostly in jhm and stc lowland regions batysta et al 2015 2 2 et modeling approaches in this study we evaluated the relative predictive capability of et based indicators from representative prognostic and diagnostic modeling systems the soilclim and alexi models the tested predictors included eta and esi 2 2 1 soilclim the soilclim model is driven by weather inputs measured in situ together with specific information about land use soil types and topography the soilclim model relies on daily weather data collected in the station network of the czech hydrometeorological institute including potentially up to 400 precipitation stations and almost 200 climate stations trnka et al 2020 the daily data of maximum and minimum air temperature 2 m above ground mean relative air humidity 2 m above ground sum of global radiation or sunshine duration sum of precipitation and mean wind speed 10 m above ground are routinely used for derivation of the daily meteorological model inputs and interpolated into the resolution of 500 m hlavinka et al 2011 daily data are interpolated by a regression via kriging using geographical coordinates elevation and other characteristics related to terrain as predictors trnka et al 2020 soilclim is a bucket type model considering two soil compartments to estimate eta and soil water content the topsoil compartment 0 0 0 4 m and the subsoil compartment 0 4 1 0 m the maximum values of water content are given by the field capacity while the minimum by wilting point these two boundary conditions are representing water holding capacity that is a characteristic of each grid cell hlavinka et al 2011 this parameter is estimated using a combination of digital maps and detailed soil physical data collected by the czech national soil survey e g trnka et al 2015 if the field capacity is reached the additional water surplus is considered as deep percolation in addition a partial percolation approach is adopted in the soilclim model hlavinka et al 2011 allowing a downward water movement from both compartment when their relative available water is greater than 50 this partially percolated water is determined as a function of relative soil water content and the site specific infiltration coefficient that is typically one order of magnitude smaller in the case of the subsoil compartment hlavinka et al 2011 this feature that soil water is allowed to seep into the subsoil compartment and below not only for values above the field capacity but also for lower ones is imitating macropore and preferential water transports within the soil profile hlavinka et al 2011 daily eta was estimated following the crop coefficient approach presented by allen et al 1998 considering the single crop coefficient kc and the water stress coefficient ks computed as eta kc ks eto where ks is a function of the soil water content using the single kc eta was calculated without partitioning into evaporation and transpiration within the model kc is driven by the sum of growing degree days and varies for individual vegetation covers throughout the growing season cf hlavinka et al 2011 to simplify the seasonal variations in crop cover on arable land a fixed proportion of crops spring barley winter wheat and maize on each arable grid is assumed trnka et al 2015 the land cover data at the spatial resolution of 100 m were obtained from the corine land cover 2006 dataset version 16 https www eea europa eu data and maps data clc 2006 vector 4 overall there are seven land use categories considered within soilclim while only six categories were considered for calculation of eta including arable land permanent grasslands other agricultural areas and conifer deciduous and mixed forests and further analysis the inclusion of other landcover categories than arable land was adopted for consistency with alexi data which due to their spatial resolution do not allow to discriminate the individual categories the version of the soilclim model used in this study provides an operational tool for drought monitoring at the national level for the czech republic and slovakia at the spatial resolution of 500 m eta estimated by soilclim was compared previously with eta measured by eddy covariance at two flux sites two seasons and bowen ratio energy balance method at one site six seasons in the czech republic the eta estimates by soilclim demonstrated to explain between 74 and 80 of daily eta variability i e coefficient of determination r2 of 0 74 and 0 80 measured by these two systems with root mean square error rmse between 0 5 and 1 mm day 1 trnka et al 2015 furthermore the soil water content estimated by soilclim was compared with data from the lysimetric station hirschstetten austria for the period 1999 2004 explaining up to 63 topsoil compartment and 74 subsoil compartment of observed soil water variability i e r2 of 0 63 and 0 74 rmse was between 2 8 and 4 2 for both compartments hlavinka et al 2011 trnka et al 2015 2 2 2 alexi alexi is an example of diagnostic model based on time changes in lst and other primarily remote sensing inputs related to meteorological conditions and land cover properties e g solar radiation albedo lai alexi quantifies the evaporative flux and cooling required to keep the soil and vegetation at the observed lst under the known solar radiation input and other meteorological conditions anderson et al 2007a the core of alexi is the tseb model of norman et al 1995 which partitions fluxes and radiometric temperature trad between nominal soil and vegetation components based on the local vegetation cover fraction apparent at the thermal sensor view angle anderson et al 2007a tseb estimates eta by partitioning the energy available at the land surface rn g where rn is net radiation and g is the soil heat flux in w m 2 into turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat h and le respectively in w m 2 1 rn g h le where le λeta with λ being the latent heat of vaporization with information about trad lai albedo and solar radiation tseb can compute system and component fluxes separately for canopy and soil net radiation rn rnc rns sensible and latent heat h hc hs and le lec les and g the eta estimates at the global scale are generated daily from alexi etalexi at the 0 05 spatial resolution roughly 5 km using modis day night lst measurements hain and anderson 2017 twice daily lst measurements 10 30 a m p m local solar time are retrieved using a generalized split window atmospheric compensation technique wan et al 2004 the modis day night lst difference were extracted from the daily l3 global climate modeling grid lst product myd11c1 wan 2014 the lai data were obtained from the 8 day modis lai composite product mod15a myneni et al 2002 and albedo data were retrieved from the 16 day modis albedo composites mod43c moody et al 2005 land cover classification necessary for the tseb model parameterization was derived from the university of maryland global land cover dataset hansen et al 2000 meteorological inputs to alexi including solar radiation wind speed air temperature and vapor pressure were obtained from the climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2010 note that some inputs are common for both models like e g landcover type map or meteorological data since we used these models in the form in which they are available operationally the mentioned input data sources are different e g corine land cover 2006 vs global land cover dataset or in situ meteorological data vs reanalysis using a spatial disaggregation method disalexi norman et al 2003 alexi fluxes have been downscaled for direct comparison with ground based flux measurements at the observations footprint scale typically less than 100 m previous evaluations over flux sites in the united states in a variety of crops corn soybean cotton vineyards alfalfa rice forest pasture and wetland land covers have yielded an average rmse of 1 mm day 1 e g cammalleri et al 2014 semmens et al 2015 yang et al 2017 2018 2 3 yield predictors 2 3 1 et based indicators the esi is expressed as standardized anomalies in the ratio of eta eto normalization by the eto reduces the impact of climate and radiation on the et flux focusing more on soil moisture drivers anderson et al 2016a esi is calculated from 4 week and 12 week composites of eta eto advancing at 7 day intervals 4 week esi and 12 week esi respectively the selections of these composites follow the operationally provided product esi 4wk generally points on short term and rapidly evolving drought while esi 4wk points to more long term agricultural to hydrological droughts the standardized anomalies are computed relative to average conditions over a reference period of record in this study the reference period begins in 2001 the start of continuous lst data from modis and ends in 2017 anomalies with respect to baseline conditions are computed for every compositing interval and normalized by the standard deviation in eta eto for that time of year computed over the period of record see annex 1 for more details about the computation of esi esi values range typically between 3 5 and 3 5 where negative values indicate reduced eta e g stress caused by drought and values close to 0 indicate normal conditions positive values indicate eta above the average meaning high water supply esi can therefore point up the areas with the ratio higher or lower than is normal for the reference period and can provide early warning of declining vegetation health caused e g by drought otkin et al 2016 in this study esi was computed from eta and eto derived from both the soilclim and alexi models esi 4wksoilclim esi 12wksoilclim esi 4wkalexi esi 12wkalexi respectively while eta from direct alexi retrievals is limited to clear sky conditions for soilclim esi eta from all sky conditions was used an anecdotal testing showed that this strategy did not significantly affected the esi results and hence the different number of days within the composites of esisoilclim and esialexi was not considered important for crop yield predictions to preserve the intrinsic spatial characteristics of each model esi was computed at the native model resolution 500 m for soilclim and 0 05 for alexi for both models the same reference period was used for esi computation 2001 2017 eta from soilclim and alexi etsoilclim and etalexi respectively is computed daily by these models and was used as weekly sums in ann etsoilclim and etalexi were tested as unnormalized to preserve the intrinsic characteristics of each model values of all et based indicators etsoilclim etalexi esi 4wksoilclim esi 12wksoilclim esi 4wkalexi esi 12wkalexi were calculated as the weekly averages aggregated over the area of individual districts 2 3 2 elevation the average elevation over each district was tested as one of predictors for yield prediction as it was found to be a factor to understand relationships between et based indicators and crop yields in previous study anderson et al 2016a elevation data at a spatial resolution of 25 m were obtained from a digital surface model from copernicus land monitoring service https www eea europa eu data and maps data copernicus land monitoring service eu dem 2 4 yield data this study focuses on yield of two major cereals grown in the czech republic spring barley hordeum vulgare l and winter wheat triticum aestivum l in 2019 these crops in combination were cultivated on about 41 of arable land 33 for winter wheat and 8 5 for spring barley according to the czech statistical office https vdb czso cz vdbvo2 faces en index jsf spring barley and winter wheat represent crops with the different length of the growing season and sensitivity to drought in conditions of the czech republic winter wheat is usually sown in late september or early october and spring barley in march winter cereals are generally less sensitive to spring and summer droughts because they already have well established root systems at the beginning of spring hlavinka et al 2009 in contrary spring cereals are typically more effected by drought occurring in spring as it is the most sensitive period for their emergence and canopy development žalud et al 2017 due to this fact winter cereals are frequently preferred over spring cereals in adaptation measures for the expected increase in drought occurrence olesen et al 2011 however winter cereal crops are more sensitive to drought occurring in autumn and absence of snow cover during wintertime žalud et al 2017 yield data of both crops at the district level were primarily obtained from the ministry of agriculture of the czech republic http eagri cz for certain districts and years there were not any existing data in such cases yield data from the czech agrarian chamber were used www agrocr cz only districts where yield data were available for all years of the period 2001 2018 were analyzed yield data were available for 33 of total 76 districts of

approaches the capability of et based indicators was tested by the method of the anns combining all districts and years in this study the neuralnet package v1 44 2 fritsch et al 2019 in r r core team 2019 was used this package utilizes resilient backpropagation with riedmiller 1994 or without weight backtracking riedmiller and braun 1993 or the modified globally convergent version by anastasiadis et al 2005 furthermore the calculation of generalized weights intrator and intrator 1993 is implemented within the package the logistic function was used for transformation of all input data to the neural network into a number from 0 to 1 the hierarchy of anns in the package is composed of three layers an input hidden and output layer three neurons were defined within the hidden layer while the number of input neurons varied for different ann models cf section 2 5 2 2 5 1 training and validation of anns for the training of anns specific inputs were needed for each district i values of et based indicators ii yield data and iii average elevation of the area the et based indicators and average elevation were used as predictors in anns et based indicators were used over 7 day intervals for the period from the end of april to the middle of july 23 april 16 july or doy 113 197 et based indicators were used at weekly timestep as it is the native time step of esi from alexi the period of 23 april 16 july was chosen because it represented a part of the growing season when changes in vegetation development are typically most significant e g hlavinka et al 2009 this period was set based on soilclim that computes standard phenological phases internally based on growing degree days approach as a part of the crop coefficient submodule hlavinka et al 2011 as kc varies during the growing season four main phenological phases are separately defined within soilclim interim ini mid end cf allen et al 1998 hlavinka et al 2011 in case of yield values for each district the average avg and standard deviation sd over the analyzed period were calculated from the annual yield data the z score was then calculated from the avg and sd z score yield avg sd and used for both the training and validation of anns data were then divided into two groups all samples were poled together without any distinction of districts and years and randomly sampled into training and validation data a total of 75 of samples were used for training while the remaining 25 of samples were used for validation of each ann during the training of anns r2 and rmse in t ha 1 were calculated each time then yield in the form of z score was predicted based on the trained anns while only independent data were used for the validation yield prediction the random selection and the entire training process were repeated 20 times to select the best combination for the yield prediction this procedure was applied independently for each et based indicator and each crop 2 5 2 adjusting number and timeframe of inputs for yield prediction the yield prediction was based on adjusting number and timeframe of inputs during the growing season the number of ann inputs was increasing at weekly intervals through the season resulting in overall 13 different sets of anns with increasing number of input neurons yet decreasing number of anns in the set the first type of ann was composed from one et based predictor value for each doy e g 113 120 127 providing 13 individual anns in the set where each ann had only one input neuron the second type of ann used two input values for two succeeding doys e g 113 and 120 120 and 127 190 and 197 and hence resulted in 12 ann in the set where each had two input neurons with et based predictor the third type of ann had three input values from three succeeding doys e g 113 127 120 134 183 197 i e three input neurons with et based predictor and 11 anns in the set then the last and most complex 13th type of ann had 13 values for all available doys from 113 to 197 leading to 13 input neurons with et based predictor and the set reduced to only one ann the final predicted yield in the form of z score was then transformed into yield yield z score sd avg in the form of annual yield value the yield prediction for each combination was repeated 20 times the number of random selections mentioned in the section 2 5 1 20 different anns were calculated together with the r2 and rmse between observed and predicted yield the ann with the lowest rmse were then selected and used for further analysis values of rmse and r2 changed with date during the growing season as doy and the complexity of anns given by the number of inputs the yield prediction based on anns was calculated for each crop for all districts together for the whole country as well as for individual districts the eta 4 week esi and 12 week esi from both soilclim and alexi etsoilclim etalexi esi 4wksoilclim esi 12wksoilclim esi 4wkalexi esi 12wkalexi respectively represented et based indicators used as predictors for both the training and validation of anns predictors and their abbreviations are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 identification of the optimal period for yield prediction for all et based indicators the rmse values decreased and r2 values increased with the higher number of ann inputs and with doy within the growing season as more data were included in the yield prediction for each indicator there could be identified the optimal period for yield prediction this period started when the lowest rmse and highest r2 values were approached and these values did not significantly improve as the growing period proceeded this could be identifiable already at the lower number of ann inputs even though the accuracy of yield estimates improved as more inputs were included within anns for both spring barley and winter wheat the identified optimal period for yield prediction started between doy 155 and 169 representing doy of the last ann input a part of the growing season roughly from early june to mid june this part of growing season typically represents the heading or flowering stage for spring barley and the flowering for winter wheat both crops are usually harvested between early july and the middle of august approximately doy 190 230 these results demonstrate that the et based indicators have capability to predict yield already several weeks prior to harvest annex 2 the rmse values during the growing season generally ranged from 0 45 to 0 85 t ha 1 figs 3 and 4 or about 8 17 of the average observed yield for both crops over 2001 2018 the respective r2 values ranged between 0 5 and 0 8 during this period and all relationships were found to be statistically significant p 0 001 for most of indicators and both crops rmse values were between 0 6 and 0 7 t ha 1 at the beginning of the optimal period for yield prediction in case of esi 4wkalexi etsoilclim and etalexi the rmse reached values below 0 6 t ha 1 at the beginning of this period with the higher number of ann inputs and higher doy included in prediction the rmse reached values between 0 5 and 0 6 t ha 1 the lowest rmse values for spring barley were obtained using etsoilclim and etalexi rmse 0 47 and 0 45 t ha 1 respectively while etalexi performed best for winter wheat rmse 0 44 t ha 1 for both crops the optimal period started between doy 155 and 169 depending on the particular indicator for 4 week and 12 week esi from both models the beginning of the optimal period was identified on doy 169 for both crops for eta from both models and for both crops the beginning of the optimal period was identified one or two weeks earlier than for esi doy 155 and 162 this is likely due to the different length of the temporal aggregation of eta versus esi because eta was used as weekly temporal aggregation while esi was used as 4 week and 12 week aggregation for etsoilclim the optimum started for both crops from doy 162 the optimal period for etalexi started on doy 155 for spring barley and doy 162 for winter wheat the temporal variation in rmse in predicted yield through the growing season was similar for both spring barley and winter wheat however at lower numbers of ann inputs the rmse values were around 0 08 0 1 t ha 1 higher for winter wheat than for spring barley for higher numbers of ann inputs the rmse reached very similar values for both crops for both crops the period with the highest predictive capability was often identifiable at the lower number of ann inputs between two and four but the accuracy of yield estimates tended to increase with more ann inputs included as more data became available to use within the anns however there could be detected the seasonal pattern for the lower number of ann inputs that could not be detected for higher number of ann inputs by definition of the ann structures 3 2 spatial and temporal variability of yield prediction at the district level using the trained ann models selected based on the performance against the validation data yields were predicted for all districts with a continuous record of observed yields in contrast to an analysis presented in figs 3 and 4 where the error statistic was based strictly on the comparison with validation dataset cf section 2 5 1 to allow a temporally and spatially full coverage of the predicted yields which would not be possible by considering only the 25 of validation data we used a bootstrapping approach with subsequent ensemble averaging of the predicted values more specifically 30 of random selections of training and validation data sets were done where for each selection set of 50 anns were constructed evaluated and the best preforming ann identified in the completely same way as described previously i e evaluation based on rmse resulting from comparison with validation data cf section 2 5 1 from these 30 variants of the best performing anns the yield was predicted and averaged for each year and district for this purpose the selected ann model used etalexi as the predictor since this model resulted in the lowest rmse values and highest r2 values during the optimal prediction period cf section 3 1 for both crops the combination of ann model with nine input neurons for doys 134 190 early july was used for yield prediction the example is presented in fig 5 showing the 10 year period of 2009 2018 including both drought years and non drought years agricultural drought events were recorded in central europe in 2011 2012 zahradníček et al 2015 2015 van lanen et al 2016 trnka et al 2020 2017 štěpánek et al 2018 crocetti et al 2020 and 2018 jrc european drought observatory edo 2018 the severe drought event of 2011 2012 lasted from august 2011 to may 2012 in the czech republic žalud et al 2017 the drought event in 2015 occurred in the beginning of july and lasted till mid august for most of the territory of the czech republic zhang and kovacs 2012 the 2015 was particularly severe in the region of central and eastern europe having a significant impact on the agricultural sector van lanen et al 2016 the dry episode of 2017 started in may and was most intensive from mid may through june to the mid july štěpánek et al 2018 the severe drought of 2018 affected mostly central and northern europe in the czech republic this dry episode started in april and lasted till november e g edo 2018 the time series of both observed and predicted yields show characteristic drops in the above listed dry years and hence illustrates the drought impacts and their spatial distribution fig 5 the spring barley yields were typically 3 5 6 5 t ha 1 while winter wheat yields were 4 7 5 t ha 1 for both crops and most of districts predicted yields generally overestimated lower observed yields approximately 2 4 t ha 1 for barley and 2 5 t ha 1 for wheat when predicted yields were typically 0 5 1 t ha 1 higher than observed yields at the same time predicted yields of both crops typically underestimated higher observed yields approximately 4 5 6 5 t ha 1 for barley and 5 5 7 5 t ha 1 for wheat when predicted yields were mostly 0 5 1 t ha 1 higher than observed yields the only exception were non drought years i e 2009 2010 2013 2014 and 2016 for winter wheat yields when predicted yields agreed with or underestimated observed yields at all yield levels all these patterns could be observed for all analyzed districts no matter of their elevation over the whole period of 2009 2018 the lowest observed and predicted yields were typically found in district of jhm region while higher were detected districts in stc vys and olk regions 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies the relationship between esi from alexi in particular esi 12wkalexi and winter wheat and spring barley yields in the czech republic was previously examined by anderson et al 2016a these two crops were analyzed at the district level lau 1 as well as at the regional level nuts 3 anderson et al 2016a calculated yield anomalies at the district level from a linear regression over the period 2002 2014 then computed regression statistics between esi 12wkalexi and observed yields lumped at the regional scale r2 derived from the reported pearson correlation coefficients were peaking around 0 60 and 0 58 for winter wheat and spring barley respectively when individual regions were analyzed when all districts were combined r2 peaked at 0 36 and 0 42 at doy 190 and 200 for wheat and barley respectively in comparison the ann approach used in this study using time series of et based indicators over an 18 year period 2001 2018 yielded the r2 values exceeding 0 7 from doy 155 and 162 for wheat and barley respectively and the r2 values reaching 0 8 from doy 190 and 197 for wheat and barley respectively the higher amount of explained variability r2 in this study can be attributed to more advanced technique of yield predictions capable to capture complex and nonlinear relationships i e ann as compared to linear regression model in the current study the optimal period for yield prediction started between doy 155 and 169 for both crops i e roughly early june to mid june this is generally consistent with previous studies based on vegetation indices johnson 2016 examined relationships between yields of 10 different crops and modis based remote sensing indicators across major farming areas of the united states johnson 2016 ndvi correlations with barley yields both spring and winter peaked in late may with r2 about 0 5 while winter wheat r2 peaked around 0 5 in early june results with evi were similar but with slightly higher r2 for winter wheat around 0 6 higher resolution 250 m modis vegetation indices outperformed coarser products 1000 m similar findings regarding period of optimal grain yield forecasting were obtained in studies conducted in countries of the central europe in the tisza river catchment located in central eastern europe the optimal period for prediction of wheat yield using modis ndvi 250 m was from early to late may between 6 and 8 weeks prior to harvest nagy et al 2018 in hungary modis ndvi 250 m performance for winter wheat yield prediction peaked in the middle of june doy 165 approximately three weeks before harvest bognár et al 2017 errors in yield estimates for 2003 2015 improved from 7 for a prediction date at the end of may doy 150 to less than 5 by doy 165 these findings correspond with results of the current study even though they used different indicators at higher spatial resolution a similar optimum was found in forecasting key crops in the czech republic using modis ndvi evi and evi2 trnka et al 2018 optimal predictability occurred between the end of june and the beginning of july shortly before the onset of harvest in warmer regions of the czech republic this was relevant for both spring barley and winter wheat at the district level 4 2 factors affecting the yield prediction and performance of predictors key to the performance of the yield estimation approach described here was the transformation of yields in the form of z score as an input to the anns and its transformation back into yields during the final yield prediction before the calculation of rmse and r2 without the transformation of yields in the form of z score and its transformation back into yields we reached r2 values lower or around 0 5 while r2 was between 0 5 and 0 8 with this transformation this result reflects the fact that yield dynamics vary from district to district in the czech republic and the z score serves to de emphasize these differences in yield response the spatial analysis of the predicted vs observed yields further suggested that the predicted yields show lower variance and that the model is not capable to capture reliably the extreme values both high and low the predictability of the extreme yield anomalies and especially the yield drops under drought episodes should motivate further studies and initiatives even though the analyzed models have different spatial resolutions 500 m of soilclim vs 0 05 of alexi and represent different modeling approaches et based indicators from both models demonstrated similar performance in the yield prediction this phenomenon would be probably more crucial for analysis at more detailed level field or cadastral level or when specific land use classes are taken into account in this case higher resolution diagnostic et products 30 m could be employed generated by the fusion of landsat and modis derived et time series yang et al 2018 at this scale different crop types can be effectively separated and emergence date determined gao et al 2020 which may prove to be another valuable input for the yield predictions 5 summary and conclusions this study focused on the capability of et based indicators to predict yield of spring barley and winter wheat prior to harvest and identification of the optimal period for the yield prediction the optimal period was defined as the date when the lowest rmse and highest r2 values were reached and these did not significantly improve as the growing season proceeded the optimal period for both key crops of the czech republic started between doys 155 and 169 roughly early june to mid june the et based indicators can therefore predict yield several weeks prior to harvest for both crops the period with the highest predictive capability was often identifiable between two and four ann inputs but accuracy of yield estimates tended to increase with more inputs included within the anns on the other hand the seasonal pattern could be more clearly detected for the lower number of ann inputs than for the higher number of inputs the et based indicators from the prognostic soilclim and diagnostic alexi models demonstrated similar performance despite of their different construction and spatial resolution the difference that was found in identification of the optimal period was the different performance of the soilclim and alexi products for both models and crops the identification of the optimal period was more straightforward for eta than for 4 week and 12 week esi in case of spring barley etalexi and etsoilclim reached the lowest rmse and highest r2 values compared to the rest of indicators in case of winter wheat the period with the highest predictive capability was most clearly identifiable for etalexi reaching the lowest rmse and the highest r2 values from all indicators at the level of individual districts we focused on the 10 year period that included both drought years and non drought years 2009 2018 for both crops and most of districts tested ann approach tended to balance extremes and be close to the average yields predicted yields generally overestimated lower observed yields approximately 2 4 t ha 1 for barley and 2 5 t ha 1 for wheat at the same time predicted yields of both crops typically underestimated higher observed yields approximately 4 5 6 5 t ha 1 for barley and 5 5 7 5 t ha 1 for wheat the only exception were non drought years i e 2009 2010 2013 2014 and 2016 for winter wheat yields when predicted yields often agreed with or underestimated observed yields there is still a need to test the predictive capability for other important agricultural crops of the czech republic such as winter oilseed rape clover grain and silage maize and permanent grasslands however results of the study suggest that et based indicators have capability to predict crop yield several weeks prior to harvest and therefore have great potential for decision making at regional and district levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

9916,a process based crop model equipped with seasonal climate forecasts has been typically used to expect crop yields before or in the middle of the growing period in this work to consider the farmers risk aversion behavior we slightly shifted the typical focus to the risk associated with a crucial farming decision in a rainfed paddy rice field the transplanting timing using a simple crop model and a semi parametric weather generator we tested hypothetical and real sets of climate forecasts for the rice field under nutrient deficiency in lao people s democratic republic pdr results showed that the first climatic risk in the study field was an occational dry conditions and the traditional timing of transplanting seemed to minimize the worst effect of potential dry conditions it was found that the transplanting timing needs to be 5 10 days earlier than the farming tradition when fertility stress delays foliage development the tests with hypothetical climate forecasts suggest that duration of a potential dry condition needs to be reliably forecasted to manage the climatic risk by adjusting the transplanting timing the yield simulations for the 2015 el niño event also implcate that adjusting the transplanting timing could effectively reduce the potential impact of dry climate at a cost of slightly reduced yield expectation this study exemplifies how to explicitly assess the climatic risk associated with the farming decision using ready to use climate data and a simple crop model keywords risk minimization stochastic downscaling crop response to water and fertility stresses transplanting timing 1 introduction with the rapidly growing population climatic variability poses dual challenges to agricultural sectors across the globe niles and salerno 2018 since they are tightly related to crop productivity asseng et al 2012 fluctuating climates could threaten food security and rural livelihoods under rainfed environments liang et al 2019 still global food production depends largely on rainfed agriculture akpoti et al 2021 keating et al 2014 particularly in southeast asia highly variable monsoon onsets and durations make it increasingly difficult to manage agricultural risks by proactive farming decisions lacombe et al 2012 roth and grünbühel 2012 to reduce the rising agricultural risks monthly to seasonal climate forecasts have emerged as a decision supporting tool since the late 2000s apipattanavis et al 2010 with the help of advanced atmospheric sciences and constantly increasing computing power dynamic forecasts generated by global climate models gcms enabled to produce beneficial information for agricultural sectors bruno soares et al 2018 brown et al 2018 shannon motha 2015 they could lead to proactive farming strategies to prevent detrimental productivity losses e g choi et al 2015 iizumi et al 2013 meza et al 2008 meinke and stone 2005 and to prepare optimal crop design and management e g rodriguez et al 2018 asseng et al 2012 an vo et al 2021 even showed benefits from imperfect climate forecasts in agricultural practices seasonal climate forecasts are valued when they are translated to decision supporting information bruno soares et al 2018 to this end they have been combined with state of the art crop models han et al 2017 for example assessed variations of crop yields and economic margins by tailing seasonal climate forecasts with the modular based dssat cropping system model jones et al 2003 shelia et al 2019 also proposed an integrated framework that links climate forecasts and multiple crop models enabling users to assess agricultural vulnerability at multiple scales in a timely manner nonetheless gcms are inherently subject to the chaotic nature of atmospheric processes and often biased by inappropriate model formulations stevens and bony 2013 deser et al 2012 hence they could produce forecasts insufficiently accurate for farming decisions shafiee jood et al 2014 found that advanced climate forecasts could not capture the 2012 illinois drought and potentially worse off farmers preseason investments min et al 2017 emphasized that even a large ensemble of advanced gcms could have low predictability when heat forcing to the atmospheric systems is weak those studies implicate that seasonal climate forecasts could be subject to large uncertainty and thus need to be utilized with caution besides their inherent uncertainty gcms usually produce seasonal forecasts at coarse spatial and temporal scales and thus require a downscaling tool for converting them to weather inputs to crop models e g han and ines 2017 the uncertainty and the scale mismatch problems could be resolved by a stochastic weather generator a prominent example is apipattanavis et al 2010 who downscaled coarse gcm outputs to many random weather series for crop yield simulations they embedded the given climate forecasts in stochastic weather series as inputs to a process based crop model and thereby informed predicted ranges of crop yields and economic benefits this monte carlo framework does not only convert the raw climate forecasts to compatible inputs to a crop model but assesses agricultural and economic risks from climatic variability this pilot study has been extended to frameworks for developing water allocation strategies and valuating economic benefits e g han et al 2017 capa morocho et al 2016 nevertheless the stochastic modeling framework equipped with seasonal climate forecasts seems to pay little attention to risks directly related to farming decisions while they have been focused on forecasts of crop productivity and economic outcomes e g brown et al 2018 rodriguez et al 2018 han et al 2017 asseng et al 2012 zinyengere et al 2011 how farmers decisions alter the agricultural risks were rarely assessed despite the evident producers risk aversion behaviors binswanger 1980 friedman and savage 1948 such a risk based assessment for farming decisions have been conducted with historical observations e g kim and kaluarachchi 2016 foster et al 2014 blanco gutiérrez et al 2013 rather than using climate forecasts therefore here we provided a case study that explicitly addressed climatic risks associated with farming decisions using seasonal climate forecasts though complex crop models have been commonly employed with stochastic weather generators we adopted a simple engineering type model to simulate generic rice responses to water and fertility stresses with readily available climate data the stochastic framework was proposed to make a crucial farming decision in a rainfed paddy rice field the transplanting timing based on the farmers risk aversion behavior under a data limited environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climatic data the study site is a rainfed paddy rice field located in the savannakhet province lao people s democratic republic pdr 17 07 n 104 88 e fig 1 it is under a monsoonal climate with distinct dry november to april and wet seasons may to october due to the rainfed environment the rice field has been exposed to high risks of water stress and in severe cases such as the el nino events local farmers around the study site might suffered from crop failures inthavong et al 2011 the rice production in savannakhet contributes approximately to 40 of the national production and thus plays an important role in food and economic securities in lao pdr ministry of planning and investment 2010 the paddy rice field is a part of the wide floodplain adjacent to the mekong river that provides convenience for farmers to prepare rice seedlings in mid may to mid june the rice seedlings prepared in nurseries are transplanted usually in late june to mid july inthavong et al 2011 and harvested in october the provincial rice productivity has substantially been degraded by low soil fertility it could drop to a very low level below 1 5 mg ha 1 due to severe fertility stresses while the provincial rice yield could reach about 6 0 mg ha 1 if fertility management is good inthavong et al 2014 though there exist daily weather observations from 1985 to 2011 at the city of savannakhet the station data at a distant location from the study field were available with limited accessibility and a long latency period for quality control they were of missing periods e g one month missing precipitation data during the 27 years and even absent after 2011 due potentially to quality controls and dissemination processes to avoid the limited accessibility and long latency we used the readily available reanalysis climate data provided by the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resources power system https power larc nasa gov last access on july 13 2020 the daily precipitation p maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin 2 m wind speed u2 and solar irradiance rs were downloaded for 1984 2019 at the grid location nearest to the rice field then we compared the reanalysis data with the observations at the savannakhet station the mean annual p from the grid data source was 1581 mm a 1 for 1985 2011 and it was slightly higher 5 than that of the local weather data 1502 mm a 1 the mean air temperatures of the power data for the same period 25 5 c were acceptably close to that of the local data 26 4 c given that the missing data period and the distance between the weather station and the rice field the preliminary comparison led us to believe that the reanalysis power data were not biased considerably the reliability of the merra 2 reanalysis data that embeds the nasa power system has also been widely validated by previous studies e g le et al 2020 hamal et al 2020 2 2 stochastic risk assessment framework to evaluate climatic risks associated with the transplanting timing in the paddy field we connected probabilistic climate forecasts and a simple crop model using a non parametric conditional weather generator fig 2 the climate forecasts for coming months are given by relevant international agencies such as the apec climate center https www apcc21 org ser global and the international research institute for climate and society https iri columbia edu our expertise climate forecasts seasonal climate forecasts in a form of the tercile probabilities the stochastic weather generator synthesizes random weather series that embeds the given tercile information then a simple crop model generates rice yields with the random weather series and changing the transplanting timing within the risk assessment framework we first assessed how the tercile probabilities could change the transplanting timing with the minimum climatic risk then a case study is provided to show how the transplanting timing could be determined with forecasts of severe droughts 2 2 1 stochastic weather generation for rice yield simulations apipattanavis et al 2007 proposed a first order three state markov chain model to generate categorical p occurrences in the occurrence generation a particular day is represented by dry wet and extremely wet states classified by two thresholds 0 3 mm and the 80 percentile of non zero p were applied in this work using the thresholds the daily p series are converted to the state series yielding the 3 3 probability matrix that represents the state transition between two consecutive days e g dry to wet dry to extremely wet once the transition probabilities are obtained one can generate categorical p occurrences series recursively by the first order markov process for a desired length then the synthetic weather variables corresponding to the p occurrences are resampled by bootstrapping weather observations with a k nearest neighbor knn scheme for the generation of weather variables all the pairs of observations with the same state transition of the synthetic occurrences are collected within the 15 day time window for example if the synthetic occurrence indicates a dry to wet transition on july 1st the historical pairs with the same transitions are all sampled from june 24th to july 8th the sampled pairs are sorted with the euclidean distance to the generated weather on the first day and a set from the sorted samples is picked by another random probability this knn bootstrapping process is repeated to the end of the occurrence generation as mentioned the stochastic generator can incorporate the tercile probabilities into the random synthetic weather series for example if a tercile p forecast for a coming month indicates 50 of the above normal p 30 of the near normal p and 20 of the below normal p by allowing replacements 50 weather sets with above normal p could be mixed with 30 sets with near normal p and 20 sets with below normal p subsequently the synthetic weather series could be generated by the markov chain and the knn bootstrapper using the resampled weather datasets 2 2 2 aquacrop model the monte carlo tests were conducted by inputting the stochastic weather series into aquacrop steduto et al 2009 the resultant variation of simulated yields could quantify the associated climatic risks this numerical evaluation was repeated under multiple fertility management scenarios to simulate rice yield responses to water and fertility stresses we adopted aquacrop version 6 0 the crop growth model of the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nation available at http www fao org aquacrop en aquacrop conceptually synthesizes development of the green canopy cover cc and the biomass production using user specified inputs of daily weather series physiological crop characteristics and soil properties with a relatively simple structure it has shown good accuracy and robustness under various environmental and management conditions e g pirmoradian and davatgar 2019 kim and kaluarachchi 2015 iqbal et al 2014 shrestha et al 2013 since the theories and computation details are available in steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 we briefly describe it here aquacrop simulates the dry aboveground biomass agb at a daily scale using the simple concept of the water stress coefficient if soil water content is higher than the water stress tolerance of a chosen crop the agb produced by plants photosynthesis is assumed to reach the attainable level that is determined by the amount of transpiration and water use efficiency otherwise the water stress coefficient ks ranging between 0 full stress and 1 no stress reduces the cc development and the agb production and adjusts the harvest index hi the final crop yield at maturity is calculated by multiplying the hi to the agb accumulated over the growing period hence the core structure of aquacrop is described by the following three equations 1 tr i ks i kc tr i et o i 2 agb wp tr i et o i 3 y hi agb where tr i is the crop transpiration on day i mm d 1 kctri is the basal crop coefficient proportional to the fraction of vegetation cover i e cc unitless eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 by the fao 56 method wp is the normalized crop water productivity g m 2 and y is the crop yield mg ha 1 if cold temperatures trigger additional stress the temperature stress coefficient is multiplied to the agb from eq 2 the effect of soil fertility stress on crop yield is simulated by the semi quantitative approach that mimics the overall effect of nutrient deficiency on development of cc and agb the ratio of agb under a certain fertility stress to that under stress free conditions brel is considered the overall degree of fertility stress that introduces three changes to the cc development i delayed foliage expansion ii decreased maximum canopy cover ccx and iii steady decline in cc after mid season the nutrient deficiency could also limit the agb development by reducing the biomass water productivity i e wp geerts 2008 aquacrop incorporates four independent stress coefficients representing those four crop responses to fertility stress into the cc and agb development aquacrop allows an automatic calibration procedure to incorporate the responses to fertility stress into crop development requiring a reference set of brel and ccx gained from controlled experimental plots more details about fertility stress in aquacrop are found in van gaelen et al 2015 and shrestha et al 2013 2 2 3 model validation and risk assessments a prerequisite for rice yield simulations is to make the non conservative parameters of aquacrop be suited to the study site however since the phenological records and cc observations required for the parameter calibration were limited at the study site we did a priori parameter adjustment using information from two prior studies conducted under similar monsoonal climates first the lengths from transplanting to recovery flowering ccx senescence and maturity of the built in paddy rice were adjusted with the experiment of maniruzzaman et al 2015 this adjustment was based on the fact that maniruzzaman et al 2015 used 46 days as the length from transplanting to flowering for rice yield modeling with aquacrop in bangladesh this length was close to a phenological record in lao pdr tsubo et al 2006 second to calibrate the parameters for fertility stress we used the information in shrestha et al 2013 who suggested 57 of brel when ccx reduction was 52 for modeling the fertility stress in nepal the parameter adjustments for rice yield modeling is summarized in table 1 then we checked the validity of our parameter adjustment using the monte carlo simulations with 300 sets of random daily weather series the 300 simulations were computationally efficient to have the 95 yield ranges similar to those from a much larger number of sampling attempts e g 1000 simulations while they were more rigorous than kindred studies e g han and ines 2017 capa morocho et al 2016 it should be noted that the minimum risk transplanting dates does not require exact yield ranges but how they vary with time for the validation we assumed that the probabilities of above normal p pan near normal p pnn and below normal p pbn are all equal at 33 3 for the random weather generation i e historical weather variability was assumed the required soil properties for yield simulations were set using the 10 km resolution global soil dataset by han et al 2019 table 2 the monte carlo tests were conducted under four fertility scenarios made to consider the study of inthavong et al 2014 using the conventional soil nutrient model of janssen et al 1990 inthavong et al 2014 estimated rice yields in savannakhet under the standard fertilizer rates 60 n 13 p 16 k kg ha 1 around 3 000 mg ha 1 they also found that the yield reduction by nutrient deficiency was predicted negligible 4 when applying six times of the standard fertilizer rates while it would reach 74 with no fertilizer application when applying three times of the standard rates the reduction was predicted 22 approximately the yield reductions under zero one three and six times of the standard fertilizer rates given in inthavong et al 2014 approximately correspond to the very poor about half near optimal and non limiting fertilizing options in aquacrop based on the corresponding yield reductions we hence compared the simulated yields by aquacrop under the four management options to the outcomes of inthavong et al 2014 the monte carolo simulations showed that the simulated yields by adjusted aquacrop parameters agreed acceptably with the outcomes of inthavong et al 2014 table 3 after the comparative validation of a priori parameters we quantified climatic risks associated with rice productivity by changing the timing of transplanting we evaluated the climatic risks using the same monte carlo simulations with transplanting dates from june 14th to july 14th the climate risk of each transplanting date was measured by the difference between 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles of the resultant simulated yields we repeated the same stochastic evaluations using several sets of pan pnn and pbn forecasts and discussed how the climate risk could be managed by controlling the transplanting timing transplanting for the study site 3 results 3 1 climatic risks associated with timing of transplanting fig 3 illustrates daily variations of p and the reference et eto calculated with the power data while the daily p substantially fluctuates from 0 to 80 mm d 1 the daily eto has varied within a narrow range of 2 5 mm d 1 during the rice growing season as described earlier the rainfed rice has generally been planted from june to october during the growing period the monthly p increases from june and peaks in august 238 6 344 2 mm month 1 and it declines to october 101 3 mm month 1 on the contrary the monthly eto and air temperature were stable around 110 mm month 1 and 26 c during the five months fig 3 confirms that the primary climatic risk at the study site is the variability in daily p the boxplots in fig 4 illustrate the average stress coefficients for canopy expansion and stomatal closure under the about half fertility scenario from the monte carlo simulations with aquacrop and the climate data the upper bounds of the whiskers show that the effects of water stress on canopy expansion declined as the transplanting timing is postponed in trade off delaying the transplanting timing would lead to more frequent stomatal closure after full foliage development the former reduces tr in the early season while the latter exerts influences on tr and hi the yield simulations with the random weather series could provide strategies to balance between the two responses to water stress fig 5 displays the yields variations for each transplanting date when pan pnn and pbn were all equal at 33 3 i e historical weather variability the monte carlo simulations confirmed that fertility stress is another dominant control of monsoonal rice yields at the study site inthavong et al 2014 the simulated yields under the near optimal and the half fertility scenarios i e the standard fertilizer rates were about 80 and a half of the attainable yield under non limiting fertility respectively fig 5a and c under the very poor fertility scenario the 97 5 percentiles of the simulated yields never exceeded 1 500 mg ha 1 and the range between the two percentiles became very small 0 179 mg ha 1 suggesting that the weather variability is a minor control of rice productivity when fertility stress is very severe the transplanting timing seems to be an important farming decision due to the rainfed environment in fig 5 the 97 5 percentiles under the four fertility scenarios were almost constant this implies that abnormally wet climates allow the plant to reach the attainable productivity under each fertility scenario irrespective of the transplanting timing the median yields close to the 97 5 percentiles indicate that general climate conditions are favorably wet for rice planting at the study field however the 2 5 percentiles that would be simulated under abnormally dry conditions showed a convex response to the transplanting timing under the non limiting fertility scenario july 1st was the optimal timing to minimize the yield variation being coincident with the farming tradition in savannakhet inthavong et al 2011 perhaps local farmers might have used their long term experiences on weather variability to find the transplanting timing for risk minimization transplanting timing earlier or later than july 1st was likely to expose the plant to high water stress risks during the growing season on the other hand the minimum risk transplanting timing was earlier than july 1st under the near optimal and about half fertility scenarios fig 5b and c the minimum variation of the simulated yields was found on june 27th and june 19th under the two fertility scenarios respectively this is explained by considering the foliage expansion delayed by nutrient deficiency since it takes longer for the fertility stressed plant to fully develop its foliage than under the non limiting fertility scenario an earlier transplanting could shift the timing of full foliage development and reduce water stress risks nonetheless if nutrient deficiency is too severe and shortens the growing length of the plant the transplanting timing should rather be delayed for minimizing water stress risks fig 5d the very poor fertility scenario was the case that triggers early senescence with the shortened growing length the best transplanting timing was july 9th by which a fertility stressed rice could fully developed its foliage development in the middle of august 3 2 the minimum risk transplanting date for hypothetical forecasts although pan pnn pbn 33 3 was assumed fig 5 implicates that pbn is the key information to manage the water stress risk from climatic variability regardless of the fertility scenarios the variations of simulated yields were mostly determined by the 2 5 percentiles in other words local farmers question in a preseason would be whether p is below average during the upcoming growing season we hence examined how a dry climate forecast could affect the minimum risk transplanting date using the same monte carlo framework typically in a multi model forecast project a set of pan pnn and pbn is given by dividing the number of climate models predicting each category by the total number of participating models e g min et al 2017 since the chaotic nature of atmospheric processes often lead the climate models to divergent forecasts steinschneider et al 2012 a hypothetical set of pan 20 pnn 30 and pbn 50 can be considered a forecast fairly skewed to a dry climate when the hypothetical forecast was imposed only on the weather series in june i e pan pnn pbn 33 3 were still fixed for july august and september the minimum risk transplanting date under the non limiting fertility stress was five day earlier than the case of pbn pnn pan 33 3 and the minimum yield variation was slightly raised to 1 256 mg ha 1 6 owing to the increased water stress risk in june fig 6a the traditional transplanting timing too was unlikely to pose a large increase in the yield variability however when the dry climate forecast was assumed to last from june to july fig 6b the minimum yield variation increased to 1 996 mg ha 1 68 6 and the corresponding transplanting timing was july 4th indicating that a delayed transplanting seems necessary to avoid high water stress risks during canopy expansion when the dry climate was assumed to persist from june to august delaying the transplanting timing seems to provide a clear benefit for risk reduction the minimum yield variation was rather smaller than the case of two month dry climates due to the assumed retrieval of dry climate in september however the risk reduction from controlling the transplanting timing would not be very high if the dry climate last from june to september fig 6d when considering the effects of fertility stress the minimum risk transplanting timing would be around the conventional transplanting date fig 7 however delaying the transplanting timing could decrease the median yields due to the combined effect of fertility and water stresses under the about half fertility scenario i e the standard fertilizer levels the monte carlo simulations seem to strongly recommend the traditional transplanting timing to minimize the climatic risk in the case that dry climate lasts from june to september the median yield and the 2 5 percentile decreased sensitively by delaying the transplanting 3 3 assessing the climatic risk for a forecasted el niño event it is well known that a warm phase of the el niño southern oscillation makes the walker circulation downwelling around southeast asia and thereby causes long dry spells and below average p the proposed framework could allow users to assess this known risk in a quantitative manner the biggest el niño in the 2010s occurred in 2015 and the apec climate center provided the one month lead forecasts for this event as in table 4 the given tercile probabilities indicate below average p for june through october except august giving a clear signal of dry climate during the growing season we generated 300 synthetic weather series using the tercile probabilities and simulated rice yields under the four fertility scenarios fig 8 depicts the resultant risk assessment from the given probabilistic forecasts when fertility stress is nil the yield variation was minimized at the timing slightly earlier than july 1st while the median yields showed a clear convex response to changing transplanting dates a slight change from the minimum risk transplanting date could require a high risk of yield loss due to the given above average p forecast in august the near optimal and the half fertility scenarios on the other hand suggested earlier transplanting than under the non limiting fertility scenario fig 8b and c as expected the growing length shortened by very severe fertility stress requires a transplanting later than the farming tradition fig 6d the monte carlo simulations for the 2015 el niño event suggests that missing the minimum risk could lead to substantial reduction in the expected rice yields i e the median yield the climate forecasts recommend in hindsight that farmers could have small chances to alleviate the impact of expected dry climates by increasing probabilities of relatively large p in the middle of the growing season such a farm level strategy to increase expected yield would be more effective under better nutrient management in the case of severe fertility stresses there would be little change to raise the expected yield by adjusting the transplanting timing owing to the delayed foliage development 4 discussion and conclusions our case study could be viewed as a variation of the framework proposed by han and ines 2017 capa morocho et al 2016 and apipattanavis et al 2010 but was more focused on risks associated with a specific farming decision by linking advanced crop models and weather generators the prior studies were possible to forecast the ranges crop yields and economic gains under determined farming practices however farmers precision decisions could change the yield predictions kim and kaluarachchi 2016 blanco gutiérrez et al 2013 the yield simulations with the equal terciles in this work highlight that the conventional transplanting timing could minimize the worst outcomes from climatic variability under non limiting fertility if fertility stress delays canopy expansion however a transplanting about 5 10 days earlier than the farming tradition would minimize the risk in the case that a severe fertility stress shortens the growing length e g no fertilizer applications the transplanting timing needs to be rather delayed about 10 days for minimizing the combined effects of water and fertility stress those strategies could prevent severe yield losses from potential dry climates the monte carlo tests with the tercile information changing over the growing season showed that the risk of dry climates could be managed by controlling the timing of transplanting while the prior attempts that combined climate forecasts and crop models provided a single set of distributional outcomes our case study highlights that the outcomes could be altered by practical farming decisions considerably when the climate forecasts are considered the minimum risk transplanting dates could be pinpointed such as the el niño case a well predicted duration of dry climate could have a potential to reduce water stress risks rather than the categorical climate itself this finding might suggest a practical direction in refining the outputs of gcms our approach focused on a specific farming decision could be extended to develop other management strategies such as water and land allocations e g kim and kaluarachchi 2016 the simplicity of aquacrop and the non parametric weather generator may ease such an expansion nonetheless this study includes several caveats first aquacrop could be too simple to formulate specific fertilizing strategies though we linked the hypothetical fertility controls of the aquacrop to the experimental study of inthavong et al 2014 specific nutrient application practices corresponding to the categorical fertility levels remains still elusive aquacrop is an engineering type model that depends on a mixture of well established general theories being meant to be only functional steduto et al 2009 its primary focus is generic responses of a chosen crop to water stress second the minimum risk transplanting is not intended to make high returns but for reduction of potential climatic risks for instance our ad hoc simulation for the 2015 el niño event using the observed weathers under the half fertility scenario provided 3 185 mg ha 1 with the minimum transplanting date while it was 3 354 mg ha 1 when july 1st was used instead the ex post difference between the simulated yields is not a loss but a cost required for the risk reduction in conclusion this study exemplified how to tailor seasonal climate forecasts to a specific farming decision using ready to use data and the crop model validated by a priori information they might not be as reliable as local weather observations and a crop model validated by experimental plots but nonetheless are not subject to the data latency and the expensive costs for laborious experimentations thus the proposed approach might be practical in underdeveloped locations under low data availability obviously further efforts are necessary for refining our approaches they may include improving climate

forecasts shared from the apec climate center 
9916,a process based crop model equipped with seasonal climate forecasts has been typically used to expect crop yields before or in the middle of the growing period in this work to consider the farmers risk aversion behavior we slightly shifted the typical focus to the risk associated with a crucial farming decision in a rainfed paddy rice field the transplanting timing using a simple crop model and a semi parametric weather generator we tested hypothetical and real sets of climate forecasts for the rice field under nutrient deficiency in lao people s democratic republic pdr results showed that the first climatic risk in the study field was an occational dry conditions and the traditional timing of transplanting seemed to minimize the worst effect of potential dry conditions it was found that the transplanting timing needs to be 5 10 days earlier than the farming tradition when fertility stress delays foliage development the tests with hypothetical climate forecasts suggest that duration of a potential dry condition needs to be reliably forecasted to manage the climatic risk by adjusting the transplanting timing the yield simulations for the 2015 el niño event also implcate that adjusting the transplanting timing could effectively reduce the potential impact of dry climate at a cost of slightly reduced yield expectation this study exemplifies how to explicitly assess the climatic risk associated with the farming decision using ready to use climate data and a simple crop model keywords risk minimization stochastic downscaling crop response to water and fertility stresses transplanting timing 1 introduction with the rapidly growing population climatic variability poses dual challenges to agricultural sectors across the globe niles and salerno 2018 since they are tightly related to crop productivity asseng et al 2012 fluctuating climates could threaten food security and rural livelihoods under rainfed environments liang et al 2019 still global food production depends largely on rainfed agriculture akpoti et al 2021 keating et al 2014 particularly in southeast asia highly variable monsoon onsets and durations make it increasingly difficult to manage agricultural risks by proactive farming decisions lacombe et al 2012 roth and grünbühel 2012 to reduce the rising agricultural risks monthly to seasonal climate forecasts have emerged as a decision supporting tool since the late 2000s apipattanavis et al 2010 with the help of advanced atmospheric sciences and constantly increasing computing power dynamic forecasts generated by global climate models gcms enabled to produce beneficial information for agricultural sectors bruno soares et al 2018 brown et al 2018 shannon motha 2015 they could lead to proactive farming strategies to prevent detrimental productivity losses e g choi et al 2015 iizumi et al 2013 meza et al 2008 meinke and stone 2005 and to prepare optimal crop design and management e g rodriguez et al 2018 asseng et al 2012 an vo et al 2021 even showed benefits from imperfect climate forecasts in agricultural practices seasonal climate forecasts are valued when they are translated to decision supporting information bruno soares et al 2018 to this end they have been combined with state of the art crop models han et al 2017 for example assessed variations of crop yields and economic margins by tailing seasonal climate forecasts with the modular based dssat cropping system model jones et al 2003 shelia et al 2019 also proposed an integrated framework that links climate forecasts and multiple crop models enabling users to assess agricultural vulnerability at multiple scales in a timely manner nonetheless gcms are inherently subject to the chaotic nature of atmospheric processes and often biased by inappropriate model formulations stevens and bony 2013 deser et al 2012 hence they could produce forecasts insufficiently accurate for farming decisions shafiee jood et al 2014 found that advanced climate forecasts could not capture the 2012 illinois drought and potentially worse off farmers preseason investments min et al 2017 emphasized that even a large ensemble of advanced gcms could have low predictability when heat forcing to the atmospheric systems is weak those studies implicate that seasonal climate forecasts could be subject to large uncertainty and thus need to be utilized with caution besides their inherent uncertainty gcms usually produce seasonal forecasts at coarse spatial and temporal scales and thus require a downscaling tool for converting them to weather inputs to crop models e g han and ines 2017 the uncertainty and the scale mismatch problems could be resolved by a stochastic weather generator a prominent example is apipattanavis et al 2010 who downscaled coarse gcm outputs to many random weather series for crop yield simulations they embedded the given climate forecasts in stochastic weather series as inputs to a process based crop model and thereby informed predicted ranges of crop yields and economic benefits this monte carlo framework does not only convert the raw climate forecasts to compatible inputs to a crop model but assesses agricultural and economic risks from climatic variability this pilot study has been extended to frameworks for developing water allocation strategies and valuating economic benefits e g han et al 2017 capa morocho et al 2016 nevertheless the stochastic modeling framework equipped with seasonal climate forecasts seems to pay little attention to risks directly related to farming decisions while they have been focused on forecasts of crop productivity and economic outcomes e g brown et al 2018 rodriguez et al 2018 han et al 2017 asseng et al 2012 zinyengere et al 2011 how farmers decisions alter the agricultural risks were rarely assessed despite the evident producers risk aversion behaviors binswanger 1980 friedman and savage 1948 such a risk based assessment for farming decisions have been conducted with historical observations e g kim and kaluarachchi 2016 foster et al 2014 blanco gutiérrez et al 2013 rather than using climate forecasts therefore here we provided a case study that explicitly addressed climatic risks associated with farming decisions using seasonal climate forecasts though complex crop models have been commonly employed with stochastic weather generators we adopted a simple engineering type model to simulate generic rice responses to water and fertility stresses with readily available climate data the stochastic framework was proposed to make a crucial farming decision in a rainfed paddy rice field the transplanting timing based on the farmers risk aversion behavior under a data limited environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climatic data the study site is a rainfed paddy rice field located in the savannakhet province lao people s democratic republic pdr 17 07 n 104 88 e fig 1 it is under a monsoonal climate with distinct dry november to april and wet seasons may to october due to the rainfed environment the rice field has been exposed to high risks of water stress and in severe cases such as the el nino events local farmers around the study site might suffered from crop failures inthavong et al 2011 the rice production in savannakhet contributes approximately to 40 of the national production and thus plays an important role in food and economic securities in lao pdr ministry of planning and investment 2010 the paddy rice field is a part of the wide floodplain adjacent to the mekong river that provides convenience for farmers to prepare rice seedlings in mid may to mid june the rice seedlings prepared in nurseries are transplanted usually in late june to mid july inthavong et al 2011 and harvested in october the provincial rice productivity has substantially been degraded by low soil fertility it could drop to a very low level below 1 5 mg ha 1 due to severe fertility stresses while the provincial rice yield could reach about 6 0 mg ha 1 if fertility management is good inthavong et al 2014 though there exist daily weather observations from 1985 to 2011 at the city of savannakhet the station data at a distant location from the study field were available with limited accessibility and a long latency period for quality control they were of missing periods e g one month missing precipitation data during the 27 years and even absent after 2011 due potentially to quality controls and dissemination processes to avoid the limited accessibility and long latency we used the readily available reanalysis climate data provided by the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resources power system https power larc nasa gov last access on july 13 2020 the daily precipitation p maximum air temperature tmax minimum air temperature tmin 2 m wind speed u2 and solar irradiance rs were downloaded for 1984 2019 at the grid location nearest to the rice field then we compared the reanalysis data with the observations at the savannakhet station the mean annual p from the grid data source was 1581 mm a 1 for 1985 2011 and it was slightly higher 5 than that of the local weather data 1502 mm a 1 the mean air temperatures of the power data for the same period 25 5 c were acceptably close to that of the local data 26 4 c given that the missing data period and the distance between the weather station and the rice field the preliminary comparison led us to believe that the reanalysis power data were not biased considerably the reliability of the merra 2 reanalysis data that embeds the nasa power system has also been widely validated by previous studies e g le et al 2020 hamal et al 2020 2 2 stochastic risk assessment framework to evaluate climatic risks associated with the transplanting timing in the paddy field we connected probabilistic climate forecasts and a simple crop model using a non parametric conditional weather generator fig 2 the climate forecasts for coming months are given by relevant international agencies such as the apec climate center https www apcc21 org ser global and the international research institute for climate and society https iri columbia edu our expertise climate forecasts seasonal climate forecasts in a form of the tercile probabilities the stochastic weather generator synthesizes random weather series that embeds the given tercile information then a simple crop model generates rice yields with the random weather series and changing the transplanting timing within the risk assessment framework we first assessed how the tercile probabilities could change the transplanting timing with the minimum climatic risk then a case study is provided to show how the transplanting timing could be determined with forecasts of severe droughts 2 2 1 stochastic weather generation for rice yield simulations apipattanavis et al 2007 proposed a first order three state markov chain model to generate categorical p occurrences in the occurrence generation a particular day is represented by dry wet and extremely wet states classified by two thresholds 0 3 mm and the 80 percentile of non zero p were applied in this work using the thresholds the daily p series are converted to the state series yielding the 3 3 probability matrix that represents the state transition between two consecutive days e g dry to wet dry to extremely wet once the transition probabilities are obtained one can generate categorical p occurrences series recursively by the first order markov process for a desired length then the synthetic weather variables corresponding to the p occurrences are resampled by bootstrapping weather observations with a k nearest neighbor knn scheme for the generation of weather variables all the pairs of observations with the same state transition of the synthetic occurrences are collected within the 15 day time window for example if the synthetic occurrence indicates a dry to wet transition on july 1st the historical pairs with the same transitions are all sampled from june 24th to july 8th the sampled pairs are sorted with the euclidean distance to the generated weather on the first day and a set from the sorted samples is picked by another random probability this knn bootstrapping process is repeated to the end of the occurrence generation as mentioned the stochastic generator can incorporate the tercile probabilities into the random synthetic weather series for example if a tercile p forecast for a coming month indicates 50 of the above normal p 30 of the near normal p and 20 of the below normal p by allowing replacements 50 weather sets with above normal p could be mixed with 30 sets with near normal p and 20 sets with below normal p subsequently the synthetic weather series could be generated by the markov chain and the knn bootstrapper using the resampled weather datasets 2 2 2 aquacrop model the monte carlo tests were conducted by inputting the stochastic weather series into aquacrop steduto et al 2009 the resultant variation of simulated yields could quantify the associated climatic risks this numerical evaluation was repeated under multiple fertility management scenarios to simulate rice yield responses to water and fertility stresses we adopted aquacrop version 6 0 the crop growth model of the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nation available at http www fao org aquacrop en aquacrop conceptually synthesizes development of the green canopy cover cc and the biomass production using user specified inputs of daily weather series physiological crop characteristics and soil properties with a relatively simple structure it has shown good accuracy and robustness under various environmental and management conditions e g pirmoradian and davatgar 2019 kim and kaluarachchi 2015 iqbal et al 2014 shrestha et al 2013 since the theories and computation details are available in steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 we briefly describe it here aquacrop simulates the dry aboveground biomass agb at a daily scale using the simple concept of the water stress coefficient if soil water content is higher than the water stress tolerance of a chosen crop the agb produced by plants photosynthesis is assumed to reach the attainable level that is determined by the amount of transpiration and water use efficiency otherwise the water stress coefficient ks ranging between 0 full stress and 1 no stress reduces the cc development and the agb production and adjusts the harvest index hi the final crop yield at maturity is calculated by multiplying the hi to the agb accumulated over the growing period hence the core structure of aquacrop is described by the following three equations 1 tr i ks i kc tr i et o i 2 agb wp tr i et o i 3 y hi agb where tr i is the crop transpiration on day i mm d 1 kctri is the basal crop coefficient proportional to the fraction of vegetation cover i e cc unitless eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 by the fao 56 method wp is the normalized crop water productivity g m 2 and y is the crop yield mg ha 1 if cold temperatures trigger additional stress the temperature stress coefficient is multiplied to the agb from eq 2 the effect of soil fertility stress on crop yield is simulated by the semi quantitative approach that mimics the overall effect of nutrient deficiency on development of cc and agb the ratio of agb under a certain fertility stress to that under stress free conditions brel is considered the overall degree of fertility stress that introduces three changes to the cc development i delayed foliage expansion ii decreased maximum canopy cover ccx and iii steady decline in cc after mid season the nutrient deficiency could also limit the agb development by reducing the biomass water productivity i e wp geerts 2008 aquacrop incorporates four independent stress coefficients representing those four crop responses to fertility stress into the cc and agb development aquacrop allows an automatic calibration procedure to incorporate the responses to fertility stress into crop development requiring a reference set of brel and ccx gained from controlled experimental plots more details about fertility stress in aquacrop are found in van gaelen et al 2015 and shrestha et al 2013 2 2 3 model validation and risk assessments a prerequisite for rice yield simulations is to make the non conservative parameters of aquacrop be suited to the study site however since the phenological records and cc observations required for the parameter calibration were limited at the study site we did a priori parameter adjustment using information from two prior studies conducted under similar monsoonal climates first the lengths from transplanting to recovery flowering ccx senescence and maturity of the built in paddy rice were adjusted with the experiment of maniruzzaman et al 2015 this adjustment was based on the fact that maniruzzaman et al 2015 used 46 days as the length from transplanting to flowering for rice yield modeling with aquacrop in bangladesh this length was close to a phenological record in lao pdr tsubo et al 2006 second to calibrate the parameters for fertility stress we used the information in shrestha et al 2013 who suggested 57 of brel when ccx reduction was 52 for modeling the fertility stress in nepal the parameter adjustments for rice yield modeling is summarized in table 1 then we checked the validity of our parameter adjustment using the monte carlo simulations with 300 sets of random daily weather series the 300 simulations were computationally efficient to have the 95 yield ranges similar to those from a much larger number of sampling attempts e g 1000 simulations while they were more rigorous than kindred studies e g han and ines 2017 capa morocho et al 2016 it should be noted that the minimum risk transplanting dates does not require exact yield ranges but how they vary with time for the validation we assumed that the probabilities of above normal p pan near normal p pnn and below normal p pbn are all equal at 33 3 for the random weather generation i e historical weather variability was assumed the required soil properties for yield simulations were set using the 10 km resolution global soil dataset by han et al 2019 table 2 the monte carlo tests were conducted under four fertility scenarios made to consider the study of inthavong et al 2014 using the conventional soil nutrient model of janssen et al 1990 inthavong et al 2014 estimated rice yields in savannakhet under the standard fertilizer rates 60 n 13 p 16 k kg ha 1 around 3 000 mg ha 1 they also found that the yield reduction by nutrient deficiency was predicted negligible 4 when applying six times of the standard fertilizer rates while it would reach 74 with no fertilizer application when applying three times of the standard rates the reduction was predicted 22 approximately the yield reductions under zero one three and six times of the standard fertilizer rates given in inthavong et al 2014 approximately correspond to the very poor about half near optimal and non limiting fertilizing options in aquacrop based on the corresponding yield reductions we hence compared the simulated yields by aquacrop under the four management options to the outcomes of inthavong et al 2014 the monte carolo simulations showed that the simulated yields by adjusted aquacrop parameters agreed acceptably with the outcomes of inthavong et al 2014 table 3 after the comparative validation of a priori parameters we quantified climatic risks associated with rice productivity by changing the timing of transplanting we evaluated the climatic risks using the same monte carlo simulations with transplanting dates from june 14th to july 14th the climate risk of each transplanting date was measured by the difference between 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles of the resultant simulated yields we repeated the same stochastic evaluations using several sets of pan pnn and pbn forecasts and discussed how the climate risk could be managed by controlling the transplanting timing transplanting for the study site 3 results 3 1 climatic risks associated with timing of transplanting fig 3 illustrates daily variations of p and the reference et eto calculated with the power data while the daily p substantially fluctuates from 0 to 80 mm d 1 the daily eto has varied within a narrow range of 2 5 mm d 1 during the rice growing season as described earlier the rainfed rice has generally been planted from june to october during the growing period the monthly p increases from june and peaks in august 238 6 344 2 mm month 1 and it declines to october 101 3 mm month 1 on the contrary the monthly eto and air temperature were stable around 110 mm month 1 and 26 c during the five months fig 3 confirms that the primary climatic risk at the study site is the variability in daily p the boxplots in fig 4 illustrate the average stress coefficients for canopy expansion and stomatal closure under the about half fertility scenario from the monte carlo simulations with aquacrop and the climate data the upper bounds of the whiskers show that the effects of water stress on canopy expansion declined as the transplanting timing is postponed in trade off delaying the transplanting timing would lead to more frequent stomatal closure after full foliage development the former reduces tr in the early season while the latter exerts influences on tr and hi the yield simulations with the random weather series could provide strategies to balance between the two responses to water stress fig 5 displays the yields variations for each transplanting date when pan pnn and pbn were all equal at 33 3 i e historical weather variability the monte carlo simulations confirmed that fertility stress is another dominant control of monsoonal rice yields at the study site inthavong et al 2014 the simulated yields under the near optimal and the half fertility scenarios i e the standard fertilizer rates were about 80 and a half of the attainable yield under non limiting fertility respectively fig 5a and c under the very poor fertility scenario the 97 5 percentiles of the simulated yields never exceeded 1 500 mg ha 1 and the range between the two percentiles became very small 0 179 mg ha 1 suggesting that the weather variability is a minor control of rice productivity when fertility stress is very severe the transplanting timing seems to be an important farming decision due to the rainfed environment in fig 5 the 97 5 percentiles under the four fertility scenarios were almost constant this implies that abnormally wet climates allow the plant to reach the attainable productivity under each fertility scenario irrespective of the transplanting timing the median yields close to the 97 5 percentiles indicate that general climate conditions are favorably wet for rice planting at the study field however the 2 5 percentiles that would be simulated under abnormally dry conditions showed a convex response to the transplanting timing under the non limiting fertility scenario july 1st was the optimal timing to minimize the yield variation being coincident with the farming tradition in savannakhet inthavong et al 2011 perhaps local farmers might have used their long term experiences on weather variability to find the transplanting timing for risk minimization transplanting timing earlier or later than july 1st was likely to expose the plant to high water stress risks during the growing season on the other hand the minimum risk transplanting timing was earlier than july 1st under the near optimal and about half fertility scenarios fig 5b and c the minimum variation of the simulated yields was found on june 27th and june 19th under the two fertility scenarios respectively this is explained by considering the foliage expansion delayed by nutrient deficiency since it takes longer for the fertility stressed plant to fully develop its foliage than under the non limiting fertility scenario an earlier transplanting could shift the timing of full foliage development and reduce water stress risks nonetheless if nutrient deficiency is too severe and shortens the growing length of the plant the transplanting timing should rather be delayed for minimizing water stress risks fig 5d the very poor fertility scenario was the case that triggers early senescence with the shortened growing length the best transplanting timing was july 9th by which a fertility stressed rice could fully developed its foliage development in the middle of august 3 2 the minimum risk transplanting date for hypothetical forecasts although pan pnn pbn 33 3 was assumed fig 5 implicates that pbn is the key information to manage the water stress risk from climatic variability regardless of the fertility scenarios the variations of simulated yields were mostly determined by the 2 5 percentiles in other words local farmers question in a preseason would be whether p is below average during the upcoming growing season we hence examined how a dry climate forecast could affect the minimum risk transplanting date using the same monte carlo framework typically in a multi model forecast project a set of pan pnn and pbn is given by dividing the number of climate models predicting each category by the total number of participating models e g min et al 2017 since the chaotic nature of atmospheric processes often lead the climate models to divergent forecasts steinschneider et al 2012 a hypothetical set of pan 20 pnn 30 and pbn 50 can be considered a forecast fairly skewed to a dry climate when the hypothetical forecast was imposed only on the weather series in june i e pan pnn pbn 33 3 were still fixed for july august and september the minimum risk transplanting date under the non limiting fertility stress was five day earlier than the case of pbn pnn pan 33 3 and the minimum yield variation was slightly raised to 1 256 mg ha 1 6 owing to the increased water stress risk in june fig 6a the traditional transplanting timing too was unlikely to pose a large increase in the yield variability however when the dry climate forecast was assumed to last from june to july fig 6b the minimum yield variation increased to 1 996 mg ha 1 68 6 and the corresponding transplanting timing was july 4th indicating that a delayed transplanting seems necessary to avoid high water stress risks during canopy expansion when the dry climate was assumed to persist from june to august delaying the transplanting timing seems to provide a clear benefit for risk reduction the minimum yield variation was rather smaller than the case of two month dry climates due to the assumed retrieval of dry climate in september however the risk reduction from controlling the transplanting timing would not be very high if the dry climate last from june to september fig 6d when considering the effects of fertility stress the minimum risk transplanting timing would be around the conventional transplanting date fig 7 however delaying the transplanting timing could decrease the median yields due to the combined effect of fertility and water stresses under the about half fertility scenario i e the standard fertilizer levels the monte carlo simulations seem to strongly recommend the traditional transplanting timing to minimize the climatic risk in the case that dry climate lasts from june to september the median yield and the 2 5 percentile decreased sensitively by delaying the transplanting 3 3 assessing the climatic risk for a forecasted el niño event it is well known that a warm phase of the el niño southern oscillation makes the walker circulation downwelling around southeast asia and thereby causes long dry spells and below average p the proposed framework could allow users to assess this known risk in a quantitative manner the biggest el niño in the 2010s occurred in 2015 and the apec climate center provided the one month lead forecasts for this event as in table 4 the given tercile probabilities indicate below average p for june through october except august giving a clear signal of dry climate during the growing season we generated 300 synthetic weather series using the tercile probabilities and simulated rice yields under the four fertility scenarios fig 8 depicts the resultant risk assessment from the given probabilistic forecasts when fertility stress is nil the yield variation was minimized at the timing slightly earlier than july 1st while the median yields showed a clear convex response to changing transplanting dates a slight change from the minimum risk transplanting date could require a high risk of yield loss due to the given above average p forecast in august the near optimal and the half fertility scenarios on the other hand suggested earlier transplanting than under the non limiting fertility scenario fig 8b and c as expected the growing length shortened by very severe fertility stress requires a transplanting later than the farming tradition fig 6d the monte carlo simulations for the 2015 el niño event suggests that missing the minimum risk could lead to substantial reduction in the expected rice yields i e the median yield the climate forecasts recommend in hindsight that farmers could have small chances to alleviate the impact of expected dry climates by increasing probabilities of relatively large p in the middle of the growing season such a farm level strategy to increase expected yield would be more effective under better nutrient management in the case of severe fertility stresses there would be little change to raise the expected yield by adjusting the transplanting timing owing to the delayed foliage development 4 discussion and conclusions our case study could be viewed as a variation of the framework proposed by han and ines 2017 capa morocho et al 2016 and apipattanavis et al 2010 but was more focused on risks associated with a specific farming decision by linking advanced crop models and weather generators the prior studies were possible to forecast the ranges crop yields and economic gains under determined farming practices however farmers precision decisions could change the yield predictions kim and kaluarachchi 2016 blanco gutiérrez et al 2013 the yield simulations with the equal terciles in this work highlight that the conventional transplanting timing could minimize the worst outcomes from climatic variability under non limiting fertility if fertility stress delays canopy expansion however a transplanting about 5 10 days earlier than the farming tradition would minimize the risk in the case that a severe fertility stress shortens the growing length e g no fertilizer applications the transplanting timing needs to be rather delayed about 10 days for minimizing the combined effects of water and fertility stress those strategies could prevent severe yield losses from potential dry climates the monte carlo tests with the tercile information changing over the growing season showed that the risk of dry climates could be managed by controlling the timing of transplanting while the prior attempts that combined climate forecasts and crop models provided a single set of distributional outcomes our case study highlights that the outcomes could be altered by practical farming decisions considerably when the climate forecasts are considered the minimum risk transplanting dates could be pinpointed such as the el niño case a well predicted duration of dry climate could have a potential to reduce water stress risks rather than the categorical climate itself this finding might suggest a practical direction in refining the outputs of gcms our approach focused on a specific farming decision could be extended to develop other management strategies such as water and land allocations e g kim and kaluarachchi 2016 the simplicity of aquacrop and the non parametric weather generator may ease such an expansion nonetheless this study includes several caveats first aquacrop could be too simple to formulate specific fertilizing strategies though we linked the hypothetical fertility controls of the aquacrop to the experimental study of inthavong et al 2014 specific nutrient application practices corresponding to the categorical fertility levels remains still elusive aquacrop is an engineering type model that depends on a mixture of well established general theories being meant to be only functional steduto et al 2009 its primary focus is generic responses of a chosen crop to water stress second the minimum risk transplanting is not intended to make high returns but for reduction of potential climatic risks for instance our ad hoc simulation for the 2015 el niño event using the observed weathers under the half fertility scenario provided 3 185 mg ha 1 with the minimum transplanting date while it was 3 354 mg ha 1 when july 1st was used instead the ex post difference between the simulated yields is not a loss but a cost required for the risk reduction in conclusion this study exemplified how to tailor seasonal climate forecasts to a specific farming decision using ready to use data and the crop model validated by a priori information they might not be as reliable as local weather observations and a crop model validated by experimental plots but nonetheless are not subject to the data latency and the expensive costs for laborious experimentations thus the proposed approach might be practical in underdeveloped locations under low data availability obviously further efforts are necessary for refining our approaches they may include improving climate

9917,soil salinization seriously threats the sustainability of agriculture in irrigation districts in arid and semi arid regions unreasonable land consolidation aimed to increase cultivated land by developing uncultivated land makes soil salinization more serious in irrigation districts in the northwest of china the uncultivated land serves as the salt discharge area which is necessary for cultivated land with reasonable area excavation depth and spatial allocation therefore this study aims to optimize the allocation of salt discharge areas based on soil water and salt movements simulated by sahysmod choosing yinchuan north irrigation district as a case study in the northwest of china results showed that sahysmod was an effective tool to simulate soil water and salt movements between cultivated land and salt discharge areas the parameters of optimum allocations including excavation depths of salt discharge areas and area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas indicated the negative and positive effects of power functions on soil salinity of cultivated land respectively in this case study an excavation depth of 0 3 m the area ratio of 1 5 and salt discharge areas located in the southwest and northeast were more conducive and cost effective in terms of removing soil salinity of cultivated land moreover the average soil salinity of cultivated land by optimum allocation was reduced to 1 2 ds m compared with 2 7 ds m by original allocation in 2027 it proved that the reasonable allocation of salt discharge areas was very important to address soil salinization of cultivated land and ensure its sustainable utilization which provided a theoretical basis and technical guide for the allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation in the arid irrigation districts graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil water and salt movement optimum allocation land consolidation irrigation district sahysmod 1 introduction high soil salinity is a major factor that reduces crop growth and productivity worldwide hassani et al 2020 china as the highest area of salt affected lands with 211 74 mha is faced with serious threats table 1 yinchuan north irrigation district ynid is one of the key areas of land consolidation and high standard irrigated farmland which plays a key role in the agricultural production of arid and semi arid regions in the northwest of china however the characteristics of climate inadequate irrigation and unreasonable drainage cause soil salinization in the ynid li et al 2018 dong et al 2020 more importantly due to the blind land consolidation aim to increase areas of cultivated land soil salinization of cultivated land is increasingly serious in ynid zhang 2012 in order to ensure sustainable land use traditionally strategies to address soil salinization problem have often focused on irrigation and drainage managements in land consolidation although these strategies may be efficient in combating the problems of soil salinization of cultivated land the previous study huang et al 2020 has proved that severe soil salinization can not be completely improved depending solely on irrigation and drainage managements in the water and salt constrained region without changing land use allocations the reason is that to supply the cultivated land and ensure national food security land consolidation aims to increase newly cultivated land areas by developing uncultivated land a large amount of the low lying uncultivated land has been reclaimed as cultivated land by land consolidation however the discharge outlets of water or salt from cultivated land have not been allocated besides the amount of irrigation doesn t support agricultural productions of all cultivated land in the region with water and salt constraints the blindly increased cultivated land results in the unreasonable allocation of uncultivated land and unsustainable land use therefore whether the newly or originally cultivated land soil salinization is increasingly serious actually the uncultivated land as salt discharge areas plays a key role in controlling salinization of cultivated land in the region therefore the methods to control salinization of cultivated land must be effective sustainable and more importantly the allocation of cultivated land and salt discharge areas must be optimum in land consolidation under water and salt constraints the nature of the allocation of salt discharge areas is an optimization of a dry drainage system namely extracting water and salt from cultivated land to neighboring salt discharge areas sotoodehnia et al 2012 it can be used as an effective alternative approach for salinity control in the region with water and salt constraints as shown in table 2 simulation of water and salt balances and evaluation of the effectiveness of a dry drainage system on soil salinity control have been discussed and tested in recent studies for example wang et al 2019 proved the fallow areas could act as a drainage repository to receive excess water and salt from surrounding irrigated cultivated land from 2007 to 2011 moreover the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas can ensure sustainable land use and prevent secondary salinization of cultivated land finally the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas is also environmentally friendly salt discharge areas in a dry drainage system not only control the soil salinity of cultivated land but also reduce the amount of irrigation in the irrigation district unfortunately the parameters of the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation including the area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas the excavation depth and location layout of salt discharge areas have not been reported to date based on the different allocation scenarios of salt discharge areas the optimum allocation scheme along with a numerical model has little attention as shown in table 3 diverse mathematical models have been used for water and salinity managements including numerical models and mass balance models however the numerical models such as hydrus singh 2019 and swap van dam et al 1997 have limits in the application of this study for the numerical models fine spatial discretization and small time steps are always needed to obtain accurate results which may result in high computational costs especially for long term and large scale modeling setting up the numerical models also requires intensive hydrogeological information which is not always available in practice zhu et al 2013 mass balance models are not subject to the problems above for numerical models sun et al 2019 moreover balance models such as sahysmod can describe the key process of irrigation and drainage managements in different land use types and vegetation components therefore the different boundary conditions of cultivated land and salt discharge areas by the model can be provided consequently sahysmod oosterbaan 2005 is selected to evaluate different allocation scenarios of salt discharge areas for solving the problem of soil salinization in the irrigation district the main objective of the present study was to quantify the effectiveness of the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in controlling soil salinization and ensuring sustainable utilization of cultivated land therefore the water and salt balances in a typical region of ynid were built by sahysmod future groundwater table and soil salinity of cultivated land and salt discharge areas under various allocation scenarios would be simulated by sahysmod respectively whether the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas could remove excess salt and ensure sustainable utilization of cultivated land were evaluated optimum allocation parameters of salt discharge areas in land consolidation for the control of soil salinization including the area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas the excavation depth and spatial layout of salt discharge areas were recommended 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study is conducted in a typical region of ynid xidatan 38 47 58 n 38 49 47 n 106 24 48 e 106 26 10 e which is situated in ningxia hui nationality autonomous region china fig 1 it is one of key areas of land consolidation in china with water and salt constraints a large area of highly saline sodic soil exists in the field the blind land consolidation aimed to increase areas of cultivated land results in the increasing soil salinization indicating soil salinity of 0 14 5 50 ds m in the root zone yellow river and drainage reuse have supported agricultural productions in the study area with an irrigation amount of 671 mm per year because of the drainage reuse the salinity of irrigation water is high indicating electrical conductivity of 1 05 ds m considering agricultural and ecological developments of the whole basin and downstream areas irrigation from yellow river to the study area has been gradually reduced and then the low lying cultivated land with serious soil salinization is abandoned climate is arid with potential evaporation of 1502 mm per year and precipitation of 210 mm per year in the study area the groundwater table is closer to the surface accompanied with poor irrigation and drainage managements 2 2 soil sampling a 240 m grid sampling strategy was used to characterize soil salinity which was implemented by the fishnet tool of arcgis 10 0 esri inc redlands ca usa 70 locations were sampled at the depths of 0 30 and 30 50 cm soil samples were collected in may october of 2015 and 2016 and may of 2017 each composite soil sample comprised four core subsamples that were collected at a distance of 5 m north south east and west of the center sampling points the soil samples were crushed and mixed together to form one sample soil samples were dried and ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve next the ground and sieved soil samples were mixed with water at a 1 soil sample 5 water ratio at a temperature of 25 the leaking liquid was extracted to measure the soil electrical conductivity as detailed in the analysis methods of soil agricultural chemistry lu 2000 ec1 5 ec of 1 5 soil water paste extract and soil salinity were usually highly correlated and the former was often used as a surrogate for the latter visconti et al 2010 then soil salinity was measured using ec1 5 and was converted to ece ec of saturated soil paste extract using the relationship between ece ds m and ec1 5 ds m in the study area huang et al 2020 in addition soil water content soil texture bulk density field water capacity groundwater salinity and water table were measured irrigation and drainage managements were obtained by field investigations 2 3 allocation theory of salt discharge areas optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation is capable of maintaining water table at a desired level and soil salinity to an extent that crops can be grown economically if designed properly heuperman et al 2002 as shown in fig 2 there is a vertical flow i e irrigation water applied to cultivated land and evapotranspiration from adjacent salt discharge areas and a horizontal flow between the neighboring cultivated land and salt discharge areas the groundwater system provides the pathway for the movement of excessive irrigation water from cultivated land to salt discharge areas first in the irrigated cultivated land soil salinization due to salt introduction by the irrigation water and the upward movement of salt from the groundwater is prevented by the application of sufficient water to leach the salt down through the profile and into the groundwater below second the groundwater salt concentration below the irrigated area increases as a result of leaching the groundwater table in salt discharge areas falls with the aid of evaporation resulting in hydraulic gradients and groundwater exchanges between cultivated land and salt discharge areas finally through the appropriate design of the salt discharge areas these excessive leached salts from the irrigated cultivated land will eventually remain in the soil zone of salt discharge areas with the aid of the evaporation condition water and salt balances in cultivated land can be maintained in other words the cultivated land and salt discharge areas are sources and sinks of soil salinity respectively which are economically feasible in the soil salinized regions with the water constraint konukcu et al 2006 2 4 sahysmod sahysmod is a computer program for prediction of soil salinity drainage water and groundwater table based on different water and salinity managements yao et al 2014 2017 which has been widely used to understand the intricate interactions between soil salinity and water management practices it consists of three parts the first is an agronomic water balance model saltmod which calculates for each polygon the downward and or upward water fluxes in the soil profile depending on the fluctuations of the groundwater table the second part is a nodal groundwater model standard groundwater model package sgmp which calculates the groundwater flows into and from each polygon and the groundwater levels per polygon the first and second parts interact as they influence each other the third part is a salt balance model which runs parallel to the water balance model and determines the salt concentrations in the soil profile oosterbaan 2005 the detailed description of sahysmod can be found by references sahysmod working group of ilri 2005 singh and panda 2012 considering the different land use types soil salinity irrigation and drainage managements 98 internal number 1 98 it represented the study area and 40 external number 99 138 it represented boundary conditions networks were divided by sahysmod each of 270 270 m2 size on a scale of 1 20 000 fig s1 supplementary data if there were two or more crop types e g maize and rice in fig 1 in a grid the parameters e g irrigation volume in the grid could be calculated by occupying area proportions of the crops as shown in fig 1 the boundary of the study area was surrounded by irrigation and drainage ditches according to the previous study inam et al 2017 the boundary condition of the study area was the fixed head boundary condition to illustrate the sustainable utilization of cultivated land sahysmod would be run for a period of 10 years i e from 2018 to 2027 to predict soil and water salinity balances average annual rainfall and evaporation for the past 10 years were 210 and 1502 mm respectively the rainfall occurred in season 1 from may to september was 185 mm whereas the amount in season 2 from october to april was 25 mm the evaporation occurred in the season 1 and 2 was 917 mm and 585 mm respectively when spatial allocations by sahysmod it was believed that evaporation mainly occurred in salt discharge areas and irrigation only applied to cultivated land the groundwater table and salinity in the study area were collected by monitoring the groundwater observation wells for many years thicknesses of the surface reservoir root zone transition zone and aquifer zone in sahysmod were defined based on the definition from sahysmod working group of ilri 2005 the surface reservoir was regarded as 0 m in the study area the root zone corresponded to the depth of soil from which evapotranspiration of crops took place as shown in fig 1 the major crop grown in the study area was maize and the average length of maize root was 0 3 m thus we considered the thickness of the root zone as 0 3 m transition zone was the zone between the root zone and aquifer and its lower limit could be fixed at the annually greatest depth to water table sahysmod working group of ilri 2005 according to the previous study sun 2011 the greatest depths of water table in the cultivated land and salt discharge areas during the non growth period were 2 0 m and 1 8 m respectively when the greatest depths of water table 2 0 and 1 8 m minus the thickness of the root zone 0 3 m the thicknesses of the transition layer in the cultivated land and salt discharge areas were determined as 1 7 m and 1 5 m respectively based on the previous study lu 2010 the thickness of aquifer zone in the study area was approximate 20 m the main input data of sahysmod included meteorological data groundwater properties soil properties crop parameters irrigation and drainage managements the main output data of sahysmod comprising soil salinity drainage groundwater salinity and groundwater table could be given for each season of any year the spatial variation of soil properties including initial soil salinity of root zone and transition zone total porosity and effective porosity of the root zone field capacity and soil bulk density was taken into account an overview of the collected regional information and its sources in the study area was provided in tables s1 s3 and fig s2 supplementary data parameters of the sahysmod in 2015 2016 were used as calibration and in 2017 were used as validation 2 5 design for allocations of salt discharge areas sahysmod need calibration and validation before application in a variety of allocated scenarios of salt discharge areas a companion paper presented the results dealing with the calibration validation error analysis and sensitivity analysis of the model parameters huang et al 2020 and was not discussed here the effects of spatial allocations of cultivated land and salt discharge areas on the future soil salinization of cultivated land were presented in this paper in the present study the areas of cultivated land and salt discharge areas were 4 90 km2 and 1 99 km2 respectively fig 1 if the area of cultivated land or salt discharge areas in a grid was more than half the land use type in the grid was considered as cultivated land or salt discharge areas then there were 70 and 28 grids of cultivated land and salt discharge areas respectively fig 3 thus the area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas was 2 5 when allocations were simulated by sahysmod the area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas lc d excavation depth di and layout of salt discharge areas were considered and other parameters were regarded as unchanged different allocations were described in the following sections optimum area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas must be established so that the area of cultivated land was maximized the different area ratios were summarized in table 4 the areas of 2 30 3 45 4 13 4 60 4 90 and 5 16 km2 of the cultivated land were allocated the areas of 4 59 3 45 2 76 2 30 1 99 and 1 72 km2 of the salt discharge areas respectively the corresponding values of lc d equaled to 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 respectively therefore we could select the most suitable answer which was the highest ratio of lc d that could maintain future soil salinity of cultivated land at a desired level based on the field survey the average excavation depth of the low lying salt discharge areas was approximate 0 2 m in order to analyze the effects of excavation depths on soil salinity of cultivated land and establish a function to describe the effects excavation depths of 0 001 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 8 m were simulated by sahysmod considering the cost effective and environmentally friendly options di should be as minimized as possible in the optimum allocation as shown in fig 1 salt discharge areas mainly located in the southwest of the study area the location layout of salt discharge areas effected the ability of drainage salt water in order to investigate the effects of different layouts of salt discharge areas on soil salinity the salt discharge areas that located in the northeast middle and scattered in the study area would be simulated by sahysmod fig 3 2 6 evaluation of the optimum allocation in the present study evaluation indexes for the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation were selected including soil salinity soil salinization salt removing rate difference degree of soil salinization environmental effects and economic benefits soil salinity can be expressed as follows 1 u 1 j i 1 j u i where u is the average soil salinity of cultivated land or salt discharge areas ds m u i is the soil salinity of cultivated land or salt discharge areas in the ith grid j is the total number of grids of cultivated land or salt discharge areas in the present study j values of cultivated land and salt discharge areas were 70 and 28 respectively moreover in order to evaluate the sustainable utilization of cultivated land soil salinization salt removing rate is used to describe the change of soil salinity in the predicted years relative to a base year 2 z k m u i k u i m u i m where z k m is the soil salinization salt removing rate u i k is soil salinity of the ith grid in kth year ds m u i m is soil salinity of the ith grid in mth year ds m and m is the base year if z k m 0 it shows the soil salinity is accumulated and then z k m represents the soil salinization rate otherwise it represents the salt removing rate and cultivated land can be sustainably used in order to compare different allocations of salt discharge areas the difference degree of soil salinization g is used to indicate the relative changes of soil salinity under different allocations it can be expressed as follows 3 g u b u b u b where u b is the average value of soil salinity of cultivated land or salt discharge areas after the optimum allocation ds m u b is the average value of soil salinity of cultivated land or salt discharge areas before the optimum allocation ds m if g 0 it shows the allocation is optimum the greater the absolute value of g the more the soil salinity of cultivated land is reduced by the optimum allocation in land consolidation if g 0 it suggests the allocation is not optimum moreover environmental effects and economic benefits should be considered the allocation should be carried out at a minimum possible cost a maximized area of cultivated land and with minimum negative environmental effects in land consolidation 3 results 3 1 effect of different area ratios on soil salinity as shown in fig 4 soil salinity of cultivated land was plotted against the area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas lc d for different excavation depths di it could be seen from the figure that lc d increased the soil salinity of cultivated land indicated the increase of a power function it was clear that with allocation of more land to salt discharge areas in land consolidation it could be more conducive to transport excessive salts from cultivated land to salt discharge areas then soil salinization of cultivated land was improved 3 2 effect of different excavation depths of salt discharge areas on soil salinity fig 4 revealed that soil salinity of cultivated land was a power function decrease along with the increase of the excavation depths of salt discharge areas whether at the 5th year or 10th year it suggested the increased excavation depth played an important role in reducing the soil salinity of cultivated land this was due to a salt balance in which the salt of cultivated land transferred to the salt discharge areas moreover it could be seen from fig 4 that the effects of different area ratios lc d and excavation depths di on soil salinity of cultivated land u at 5th and 10th years could be described as 4 u 1 45 2 68 di 0 5 0 83 lc d 0 5 5 u 2 84 4 67 di 0 5 1 15 lc d 0 5 as shown in eqs 4 and 5 it was clear that the effects of different area ratios on soil salinity were relatively smaller compared with the effects of excavation depths the soil salinization of cultivated land was more serious at the 10th year compared with 5th year in this study di 0 3 m and lc d 1 5 were enough to provide the values of soil salinity 1 7 ds m in the cultivated land in the next 10 years which ensured the sustainable utilization of cultivated land allen et al 1998 pointed out that maize yields started to reduce when soil salinity was 1 7 ds m according to the field survey fig 1 the major crop grown in the study area was maize therefore the excavation depth of 0 3 m and area ratio of 1 5 in land consolidation could be considered as the optimum allocation in terms of a minimum cost of the work for excavation a maximized area of cultivated land and sustainable crop production 3 3 effect of layouts of salt discharge areas on soil salinity based on the original allocation i e lc d 2 5 di 0 2 m when the salt discharge areas scattered across cultivated land the increase of soil salinity in cultivated land was the smallest fig 5a the value of g1 was less than 0 and the absolute value of the g1 was the largest in the next 10 years fig 5b therefore the scattered distribution of salt discharge areas was the most conducive to slow down soil salinization of cultivated land when the salt discharge areas located in the middle of the study area the value of g2 was less than 0 fig 5b which showed the layout of salt discharge areas was more optimum compared with the original layout southwest when the salt discharge areas located in the northeast the soil salinization of cultivated land was the most serious in the next 10 years fig 5 this indicated the abilities to control soil salinity of salt discharge areas in the northeast were weaker compared with other layouts e g southwest the main reason was the southwest of the study area was more low lying compared with the northeast as a result it further showed that the low lying salt discharge areas were more conducive to the effects of accumulating salt it was worth noting when the allocations of area ratios and excavation depths were not optimized although the layouts of salt discharge areas were optimized the soil salinization of cultivated land was still serious it exhibited the values of soil salinity 1 7 ds m in the next 10 years fig 5 it illustrated that concurrent optimization of the layouts of salt discharge areas the area ratios and excavation depths was necessary to control soil salinization and ensure sustainable utilization of cultivated land the effective distances of salt discharge areas should be considered when allocating the salt discharge areas in land consolidation it was evident that the scattered and middle distributions of salt discharge areas could ensure that the most of salt discharge areas were satisfied within the effective distances of removed salt then the abilities of controlling soil salinity were improved it was worth noting that the adverse effects of scattered distribution of salt discharge areas on irrigation and drainage managements should be considered therefore in terms of optimizing layouts of salt discharge areas not only the abilities to control soil salinity by salt discharge areas should be considered but also the adverse effects should be concerned as shown in fig 6 when salt discharge areas located in the middle of the study area soil salinity of the salt discharge areas continuously increased from 2016 to 2027 moreover there was an obvious rule that soil salinity of salt discharge areas decreased with the distances from cultivated land at different years in other words salt discharge areas near the cultivated land suffered from more serious soil salinization compared with the areas far away from the cultivated land the main reason was when the salt discharge areas near the cultivated land soil salinity of the cultivated land was more conducive to introduce to the salt discharge areas when the salt discharge areas far away from the cultivated land their abilities to control soil salinity were influenced then the introduced soil salinity to salt discharge areas was reduced finally the ranges of soil salinity in different grids were 2 40 3 99 6 59 10 93 and 11 02 11 86 ds m in 2018 2022 and 2027 respectively fig 6 it was evident that the ranges increased from 2018 to 2022 and then decreased from 2022 to 2027 which suggested the soil salinization of salt discharge areas was gradually serious whether the salt discharge areas near or far away from the cultivated land as time went on it also indicated that the layouts of salt discharge areas in land consolidation affected not only the allocation system effectiveness but also allocation system aging and lifetime 3 4 3 4 comparison of different allocations in land consolidation based on the comprehensive consideration of soil salinity u soil salinization salt removing rate z difference degree of soil salinization g environmental effects and economic benefits parameters of the optimum allocation were determined table 5 the layouts of salt discharge areas by the original and optimum allocations were shown in fig 7 generally speaking the cultivated land with very serious soil salinization was first considered as abandoned land and then used as salt discharge areas in optimum allocation as a result salt discharge areas by the optimum allocation located in the southwest and northeast fig 7 thus the 2 76 km2 of salt discharge areas would be allocated with 4 13 km2 of cultivated land and the area ratio was reduced from 2 5 to 1 5 moreover the irrigation amount of cultivated land was reduced from 342 41 105 m3 to 288 60 105 m3 as the decrease of areas of cultivated land in order to illustrate the sustainable utilization of cultivated land the soil salinity of cultivated land and salt discharge areas were predicted in the next 10 years respectively fig 8 based on different allocations soil salinity of cultivated land and salt discharge areas increased year by year soil salinity of cultivated land was nearly 2 7 ds m by the original allocation figs 8a and 1 2 ds m by the optimum allocation fig 8b at the 10th year generally the maize yields started to reduce when soil salinity was 1 7 ds m allen et al 1998 therefore the maize could grow normally in the next 10 years by the optimum allocation which ensured the sustainable utilization of cultivated land as shown in fig 8c the values of g were less than 0 which suggested soil salinity was reduced by the optimum allocation compared with the original allocation the absolute value of g in cultivated land increased year by year according to an explanation of eq 3 the increased the absolute value of g the more the soil salinity of cultivated land was reduced by the optimum allocation therefore the proposed allocation in the study area was optimum as shown in fig 9 a c the spatial distributions of soil salinity were similar at different years the higher soil salinity generally distributed in the west and east of the study area where were mostly salt discharge areas the lower soil salinity mainly distributed in the middle of the study area where were mostly cultivated land furthermore as shown in fig 9d based on the original allocation the range of z value was 0 17 20 23 it suggested soil salinization was more serious in 2027 compared with 2016 as shown in fig 9e the range of z value was 0 23 11 33 which suggested that the part of cultivated land by the optimum allocation still occurred the salt removing in 2027 compared with in 2016 as shown in fig 9f z values were less than 0 which showed that in 2027 the soil salinity of cultivated land was removed by the optimum allocation compared with the original allocation it suggested that the salt discharge areas by the optimum allocation helped to lessen the salt load of the irrigated cultivated land in the next 10 years 4 discussion ynid had the characteristics of solving the problem of soil salinization of cultivated land by the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation first soil salinization in the low lying land was more serious and caused a reduction in crop yield this made some farmers abandon the low lying cultivated land and then the abandoned land could be used as sinks to store excessive salts this fact increased salinity in the salt discharge areas and reduced salinity in the cultivated land second the main source of irrigation water was the yellow river diversion however considering agricultural and ecological developments of the whole basin and downstream areas the amount of yellow river diversion in ynid had been gradually reduced and irrigation water of cultivated land was constrained the irrigation development possibility was not provided in all segments and some lands without irrigation were abandoned third the typical climate characteristic of ynid high evaporation and low precipitation was also beneficial to the salt accumulation of salt discharge areas finally the differences of height between low lying salt discharge areas and cultivated land were significant in the study area in land consolidation retaining the low lying land not only was cost effective and environmentally friendly options but also guaranteed the hydraulic gradient and groundwater exchange between salt discharge areas and cultivated land therefore the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas was an effective measure to lessen the salt load of cultivated land in ynid under water and salt constraints the effectiveness of the allocation was higher where salt discharge areas were larger i e 1 5 instead of 2 5 for area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas growing and wyseure 1992 also suggested an approximately equal area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas whereas khouri 1998 stated that a ratio of less than 2 satisfied the leaching requirement konukcu et al 2006 suggested that the area ratio was 1 25 different area ratios may attribute to different regional characteristics with various land use types water table climate and crop types the increased excavation depths of salt discharge areas had important effects on lowering soil salinity of cultivated land but the cost of earth works for the excavation should be considered in the study area an excavation depth of 0 3 m was required khouri 1998 also stated that an excavation depth of 0 3 m in the salt discharge areas could accelerate the upward flux the design requirement for the allocation was that the water table was shallow it was not expected that a larger excavation depth was required to enhance the evaporation finally it was worth noting that both soil salinity and sodicity problem existed in the study area however the effects of exchangeable na sodium on water and salt movements have not been investigated by the model the effects of exchangeable na on water movement and evaporation in the salt discharge area will be monitored and then the further effects on system performance will be analyzed in the next research the salt discharge areas acted as sinks for excessive salts transported with the groundwater depending on the evaporation rate the excess water was evaporated and the salt was accumulated on the surface of salt discharge areas the evaporation rate was reduced with increasing salt on the soil surface of salt discharge areas hassan and ghaibeh 1977 khouri 1998 then the amount of soil salinity accumulating in salt discharge areas was limited therefore the evaporation rate required to be enhanced or maintained before the regeneration of allocation khouri 1998 the main concern for the management of salt discharge areas was how to increase or at least maintain the evaporation rate from the soil surface of salt discharge areas soil texture significantly affected the rate of evaporation the fine soil had a larger capillary rise and as a result more water was available for evaporation levy et al 2005 bagarello et al 2006 konukcu et al 2006 also indicated the coarser the texture the larger would be the sink area and the higher the silt content the smaller the sink area for the same water table depth evaporation can be improved by replacing the top soil layer with soil of finer texture hassan and ghaibeh 1977 also found experimentally that the presence of a fine textured soil above a coarse textured soil increased the evaporation rate beyond that of the coarse soil although the optimum allocation was more effective compared with the artificial drainage the artificial drainage still needed to be established in the study area the reason was that soil texture in the study area may result in weak hydraulic conductivity which required that the artificial drainage adequately guaranteed the water and salt transfer from cultivated land to salt discharge areas moreover the presence of a shallow saline groundwater table in the study area and greater evaporation resulted in the salt accumulation on the surface of cultivated land therefore the artificial drainage system combined with the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas could control the water table and soil salinity of cultivated land finally the attention should be paid to the balance between the allocation and land use the allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation needed a relatively high percentage of land out of the farming system so the allocation was more suitable in the regions where the land was in abundance and cheap and water was scarce and expensive 5 conclusions ynid is a typical soil salinization region with high evaporation and low precipitation and an unreasonable allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation in this study to solve soil salinization and ensure sustainable land use different allocations in land consolidation including the excavation depths of salt discharge areas di area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas lc d and layouts of salt discharge areas were simulated by sahysmod in 2018 2027 based on the simulation results of different scenarios in ynid it was apparent that sahysmod was an effective tool to simulate soil water and salt movements between cultivated land and salt discharge areas in the irrigation district the results showed that 1 different excavation depths and area ratios indicated the negative and positive effects of power functions on soil salinity of cultivated land u for example in 2027 u 2 84 4 67 di 0 5 1 15 lc d 0 5 2 the scattered distribution of salt discharge areas was more conducive to removing salt from cultivated land therefore the optimum allocation in land consolidation was closely related to the excavation depths area ratios and layouts of salt discharge areas in this study an excavation depth of 0 3 m the area ratio of 1 5 and salt discharge areas located in the southwest and northeast were more conducive in terms of removing soil salinity and considering cost effective moreover the average soil salinity of cultivated land by the optimum allocation was reduced to 1 2 ds m compared with 2 7 ds m by the original allocation in 2027 finally the optimum allocation in land consolidation suggested that salt discharge areas not only helped to lessen the salt load of cultivated land but also reduced the amount of irrigation i e from 342 41 105 m3 to 288 60 105 m3 in the study area with a water constraint therefore the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation was very important to address soil salinization of cultivated land and ensure sustainable land use especially in the arid and semi arid irrigated regions the results of this study provide a theoretical basis and technical guide for the optimum allocation of salt

9917,soil salinization seriously threats the sustainability of agriculture in irrigation districts in arid and semi arid regions unreasonable land consolidation aimed to increase cultivated land by developing uncultivated land makes soil salinization more serious in irrigation districts in the northwest of china the uncultivated land serves as the salt discharge area which is necessary for cultivated land with reasonable area excavation depth and spatial allocation therefore this study aims to optimize the allocation of salt discharge areas based on soil water and salt movements simulated by sahysmod choosing yinchuan north irrigation district as a case study in the northwest of china results showed that sahysmod was an effective tool to simulate soil water and salt movements between cultivated land and salt discharge areas the parameters of optimum allocations including excavation depths of salt discharge areas and area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas indicated the negative and positive effects of power functions on soil salinity of cultivated land respectively in this case study an excavation depth of 0 3 m the area ratio of 1 5 and salt discharge areas located in the southwest and northeast were more conducive and cost effective in terms of removing soil salinity of cultivated land moreover the average soil salinity of cultivated land by optimum allocation was reduced to 1 2 ds m compared with 2 7 ds m by original allocation in 2027 it proved that the reasonable allocation of salt discharge areas was very important to address soil salinization of cultivated land and ensure its sustainable utilization which provided a theoretical basis and technical guide for the allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation in the arid irrigation districts graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil water and salt movement optimum allocation land consolidation irrigation district sahysmod 1 introduction high soil salinity is a major factor that reduces crop growth and productivity worldwide hassani et al 2020 china as the highest area of salt affected lands with 211 74 mha is faced with serious threats table 1 yinchuan north irrigation district ynid is one of the key areas of land consolidation and high standard irrigated farmland which plays a key role in the agricultural production of arid and semi arid regions in the northwest of china however the characteristics of climate inadequate irrigation and unreasonable drainage cause soil salinization in the ynid li et al 2018 dong et al 2020 more importantly due to the blind land consolidation aim to increase areas of cultivated land soil salinization of cultivated land is increasingly serious in ynid zhang 2012 in order to ensure sustainable land use traditionally strategies to address soil salinization problem have often focused on irrigation and drainage managements in land consolidation although these strategies may be efficient in combating the problems of soil salinization of cultivated land the previous study huang et al 2020 has proved that severe soil salinization can not be completely improved depending solely on irrigation and drainage managements in the water and salt constrained region without changing land use allocations the reason is that to supply the cultivated land and ensure national food security land consolidation aims to increase newly cultivated land areas by developing uncultivated land a large amount of the low lying uncultivated land has been reclaimed as cultivated land by land consolidation however the discharge outlets of water or salt from cultivated land have not been allocated besides the amount of irrigation doesn t support agricultural productions of all cultivated land in the region with water and salt constraints the blindly increased cultivated land results in the unreasonable allocation of uncultivated land and unsustainable land use therefore whether the newly or originally cultivated land soil salinization is increasingly serious actually the uncultivated land as salt discharge areas plays a key role in controlling salinization of cultivated land in the region therefore the methods to control salinization of cultivated land must be effective sustainable and more importantly the allocation of cultivated land and salt discharge areas must be optimum in land consolidation under water and salt constraints the nature of the allocation of salt discharge areas is an optimization of a dry drainage system namely extracting water and salt from cultivated land to neighboring salt discharge areas sotoodehnia et al 2012 it can be used as an effective alternative approach for salinity control in the region with water and salt constraints as shown in table 2 simulation of water and salt balances and evaluation of the effectiveness of a dry drainage system on soil salinity control have been discussed and tested in recent studies for example wang et al 2019 proved the fallow areas could act as a drainage repository to receive excess water and salt from surrounding irrigated cultivated land from 2007 to 2011 moreover the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas can ensure sustainable land use and prevent secondary salinization of cultivated land finally the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas is also environmentally friendly salt discharge areas in a dry drainage system not only control the soil salinity of cultivated land but also reduce the amount of irrigation in the irrigation district unfortunately the parameters of the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation including the area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas the excavation depth and location layout of salt discharge areas have not been reported to date based on the different allocation scenarios of salt discharge areas the optimum allocation scheme along with a numerical model has little attention as shown in table 3 diverse mathematical models have been used for water and salinity managements including numerical models and mass balance models however the numerical models such as hydrus singh 2019 and swap van dam et al 1997 have limits in the application of this study for the numerical models fine spatial discretization and small time steps are always needed to obtain accurate results which may result in high computational costs especially for long term and large scale modeling setting up the numerical models also requires intensive hydrogeological information which is not always available in practice zhu et al 2013 mass balance models are not subject to the problems above for numerical models sun et al 2019 moreover balance models such as sahysmod can describe the key process of irrigation and drainage managements in different land use types and vegetation components therefore the different boundary conditions of cultivated land and salt discharge areas by the model can be provided consequently sahysmod oosterbaan 2005 is selected to evaluate different allocation scenarios of salt discharge areas for solving the problem of soil salinization in the irrigation district the main objective of the present study was to quantify the effectiveness of the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in controlling soil salinization and ensuring sustainable utilization of cultivated land therefore the water and salt balances in a typical region of ynid were built by sahysmod future groundwater table and soil salinity of cultivated land and salt discharge areas under various allocation scenarios would be simulated by sahysmod respectively whether the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas could remove excess salt and ensure sustainable utilization of cultivated land were evaluated optimum allocation parameters of salt discharge areas in land consolidation for the control of soil salinization including the area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas the excavation depth and spatial layout of salt discharge areas were recommended 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study is conducted in a typical region of ynid xidatan 38 47 58 n 38 49 47 n 106 24 48 e 106 26 10 e which is situated in ningxia hui nationality autonomous region china fig 1 it is one of key areas of land consolidation in china with water and salt constraints a large area of highly saline sodic soil exists in the field the blind land consolidation aimed to increase areas of cultivated land results in the increasing soil salinization indicating soil salinity of 0 14 5 50 ds m in the root zone yellow river and drainage reuse have supported agricultural productions in the study area with an irrigation amount of 671 mm per year because of the drainage reuse the salinity of irrigation water is high indicating electrical conductivity of 1 05 ds m considering agricultural and ecological developments of the whole basin and downstream areas irrigation from yellow river to the study area has been gradually reduced and then the low lying cultivated land with serious soil salinization is abandoned climate is arid with potential evaporation of 1502 mm per year and precipitation of 210 mm per year in the study area the groundwater table is closer to the surface accompanied with poor irrigation and drainage managements 2 2 soil sampling a 240 m grid sampling strategy was used to characterize soil salinity which was implemented by the fishnet tool of arcgis 10 0 esri inc redlands ca usa 70 locations were sampled at the depths of 0 30 and 30 50 cm soil samples were collected in may october of 2015 and 2016 and may of 2017 each composite soil sample comprised four core subsamples that were collected at a distance of 5 m north south east and west of the center sampling points the soil samples were crushed and mixed together to form one sample soil samples were dried and ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve next the ground and sieved soil samples were mixed with water at a 1 soil sample 5 water ratio at a temperature of 25 the leaking liquid was extracted to measure the soil electrical conductivity as detailed in the analysis methods of soil agricultural chemistry lu 2000 ec1 5 ec of 1 5 soil water paste extract and soil salinity were usually highly correlated and the former was often used as a surrogate for the latter visconti et al 2010 then soil salinity was measured using ec1 5 and was converted to ece ec of saturated soil paste extract using the relationship between ece ds m and ec1 5 ds m in the study area huang et al 2020 in addition soil water content soil texture bulk density field water capacity groundwater salinity and water table were measured irrigation and drainage managements were obtained by field investigations 2 3 allocation theory of salt discharge areas optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation is capable of maintaining water table at a desired level and soil salinity to an extent that crops can be grown economically if designed properly heuperman et al 2002 as shown in fig 2 there is a vertical flow i e irrigation water applied to cultivated land and evapotranspiration from adjacent salt discharge areas and a horizontal flow between the neighboring cultivated land and salt discharge areas the groundwater system provides the pathway for the movement of excessive irrigation water from cultivated land to salt discharge areas first in the irrigated cultivated land soil salinization due to salt introduction by the irrigation water and the upward movement of salt from the groundwater is prevented by the application of sufficient water to leach the salt down through the profile and into the groundwater below second the groundwater salt concentration below the irrigated area increases as a result of leaching the groundwater table in salt discharge areas falls with the aid of evaporation resulting in hydraulic gradients and groundwater exchanges between cultivated land and salt discharge areas finally through the appropriate design of the salt discharge areas these excessive leached salts from the irrigated cultivated land will eventually remain in the soil zone of salt discharge areas with the aid of the evaporation condition water and salt balances in cultivated land can be maintained in other words the cultivated land and salt discharge areas are sources and sinks of soil salinity respectively which are economically feasible in the soil salinized regions with the water constraint konukcu et al 2006 2 4 sahysmod sahysmod is a computer program for prediction of soil salinity drainage water and groundwater table based on different water and salinity managements yao et al 2014 2017 which has been widely used to understand the intricate interactions between soil salinity and water management practices it consists of three parts the first is an agronomic water balance model saltmod which calculates for each polygon the downward and or upward water fluxes in the soil profile depending on the fluctuations of the groundwater table the second part is a nodal groundwater model standard groundwater model package sgmp which calculates the groundwater flows into and from each polygon and the groundwater levels per polygon the first and second parts interact as they influence each other the third part is a salt balance model which runs parallel to the water balance model and determines the salt concentrations in the soil profile oosterbaan 2005 the detailed description of sahysmod can be found by references sahysmod working group of ilri 2005 singh and panda 2012 considering the different land use types soil salinity irrigation and drainage managements 98 internal number 1 98 it represented the study area and 40 external number 99 138 it represented boundary conditions networks were divided by sahysmod each of 270 270 m2 size on a scale of 1 20 000 fig s1 supplementary data if there were two or more crop types e g maize and rice in fig 1 in a grid the parameters e g irrigation volume in the grid could be calculated by occupying area proportions of the crops as shown in fig 1 the boundary of the study area was surrounded by irrigation and drainage ditches according to the previous study inam et al 2017 the boundary condition of the study area was the fixed head boundary condition to illustrate the sustainable utilization of cultivated land sahysmod would be run for a period of 10 years i e from 2018 to 2027 to predict soil and water salinity balances average annual rainfall and evaporation for the past 10 years were 210 and 1502 mm respectively the rainfall occurred in season 1 from may to september was 185 mm whereas the amount in season 2 from october to april was 25 mm the evaporation occurred in the season 1 and 2 was 917 mm and 585 mm respectively when spatial allocations by sahysmod it was believed that evaporation mainly occurred in salt discharge areas and irrigation only applied to cultivated land the groundwater table and salinity in the study area were collected by monitoring the groundwater observation wells for many years thicknesses of the surface reservoir root zone transition zone and aquifer zone in sahysmod were defined based on the definition from sahysmod working group of ilri 2005 the surface reservoir was regarded as 0 m in the study area the root zone corresponded to the depth of soil from which evapotranspiration of crops took place as shown in fig 1 the major crop grown in the study area was maize and the average length of maize root was 0 3 m thus we considered the thickness of the root zone as 0 3 m transition zone was the zone between the root zone and aquifer and its lower limit could be fixed at the annually greatest depth to water table sahysmod working group of ilri 2005 according to the previous study sun 2011 the greatest depths of water table in the cultivated land and salt discharge areas during the non growth period were 2 0 m and 1 8 m respectively when the greatest depths of water table 2 0 and 1 8 m minus the thickness of the root zone 0 3 m the thicknesses of the transition layer in the cultivated land and salt discharge areas were determined as 1 7 m and 1 5 m respectively based on the previous study lu 2010 the thickness of aquifer zone in the study area was approximate 20 m the main input data of sahysmod included meteorological data groundwater properties soil properties crop parameters irrigation and drainage managements the main output data of sahysmod comprising soil salinity drainage groundwater salinity and groundwater table could be given for each season of any year the spatial variation of soil properties including initial soil salinity of root zone and transition zone total porosity and effective porosity of the root zone field capacity and soil bulk density was taken into account an overview of the collected regional information and its sources in the study area was provided in tables s1 s3 and fig s2 supplementary data parameters of the sahysmod in 2015 2016 were used as calibration and in 2017 were used as validation 2 5 design for allocations of salt discharge areas sahysmod need calibration and validation before application in a variety of allocated scenarios of salt discharge areas a companion paper presented the results dealing with the calibration validation error analysis and sensitivity analysis of the model parameters huang et al 2020 and was not discussed here the effects of spatial allocations of cultivated land and salt discharge areas on the future soil salinization of cultivated land were presented in this paper in the present study the areas of cultivated land and salt discharge areas were 4 90 km2 and 1 99 km2 respectively fig 1 if the area of cultivated land or salt discharge areas in a grid was more than half the land use type in the grid was considered as cultivated land or salt discharge areas then there were 70 and 28 grids of cultivated land and salt discharge areas respectively fig 3 thus the area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas was 2 5 when allocations were simulated by sahysmod the area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas lc d excavation depth di and layout of salt discharge areas were considered and other parameters were regarded as unchanged different allocations were described in the following sections optimum area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas must be established so that the area of cultivated land was maximized the different area ratios were summarized in table 4 the areas of 2 30 3 45 4 13 4 60 4 90 and 5 16 km2 of the cultivated land were allocated the areas of 4 59 3 45 2 76 2 30 1 99 and 1 72 km2 of the salt discharge areas respectively the corresponding values of lc d equaled to 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 respectively therefore we could select the most suitable answer which was the highest ratio of lc d that could maintain future soil salinity of cultivated land at a desired level based on the field survey the average excavation depth of the low lying salt discharge areas was approximate 0 2 m in order to analyze the effects of excavation depths on soil salinity of cultivated land and establish a function to describe the effects excavation depths of 0 001 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 8 m were simulated by sahysmod considering the cost effective and environmentally friendly options di should be as minimized as possible in the optimum allocation as shown in fig 1 salt discharge areas mainly located in the southwest of the study area the location layout of salt discharge areas effected the ability of drainage salt water in order to investigate the effects of different layouts of salt discharge areas on soil salinity the salt discharge areas that located in the northeast middle and scattered in the study area would be simulated by sahysmod fig 3 2 6 evaluation of the optimum allocation in the present study evaluation indexes for the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation were selected including soil salinity soil salinization salt removing rate difference degree of soil salinization environmental effects and economic benefits soil salinity can be expressed as follows 1 u 1 j i 1 j u i where u is the average soil salinity of cultivated land or salt discharge areas ds m u i is the soil salinity of cultivated land or salt discharge areas in the ith grid j is the total number of grids of cultivated land or salt discharge areas in the present study j values of cultivated land and salt discharge areas were 70 and 28 respectively moreover in order to evaluate the sustainable utilization of cultivated land soil salinization salt removing rate is used to describe the change of soil salinity in the predicted years relative to a base year 2 z k m u i k u i m u i m where z k m is the soil salinization salt removing rate u i k is soil salinity of the ith grid in kth year ds m u i m is soil salinity of the ith grid in mth year ds m and m is the base year if z k m 0 it shows the soil salinity is accumulated and then z k m represents the soil salinization rate otherwise it represents the salt removing rate and cultivated land can be sustainably used in order to compare different allocations of salt discharge areas the difference degree of soil salinization g is used to indicate the relative changes of soil salinity under different allocations it can be expressed as follows 3 g u b u b u b where u b is the average value of soil salinity of cultivated land or salt discharge areas after the optimum allocation ds m u b is the average value of soil salinity of cultivated land or salt discharge areas before the optimum allocation ds m if g 0 it shows the allocation is optimum the greater the absolute value of g the more the soil salinity of cultivated land is reduced by the optimum allocation in land consolidation if g 0 it suggests the allocation is not optimum moreover environmental effects and economic benefits should be considered the allocation should be carried out at a minimum possible cost a maximized area of cultivated land and with minimum negative environmental effects in land consolidation 3 results 3 1 effect of different area ratios on soil salinity as shown in fig 4 soil salinity of cultivated land was plotted against the area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas lc d for different excavation depths di it could be seen from the figure that lc d increased the soil salinity of cultivated land indicated the increase of a power function it was clear that with allocation of more land to salt discharge areas in land consolidation it could be more conducive to transport excessive salts from cultivated land to salt discharge areas then soil salinization of cultivated land was improved 3 2 effect of different excavation depths of salt discharge areas on soil salinity fig 4 revealed that soil salinity of cultivated land was a power function decrease along with the increase of the excavation depths of salt discharge areas whether at the 5th year or 10th year it suggested the increased excavation depth played an important role in reducing the soil salinity of cultivated land this was due to a salt balance in which the salt of cultivated land transferred to the salt discharge areas moreover it could be seen from fig 4 that the effects of different area ratios lc d and excavation depths di on soil salinity of cultivated land u at 5th and 10th years could be described as 4 u 1 45 2 68 di 0 5 0 83 lc d 0 5 5 u 2 84 4 67 di 0 5 1 15 lc d 0 5 as shown in eqs 4 and 5 it was clear that the effects of different area ratios on soil salinity were relatively smaller compared with the effects of excavation depths the soil salinization of cultivated land was more serious at the 10th year compared with 5th year in this study di 0 3 m and lc d 1 5 were enough to provide the values of soil salinity 1 7 ds m in the cultivated land in the next 10 years which ensured the sustainable utilization of cultivated land allen et al 1998 pointed out that maize yields started to reduce when soil salinity was 1 7 ds m according to the field survey fig 1 the major crop grown in the study area was maize therefore the excavation depth of 0 3 m and area ratio of 1 5 in land consolidation could be considered as the optimum allocation in terms of a minimum cost of the work for excavation a maximized area of cultivated land and sustainable crop production 3 3 effect of layouts of salt discharge areas on soil salinity based on the original allocation i e lc d 2 5 di 0 2 m when the salt discharge areas scattered across cultivated land the increase of soil salinity in cultivated land was the smallest fig 5a the value of g1 was less than 0 and the absolute value of the g1 was the largest in the next 10 years fig 5b therefore the scattered distribution of salt discharge areas was the most conducive to slow down soil salinization of cultivated land when the salt discharge areas located in the middle of the study area the value of g2 was less than 0 fig 5b which showed the layout of salt discharge areas was more optimum compared with the original layout southwest when the salt discharge areas located in the northeast the soil salinization of cultivated land was the most serious in the next 10 years fig 5 this indicated the abilities to control soil salinity of salt discharge areas in the northeast were weaker compared with other layouts e g southwest the main reason was the southwest of the study area was more low lying compared with the northeast as a result it further showed that the low lying salt discharge areas were more conducive to the effects of accumulating salt it was worth noting when the allocations of area ratios and excavation depths were not optimized although the layouts of salt discharge areas were optimized the soil salinization of cultivated land was still serious it exhibited the values of soil salinity 1 7 ds m in the next 10 years fig 5 it illustrated that concurrent optimization of the layouts of salt discharge areas the area ratios and excavation depths was necessary to control soil salinization and ensure sustainable utilization of cultivated land the effective distances of salt discharge areas should be considered when allocating the salt discharge areas in land consolidation it was evident that the scattered and middle distributions of salt discharge areas could ensure that the most of salt discharge areas were satisfied within the effective distances of removed salt then the abilities of controlling soil salinity were improved it was worth noting that the adverse effects of scattered distribution of salt discharge areas on irrigation and drainage managements should be considered therefore in terms of optimizing layouts of salt discharge areas not only the abilities to control soil salinity by salt discharge areas should be considered but also the adverse effects should be concerned as shown in fig 6 when salt discharge areas located in the middle of the study area soil salinity of the salt discharge areas continuously increased from 2016 to 2027 moreover there was an obvious rule that soil salinity of salt discharge areas decreased with the distances from cultivated land at different years in other words salt discharge areas near the cultivated land suffered from more serious soil salinization compared with the areas far away from the cultivated land the main reason was when the salt discharge areas near the cultivated land soil salinity of the cultivated land was more conducive to introduce to the salt discharge areas when the salt discharge areas far away from the cultivated land their abilities to control soil salinity were influenced then the introduced soil salinity to salt discharge areas was reduced finally the ranges of soil salinity in different grids were 2 40 3 99 6 59 10 93 and 11 02 11 86 ds m in 2018 2022 and 2027 respectively fig 6 it was evident that the ranges increased from 2018 to 2022 and then decreased from 2022 to 2027 which suggested the soil salinization of salt discharge areas was gradually serious whether the salt discharge areas near or far away from the cultivated land as time went on it also indicated that the layouts of salt discharge areas in land consolidation affected not only the allocation system effectiveness but also allocation system aging and lifetime 3 4 3 4 comparison of different allocations in land consolidation based on the comprehensive consideration of soil salinity u soil salinization salt removing rate z difference degree of soil salinization g environmental effects and economic benefits parameters of the optimum allocation were determined table 5 the layouts of salt discharge areas by the original and optimum allocations were shown in fig 7 generally speaking the cultivated land with very serious soil salinization was first considered as abandoned land and then used as salt discharge areas in optimum allocation as a result salt discharge areas by the optimum allocation located in the southwest and northeast fig 7 thus the 2 76 km2 of salt discharge areas would be allocated with 4 13 km2 of cultivated land and the area ratio was reduced from 2 5 to 1 5 moreover the irrigation amount of cultivated land was reduced from 342 41 105 m3 to 288 60 105 m3 as the decrease of areas of cultivated land in order to illustrate the sustainable utilization of cultivated land the soil salinity of cultivated land and salt discharge areas were predicted in the next 10 years respectively fig 8 based on different allocations soil salinity of cultivated land and salt discharge areas increased year by year soil salinity of cultivated land was nearly 2 7 ds m by the original allocation figs 8a and 1 2 ds m by the optimum allocation fig 8b at the 10th year generally the maize yields started to reduce when soil salinity was 1 7 ds m allen et al 1998 therefore the maize could grow normally in the next 10 years by the optimum allocation which ensured the sustainable utilization of cultivated land as shown in fig 8c the values of g were less than 0 which suggested soil salinity was reduced by the optimum allocation compared with the original allocation the absolute value of g in cultivated land increased year by year according to an explanation of eq 3 the increased the absolute value of g the more the soil salinity of cultivated land was reduced by the optimum allocation therefore the proposed allocation in the study area was optimum as shown in fig 9 a c the spatial distributions of soil salinity were similar at different years the higher soil salinity generally distributed in the west and east of the study area where were mostly salt discharge areas the lower soil salinity mainly distributed in the middle of the study area where were mostly cultivated land furthermore as shown in fig 9d based on the original allocation the range of z value was 0 17 20 23 it suggested soil salinization was more serious in 2027 compared with 2016 as shown in fig 9e the range of z value was 0 23 11 33 which suggested that the part of cultivated land by the optimum allocation still occurred the salt removing in 2027 compared with in 2016 as shown in fig 9f z values were less than 0 which showed that in 2027 the soil salinity of cultivated land was removed by the optimum allocation compared with the original allocation it suggested that the salt discharge areas by the optimum allocation helped to lessen the salt load of the irrigated cultivated land in the next 10 years 4 discussion ynid had the characteristics of solving the problem of soil salinization of cultivated land by the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation first soil salinization in the low lying land was more serious and caused a reduction in crop yield this made some farmers abandon the low lying cultivated land and then the abandoned land could be used as sinks to store excessive salts this fact increased salinity in the salt discharge areas and reduced salinity in the cultivated land second the main source of irrigation water was the yellow river diversion however considering agricultural and ecological developments of the whole basin and downstream areas the amount of yellow river diversion in ynid had been gradually reduced and irrigation water of cultivated land was constrained the irrigation development possibility was not provided in all segments and some lands without irrigation were abandoned third the typical climate characteristic of ynid high evaporation and low precipitation was also beneficial to the salt accumulation of salt discharge areas finally the differences of height between low lying salt discharge areas and cultivated land were significant in the study area in land consolidation retaining the low lying land not only was cost effective and environmentally friendly options but also guaranteed the hydraulic gradient and groundwater exchange between salt discharge areas and cultivated land therefore the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas was an effective measure to lessen the salt load of cultivated land in ynid under water and salt constraints the effectiveness of the allocation was higher where salt discharge areas were larger i e 1 5 instead of 2 5 for area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas growing and wyseure 1992 also suggested an approximately equal area ratio of cultivated land to salt discharge areas whereas khouri 1998 stated that a ratio of less than 2 satisfied the leaching requirement konukcu et al 2006 suggested that the area ratio was 1 25 different area ratios may attribute to different regional characteristics with various land use types water table climate and crop types the increased excavation depths of salt discharge areas had important effects on lowering soil salinity of cultivated land but the cost of earth works for the excavation should be considered in the study area an excavation depth of 0 3 m was required khouri 1998 also stated that an excavation depth of 0 3 m in the salt discharge areas could accelerate the upward flux the design requirement for the allocation was that the water table was shallow it was not expected that a larger excavation depth was required to enhance the evaporation finally it was worth noting that both soil salinity and sodicity problem existed in the study area however the effects of exchangeable na sodium on water and salt movements have not been investigated by the model the effects of exchangeable na on water movement and evaporation in the salt discharge area will be monitored and then the further effects on system performance will be analyzed in the next research the salt discharge areas acted as sinks for excessive salts transported with the groundwater depending on the evaporation rate the excess water was evaporated and the salt was accumulated on the surface of salt discharge areas the evaporation rate was reduced with increasing salt on the soil surface of salt discharge areas hassan and ghaibeh 1977 khouri 1998 then the amount of soil salinity accumulating in salt discharge areas was limited therefore the evaporation rate required to be enhanced or maintained before the regeneration of allocation khouri 1998 the main concern for the management of salt discharge areas was how to increase or at least maintain the evaporation rate from the soil surface of salt discharge areas soil texture significantly affected the rate of evaporation the fine soil had a larger capillary rise and as a result more water was available for evaporation levy et al 2005 bagarello et al 2006 konukcu et al 2006 also indicated the coarser the texture the larger would be the sink area and the higher the silt content the smaller the sink area for the same water table depth evaporation can be improved by replacing the top soil layer with soil of finer texture hassan and ghaibeh 1977 also found experimentally that the presence of a fine textured soil above a coarse textured soil increased the evaporation rate beyond that of the coarse soil although the optimum allocation was more effective compared with the artificial drainage the artificial drainage still needed to be established in the study area the reason was that soil texture in the study area may result in weak hydraulic conductivity which required that the artificial drainage adequately guaranteed the water and salt transfer from cultivated land to salt discharge areas moreover the presence of a shallow saline groundwater table in the study area and greater evaporation resulted in the salt accumulation on the surface of cultivated land therefore the artificial drainage system combined with the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas could control the water table and soil salinity of cultivated land finally the attention should be paid to the balance between the allocation and land use the allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation needed a relatively high percentage of land out of the farming system so the allocation was more suitable in the regions where the land was in abundance and cheap and water was scarce and expensive 5 conclusions ynid is a typical soil salinization region with high evaporation and low precipitation and an unreasonable allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation in this study to solve soil salinization and ensure sustainable land use different allocations in land consolidation including the excavation depths of salt discharge areas di area ratios of cultivated land to salt discharge areas lc d and layouts of salt discharge areas were simulated by sahysmod in 2018 2027 based on the simulation results of different scenarios in ynid it was apparent that sahysmod was an effective tool to simulate soil water and salt movements between cultivated land and salt discharge areas in the irrigation district the results showed that 1 different excavation depths and area ratios indicated the negative and positive effects of power functions on soil salinity of cultivated land u for example in 2027 u 2 84 4 67 di 0 5 1 15 lc d 0 5 2 the scattered distribution of salt discharge areas was more conducive to removing salt from cultivated land therefore the optimum allocation in land consolidation was closely related to the excavation depths area ratios and layouts of salt discharge areas in this study an excavation depth of 0 3 m the area ratio of 1 5 and salt discharge areas located in the southwest and northeast were more conducive in terms of removing soil salinity and considering cost effective moreover the average soil salinity of cultivated land by the optimum allocation was reduced to 1 2 ds m compared with 2 7 ds m by the original allocation in 2027 finally the optimum allocation in land consolidation suggested that salt discharge areas not only helped to lessen the salt load of cultivated land but also reduced the amount of irrigation i e from 342 41 105 m3 to 288 60 105 m3 in the study area with a water constraint therefore the optimum allocation of salt discharge areas in land consolidation was very important to address soil salinization of cultivated land and ensure sustainable land use especially in the arid and semi arid irrigated regions the results of this study provide a theoretical basis and technical guide for the optimum allocation of salt

9918,nowadays improving the method of design in agriculture using new technologies is a common issue irrigation system plays an important role in productivity and some new methods are proposed in this domain as most of the proposed models are more focused on performance criteria their obtained design have problems in terms of practicality and feasibility this paper presents a simulation optimization model for designing a surface irrigation system the main innovation of the proposed model is its special focus on the feasibility in real issues it gives an optimal and feasible surface

meter 1 introduction traditional engineering designs are still used in many fields one of these fields is agriculture which requires a variety of engineering designs despite the many advances that have taken place many farmers around the world still use traditional methods to design one of the reasons that new technologies are not widely used by farmers is the incompatibility of the methods and design provided by these technologies with their resources infrastructure and experimental learning therefore one of the ways to provide more efficient tools is to use new technologies in line with the realities of traditional agriculture drury et al 2017 one of the major issues facing farmers is the design of their farm land irrigation system the irrigation system should be appropriate to the resources and constraints of farmers and also has an optimal performance based on the performance indicators introduced for irrigation numerous modeling using hydraulic relationships and numerical methods to simulate the behavior of an irrigation system has been proposed walker and skogerboe 1987 washington 2012 walker 1989 2003 an irrigation system contains a large number of parameters that are often continuous so a large search space must be searched to find the optimal irrigation system the proposed engineering methods for irrigation system design often do not provide suitable procedure and tools for effective search in this large search space and focus on simulation procedures and qualitative validation of an irrigation system on the other hand there are many constraints and practicality considerations in irrigation systems which are mostly considered by farmers but unfortunately appropriate numerical modeling has not been provided for them designing an irrigation system without considering the constraints and feasibility considerations reduces the usability of the model by farmers also since the irrigation system manages water as a very important resource in agriculture that has a direct impact on productivity in crop production providing effective tools using technology and new knowledge to design an optimal irrigation system is desirable in walker and skogerboe 1987 walker 1989 using hydraulic models such as volume balance model many numerical procedures for simulating the irrigation system and calculating its performance indicators are presented some simulator software programs were developed based on the presented numerical procedure such as bautista et al 2009a walker 2003 garcia 2014 in the simulator software programs the irrigation system is imported and the functional parameters and some performance indicators are calculated in some research the simulator software programs are used for optimizing the irrigation system of some case studies bautista et al 2009a mazarei et al 2020 salahou et al 2018 fadul et al 2020 salahou et al 2018 analyzed the effect of cut off time and bottom slope of field using winsrfr for border irrigation field of winter wheat in china in bautista et al 2009a basin irrigation system is analyzed by winsrfr software in fadul et al 2020 winsrfr is used for verifying proposed design in large field dimensions which has made a significant improvement in efficiency adequacy and uniformity in mazarei et al 2020 the winsrfr is used for optimizing the inflow rate slope and field length of blocked end furrow irrigation system in smith et al 2018 flow rate cut off time and their effect on application efficiency are investigated where the sisco model gillies and smith 2015 is used as a simulation model in valipour and montazar 2012 the mixed of genetic algorithm and winsrfr is used for designing and optimizing the furrow irrigation in akbari et al 2018 a simulation optimization model is proposed as edosim the edosim is used for design and evaluation of surface irrigation system for border basin and furrow method of irrigation a volume balance equation is used for simulation and twenty meta heuristic algorithm are used for optimizing also seven performance indicators are used for optimizing which are weighted sum as a single objective optimization criterion in edosim the practicality and labor are not considered in saberi et al 2020 a simulation optimization framework is proposed for furrow surface irrigation design flow discharge furrow length and cut off time are given as decision variable and four performance indicator are used as multi objective optimization criteria amalgam algorithm is used as multi objective optimization algorithm also the software surdev is used for simulation and performance indicator calculation in the proposed model no constraints are used to determine the practicality and labor of the designed irrigation system in pazouki 2021 a simulation optimization model for designing an optimal practical surface irrigation system is presented in the models simulation section equations and numerical solution procedures based on volume balance model have been used in the optimization section six evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithms have been used five performance indicators of irrigation systems have been used as objective functions the performance indicators have been calculated in first irrigation and later irrigations therefore the optimization problem is solved with 10 objective functions in order to make the proposed model more practical it is presented in two modes labor sensitive ls and labor insensitive lis in the model which is proposed in this paper the amount of practicality and labor required for the designed irrigation system is not calculated directly one of the problems of the proposed models so far is the lack of proper attention to practicality and the amount of required labor to implement the designed irrigation system of course in the proposed models by applying constraints to the algorithms during the design of the irrigation system a certain amount of practicality is applied but the amount of labor has not been considered since the implementation of the irrigation plan in the farm land is done manually if the proposed design is not practical or requires a lot of labor with the fatigue of the workers the plan is implemented imperfectly therefore the full realization of quality expectations based on performance indicators from an irrigation project depends on the feasibility of the project by workers research on the rate of workability and labor in surface irrigation is more focused on estimating the cost of irrigation amosson et al 2011 wichelns et al 1996 al ghafri 2005 in amosson et al 2011 by examining the cost of implementing 4 different irrigation systems based on cost per hectare and in different conditions it has provided feasibility analysis regarding the use of different irrigation systems economically in wichelns et al 1996 detailed information about irrigation practices and costs are collected by interviewing 10 farmers in the 9000 acre broadview water district in this paper four irrigation systems furrow irrigation using siphon tube furrow irrigation using gate pipe sprinkler irrigation and combination of these were studied in terms of cost and labor in this study good points about the amount of labor for irrigation practices are provided for example the relationship between field length number of sets and type of irrigation with the amount of labor of course the main focus of this paper has been on cost estimation in al ghafri 2005 irrigation systems and related costs have been evaluated in two areas sub saharan africa and southeastern arabia and the presented analyzes are mostly based on irrigation costs and have not focused directly on labor as it is shown in the presented researches the practicality of the irrigation system and the amount of required labor by them unlike the numerical simulations introduced to evaluate the performance indicators have not direct numerical modeling and can be evaluated and analyzed based on the experiences of experts and descriptive logics of administrators therefore to model them use tools that provide numerical models based on the descriptions and experiences of experts fuzzy expert system is one of the best tools used for modeling in such situations in fuzzy expert system using fuzzy logic and describing language knowledge in the form of logical rules related to a phenomenon a computational model is created to model this this tool has been used in various issues in agriculture bahat et al 2000 lambert et al 2014 saruwatari and yomota 1995 gonzlez perea et al 2018 in kambalimath and deka 2020 reviews a variety of applications of fuzzy logic in the domain of hydrology and water resources in this paper the imprecision and vagueness characteristics of the problems related to hydrology and water resource management which lead to the optimal performance of models based on fuzzy logic are pointed out also based on the studies conducted in this article it has been determined that the performance of the methods that are presented in combination with the fuzzy model is more favorable than the methods that use the fuzzy model purely in hoseini 2019 using physical and chemical characteristics of the soil with the fuzzy logic inference a suitable irrigation system is proposed in saruwatari and yomota 1995 a forecasting system of irrigation water requirements of a paddy field area is proposed based on fuzzy inference system which has been composed from the experience and knowledge of administrators in this research parameters related to previous irrigation status current cultivation status and climatic conditions are used for modeling in gonzlez perea et al 2018 a hybrid method is used to estimate the water demand to irrigate agricultural land in this research a fuzzy neural network was used for modeling its parameters were selected by the evolutionary algorithm the use of fuzzy control system to control irrigation systems has also been considered in research quanxing et al 1996 hasan et al 2018 in this research the fuzzy inference model is used to model the feasibility of the irrigation system and also the amount of required labor for it by combining the designed fuzzy system and meta heuristic algorithms a model for designing a surface irrigation system is presented which in addition to being optimal in terms of performance indicators is also desirable in terms of feasibility 2 material and methods in this paper a simulation optimization model is presented in order to design an optimal surface irrigation system of land field that has optimal practicality a special feature of the proposed model is the use of a fuzzy expert system to model the practicality of the proposed irrigation scheme the proposed model consists of three parts the first part is the irrigation system simulator which simulates the irrigation practice based on the input parameters and design parameters and finally presents some intermediate parameters and performance indicators the second part calculates the amount of practicality and required labor to implement the irrigation plan based on design parameters and input parameters and with the help of fuzzy expert system the third part of the model using meta heuristic algorithms presents the optimal design based on performance indicators practicality and the amount of required labor the block diagram of the proposed model is presented in fig 1 the parts of the proposed model are presented in more detail below 2 1 simulation procedure the volume balance model is used for simulating the irrigation system performance in this simulation model the kostiakov lewis characteristics such as a k and f 0 are known but advance time rescission time the depletion time and infiltration volume z are unknown which are calculated based on numerical equations and procedures the volume balance equation is written based on two assumptions the power function which describes the trajectory of the advance of the water front field and the infiltration equation that has the kostiakov lewis characteristic form so the volume balance equation is 1 q 0 t 0 77 a 0 x σ z k t a x f 0 t x 1 r where q 0 is inlet discharge a 0 is cross sectional area of flow at the inlet σ z is subsurface shape factor some important parameters that must be calculated in the simulation are intake opportunity time τ req advance time t l cut off time t co depletion time t d and infiltration volume these parameters are obtained using numerical estimation procedure based on the newton raphson procedure and volume balance equation eq 1 the detail procedure of the estimation is presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 walker 2003 in order to simplify the paper those procedures are not repeated here after calculating these intermediate parameters some widely used performance indicators to evaluate the performance of surface irrigation system are calculated as follows the application efficiency e a is an important indicator which is obtained as 2 e a z r e q l q 0 t c o the water requirement efficiency for under irrigation is calculated by eq 3 and this indicator is one or 100 in percentage representation for complete and over irrigation 3 e r z r e q x d v z i z r e q l the distribution uniformity is given by eq 4 4 d u 4 0 v l q v r z v d p where v lq is the average volume of infiltrated water in the least irrigated 25 of the field v dp is the volume per furrow spacing of water that percolates below the root zone and v rz is the volume per furrow spacing of irrigation water that is actually stored in the root zone washington 2012 the deep percolation ratio is given by eq 5 for complete and overirrigation 5 d p r v z z r e q l q 0 t c o where v z is the total infiltrated volume the tailwater ratio is obtained by eq 6 6 t w r 100 e a d p r also in furrow irrigation with cutback and reuse systems different equations are used which are presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 after calculating the performance indicators the total required time of irrigation practice is calculated different irrigation systems use different equations to calculate the required total time in the first step the land division structure must be given which in the furrow model eqs 7 and 8 are used but based on the drainage type of irrigation system such as cutback and reuse other equations are used which are presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 walker 2003 7 n f w f w 8 n s n f q 0 q t the total required time of irrigation practice is found by eq 9 9 t t n s t c o also the land division structure for basin and border irrigation systems is calculated by eqs 10 and 11 10 w 0 q t q 0 11 n b o w f w 0 the design simulations of border and basin surface irrigation are performed based on procedure proposed by walker and skogerboe 1987 in order to explain more clearly the simulation procedure which is used for furrow border and basin is presented in fig 2 in this diagram the input parameters enter the diagram from the top and the performance indicators exit from the bottom as shown in this diagram the input parameters consist of two parts the field input parameters and the surface irrigation design parameters which are given by the optimization parts in each box a part of the simulation calculations is done based on the dependencies between the calculations the boxes are arranged from top to bottom so that the lower boxes depend on the output of the higher boxes and the arrows indicate the dependence between the boxes the final result is the simulation of performance indicators and performance parameters of the irrigation system designed based on farm land inputs 2 2 fuzzy inference system in the proposed model some fuzzy expert systems are used to model the amount of practicality and required labor to apply the irrigation system designed in the farm land considering that most of the available data on the practicality and labor of an irrigation practice are in the form of experiences and knowledge of administrators which is modeled numerically and computationally using the fuzzy expert system the main components of a fuzzy expert system are fuzzification inference knowledge base and defuzzification since the fuzzy expert system uses fuzzy logic all numbers and calculations used in it must be fuzzy but in the proposed model the data is crisp as a result with the help of fuzzification and defuzzification components it is possible to convert data to an expert system and from an expert system also the experiences and knowledge of administrators are created in the form of fuzzy rules and with the help of fuzzy numbers in component knowledge base in fig 3 the main components of the fuzzy expert system and relations between them are shown in the proposed model a fuzzy inference system fis is used in two different architectures in one architecture five fuzzy inference systems are used to model the amount of practicality labor and quality of performance in this model the fis provide three crisp value based on irrigation system design and simulation of the irrigation practice since this model expresses the performance of the irrigation system with three numbers it is called the multi objective model the overview of the fis model for multi objective is shown in fig 4 a fis is designed for modeling the practicality the inputs of this fis are different depending on the irrigation system for furrow irrigation system the inputs are δmid δbase t max t mid y max base δq f δq l δt tf δt tl and numbericerror t max t mid y max and base are the geometrical parameters of irrigation system design δmid is calculated based on equation t max t mid which is used to control constraint t max t mid δbase is calculated based on equation t mid base which is used to control constraint t mid base δq f is calculated based on equation q 0 f q m a x and is used to control constraint q 0f q max in first irrigation practice and δq l has the same role in subsequent irrigations δt tf is calculated based on equation t t f t t and is used to control constraint t tf t t in first irrigation practice and δt tl has the same role in subsequent irrigations numbericerror indicates the occurrence of errors in the simulator calculations because the simulator uses numerical solution methods in some calculations these numerical methods may face problems in that case their simulation results as well as the irrigation system design will be problematic the output of this fis model is in the range of 0 100 the larger the size the better the practicality of the presented design the model details are provided in fig 5 this figure shows the membership functions used to fuzzify the inputs the rules used to inference and the model output membership function with its defuzzification method as shown in fig 5 this fis model uses the 13 rules and uses the center of gradient defuzzyfication method leekwijck and kerre 1999 membership functions and rules are designed based on talking to experts and using their experience maximum is used as s norm and aggregation and minimum as t norm and implication of fis in fuzzy calculation also the mamdani based fis is used in proposed model mamdani and assilian 1975 the fis model proposed for border and basin irrigation systems are the same as the model presented for furrow irrigation system in which only unnecessary inputs in border and basin irrigation system which is shown in fig 4 have been removed and the sections related to deleted inputs have been amended in the rules two fuzzy inference systems is design for modeling the labor the inputs of this fis are different depending on the irrigation system the inputs are l s n s l t t co t t δw f and y max l t is the input parameter of farm land n s t co and t t are calculated in simulator based on the proposed irrigation system design l s and y max are the parameters of the irrigation system design δw f is calculated based on equation w t max which is used to control the ridge width the output of this fis model is in the range of 0 100 the smaller the size the better the labor of the presented design model details are provided in fig 6 this figure shows the membership functions used to fuzzification of the inputs the rules used to inference and the model output membership function with its defuzzification method as shown in fig 6 this fis model uses the 30 rules and uses the center of gradient defuzzyfication method this fis model also has settings and operators similar to the previous fis model also two instance of this model are used in modeling one of which provides output based on the first irrigation parameters and the other performs calculations based on the later irrigation parameters to combine the results of the first and later irrigations labor another fis model combining fis model is used the exact specifications of which are presented in fig 7 the inputs of this combining fis model are the outputs of the two labor fis models the combining model has 10 rules which are presented in fig 7 and estimates the amount of required labor in a numerical value between 0 and 100 a fis model is designed for modeling the performance indicator the inputs of this fis are e a e r dpr twr and du which are the well known performance indicators of irrigation system design for first and later irrigations the output of this fis model is in the range of 0 100 the larger the size the better the performance of the presented design the model details are provided in fig 8 this figure shows the membership functions used to fuzzify the inputs the rules used to inference and the model output membership function with its defuzzification method as shown in fig 8 this fis model uses 19 rules and uses the center of gradient defuzzyfication method this fis model also has settings and operators similar to the previous fis models the second model which is used to estimate the quality and performance of the irrigation system determines the desirability of the proposed design with a number so is called a single objective model the overview of single objective model is given in fig 9 as shown in this figure the difference between multi objective and single objective model is in adding a fis at the end of single objective model this fis provides a number based on the results of three other fuzzy systems which is used as an indicator of the suitability of the designed irrigation system details of the fis used to combine the three metrics are provided in fig 10 as shown it uses 22 rules to inference the settings and operators which are used in this fis are the same as other fuzzy systems that are introduced above fuzzy expert systems are implemented using fuzzylite which is the libraries for fuzzy logic control rada vilela 2018 this tool can be used in different programming languages in this research python has been used fuzzy expert systems are defined in the form of fuzzylite language fll that can be used in fuzzylite jfuzzylogic has also been used to plot membership functions cingolani and alcal fdez 2012 2013 2 3 optimization method due to the complexities in the design of the irrigation system search space such as the large space of the irrigation system design problem finding an efficient design solution requires the use of effective optimization algorithms in the proposed model the irrigation system design is modeled in two multivariate forms a multi objective and a single objective optimization problem there are several parameters influencing the design so it is a multivariate issue as given in section 2 2 there are several effective design objectives for irrigation system design that conflict with each other so it is a multi objective issue in this research using some fuzzy expert systems the variety of objectives in the problem of irrigation system design are combined with each other in the form of the two models first a multi objective model that provide only three indicators to express the desirability of the irrigation system and second a single objective model that is an indicator of the desirability of the irrigation system so the relations between input parameters with objectives are complex that is evident in designed fuzzy expert systems therefore using evolutionary multi objective and single objective algorithms can be a wise decision for the optimization module of the proposed model eiben and smith 2015 according to the procedures proposed in walker and skogerboe 1987 in order to optimally design the irrigation system the provided solution should be an appropriate response in the first irrigation and the later irrigations accordingly changes in the various parameters of agricultural field during the first and subsequent irrigations have been considered the decision variables and input parameters of the proposed model are given in table 1 as mentioned the objectives of the optimization algorithm are two models in the first model a multi objective fis as shown in fig 4 is used the output of which are three indicators in the range of 0 and 100 an indicator determines the amount of practicality the larger the size the more practical the second indicator shows the amount of required labor to run the irrigation system with a number in the range of 0 100 that should be minimized the third indicator shows the performance quality of the irrigation system with a number between 0 and 100 that should be maximized the second model is a single objective problem whose objective is also calculated based on a single objective fis as shown in fig 9 the metric used in this model indicates the desirability of the irrigation system with a number between 0 and 100 that should be maximized therefore in the proposed model both multi objective and single objective algorithms are used for optimizing in the proposed model six different mutli objective evolutionary optimization algorithms as nsgaii deb et al 2002 rnsgaii deb and sundar 2006 nsgaiii deb and jain 2014 rnsgaiii vesikar et al 2018 unsgaiii seada and deb 2016 and moea zhang and li 2007 are used also four different single objective evolutionary optimization algorithms as ga eiben and smith 2015 de price et al 2005 pattern search hooke and jeeves 1961 and cmaes hansen and ostermeier 2001 are used pymoo package which is a python package for multi objective and single objective is used to implement the optimization procedure blank and deb 2020 the simulation optimization

population of generations 2 4 parameter tuning the selected optimization algorithms have some effective parameters assigning appropriate values to these parameters have a significant impact on the quality of the optimization algorithm in general in order to achieve better results from evolutionary optimization algorithms a suitable parameter tuning should be performed eiben and smith 2015 due to the randomness of the evolutionary algorithms their parameter tuning procedure is complex one solution is to use the evolutionary algorithm itself to set the parameters of another evolutionary algorithm called metaga eiben and smith 2015 this method is used in the proposed model for this purpose the components of metaga must be designed the main components are representation fitness function which is called utility function in metaga diversity and selection operators and termination criterion in metaga the mean best fitness mbf is used as the utility function because evolutionary algorithms are random to reliably evaluate an individual of metaga related optimization algorithm is repeated several times taking into account the proposed parameters in this individual then in multi objective model based on a specific weight combination of objective functions the fitness value of the best individual in each iteration is calculated and in single objective model the fitness value of the optimization algorithm is used the mbf is calculated by averaging the best fitness in several iterations b is the number of iteration of the related optimization algorithm the representation of metaga is actually a parameters vector pv of optimization algorithm in proposed model pv is population size offspring number max generation of termination criteria the crossover probability eta parameters of crossover operator eta parameters of mutation operator also the selection and diversity operators used are two point crossover gaussian mutation and tournament selection with k 3 also in order to increase the number of evaluated pv in the parameter tuning process a multistage method along with metaga is used in the multistage method the number of iterations of the algorithm per pv is managed based on the intermediate fitness obtained from its initial evaluations in such a way that only pvs with good intermediate fitness are evaluated by the maximum iteration which is the b this method allows more efficient execution of parameter tuning the procedure of metaga is presented in algorithm 2 deap python library is used for implementing the metaga algorithm fortin 2012 algorithm 2

systems is performed the data selected for the experiments include diversity of surface irrigation systems such as furrow in free draining border and basin also in order to compare the results of the proposed model with other similar ones a set of data is selected that has been used as experimental data in other proposed models akbari et al 2018 saberi et al 2020 due to the large number of experimental data parameters the data is not provided here and the parameters can be accessed by referring to the provided references the used parameters in the experiments are as the same as the main parameters of the based data in table 2 experimental fields references and their irrigation system are provided as shown in table 2 the experimental data includes 8 furrow fields three border fields and three basin fields 3 results the proposed simulation optimization model is evaluated and validated by designing a set of experiments on data from 14 farm lands with different characteristics the proposed model is implemented with python language and related libraries the simulation algorithm of the proposed model is implemented from scratch based on the presented theories and algorithms of section 2 1 the simulation part of the proposed model is validated by two well known software programs sirmod walker 2003 and winsrfr bautista et al 2009b the results are presented below as presented the proposed model is introduced by combining fuzzy expert systems and meta heuristic optimization algorithms in the optimization section of the proposed model two categories of single objective and multi objective algorithms are used the inputs of the multi objective model are three outputs produced by fuzzy expert systems that display the practicality labor and performance quality of the designed irrigation system the input of the single objective model is generated using an expert system that receives the previous three quality indicators and produces one output the multi objective model presents a set of designs which are in fact the points of the estimated pareto front of the problem in the optimization algorithm therefore to evaluate the results of the multi objective model candidate points are selected from the set of results presented by the multi objective model based on the weight composition in accordance with the objectives of the problem table 3 presents the set of weight compositions used to extract candidate designs from the output of the multi objective model tables 4 5 6 and 7 present the results of the multi objective model for 14 agricultural fields in tables 4 and 5 the results of border and basin irrigation systems are shown and in tables 6 and 7 the results of furrow irrigation system are presented in tables 4 and 6 the irrigation system designs and the intermediate parameters of the simulation part of the proposed model based on design parameters are given in tables 5 and 7 the performance indicators and fuzzy expert systems related to the presented design in tables 4 and 6 are shown the results presented for the multi objective model are based on weights 1 2 and 4 of table 3 in weight 1 the importance of all three objectives of practicality labor and quality are considered equally in weight 2 only practicality and labor are considered and in weight 4 the importance of quality is greater than practicality and labor based on the presented results it is clear that the proposed designs for weight combinations 1 and 4 are the same but in weight composition 2 due to not considering the quality designs are proposed that are qualitatively undesirable but practical and can be implemented with less labor evaluation of quality metrics and intermediate parameters of simulation determines the performance of fuzzy expert systems for example the amount of labor according to the models presented in section 2 2 is highly dependent on the total time required to irrigate parameter t t and the number of basins these parameters for field 3 and 4 in table 5 has low values so the labor is low as it is shown the designs presented by the multi objective model in terms of application efficiency e a in first and later irrigations which is an important quality metric that should be maximized are above 60 on average and in terms of two other indicators dpr and twr which should be minimized are below 25 on average the results also indicate problems for field 8 in table 6 and 7 although simulation parameters of weight 2 design such as t t and n s are too high labor and practicality are normal which is due to inadequacy of the rules in the expert system in the single objective model an optimal irrigation system is presented for each field and the results for 14 agricultural fields are presented in tables 8 9 10 and 11 the results of single objective model for border and basin irrigation systems are shown in tables 8 and 9 where in table 8 the proposed design for these fields is presented along with some intermediate parameters obtained from the simulation and in table 9 the quality and output of its expert systems are provided information about furrow irrigation system is also presented in tables 10 and 11 in order to compare the results of the multi objective with the single objective model three charts are presented in fig 11 in these charts the outputs of three expert systems for 14 different farm fields are presented fig 11 a shows the amount of practicality which is a number between 0 and 100 and the larger the size the more desirable this chart indicates that the designs presented by the multi objective model are more feasible than the designs presented by the single objective method fig 11 b shows the amount of required labor to implement the proposed design and is a number between 0 and 100 that should be minimized here the output of the multi objective model shows better results than the single objective model also in fig 11 c which specifies the design quality metrics with a number between 0 and 100 the multi objective model has provided better results therefore it can be concluded that the multi objective model provides better results than the single objective model as presented in section 2 4 in order to tuning the parameters of multi objective and single objective optimization algorithms the main parameters of these algorithms are selected using an automatic parameter tuning method called metaga the parameter tuning results for a multi objective and a single objective algorithm are presented as examples in table 12 and table 13 as shown the tuning algorithm select a set of parameters for optimization algorithms which provide better performance 4 discussion in order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method a set of comparisons are performed in experiments comparisons are made in two ways first in order to check the accuracy of the implemented simulation procedure in the proposed model the design obtained by the proposed model is simulated using two well known irrigation system software programs sirmod and winsrfr the results of the simulation part of the proposed model and the results of the simulation by the selected software are presented for six fields in table 14 as the results show the accuracy of the implemented simulation is desirable and the slight difference between the results can be due to the rounding numbers of design parameters also in fig 12 four important graphs obtained by sirmod and winsrfr are presented which are runoff hydrograph surface and subsurface flow profile hydrograph depth profile and hydrograph summary profile the presented graphs in fig 12 also visually show the quality of design which is provided by the proposed model in order to evaluate the results of the proposed model are compared with the results of the three methods in table 15 and table 16 these tables show the best results of each indicator and each field in bold also in order to compare the results of the proposed method with edosim and practical simulation optimization model based on the metric of practicality and labor two diagrams in fig 13 are presented to calculate the practicality and labor of edosim and practical simulation optimization model the design parameters provided by these methods are placed in the expert systems of the proposed model as input and the results are displayed in these diagrams as shown in fig 13 the designs presented by the proposed model have a practicality which is equal to or better than the designs presented by the edosim and practical simulation optimization model also the designs presented by the proposed method require equal or less labor in fields 1 2 3 4 and 6 while in fields 5 8 and 9 require more labor related to the edosim and in most fields they require less labor than practical simulation optimization model differences in practicality and labor are often due to the way that the field is divided in length and width direction as well as times of cut off t co and total time of irrigation practice t t according to the information provided in table 15 and table 16 the designs provided by the proposed model have better quality or very close to the edosim model akbari et al 2018 and multi objective framework model saberi et al 2020 in most fields and for most indicators these results show that the practical simulation optimization model pazouki 2021 provides better quality related to the proposed model however fig 13 show that the designs which are provided by practical simulation optimization model are less desirable than the designs which are provided by the proposed method in terms of practicality and the amount of required labor although in practical simulation optimization model by applying additional constraints and objective functions an attempt has been made to obtain practical designs but since the level of design practicality is not directly calculated and used in the modeling process the results provided by this model do not have the desired practicality despite better quality whereas in the proposed model with direct modeling the amount of practicality of the irrigation designs is more desirable despite the lower quality in order to better understand the capabilities of the proposed model the cause of the obtained results of the comparisons is analyzed based on the structure of the models based on the values which are presented by table 4 and 5 of akbari et al 2018 the edosim model uses very small ranges for decision variables which also vary for different fields in other words in this model by selecting a small and specified range for each agricultural field the search space of irrigation model is very limited as these numbers are different for different fields it is probably required to set these ranges based on the opinion of a person who is familiar with the conditions of each field the most important reason that the designs provided by edosim model have good results in terms of practicality and labor as shown in fig 13 is the limited and specified range of decision variables but the same issue can also lead to unfavorable results in terms of performance quality indicators such as application efficiency in other words one of the reasons that practical simulation optimization model which is proposed in pazouki 2021 provides better results in terms of performance indicators is the wider range of decision variables in practical simulation optimization model the decision variables are both broader and same for all fields as a result the designs obtained by practical simulation optimization model are more desirable in terms of performance indicators but in terms of practicality and labor even worse than edosim in practical simulation optimization model despite the special considerations for practicality as the amount of practicality is not used directly in the model it has not been able to provide desirable results in terms of practicality in the proposed model by quantifying practicality and labor by the fuzzy expert system and using them in modeling the irrigation systems designed by this model in terms of performance indicators practicality and labor have better results than edosim model as shown in table 15 and fig 13 on the other hand the proposed model has provided better results than practical simulation optimization model due to the use of practicality and labor in modeling it can be concluded that first in order to provide an optimal and practical irrigation system edosim model needs to adjust and fit the model for each field in which case the results are desirable in terms of practicality but can be further improved in terms of performance indicators second the practical simulation optimization model designs an optimal irrigation system for each field without the need for precise adjustment which has problems in terms of practicality but offers very good results in terms of performance indicators and third the proposed model designs an irrigation system for each field without the need for precise adjustment which is desirable both in terms of performance indicators and is more feasible in terms of practicality design therefore the proposed model can provide a more optimal irrigation system for each field without the need for specialization 5 conclusion in this paper a simulation optimization model was proposed to design an optimal surface irrigation system for farm fields the proposed model can be used to design the surface irrigation system of furrow border and basin fields which covers more than 90 of the farm lands in the world in the proposed model fuzzy expert systems and meta heuristic algorithms are used the fuzzy expert system calculates the practicality labor and performance quality of the proposed irrigation system the rule base knowledge of the fuzzy expert systems are designed based on the knowledge and experiences of experts the outputs of the fuzzy expert systems were used as objectives in single objective and multi objective model of the meta heuristic algorithms in the proposed model five different fuzzy expert systems and 10 meta heuristic algorithms were used also the parameters of the optimization algorithms were tuned using the multi stage automatic parameter tuning method based on the evolutionary algorithm in order to evaluate the performance accuracy of the proposed model experiments were performed on 14 farm fields with different characteristics the results of the experiments have been evaluated in two ways first in order to evaluate the simulation part of the proposed model the results of the simulation part were compared with the results of two well known simulation software programs sirmod and winsrfr and the performance of the simulation part of the proposed model was determined then the results of the proposed model were compared with the results of the three other models and it was found that the designs presented by the proposed model provide more favorable results both in terms of quality and in terms of practicality and the amount of required labor the designs provided by the proposed model with proper management of the total time of irrigation t t cut off time t co size and type of geometric division of field geometric shape of furrows and basins provide an effective irrigation system for the farmers in effective irrigation qualitative parameters of irrigation such as application efficiency e a the deep percolation ratio dpr and runoff ratio twr are considered

9918,nowadays improving the method of design in agriculture using new technologies is a common issue irrigation system plays an important role in productivity and some new methods are proposed in this domain as most of the proposed models are more focused on performance criteria their obtained design have problems in terms of practicality and feasibility this paper presents a simulation optimization model for designing a surface irrigation system the main innovation of the proposed model is its special focus on the feasibility in real issues it gives an optimal and feasible surface irrigation system by fuzzy expert systems and meta heuristic optimization algorithms five fuzzy expert systems analyze the feasibility level of the obtained irrigation system using inference rules which are proposed by expert farmers and 10 meta heuristic optimization algorithms optimize the irrigation system based on the fuzzy expert systems outputs experiments were performed to evaluate the

meter 1 introduction traditional engineering designs are still used in many fields one of these fields is agriculture which requires a variety of engineering designs despite the many advances that have taken place many farmers around the world still use traditional methods to design one of the reasons that new technologies are not widely used by farmers is the incompatibility of the methods and design provided by these technologies with their resources infrastructure and experimental learning therefore one of the ways to provide more efficient tools is to use new technologies in line with the realities of traditional agriculture drury et al 2017 one of the major issues facing farmers is the design of their farm land irrigation system the irrigation system should be appropriate to the resources and constraints of farmers and also has an optimal performance based on the performance indicators introduced for irrigation numerous modeling using hydraulic relationships and numerical methods to simulate the behavior of an irrigation system has been proposed walker and skogerboe 1987 washington 2012 walker 1989 2003 an irrigation system contains a large number of parameters that are often continuous so a large search space must be searched to find the optimal irrigation system the proposed engineering methods for irrigation system design often do not provide suitable procedure and tools for effective search in this large search space and focus on simulation procedures and qualitative validation of an irrigation system on the other hand there are many constraints and practicality considerations in irrigation systems which are mostly considered by farmers but unfortunately appropriate numerical modeling has not been provided for them designing an irrigation system without considering the constraints and feasibility considerations reduces the usability of the model by farmers also since the irrigation system manages water as a very important resource in agriculture that has a direct impact on productivity in crop production providing effective tools using technology and new knowledge to design an optimal irrigation system is desirable in walker and skogerboe 1987 walker 1989 using hydraulic models such as volume balance model many numerical procedures for simulating the irrigation system and calculating its performance indicators are presented some simulator software programs were developed based on the presented numerical procedure such as bautista et al 2009a walker 2003 garcia 2014 in the simulator software programs the irrigation system is imported and the functional parameters and some performance indicators are calculated in some research the simulator software programs are used for optimizing the irrigation system of some case studies bautista et al 2009a mazarei et al 2020 salahou et al 2018 fadul et al 2020 salahou et al 2018 analyzed the effect of cut off time and bottom slope of field using winsrfr for border irrigation field of winter wheat in china in bautista et al 2009a basin irrigation system is analyzed by winsrfr software in fadul et al 2020 winsrfr is used for verifying proposed design in large field dimensions which has made a significant improvement in efficiency adequacy and uniformity in mazarei et al 2020 the winsrfr is used for optimizing the inflow rate slope and field length of blocked end furrow irrigation system in smith et al 2018 flow rate cut off time and their effect on application efficiency are investigated where the sisco model gillies and smith 2015 is used as a simulation model in valipour and montazar 2012 the mixed of genetic algorithm and winsrfr is used for designing and optimizing the furrow irrigation in akbari et al 2018 a simulation optimization model is proposed as edosim the edosim is used for design and evaluation of surface irrigation system for border basin and furrow method of irrigation a volume balance equation is used for simulation and twenty meta heuristic algorithm are used for optimizing also seven performance indicators are used for optimizing which are weighted sum as a single objective optimization criterion in edosim the practicality and labor are not considered in saberi et al 2020 a simulation optimization framework is proposed for furrow surface irrigation design flow discharge furrow length and cut off time are given as decision variable and four performance indicator are used as multi objective optimization criteria amalgam algorithm is used as multi objective optimization algorithm also the software surdev is used for simulation and performance indicator calculation in the proposed model no constraints are used to determine the practicality and labor of the designed irrigation system in pazouki 2021 a simulation optimization model for designing an optimal practical surface irrigation system is presented in the models simulation section equations and numerical solution procedures based on volume balance model have been used in the optimization section six evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithms have been used five performance indicators of irrigation systems have been used as objective functions the performance indicators have been calculated in first irrigation and later irrigations therefore the optimization problem is solved with 10 objective functions in order to make the proposed model more practical it is presented in two modes labor sensitive ls and labor insensitive lis in the model which is proposed in this paper the amount of practicality and labor required for the designed irrigation system is not calculated directly one of the problems of the proposed models so far is the lack of proper attention to practicality and the amount of required labor to implement the designed irrigation system of course in the proposed models by applying constraints to the algorithms during the design of the irrigation system a certain amount of practicality is applied but the amount of labor has not been considered since the implementation of the irrigation plan in the farm land is done manually if the proposed design is not practical or requires a lot of labor with the fatigue of the workers the plan is implemented imperfectly therefore the full realization of quality expectations based on performance indicators from an irrigation project depends on the feasibility of the project by workers research on the rate of workability and labor in surface irrigation is more focused on estimating the cost of irrigation amosson et al 2011 wichelns et al 1996 al ghafri 2005 in amosson et al 2011 by examining the cost of implementing 4 different irrigation systems based on cost per hectare and in different conditions it has provided feasibility analysis regarding the use of different irrigation systems economically in wichelns et al 1996 detailed information about irrigation practices and costs are collected by interviewing 10 farmers in the 9000 acre broadview water district in this paper four irrigation systems furrow irrigation using siphon tube furrow irrigation using gate pipe sprinkler irrigation and combination of these were studied in terms of cost and labor in this study good points about the amount of labor for irrigation practices are provided for example the relationship between field length number of sets and type of irrigation with the amount of labor of course the main focus of this paper has been on cost estimation in al ghafri 2005 irrigation systems and related costs have been evaluated in two areas sub saharan africa and southeastern arabia and the presented analyzes are mostly based on irrigation costs and have not focused directly on labor as it is shown in the presented researches the practicality of the irrigation system and the amount of required labor by them unlike the numerical simulations introduced to evaluate the performance indicators have not direct numerical modeling and can be evaluated and analyzed based on the experiences of experts and descriptive logics of administrators therefore to model them use tools that provide numerical models based on the descriptions and experiences of experts fuzzy expert system is one of the best tools used for modeling in such situations in fuzzy expert system using fuzzy logic and describing language knowledge in the form of logical rules related to a phenomenon a computational model is created to model this this tool has been used in various issues in agriculture bahat et al 2000 lambert et al 2014 saruwatari and yomota 1995 gonzlez perea et al 2018 in kambalimath and deka 2020 reviews a variety of applications of fuzzy logic in the domain of hydrology and water resources in this paper the imprecision and vagueness characteristics of the problems related to hydrology and water resource management which lead to the optimal performance of models based on fuzzy logic are pointed out also based on the studies conducted in this article it has been determined that the performance of the methods that are presented in combination with the fuzzy model is more favorable than the methods that use the fuzzy model purely in hoseini 2019 using physical and chemical characteristics of the soil with the fuzzy logic inference a suitable irrigation system is proposed in saruwatari and yomota 1995 a forecasting system of irrigation water requirements of a paddy field area is proposed based on fuzzy inference system which has been composed from the experience and knowledge of administrators in this research parameters related to previous irrigation status current cultivation status and climatic conditions are used for modeling in gonzlez perea et al 2018 a hybrid method is used to estimate the water demand to irrigate agricultural land in this research a fuzzy neural network was used for modeling its parameters were selected by the evolutionary algorithm the use of fuzzy control system to control irrigation systems has also been considered in research quanxing et al 1996 hasan et al 2018 in this research the fuzzy inference model is used to model the feasibility of the irrigation system and also the amount of required labor for it by combining the designed fuzzy system and meta heuristic algorithms a model for designing a surface irrigation system is presented which in addition to being optimal in terms of performance indicators is also desirable in terms of feasibility 2 material and methods in this paper a simulation optimization model is presented in order to design an optimal surface irrigation system of land field that has optimal practicality a special feature of the proposed model is the use of a fuzzy expert system to model the practicality of the proposed irrigation scheme the proposed model consists of three parts the first part is the irrigation system simulator which simulates the irrigation practice based on the input parameters and design parameters and finally presents some intermediate parameters and performance indicators the second part calculates the amount of practicality and required labor to implement the irrigation plan based on design parameters and input parameters and with the help of fuzzy expert system the third part of the model using meta heuristic algorithms presents the optimal design based on performance indicators practicality and the amount of required labor the block diagram of the proposed model is presented in fig 1 the parts of the proposed model are presented in more detail below 2 1 simulation procedure the volume balance model is used for simulating the irrigation system performance in this simulation model the kostiakov lewis characteristics such as a k and f 0 are known but advance time rescission time the depletion time and infiltration volume z are unknown which are calculated based on numerical equations and procedures the volume balance equation is written based on two assumptions the power function which describes the trajectory of the advance of the water front field and the infiltration equation that has the kostiakov lewis characteristic form so the volume balance equation is 1 q 0 t 0 77 a 0 x σ z k t a x f 0 t x 1 r where q 0 is inlet discharge a 0 is cross sectional area of flow at the inlet σ z is subsurface shape factor some important parameters that must be calculated in the simulation are intake opportunity time τ req advance time t l cut off time t co depletion time t d and infiltration volume these parameters are obtained using numerical estimation procedure based on the newton raphson procedure and volume balance equation eq 1 the detail procedure of the estimation is presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 walker 2003 in order to simplify the paper those procedures are not repeated here after calculating these intermediate parameters some widely used performance indicators to evaluate the performance of surface irrigation system are calculated as follows the application efficiency e a is an important indicator which is obtained as 2 e a z r e q l q 0 t c o the water requirement efficiency for under irrigation is calculated by eq 3 and this indicator is one or 100 in percentage representation for complete and over irrigation 3 e r z r e q x d v z i z r e q l the distribution uniformity is given by eq 4 4 d u 4 0 v l q v r z v d p where v lq is the average volume of infiltrated water in the least irrigated 25 of the field v dp is the volume per furrow spacing of water that percolates below the root zone and v rz is the volume per furrow spacing of irrigation water that is actually stored in the root zone washington 2012 the deep percolation ratio is given by eq 5 for complete and overirrigation 5 d p r v z z r e q l q 0 t c o where v z is the total infiltrated volume the tailwater ratio is obtained by eq 6 6 t w r 100 e a d p r also in furrow irrigation with cutback and reuse systems different equations are used which are presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 after calculating the performance indicators the total required time of irrigation practice is calculated different irrigation systems use different equations to calculate the required total time in the first step the land division structure must be given which in the furrow model eqs 7 and 8 are used but based on the drainage type of irrigation system such as cutback and reuse other equations are used which are presented in walker and skogerboe 1987 walker 2003 7 n f w f w 8 n s n f q 0 q t the total required time of irrigation practice is found by eq 9 9 t t n s t c o also the land division structure for basin and border irrigation systems is calculated by eqs 10 and 11 10 w 0 q t q 0 11 n b o w f w 0 the design simulations of border and basin surface irrigation are performed based on procedure proposed by walker and skogerboe 1987 in order to explain more clearly the simulation procedure which is used for furrow border and basin is presented in fig 2 in this diagram the input parameters enter the diagram from the top and the performance indicators exit from the bottom as shown in this diagram the input parameters consist of two parts the field input parameters and the surface irrigation design parameters which are given by the optimization parts in each box a part of the simulation calculations is done based on the dependencies between the calculations the boxes are arranged from top to bottom so that the lower boxes depend on the output of the higher boxes and the arrows indicate the dependence between the boxes the final result is the simulation of performance indicators and performance parameters of the irrigation system designed based on farm land inputs 2 2 fuzzy inference system in the proposed model some fuzzy expert systems are used to model the amount of practicality and required labor to apply the irrigation system designed in the farm land considering that most of the available data on the practicality and labor of an irrigation practice are in the form of experiences and knowledge of administrators which is modeled numerically and computationally using the fuzzy expert system the main components of a fuzzy expert system are fuzzification inference knowledge base and defuzzification since the fuzzy expert system uses fuzzy logic all numbers and calculations used in it must be fuzzy but in the proposed model the data is crisp as a result with the help of fuzzification and defuzzification components it is possible to convert data to an expert system and from an expert system also the experiences and knowledge of administrators are created in the form of fuzzy rules and with the help of fuzzy numbers in component knowledge base in fig 3 the main components of the fuzzy expert system and relations between them are shown in the proposed model a fuzzy inference system fis is used in two different architectures in one architecture five fuzzy inference systems are used to model the amount of practicality labor and quality of performance in this model the fis provide three crisp value based on irrigation system design and simulation of the irrigation practice since this model expresses the performance of the irrigation system with three numbers it is called the multi objective model the overview of the fis model for multi objective is shown in fig 4 a fis is designed for modeling the practicality the inputs of this fis are different depending on the irrigation system for furrow irrigation system the inputs are δmid δbase t max t mid y max base δq f δq l δt tf δt tl and numbericerror t max t mid y max and base are the geometrical parameters of irrigation system design δmid is calculated based on equation t max t mid which is used to control constraint t max t mid δbase is calculated based on equation t mid base which is used to control constraint t mid base δq f is calculated based on equation q 0 f q m a x and is used to control constraint q 0f q max in first irrigation practice and δq l has the same role in subsequent irrigations δt tf is calculated based on equation t t f t t and is used to control constraint t tf t t in first irrigation practice and δt tl has the same role in subsequent irrigations numbericerror indicates the occurrence of errors in the simulator calculations because the simulator uses numerical solution methods in some calculations these numerical methods may face problems in that case their simulation results as well as the irrigation system design will be problematic the output of this fis model is in the range of 0 100 the larger the size the better the practicality of the presented design the model details are provided in fig 5 this figure shows the membership functions used to fuzzify the inputs the rules used to inference and the model output membership function with its defuzzification method as shown in fig 5 this fis model uses the 13 rules and uses the center of gradient defuzzyfication method leekwijck and kerre 1999 membership functions and rules are designed based on talking to experts and using their experience maximum is used as s norm and aggregation and minimum as t norm and implication of fis in fuzzy calculation also the mamdani based fis is used in proposed model mamdani and assilian 1975 the fis model proposed for border and basin irrigation systems are the same as the model presented for furrow irrigation system in which only unnecessary inputs in border and basin irrigation system which is shown in fig 4 have been removed and the sections related to deleted inputs have been amended in the rules two fuzzy inference systems is design for modeling the labor the inputs of this fis are different depending on the irrigation system the inputs are l s n s l t t co t t δw f and y max l t is the input parameter of farm land n s t co and t t are calculated in simulator based on the proposed irrigation system design l s and y max are the parameters of the irrigation system design δw f is calculated based on equation w t max which is used to control the ridge width the output of this fis model is in the range of 0 100 the smaller the size the better the labor of the presented design model details are provided in fig 6 this figure shows the membership functions used to fuzzification of the inputs the rules used to inference and the model output membership function with its defuzzification method as shown in fig 6 this fis model uses the 30 rules and uses the center of gradient defuzzyfication method this fis model also has settings and operators similar to the previous fis model also two instance of this model are used in modeling one of which provides output based on the first irrigation parameters and the other performs calculations based on the later irrigation parameters to combine the results of the first and later irrigations labor another fis model combining fis model is used the exact specifications of which are presented in fig 7 the inputs of this combining fis model are the outputs of the two labor fis models the combining model has 10 rules which are presented in fig 7 and estimates the amount of required labor in a numerical value between 0 and 100 a fis model is designed for modeling the performance indicator the inputs of this fis are e a e r dpr twr and du which are the well known performance indicators of irrigation system design for first and later irrigations the output of this fis model is in the range of 0 100 the larger the size the better the performance of the presented design the model details are provided in fig 8 this figure shows the membership functions used to fuzzify the inputs the rules used to inference and the model output membership function with its defuzzification method as shown in fig 8 this fis model uses 19 rules and uses the center of gradient defuzzyfication method this fis model also has settings and operators similar to the previous fis models the second model which is used to estimate the quality and performance of the irrigation system determines the desirability of the proposed design with a number so is called a single objective model the overview of single objective model is given in fig 9 as shown in this figure the difference between multi objective and single objective model is in adding a fis at the end of single objective model this fis provides a number based on the results of three other fuzzy systems which is used as an indicator of the suitability of the designed irrigation system details of the fis used to combine the three metrics are provided in fig 10 as shown it uses 22 rules to inference the settings and operators which are used in this fis are the same as other fuzzy systems that are introduced above fuzzy expert systems are implemented using fuzzylite which is the libraries for fuzzy logic control rada vilela 2018 this tool can be used in different programming languages in this research python has been used fuzzy expert systems are defined in the form of fuzzylite language fll that can be used in fuzzylite jfuzzylogic has also been used to plot membership functions cingolani and alcal fdez 2012 2013 2 3 optimization method due to the complexities in the design of the irrigation system search space such as the large space of the irrigation system design problem finding an efficient design solution requires the use of effective optimization algorithms in the proposed model the irrigation system design is modeled in two multivariate forms a multi objective and a single objective optimization problem there are several parameters influencing the design so it is a multivariate issue as given in section 2 2 there are several effective design objectives for irrigation system design that conflict with each other so it is a multi objective issue in this research using some fuzzy expert systems the variety of objectives in the problem of irrigation system design are combined with each other in the form of the two models first a multi objective model that provide only three indicators to express the desirability of the irrigation system and second a single objective model that is an indicator of the desirability of the irrigation system so the relations between input parameters with objectives are complex that is evident in designed fuzzy expert systems therefore using evolutionary multi objective and single objective algorithms can be a wise decision for the optimization module of the proposed model eiben and smith 2015 according to the procedures proposed in walker and skogerboe 1987 in order to optimally design the irrigation system the provided solution should be an appropriate response in the first irrigation and the later irrigations accordingly changes in the various parameters of agricultural field during the first and subsequent irrigations have been considered the decision variables and input parameters of the proposed model are given in table 1 as mentioned the objectives of the optimization algorithm are two models in the first model a multi objective fis as shown in fig 4 is used the output of which are three indicators in the range of 0 and 100 an indicator determines the amount of practicality the larger the size the more practical the second indicator shows the amount of required labor to run the irrigation system with a number in the range of 0 100 that should be minimized the third indicator shows the performance quality of the irrigation system with a number between 0 and 100 that should be maximized the second model is a single objective problem whose objective is also calculated based on a single objective fis as shown in fig 9 the metric used in this model indicates the desirability of the irrigation system with a number between 0 and 100 that should be maximized therefore in the proposed model both multi objective and single objective algorithms are used for optimizing in the proposed model six different mutli objective evolutionary optimization algorithms as nsgaii deb et al 2002 rnsgaii deb and sundar 2006 nsgaiii deb and jain 2014 rnsgaiii vesikar et al 2018 unsgaiii seada and deb 2016 and moea zhang and li 2007 are used also four different single objective evolutionary optimization algorithms as ga eiben and smith 2015 de price et al 2005 pattern search hooke and jeeves 1961 and cmaes hansen and ostermeier 2001 are used pymoo package which is a python package for multi objective and single objective is used to implement the optimization procedure blank and deb 2020 the simulation optimization

population of generations 2 4 parameter tuning the selected optimization algorithms have some effective parameters assigning appropriate values to these parameters have a significant impact on the quality of the optimization algorithm in general in order to achieve better results from evolutionary optimization algorithms a suitable parameter tuning should be performed eiben and smith 2015 due to the randomness of the evolutionary algorithms their parameter tuning procedure is complex one solution is to use the evolutionary algorithm itself to set the parameters of another evolutionary algorithm called metaga eiben and smith 2015 this method is used in the proposed model for this purpose the components of metaga must be designed the main components are representation fitness function which is called utility function in metaga diversity and selection operators and termination criterion in metaga the mean best fitness mbf is used as the utility function because evolutionary algorithms are random to reliably evaluate an individual of metaga related optimization algorithm is repeated several times taking into account the proposed parameters in this individual then in multi objective model based on a specific weight combination of objective functions the fitness value of the best individual in each iteration is calculated and in single objective model the fitness value of the optimization algorithm is used the mbf is calculated by averaging the best fitness in several iterations b is the number of iteration of the related optimization algorithm the representation of metaga is actually a parameters vector pv of optimization algorithm in proposed model pv is population size offspring number max generation of termination criteria the crossover probability eta parameters of crossover operator eta parameters of mutation operator also the selection and diversity operators used are two point crossover gaussian mutation and tournament selection with k 3 also in order to increase the number of evaluated pv in the parameter tuning process a multistage method along with metaga is used in the multistage method the number of iterations of the algorithm per pv is managed based on the intermediate fitness obtained from its initial evaluations in such a way that only pvs with good intermediate fitness are evaluated by the maximum iteration which is the b this method allows more efficient execution of parameter tuning the procedure of metaga is presented in algorithm 2 deap python library is used for implementing the metaga algorithm fortin 2012 algorithm 2 metaga algorithm for parameter tuning of optimization algorithm table require surface irrigation system known parameters for first irrigation and later irrigations are l t w f k a f 0 v max ensure the

satisfy termination conditions 20 return the best parameters of optimization algorithm based on last population of ga 2 5 experimental fields as the proposed model for a variety of surface irrigation systems is performed the data selected for the experiments include diversity of surface irrigation systems such as furrow in free draining border and basin also in order to compare the results of the proposed model with other similar ones a set of data is selected that has been used as experimental data in other proposed models akbari et al 2018 saberi et al 2020 due to the large number of experimental data parameters the data is not provided here and the parameters can be accessed by referring to the provided references the used parameters in the experiments are as the same as the main parameters of the based data in table 2 experimental fields references and their irrigation system are provided as shown in table 2 the experimental data includes 8 furrow fields three border fields and three basin fields 3 results the proposed simulation optimization model is evaluated and validated by designing a set of experiments on data from 14 farm lands with different characteristics the proposed model is implemented with python language and related libraries the simulation algorithm of the proposed model is implemented from scratch based on the presented theories and algorithms of section 2 1 the simulation part of the proposed model is validated by two well known software programs sirmod walker 2003 and winsrfr bautista et al 2009b the results are presented below as presented the proposed model is introduced by combining fuzzy expert systems and meta heuristic optimization algorithms in the optimization section of the proposed model two categories of single objective and multi objective algorithms are used the inputs of the multi objective model are three outputs produced by fuzzy expert systems that display the practicality labor and performance quality of the designed irrigation system the input of the single objective model is generated using an expert system that receives the previous three quality indicators and produces one output the multi objective model presents a set of designs which are in fact the points of the estimated pareto front of the problem in the optimization algorithm therefore to evaluate the results of the multi objective model candidate points are selected from the set of results presented by the multi objective model based on the weight composition in accordance with the objectives of the problem table 3 presents the set of weight compositions used to extract candidate designs from the output of the multi objective model tables 4 5 6 and 7 present the results of the multi objective model for 14 agricultural fields in tables 4 and 5 the results of border and basin irrigation systems are shown and in tables 6 and 7 the results of furrow irrigation system are presented in tables 4 and 6 the irrigation system designs and the intermediate parameters of the simulation part of the proposed model based on design parameters are given in tables 5 and 7 the performance indicators and fuzzy expert systems related to the presented design in tables 4 and 6 are shown the results presented for the multi objective model are based on weights 1 2 and 4 of table 3 in weight 1 the importance of all three objectives of practicality labor and quality are considered equally in weight 2 only practicality and labor are considered and in weight 4 the importance of quality is greater than practicality and labor based on the presented results it is clear that the proposed designs for weight combinations 1 and 4 are the same but in weight composition 2 due to not considering the quality designs are proposed that are qualitatively undesirable but practical and can be implemented with less labor evaluation of quality metrics and intermediate parameters of simulation determines the performance of fuzzy expert systems for example the amount of labor according to the models presented in section 2 2 is highly dependent on the total time required to irrigate parameter t t and the number of basins these parameters for field 3 and 4 in table 5 has low values so the labor is low as it is shown the designs presented by the multi objective model in terms of application efficiency e a in first and later irrigations which is an important quality metric that should be maximized are above 60 on average and in terms of two other indicators dpr and twr which should be minimized are below 25 on average the results also indicate problems for field 8 in table 6 and 7 although simulation parameters of weight 2 design such as t t and n s are too high labor and practicality are normal which is due to inadequacy of the rules in the expert system in the single objective model an optimal irrigation system is presented for each field and the results for 14 agricultural fields are presented in tables 8 9 10 and 11 the results of single objective model for border and basin irrigation systems are shown in tables 8 and 9 where in table 8 the proposed design for these fields is presented along with some intermediate parameters obtained from the simulation and in table 9 the quality and output of its expert systems are provided information about furrow irrigation system is also presented in tables 10 and 11 in order to compare the results of the multi objective with the single objective model three charts are presented in fig 11 in these charts the outputs of three expert systems for 14 different farm fields are presented fig 11 a shows the amount of practicality which is a number between 0 and 100 and the larger the size the more desirable this chart indicates that the designs presented by the multi objective model are more feasible than the designs presented by the single objective method fig 11 b shows the amount of required labor to implement the proposed design and is a number between 0 and 100 that should be minimized here the output of the multi objective model shows better results than the single objective model also in fig 11 c which specifies the design quality metrics with a number between 0 and 100 the multi objective model has provided better results therefore it can be concluded that the multi objective model provides better results than the single objective model as presented in section 2 4 in order to tuning the parameters of multi objective and single objective optimization algorithms the main parameters of these algorithms are selected using an automatic parameter tuning method called metaga the parameter tuning results for a multi objective and a single objective algorithm are presented as examples in table 12 and table 13 as shown the tuning algorithm select a set of parameters for optimization algorithms which provide better performance 4 discussion in order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method a set of comparisons are performed in experiments comparisons are made in two ways first in order to check the accuracy of the implemented simulation procedure in the proposed model the design obtained by the proposed model is simulated using two well known irrigation system software programs sirmod and winsrfr the results of the simulation part of the proposed model and the results of the simulation by the selected software are presented for six fields in table 14 as the results show the accuracy of the implemented simulation is desirable and the slight difference between the results can be due to the rounding numbers of design parameters also in fig 12 four important graphs obtained by sirmod and winsrfr are presented which are runoff hydrograph surface and subsurface flow profile hydrograph depth profile and hydrograph summary profile the presented graphs in fig 12 also visually show the quality of design which is provided by the proposed model in order to evaluate the results of the proposed model are compared with the results of the three methods in table 15 and table 16 these tables show the best results of each indicator and each field in bold also in order to compare the results of the proposed method with edosim and practical simulation optimization model based on the metric of practicality and labor two diagrams in fig 13 are presented to calculate the practicality and labor of edosim and practical simulation optimization model the design parameters provided by these methods are placed in the expert systems of the proposed model as input and the results are displayed in these diagrams as shown in fig 13 the designs presented by the proposed model have a practicality which is equal to or better than the designs presented by the edosim and practical simulation optimization model also the designs presented by the proposed method require equal or less labor in fields 1 2 3 4 and 6 while in fields 5 8 and 9 require more labor related to the edosim and in most fields they require less labor than practical simulation optimization model differences in practicality and labor are often due to the way that the field is divided in length and width direction as well as times of cut off t co and total time of irrigation practice t t according to the information provided in table 15 and table 16 the designs provided by the proposed model have better quality or very close to the edosim model akbari et al 2018 and multi objective framework model saberi et al 2020 in most fields and for most indicators these results show that the practical simulation optimization model pazouki 2021 provides better quality related to the proposed model however fig 13 show that the designs which are provided by practical simulation optimization model are less desirable than the designs which are provided by the proposed method in terms of practicality and the amount of required labor although in practical simulation optimization model by applying additional constraints and objective functions an attempt has been made to obtain practical designs but since the level of design practicality is not directly calculated and used in the modeling process the results provided by this model do not have the desired practicality despite better quality whereas in the proposed model with direct modeling the amount of practicality of the irrigation designs is more desirable despite the lower quality in order to better understand the capabilities of the proposed model the cause of the obtained results of the comparisons is analyzed based on the structure of the models based on the values which are presented by table 4 and 5 of akbari et al 2018 the edosim model uses very small ranges for decision variables which also vary for different fields in other words in this model by selecting a small and specified range for each agricultural field the search space of irrigation model is very limited as these numbers are different for different fields it is probably required to set these ranges based on the opinion of a person who is familiar with the conditions of each field the most important reason that the designs provided by edosim model have good results in terms of practicality and labor as shown in fig 13 is the limited and specified range of decision variables but the same issue can also lead to unfavorable results in terms of performance quality indicators such as application efficiency in other words one of the reasons that practical simulation optimization model which is proposed in pazouki 2021 provides better results in terms of performance indicators is the wider range of decision variables in practical simulation optimization model the decision variables are both broader and same for all fields as a result the designs obtained by practical simulation optimization model are more desirable in terms of performance indicators but in terms of practicality and labor even worse than edosim in practical simulation optimization model despite the special considerations for practicality as the amount of practicality is not used directly in the model it has not been able to provide desirable results in terms of practicality in the proposed model by quantifying practicality and labor by the fuzzy expert system and using them in modeling the irrigation systems designed by this model in terms of performance indicators practicality and labor have better results than edosim model as shown in table 15 and fig 13 on the other hand the proposed model has provided better results than practical simulation optimization model due to the use of practicality and labor in modeling it can be concluded that first in order to provide an optimal and practical irrigation system edosim model needs to adjust and fit the model for each field in which case the results are desirable in terms of practicality but can be further improved in terms of performance indicators second the practical simulation optimization model designs an optimal irrigation system for each field without the need for precise adjustment which has problems in terms of practicality but offers very good results in terms of performance indicators and third the proposed model designs an irrigation system for each field without the need for precise adjustment which is desirable both in terms of performance indicators and is more feasible in terms of practicality design therefore the proposed model can provide a more optimal irrigation system for each field without the need for specialization 5 conclusion in this paper a simulation optimization model was proposed to design an optimal surface irrigation system for farm fields the proposed model can be used to design the surface irrigation system of furrow border and basin fields which covers more than 90 of the farm lands in the world in the proposed model fuzzy expert systems and meta heuristic algorithms are used the fuzzy expert system calculates the practicality labor and performance quality of the proposed irrigation system the rule base knowledge of the fuzzy expert systems are designed based on the knowledge and experiences of experts the outputs of the fuzzy expert systems were used as objectives in single objective and multi objective model of the meta heuristic algorithms in the proposed model five different fuzzy expert systems and 10 meta heuristic algorithms were used also the parameters of the optimization algorithms were tuned using the multi stage automatic parameter tuning method based on the evolutionary algorithm in order to evaluate the performance accuracy of the proposed model experiments were performed on 14 farm fields with different characteristics the results of the experiments have been evaluated in two ways first in order to evaluate the simulation part of the proposed model the results of the simulation part were compared with the results of two well known simulation software programs sirmod and winsrfr and the performance of the simulation part of the proposed model was determined then the results of the proposed model were compared with the results of the three other models and it was found that the designs presented by the proposed model provide more favorable results both in terms of quality and in terms of practicality and the amount of required labor the designs provided by the proposed model with proper management of the total time of irrigation t t cut off time t co size and type of geometric division of field geometric shape of furrows and basins provide an effective irrigation system for the farmers in effective irrigation qualitative parameters of irrigation such as application efficiency e a the deep percolation ratio dpr and runoff ratio twr are considered

9919,nowadays water scarcity and the increase in energy demand and their associated costs in pressurized irrigation systems are causing serious challenges in addition most of these pressurized irrigation systems has been designed to be operated on demand where irrigation water is continuously available to farmers complexing the daily decision making process of the water user association managers know in advance how much water will be applied by each farmer and its distribution during the day would facilitate the management of the system and would help to optimize the water use and energy costs in this work a new hybrid methodology cangenfis combining multiple input multiple output fuzzy logic artificial neural networks and multiobjective genetic algorithms was developed to model farmer behaviour and short term forecasting the distribution by tariff period of the irrigation depth applied at farm level cangenfis which was developed in matlab was applied to a real water user association located in southwest spain three optimal models for the main crops in the water user association were obtained the average for all tariff periods of the representability r2 and accuracy of the forecasts standard error prediction sep were 0 70 0 76 and 0 85 and 19 9 22 9 and 19 5 for rice maize and tomato crops models respectively keywords irrigation scheduling artificial intelligence canfis genetic algorithm farmer s behaviour modelling 1 introduction irrigated agriculture uses nearly 70 of the total water consumption in the world conforti 2011 this value accounts for up to 90 of the total water resources in arid developing countries bazilian et al 2011 in europe irrigated agriculture uses around 33 of total water used although this figure may reach over 80 in southern europe countries eea 2012 and in the whole mediterranean region thus efficient water use is essential in a sustainable agricultural system because of reduced water availability hunt 2004 mainly in arid and semi arid regions like spain in spain after a national modernization plan of irrigation marm 2010 water use efficiency was improved replacing the obsolete open channel distribution systems by pressurize networks plusquellec 2009 however despite of the upgrading of these water distribution systems allowed to reduce the water used by 21 the energy consumption per unit area was risen by 657 corominas 2010 which may lead to additional costs for farmers that may be unable to afford such expense if their production is devoted to low value crops on the other hand because of this modernization processes most of the new irrigation systems were designed to be operated on demand where water is continuously available to farmers who are free to decide how and when irrigate although the increased operation flexibility is a positive aspect for farmers the management of the whole water distribution system is a more complex task because the hydraulic systems must work under a wide range of operating conditions in terms of flow and pressure in addition since the liberalization of the spanish electricity market on 1st january 2008 the special tariffs for irrigation disappeared and now water users associations wua are subject to the general industrial tariffs whose prices vary along the day and the irrigation season under this scenario of water scarcity the increase in energy demand of the new pressurized irrigation systems the uncertainty associated with irrigation water demand and the liberalization of the electricity market are causing serious challenges in the daily management of the wuas related to this water demand forecasting could be one of the main tools to improve the management of the wuas and help managers in the daily decision making processes the recent revolution of the information and communication technologies icts as well as the development of new low cost sensors capable to automatically collect thousands of robust data of the whole water soil plant atmosphere system has modified the technological environment of the current agriculture the available technology offers new possibilities for the water demand forecasting that may lead to better water and energy use efficiencies making the wuas more sustainable in environmental social and economic aspects in addition the cloud computing development and virtual storage has reduced the storage cost of big data bin and xin 2013 thus the synergism of techniques of artificial intelligence ai such as artificial neural networks anns fuzzy logic fl and genetic algorithms gas allow soft computing to incorporate human knowledge effectively deal with imprecisions and uncertainty and design adaptation strategies for improve the wua management ai techniques have been applied to solve different problems of water resources management and planning such as modelling monthly daily and hourly rainfall runoff process agarwal et al 2006 anctil and rat 2005 real time river level and lake stage forecasting ondimu and murase 2007 or the optimization of the multi crop pattern plan using fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms rezaei et al 2017 previous research also works focused on the prediction of water demand at irrigation district level using neuro genetic algorithms gonzález perea et al 2015 pulido calvo and gutiérrez estrada 2009 however forecasting water demand at individual farmer level is an extremely complex task forecasting of the farmer s behavior was addressed by gonzález perea 2017 and gonzález perea et al 2018 two models were developed to predict the occurrence of the irrigation events gonzález perea 2017 and the daily applied irrigation depth gonzález perea et al 2018 respectively however an optimal daily decision making in wuas requires not only the knowledge of the of irrigation events occurrence and the applied irrigation depths but their hourly distribution since electricity tariffs are organized in hourly periods the knowledge of the hourly distribution of water consumption would be useful for the optimal contracting of these tariffs in this work a hybrid model combining multiple input multiple output mimo of an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis known as co active neuro fuzzy inference system canfis has been developed to forecast one day ahead the distribution in energy tariff periods of the irrigation depths applied at farm level canfis has been optimized by the multiobjective ga nsga ii deb et al 2002 the model which was developed in matlab and integrated as toolbox was validated and tested in a real wua 2 study area and data source canal del zújar irrigation district czid fig 1 was selected as real wua to validate and test the forecast model developed in this study the model was trained and tested with data from the 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 irrigation seasons this wua located in southwest spain extremadura region is made up of 10 independent hydraulic sectors covering a total area of 21141 ha the closest weather station is don benito efa utm coordinates x y zone 252468 431917 30 the average temperature in the area ranges from 7 1 c in january to 25 c in july and the average maximum temperature ranges

daily average value of 7 03 mm and peak values around 9 mm the average annual evapotranspiration is 1296 mm sector ii was selected for this work because of the high amount of available data this sector covers an irrigated area of 2691 ha and is composed of 191 hydrants with a nominal pressure at each hydrant of 25 m the main crops are tomato maize and rice 90 of the total irrigated area the number of samples water depth records of each crop was 54 475 18 568 and 4451 for tomato maize and rice respectively drip irrigation is used for tomato and maize while rice is flood irrigated the typical annual irrigation needs for these crops of this wua are 6110 m3 ha 1 5950 m3 ha 1 and 11 103 m3 ha 1 respectively the average and standard deviation of the area of the farms are 1 15 ha and 2 08 ha respectively however the largest farm covers an area of 26 ha sector ii of the czid has a remote telemetry system which records every hour the volume of water applied in each hydrant in addition for each hydrant information about supplied farm and crops are also recorded the electrical tariff in this wua is organized in six periods being period 1 p1 the most expensive period and period 6 p6 the cheapest one fig 2 shows the temporal distribution of each period along the irrigation season 3 methodology 3 1 model inputs identification a previous step to generate the hybrid model is needed to reduce the dimension of the input space and identify the significant inputs from the full set of possible inputs there are many techniques to achieve this inputs space reduction principal components analysis or partial least square cardinal components are two of these techniques widely used however when the significant input variables resulting from these techniques are used in nonlinear models very poor results are usually got lin et al 1996 therefore an adaptation of the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 has been used in this work to identify the significant inputs lin et al 1996 determined automatically the most significant inputs for a single output variable using fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces because of the mimo multiple input multiple output nature of the hybrid model developed in this work an extension n dimensional of the fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces have been developed thus the fuzzy curves have been extended to a beam of n fuzzy and fuzzy surfaces have been transformed to n dimensional fuzzy curves the number of output variables of the predictive model defined the n dimensionality of the fuzzy curves and surfaces for a potential input variable iv piiv fuzzy curve beams c iv ov are created eq 1 each curve determined the relationship between iv and the output variable ov of the forecasting model dwa ov daily amount of water applied by each farmer in the energy tariff period ov 1 c iv ov pi iv k 1 m ov dwa k ov μ iv k ov p i iv k 1 m ov μ iv k ov pi iv for ov 1 n ov where µ iv k ov is the fuzzy membership function of point k in the space iv dwa ov which relates the potential input variable iv and the daily amount of water applied by each farmer in the energy tariff period ov and it is defined by eq 2 m ov is the total number of points in the space piiv dwaov dwa k ov is the daily amount of water applied by each farmer in point k of the space pi iv dwa ov and n ov is the total number of output variables of the forecast model 2 μ iv k ov pi iv exp pi iv k ov pi iv b 2 for ov 1 n ov where pi iv k ov is the value of pi iv at point k in the space pi iv dwa ov and b takes a value close to two lin et al 1996 hereafter the mean square error values mse of each c iv ov curve are computed and sorted in ascending order according to eq 3 if there is a fully random relationship between the input variable iv and the dwa ov the fuzzy curves is flat and the msec iv ov is large otherwise msec iv ov takes small values when the relationship in the space pi iv dwa ov is more significant 3 mse c iv ov 1 m ov k 1 m ov c iv k ov pi iv dwa k ov 2 for ov 1 n ov according to lin et al 1996 a fuzzy surface is a space with a two dimensional fuzzy curve in this work a fuzzy surface beams fs iv ij ov defined in eq 4 have been used 4 fs iv ij ov pi iv ov pi ij ov k 1 m ov dwa k ov μ iv k ov pi iv ov μ ij k ov pi ij ov k 1 m ov μ iv k ov pi iv ov μ ij k ov pi ij ov for ov 1 n ov where pi iv ov and pi ij ov are two potential input variables for output variable ov then similarly to eq 3 the mse is computed for each fuzzy surface mse fs iv ij ov thus fuzzy curves are initially used to rank all the potential input variables in ascending order the pi variable with the smallest msec iv ov is the most important input variable for each output variable ov fuzzy surfaces are then used to find the independent input variables and to eliminate the related input in each step 20 eliminated according to lin et al 1996 therefore in each step new fuzzy surfaces are computed and 20 of the potential input variable with the largest mse fs iv ij ov is eliminated 3 2 coactive neuro fuzzy inference system canfis a coactive neuro fuzzy inference system canfis is an extension of an adaptative network fuzzy inference system anfis jang et al 1997 which integrates fuzzy inference systems fiss and artificial neural networks anns linked to a mimo system in the same methodology canfis model can create different regions specialized in specific tasks such as different amount of water applied in different tariff period fis recreates the human thinking by a nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs based on a set of if then rules with the aim of making understandable the input variable to the rule set the input variables are converted into linguistic variables by membership functions mfs therefore building a fis consist of determining the mfs for each input variables as well as the rule set the rule set and mfs form the knowledge base of the fis on the other hand the main drawback to obtain an optimal fis is the lack of systematic procedures to determine its knowledge base however artificial neural networks can learn their structure from the input output sets thus in this work under mimo framework a canfis model resulting from the combination of an ann and a fis was created to define the mf parameters canfis can also find the rule base through the ann learning ability to set the relationship between input and output the typical structure of a canfis is made up by five layers fig 3 where square nodes are adaptive nodes and circles nodes are fixed nodes and their functions are described as follows the first layer layer 1 which is known as fuzzification layer uses the mfs to computes the outputs outn l n and l are the node and layer indexes respectively each node n of this layer is a square node with a node function which is shown in eq 5 and 6 each outn i l corresponds to the n th linguistic term of the i th input variable inp i e g the value of the variable evapotranspiration is 9 5 mm and it is turned into the linguistic term the evapotranspiration is high 5 out n i 1 μ n inp i unlike previous works in this work the optimal typology of each mf will be determined by a ga the different mf typologies considered during the optimization process will be described in section 2 4 every node in layer 2 is a circle node labelled π which multiplies all the incoming signals coming from layer 1 and sends the product out to the next this layer is known as firing strength it contains the rule nodes and it computes the activation value of each fuzzy rule w r as eq 6 out r 2 w r n 1 n in put out nm 1 for all the term nodes m connected to the r th rule node 6 r 1 nrules where n input is the total number of inputs and n rules is the total number of rules the third layer computes the rational firing strength of each nodes which is represented as circle node and labelled n thus for convenience outputs of this layer are called normalized firing strengths and they are computed according to the following equation 7 out r 3 w r out r 2 nr 1 n rules out nr 2 for r 1 n rules the defuzzification phase is carried out by layer 4 consequence parameters thus the output of each node is the output of each r th fuzzy rule that influences the ov th model output eq 8 8 o u t r o v 4 w r f r o v w r a 1 r o v i n p 1 a 2 r o v i n p 2 a n i n p u t r o v i n p n i n p u t a 0 r o v for r 1 n r u l e s ov 1 n o v where a 1 r ov a 2 r ov a n input r ov a 0 r ov are the consequent parameters of the canfis system that represent the contribution of the r th rule to the ov th output finally in layer 5 is represented as fixed node and labelled as in this layer each ov th model output is computed as the algebraic sum of the ov th node s inputs eq 9 9 o u t o v 5 r n r u l e s o u t r o v 4 for o v 1 n o v due to the complexity of the developed model and its computational efficiency a first order takagi sugeno type of fis was selected takagi and sugeno 1985 in this work while the antecedent part if is always fuzzy the consequent part then is a crisp linear function of an antecedent variable thus three examples of typical first order takagi sugeno fis rules are rule 1 1 if inp 1 is a 1 and inp 2 is b 1 and inp 3 is c 1 then f 1 1 a 1 1 1 inp 1 a 2 1 1 inp 2 a 3 1 1 inp 3 a 0 1 1 rule 1 2 if inp 1 is a 1 and inp 2 is b 1 and inp 3 is c 1 then f 1 2 a 1 1 2 inp 1 a 2 1 2 inp 2 a 3 1 2 inp 3 a 0 1 2 rule 2 1 if inp 1 is a 2 and inp 2 is b 2 and inp 3 is c 2 then f 2 1 a 1 2 1 inp 1 a 2 2 1 inp 2 a 3 2 1 inp 3 a 0 2 1 both the total number of rules and consequent parameters a 1 1 1 a 2 1 1 a 0 2 1 will be automatically determined by the ann during the training process of the canfis model in conventional anns a simple back propagation algorithm is usually used to train and adjust the weights which connects the neurons of different layers in cafis structure the parameters of the premises and consequents play the role of weights the effectiveness of the developed fis depends on these parameters thus with the aim to improve the training process recursive least squares estimation rlse haykin 2002 was used in this work as training algorithm of the canfis model rlse is an adaptive filter algorithm that recursively finds the coefficients a 1 r ov a 2 r ov a n input r ov a 0 r ov that minimize a weighted linear least squares cost function relating to the model input although this algorithm is computationally complex its computational development has been implemented for this work it has also extremely faster convergence than other training algorithm lewis and hwang 1990 3 3 coactive neuro genetic fuzzy inference system cangenfis the rule base and the mf parameters which defines the mf s shape is determined by an ann in the canfis model however before defining the mf parameters the number of mfs which defines each discourse universe of each input variable as well as the mf types that characterizes every linguistic label must be defined canfis model is not able to automatically determine these essential variables for fis and hence in most previous works are determined by trial and error without an optimization criterion thus with the aim to optimize automatically both mfs number and the mf types an hybrid model cangenfis which combines a canfis model and the multiobjective ga nsga ii deb et al 2002 has been developed in this work furthermore two essential parameters must be considered in the training process of the canfis model forgetting factor λ which reduces the influence of old data in the determination of the synaptic weights of the canfis model haykin 2002 and the learning rate lr which defines the updating rate of the mfs parameters hagan et al 1996 although these parameters are highly sensitive in the accuracy of the forecasted model standard values of these parameters are usually considered by most of the previous works independently of the problem nature in this work these parameters are also optimized by the cangenfis model cangenfis model optimizes their decision variables mfs number mf types λ and lr based on two objective functions of 1 and of 2 of 1 maximizes the average of the determination coefficient of the model outputs irrigation depth in each tariff periods for the testing dataset of the cangenfis model of 2 minimizes the average and deviation of the standard error prediction sep ventura et al 1995 of the cangenfis standard deviation was considered to avoid the tendency to improve some specific outputs of the cangenfis model e g forecasting of the irrigation depth applied in p6 fig 4 shows the flow chart of the generation and optimization the cangenfis model initially an initial population of npop size is randomly generated each chromosome chr or individual of the initial population is made up of ndec decision variables or genes that represent each hyperparameter of the cangenfis model to be optimized in this work the chromosome size is variable and depends on the number of inputs ninp to the forecasting model table 1 shows the decision variable genes considered in this work for ninp inputs in cangenfis model as well as the value range that everyone can take during the optimization process the first ninp genes determine the division of the discourse universe of each input variable of the predictive model the next ninp genes define the type of the membership function of each input variable which transform the crisp input values into fuzzy input values and represent the activation function of the neurones of the first layer of cangenfis model learning rate and forgetting factor are represented by the last two genes respectively once the initial population is created where the first ninp 2 genes of each chromosome chr define the architecture of the chr model and the two last genes defines the complete chr model architecture learning way each individual of this population is trained and the knowledge base each forecasted model is obtained after that each of these trained models are tested and the objective function of1 and of2 are computed then it is necessary to sort the initial population according to its aptitude i e its forecast capacity objective functions the best npop 2 individuals are then selected as the best individual of the initial population in the remaining stages the npop 2 individuals are modified crossover and mutation and a new population of npop individuals is generated the process was repeated for several generations ngen finally the set of npop optimal individuals optimal cangenfis models obtained in the last generation defines the pareto front the computational cost mainly in computational time and memory that the training process of each individual in each population required is hugely high thus the number of epochs during the training phase of each forecast model must be limited consequently at the end of the optimization process the best models in terms of hyperparameters is obtained however the synaptic weights of the neural network i e the knowledge base are not yet optimized as it has not had enough time enough training epochs to adjust them hence once the optimal models have been defined on the pareto front they must be retrained without restriction of training epochs obtaining the optimal knowledge base of the model 4 results and discussion the methodology developed was applied to czid during the 2015 2016 and 2017 irrigation seasons to forecast one day ahead the distribution in energy tariff periods of the irrigation depths applied at farm level by each farmer in the wua the complete dataset of irrigation depths applied contained a total of 77794 measures due to the differences of the irrigation practices for the main three crops and their impact on the applied irrigation depths gonzález perea et al 2018 the full dataset was classified according to the three main crops rice maize and tomato each of these datasets were randomly divided into two subsets training dataset 80 and testing dataset 20 the hyperparameters of the forecasting models were optimized by the multiobjective nsga ii genetic algorithm the number of individuals that must make up the initial population is related to the number and range of each gene thus the random initial population random cangenfis models consisted of 100 individuals or chromosomes npop 100 for each one of the main crops the number of generations depends on the stabilization time of each objective function this stabilization is related to each problem and should not be pre set allowing the genetic algorithm to achieve its own stabilization consequently the initial population was evolved for 300 40 and 70 generations ngen 300 40 and 70 for rice maize and tomato respectively where the values of of1 and of2 were stabilized the probabilities for mutation and crossover were set to 10 and 90 respectively 4 1 model inputs the most important inputs for cangenfis model were selected from a set of 21 potential inputs following the methodology described in section 2 2 table 2 shows the potential inputs evaluated and table 3 shows the most important inputs selected after applying the methodology of section 2 2 the most representative inputs and therefore the input variables of cangenfis model were number of hours of p1 p2 and p6 in the day to forecast weekday applied irrigation depth mm and day of the year doi the applied irrigation depth of the day to be forecasted is an essential input for the model when these models are working in real time in a wua this input can be also obtained in real time using the previous model developed by gonzález perea et al 2018 as table 3 shows the distribution in tariff period does not depends on any agroclimatic variables not even the farm size or non working days contrarily to the previous works were these variables were essential to forecast the daily irrigation scheduling these inputs highlight that the distribution in tariff period of the daily irrigation depth applied depends almost exclusively on hourly energy price of the tariff fig 2 in other words the distribution by tariff periods of the irrigation water applied depends more on the price of each tariff period than on the particularities or cultural habits of each farmer therefore only information about the two expensive p1 and p2 and the cheapest p6 tariff periods mi1 mi2 and mi3 respectively as well as the total amount of the irrigation water and the day of year and week mi4 and mi6 is required 4 2 pareto front of the optimization process by ga the modified genetic algorithm nsga ii optimized the objective functions maximizing of1 and minimizing of2 the random initial population of 100 chromosomes or individuals evolved over 300 40 and 70 generations for rice maize and tomato respectively each individual consisted of 14 genes 2 ninput lr λ because the number of input variables ninput was 6 fig 5 shows the pareto fronts obtained in the last generation for rice star mark maize cross mark and tomato square mark this figure shows that the three crops are clearly different obtaining the tomato model the best values of of1 and of2 ranging from 0 647 to 0 666 and from 0 198 to 0 204 respectively the of1 and of2 values ranged from 0 512 to 0 527 and from 0 254 to 0 26 respectively for the forecasting models developed for rice maize models obtained the widest range of values their objective functions ranged from 0 551 to 0 61 for of1 and from 0 254 to 0 288 for of2 the three pareto fronts show that both objective functions are clearly in conflict consequently as the representativeness of the predictive models represented by of1 the accuracy of the forecasting models represented by of2 decreased this sensitivity of the models between accuracy and representativeness is much more pronounced in the models developed for maize crops as the slope of this pareto front is steeper than the other two both the larger range of the values of the objective functions and the slope of the pareto front for the maize crop is relate to the number of generations during the optimization process the maize model needed the lower number of generations to stabilize their objective functions the methodology developed considered the effect of the random initial population over the evolution of the optimization process and a clock dynamic seed was programmed to avoid this effect in the evolution of the population therefore the differences of the ngen value in the three crops are related to the nature of the problem i e the differences in irrigation water management between crops and not to an effect associated with random initiation of the initial population consequently the maize model was easier to obtain than the other two crops in addition as reported by gonzález perea et al 2018 the irrigation water management in this crop is easier to reproduce and better results can be obtained than in the other two crops due to the irrigation method flood irrigation rice is the crop that needed the most ngen value to stabilise their objective functions and the one with the worst values of accuracy and representativeness this will be discussed below where the best model for each crop is analysed the architecture and the other hyperparameters of each model are defined by the values of each gene of each individual the generalization ability of a model capacity to reproduce previously unobserved events as in the test set depends on these genes the pareto fronts of rice and tomato did not show variation of the objective function values this indicates that the number of training epochs was insufficient and these models did not have enough time to find the best values of their synaptic weights consequently the values of the objective functions were insensitive to the different hyperparameters genes of each individual each model in order words in rice and tomato s pareto fronts the effect of the number of training epochs is more restrictive than the network architecture however the optimization process of the genetic algorithm does ensure that these individuals were the best w r t the others analysed during the optimization process and the fastest to train even if further refinement of their synaptic weights is necessary considering the values of each objective function one individual per crop has been selected as the best one thus fig 4 shows the best individual the best forecasting model from rice crop i r maize crop i m and tomato crop i t these individuals will be analysed in the next section 4 3 optimal cangenfis models the best individual cangenfis models for each crop type in each pareto front was selected thus i r i m and i t represents the best individual for rice maize and tomato respectively table 4 shows the gene values that make up each cangenfis model as well as the r2 and sep values of the test set after the refining process without limitations of the number of training epochs the partition of the discourse universe number of mfs of each input variable was clearly stablished in 3 except for mi5 in the rice model mi5 and mi6 in the maize model and mi6 in the tomato model the minimum and maximum values that these genes would take ranged from 2 to 5 for no input variable in any developed model i r i m and i t these genes corresponding to the partitions of their discourse universe tended to their maximum values these genes could range from 2 to 5 consequently the range of values for these genes during the optimization process was properly established a tendency towards any of the lower or upper limits would indicate the need to modify this range and repeat the optimization process of the genetic algorithm table 5 shows the linguistic variables for each one of the partitions of the discourse universe of each input variable for the three models assessed in the three models the number of hours in p1 p2 and p6 mi1 mi2 and mi3 respectively in the forecasted day were addressed in the same way for farmers who irrigate rice maize or tomato thus the linguistic variables or the reasoning that all farmers consider about the distribution of these hours for every day as high hi medium m or low lo i e the behaviour of each farmer in the wua in deciding how to apply the irrigation depth on a given day is conditioned by whether the number of hours available is high medium or low for the two most expensive tariff period p1 and p2 and the cheapest period p6 similarly for all farmers the week is divided into early week lo mid week m and late week hi it is reasonable that the partition of the discourse universe for this variable would have been 2 weekend and all other days since the distribution of the tariff periods is conditioned by weekends fig 2 however the results for this input variable mi4 show that it is also important whether the farmer is at the beginning or in the middle of the week possibly conditioned by his activity during the weekend and some other socio cultural practices that should be studied in detail the applied irrigation depth mi5 was processed differently for rice and maize than for tomato while for rice and maize considers high h or low l irrigation depths for tomato high h medium m or low l irrigation depths are considered the irrigation season was also divided differently depending on the crop type the decision of the distribution of the daily applied irrigation depth is conditioned whether doi mi6 is at the beginning middle or end of the irrigation season for rice however for maize and tomato the irrigation season was divided into early or late this way of considering the irrigation season is related to the irrigation system of each crop rice is irrigated by flooding maize and tomato by drip irrigation i e farmers with rice irrigated by flooding and vary their irrigation management according to three periods of the irrigation season beginning middle and end however the irrigation management of farmers with tomato and maize is affected only by two periods along the irrigation season this division of the irrigation season has not only been caused by the irrigation method but also the different phenological stages of each crop table 4 also shows the type of mfs for each input variable and each model the crop cycle the irrigation system and the daily irrigation depths to be applied in rice differ greatly from maize and tomato consequently the way in which the knowledge base of the fuzzy inference system of each cangenfis model transforms the crisp input values into linguistic variables fuzzy values is very similar for maize and tomato moving away from the behaviour for rice apart from the days of the week mi4 the knowledge base of the rice model is totally different from the other two models the values of learning rate were 3 89 10 6 10 6 and 1 21 10 3 for i r i m and i t respectively the optimal lr value depends on the shape of the n dimensional error function or cost function between the target value and the forecasted values during the training process thus in those error functions where the decreasing error path can clearly be found it is possible to increase the value of lr speeding up the training process however the error functions with more tortuous paths to their global minima cannot have very high lr value as they would not find this minimum value results show that the n dimensional space of the error function of i t model is less tortuous and easier to find an optimal point than the others due to it achieved the lower value of lr contrary i m obtained the lower value of lr forgetting factor is a hyperparameter of the training function used in this work rls this hyperparameter defines the amount of information which is forgotten in each step of the recursive training process the smaller value of λ the smaller is the contribution of previous sample to the covariance matrix of the rls algorithm this makes the algorithm more sensitive to recent samples or recent records rather than older ones thus the λ values for i r i m and i t were 0 9855 1 and 0 9775 respectively i m model is the only that obtain a value of 1 for this hyperparameter when the forgetting factor is 1 it is referred to as the growing window rls algorithm the representativeness and the accuracy of the three models selected are defined by the r2 and sep values and it also shows in table 4 the r2 values for i r i m and i t were 0 70 0 76 and 0 85 respectively the sep values for these three models were 19 9 22 9 and 19 5 respectively thus the i t model was the most accurate with the highest representativeness and lower error than 20 for 85 of the forecasting as gonzález perea et al 2018 shown in their results the rice model is the most complex probably because their irrigation system and the amount of data for this crop type consequently this work confirms these findings and also obtains the lowest representativeness although the accuracy was lower than 20 however the three models are mimo i e each model receives the input variable from mi1 to mi6 and return the distribution the applied irrigation depth in a day d for each tariff period from p1 to p6 thus the r2 and sep values are an average of the six outputs of each model figs 6 8 shows the scatterplots between observed and estimated irrigation water for the test dataset for the models i r i m and i t respectively for i r the r2 values ranged from 0 57 for p4 to 0 91 for p6 however the sep values ranged from 36 58 in p6 to 11 95 in p3 similarly the r2 values for i m and i r models ranged from 0 64 in p4 to 0 90 in p6 and from 0 82 in p2 to 0 94 in p6 respectively the sep values for these two models ranged from 38 86 in p6 to 12 62 in p5 and from 30 94 in p6 to 12 13 in p5 respectively for the three models the highest r2 value was obtained in p6 but with the highest sep value contrary the lowest sep value was found in p5 for i m and i t models and in p3 for i r model figs 6 8 also show that most of the irrigation water is logically applied in the cheapest tariff period p6 also larger farms with highest irrigation water inputs higher volume of irrigation water applied trend to maximize the input in the cheapest period consequently the most expensive tariff period p1 hardly exceeds 200 m3 per irrigation event with more than 95 of the tomato and maize farms are less than 5 ha and no rice farms are larger than 8 ha only 3 farms between 5 ha and 8 ha it is important to highlight that figs 6 8 show how the second cheapest tariff period p5 is the one that receives less irrigation water when intuitively it should be the second period receiving more water this is a consequence of the distribution of the tariff periods fig 2 throughout the irrigation season while p6 is in one of the months of the irrigation season with highest crop water requirements p5 is at the beginning and end of the irrigation season when the theoretical irrigation requirements are smaller these asymmetric distribution of the irrigation water between the tariff periods are responsible for the variation in the r2 and sep values between tariff periods as the architecture of the three models have been adapted and optimized for these conditions as more records are obtained in each of these tariff periods the models will learn and improve their accuracy in an autonomous and automatic way 5 conclusions the prediction of irrigation events occurrence and applied irrigation depths was previously addressed in previous works however the optimization of irrigation water use and the energy contracting requires also the knowledge of their distribution throughout the day thus a new hybrid methodology cangenfis combining multiple inputs multiple outputs fuzzy logic artificial neural networks and multiobjective genetic algorithms has been developed to forecast the intra daily distribution of each irrigation event the new methodology developed in matlab was applied to a real wua and three models were calibrated for rice maize and tomato although some differences between tariff periods were observed the r2 and sep values for the three models were 0 70 0 76 and 0 85 and 19 9 22 9 and 19 5 respectively cangenfis also optimized the inputs of the three forecasting models following fuzzy logic techniques contrarily to the forecasting of daily water demand the distribution by tariff periods did not depend on any agroclimatic variables these findings highlight that the hourly distribution of the daily irrigation events depend almost exclusively on tariff periods according to their price finally these models provide the amount of water that each farmer of the wua is going to apply in each energy tariff period one day ahead the aggregation of this information for the total number of farmers in the wua provides the total amount of water one day in advance but discriminated by energy tariff period in addition the farms are geopositioned so managers will know in advance which pipes can be overloaded thus with these models the manager have an overview about the circulating flows in the network the day after but also the distribution of water demand and therefore the power requirements in each tariff period could be estimated this information can be very

9919,nowadays water scarcity and the increase in energy demand and their associated costs in pressurized irrigation systems are causing serious challenges in addition most of these pressurized irrigation systems has been designed to be operated on demand where irrigation water is continuously available to farmers complexing the daily decision making process of the water user association managers know in advance how much water will be applied by each farmer and its distribution during the day would facilitate the management of the system and would help to optimize the water use and energy costs in this work a new hybrid methodology cangenfis combining multiple input multiple output fuzzy logic artificial neural networks and multiobjective genetic algorithms was developed to model farmer behaviour and short term forecasting the distribution by tariff period of the irrigation depth applied at farm level cangenfis which was developed in matlab was applied to a real water user association located in southwest spain three optimal models for the main crops in the water user association were obtained the average for all tariff periods of the representability r2 and accuracy of the forecasts standard error prediction sep were 0 70 0 76 and 0 85 and 19 9 22 9 and 19 5 for rice maize and tomato crops models respectively keywords irrigation scheduling artificial intelligence canfis genetic algorithm farmer s behaviour modelling 1 introduction irrigated agriculture uses nearly 70 of the total water consumption in the world conforti 2011 this value accounts for up to 90 of the total water resources in arid developing countries bazilian et al 2011 in europe irrigated agriculture uses around 33 of total water used although this figure may reach over 80 in southern europe countries eea 2012 and in the whole mediterranean region thus efficient water use is essential in a sustainable agricultural system because of reduced water availability hunt 2004 mainly in arid and semi arid regions like spain in spain after a national modernization plan of irrigation marm 2010 water use efficiency was improved replacing the obsolete open channel distribution systems by pressurize networks plusquellec 2009 however despite of the upgrading of these water distribution systems allowed to reduce the water used by 21 the energy consumption per unit area was risen by 657 corominas 2010 which may lead to additional costs for farmers that may be unable to afford such expense if their production is devoted to low value crops on the other hand because of this modernization processes most of the new irrigation systems were designed to be operated on demand where water is continuously available to farmers who are free to decide how and when irrigate although the increased operation flexibility is a positive aspect for farmers the management of the whole water distribution system is a more complex task because the hydraulic systems must work under a wide range of operating conditions in terms of flow and pressure in addition since the liberalization of the spanish electricity market on 1st january 2008 the special tariffs for irrigation disappeared and now water users associations wua are subject to the general industrial tariffs whose prices vary along the day and the irrigation season under this scenario of water scarcity the increase in energy demand of the new pressurized irrigation systems the uncertainty associated with irrigation water demand and the liberalization of the electricity market are causing serious challenges in the daily management of the wuas related to this water demand forecasting could be one of the main tools to improve the management of the wuas and help managers in the daily decision making processes the recent revolution of the information and communication technologies icts as well as the development of new low cost sensors capable to automatically collect thousands of robust data of the whole water soil plant atmosphere system has modified the technological environment of the current agriculture the available technology offers new possibilities for the water demand forecasting that may lead to better water and energy use efficiencies making the wuas more sustainable in environmental social and economic aspects in addition the cloud computing development and virtual storage has reduced the storage cost of big data bin and xin 2013 thus the synergism of techniques of artificial intelligence ai such as artificial neural networks anns fuzzy logic fl and genetic algorithms gas allow soft computing to incorporate human knowledge effectively deal with imprecisions and uncertainty and design adaptation strategies for improve the wua management ai techniques have been applied to solve different problems of water resources management and planning such as modelling monthly daily and hourly rainfall runoff process agarwal et al 2006 anctil and rat 2005 real time river level and lake stage forecasting ondimu and murase 2007 or the optimization of the multi crop pattern plan using fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms rezaei et al 2017 previous research also works focused on the prediction of water demand at irrigation district level using neuro genetic algorithms gonzález perea et al 2015 pulido calvo and gutiérrez estrada 2009 however forecasting water demand at individual farmer level is an extremely complex task forecasting of the farmer s behavior was addressed by gonzález perea 2017 and gonzález perea et al 2018 two models were developed to predict the occurrence of the irrigation events gonzález perea 2017 and the daily applied irrigation depth gonzález perea et al 2018 respectively however an optimal daily decision making in wuas requires not only the knowledge of the of irrigation events occurrence and the applied irrigation depths but their hourly distribution since electricity tariffs are organized in hourly periods the knowledge of the hourly distribution of water consumption would be useful for the optimal contracting of these tariffs in this work a hybrid model combining multiple input multiple output mimo of an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis known as co active neuro fuzzy inference system canfis has been developed to forecast one day ahead the distribution in energy tariff periods of the irrigation depths applied at farm level canfis has been optimized by the multiobjective ga nsga ii deb et al 2002 the model which was developed in matlab and integrated as toolbox was validated and tested in a real wua 2 study area and data source canal del zújar irrigation district czid fig 1 was selected as real wua to validate and test the forecast model developed in this study the model was trained and tested with data from the 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 irrigation seasons this wua located in southwest spain extremadura region is made up of 10 independent hydraulic sectors covering a total area of 21141 ha the closest weather station is don benito efa utm coordinates x y zone 252468 431917 30 the average temperature in the area ranges from 7 1 c in january to 25 c in july and the average maximum temperature ranges from 13 2 c to 35 1 c the average relative humidity ranged from 30 06 to 99 8 with a mean value of 66 17 and a standard deviation of 17 30 the average annual rainfall is 390 mm with an average daily value of 1 03 mm but with maximum daily values that reach 20 mm the average wind speed ranged from 0 25 m s 1 to 7 43 m s 1 for the studied seasons the maximum evapotranspiration occurs in july with a daily average value of 7 03 mm and peak values around 9 mm the average annual evapotranspiration is 1296 mm sector ii was selected for this work because of the high amount of available data this sector covers an irrigated area of 2691 ha and is composed of 191 hydrants with a nominal pressure at each hydrant of 25 m the main crops are tomato maize and rice 90 of the total irrigated area the number of samples water depth records of each crop was 54 475 18 568 and 4451 for tomato maize and rice respectively drip irrigation is used for tomato and maize while rice is flood irrigated the typical annual irrigation needs for these crops of this wua are 6110 m3 ha 1 5950 m3 ha 1 and 11 103 m3 ha 1 respectively the average and standard deviation of the area of the farms are 1 15 ha and 2 08 ha respectively however the largest farm covers an area of 26 ha sector ii of the czid has a remote telemetry system which records every hour the volume of water applied in each hydrant in addition for each hydrant information about supplied farm and crops are also recorded the electrical tariff in this wua is organized in six periods being period 1 p1 the most expensive period and period 6 p6 the cheapest one fig 2 shows the temporal distribution of each period along the irrigation season 3 methodology 3 1 model inputs identification a previous step to generate the hybrid model is needed to reduce the dimension of the input space and identify the significant inputs from the full set of possible inputs there are many techniques to achieve this inputs space reduction principal components analysis or partial least square cardinal components are two of these techniques widely used however when the significant input variables resulting from these techniques are used in nonlinear models very poor results are usually got lin et al 1996 therefore an adaptation of the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 has been used in this work to identify the significant inputs lin et al 1996 determined automatically the most significant inputs for a single output variable using fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces because of the mimo multiple input multiple output nature of the hybrid model developed in this work an extension n dimensional of the fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces have been developed thus the fuzzy curves have been extended to a beam of n fuzzy and fuzzy surfaces have been transformed to n dimensional fuzzy curves the number of output variables of the predictive model defined the n dimensionality of the fuzzy curves and surfaces for a potential input variable iv piiv fuzzy curve beams c iv ov are created eq 1 each curve determined the relationship between iv and the output variable ov of the forecasting model dwa ov daily amount of water applied by each farmer in the energy tariff period ov 1 c iv ov pi iv k 1 m ov dwa k ov μ iv k ov p i iv k 1 m ov μ iv k ov pi iv for ov 1 n ov where µ iv k ov is the fuzzy membership function of point k in the space iv dwa ov which relates the potential input variable iv and the daily amount of water applied by each farmer in the energy tariff period ov and it is defined by eq 2 m ov is the total number of points in the space piiv dwaov dwa k ov is the daily amount of water applied by each farmer in point k of the space pi iv dwa ov and n ov is the total number of output variables of the forecast model 2 μ iv k ov pi iv exp pi iv k ov pi iv b 2 for ov 1 n ov where pi iv k ov is the value of pi iv at point k in the space pi iv dwa ov and b takes a value close to two lin et al 1996 hereafter the mean square error values mse of each c iv ov curve are computed and sorted in ascending order according to eq 3 if there is a fully random relationship between the input variable iv and the dwa ov the fuzzy curves is flat and the msec iv ov is large otherwise msec iv ov takes small values when the relationship in the space pi iv dwa ov is more significant 3 mse c iv ov 1 m ov k 1 m ov c iv k ov pi iv dwa k ov 2 for ov 1 n ov according to lin et al 1996 a fuzzy surface is a space with a two dimensional fuzzy curve in this work a fuzzy surface beams fs iv ij ov defined in eq 4 have been used 4 fs iv ij ov pi iv ov pi ij ov k 1 m ov dwa k ov μ iv k ov pi iv ov μ ij k ov pi ij ov k 1 m ov μ iv k ov pi iv ov μ ij k ov pi ij ov for ov 1 n ov where pi iv ov and pi ij ov are two potential input variables for output variable ov then similarly to eq 3 the mse is computed for each fuzzy surface mse fs iv ij ov thus fuzzy curves are initially used to rank all the potential input variables in ascending order the pi variable with the smallest msec iv ov is the most important input variable for each output variable ov fuzzy surfaces are then used to find the independent input variables and to eliminate the related input in each step 20 eliminated according to lin et al 1996 therefore in each step new fuzzy surfaces are computed and 20 of the potential input variable with the largest mse fs iv ij ov is eliminated 3 2 coactive neuro fuzzy inference system canfis a coactive neuro fuzzy inference system canfis is an extension of an adaptative network fuzzy inference system anfis jang et al 1997 which integrates fuzzy inference systems fiss and artificial neural networks anns linked to a mimo system in the same methodology canfis model can create different regions specialized in specific tasks such as different amount of water applied in different tariff period fis recreates the human thinking by a nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs based on a set of if then rules with the aim of making understandable the input variable to the rule set the input variables are converted into linguistic variables by membership functions mfs therefore building a fis consist of determining the mfs for each input variables as well as the rule set the rule set and mfs form the knowledge base of the fis on the other hand the main drawback to obtain an optimal fis is the lack of systematic procedures to determine its knowledge base however artificial neural networks can learn their structure from the input output sets thus in this work under mimo framework a canfis model resulting from the combination of an ann and a fis was created to define the mf parameters canfis can also find the rule base through the ann learning ability to set the relationship between input and output the typical structure of a canfis is made up by five layers fig 3 where square nodes are adaptive nodes and circles nodes are fixed nodes and their functions are described as follows the first layer layer 1 which is known as fuzzification layer uses the mfs to computes the outputs outn l n and l are the node and layer indexes respectively each node n of this layer is a square node with a node function which is shown in eq 5 and 6 each outn i l corresponds to the n th linguistic term of the i th input variable inp i e g the value of the variable evapotranspiration is 9 5 mm and it is turned into the linguistic term the evapotranspiration is high 5 out n i 1 μ n inp i unlike previous works in this work the optimal typology of each mf will be determined by a ga the different mf typologies considered during the optimization process will be described in section 2 4 every node in layer 2 is a circle node labelled π which multiplies all the incoming signals coming from layer 1 and sends the product out to the next this layer is known as firing strength it contains the rule nodes and it computes the activation value of each fuzzy rule w r as eq 6 out r 2 w r n 1 n in put out nm 1 for all the term nodes m connected to the r th rule node 6 r 1 nrules where n input is the total number of inputs and n rules is the total number of rules the third layer computes the rational firing strength of each nodes which is represented as circle node and labelled n thus for convenience outputs of this layer are called normalized firing strengths and they are computed according to the following equation 7 out r 3 w r out r 2 nr 1 n rules out nr 2 for r 1 n rules the defuzzification phase is carried out by layer 4 consequence parameters thus the output of each node is the output of each r th fuzzy rule that influences the ov th model output eq 8 8 o u t r o v 4 w r f r o v w r a 1 r o v i n p 1 a 2 r o v i n p 2 a n i n p u t r o v i n p n i n p u t a 0 r o v for r 1 n r u l e s ov 1 n o v where a 1 r ov a 2 r ov a n input r ov a 0 r ov are the consequent parameters of the canfis system that represent the contribution of the r th rule to the ov th output finally in layer 5 is represented as fixed node and labelled as in this layer each ov th model output is computed as the algebraic sum of the ov th node s inputs eq 9 9 o u t o v 5 r n r u l e s o u t r o v 4 for o v 1 n o v due to the complexity of the developed model and its computational efficiency a first order takagi sugeno type of fis was selected takagi and sugeno 1985 in this work while the antecedent part if is always fuzzy the consequent part then is a crisp linear function of an antecedent variable thus three examples of typical first order takagi sugeno fis rules are rule 1 1 if inp 1 is a 1 and inp 2 is b 1 and inp 3 is c 1 then f 1 1 a 1 1 1 inp 1 a 2 1 1 inp 2 a 3 1 1 inp 3 a 0 1 1 rule 1 2 if inp 1 is a 1 and inp 2 is b 1 and inp 3 is c 1 then f 1 2 a 1 1 2 inp 1 a 2 1 2 inp 2 a 3 1 2 inp 3 a 0 1 2 rule 2 1 if inp 1 is a 2 and inp 2 is b 2 and inp 3 is c 2 then f 2 1 a 1 2 1 inp 1 a 2 2 1 inp 2 a 3 2 1 inp 3 a 0 2 1 both the total number of rules and consequent parameters a 1 1 1 a 2 1 1 a 0 2 1 will be automatically determined by the ann during the training process of the canfis model in conventional anns a simple back propagation algorithm is usually used to train and adjust the weights which connects the neurons of different layers in cafis structure the parameters of the premises and consequents play the role of weights the effectiveness of the developed fis depends on these parameters thus with the aim to improve the training process recursive least squares estimation rlse haykin 2002 was used in this work as training algorithm of the canfis model rlse is an adaptive filter algorithm that recursively finds the coefficients a 1 r ov a 2 r ov a n input r ov a 0 r ov that minimize a weighted linear least squares cost function relating to the model input although this algorithm is computationally complex its computational development has been implemented for this work it has also extremely faster convergence than other training algorithm lewis and hwang 1990 3 3 coactive neuro genetic fuzzy inference system cangenfis the rule base and the mf parameters which defines the mf s shape is determined by an ann in the canfis model however before defining the mf parameters the number of mfs which defines each discourse universe of each input variable as well as the mf types that characterizes every linguistic label must be defined canfis model is not able to automatically determine these essential variables for fis and hence in most previous works are determined by trial and error without an optimization criterion thus with the aim to optimize automatically both mfs number and the mf types an hybrid model cangenfis which combines a canfis model and the multiobjective ga nsga ii deb et al 2002 has been developed in this work furthermore two essential parameters must be considered in the training process of the canfis model forgetting factor λ which reduces the influence of old data in the determination of the synaptic weights of the canfis model haykin 2002 and the learning rate lr which defines the updating rate of the mfs parameters hagan et al 1996 although these parameters are highly sensitive in the accuracy of the forecasted model standard values of these parameters are usually considered by most of the previous works independently of the problem nature in this work these parameters are also optimized by the cangenfis model cangenfis model optimizes their decision variables mfs number mf types λ and lr based on two objective functions of 1 and of 2 of 1 maximizes the average of the determination coefficient of the model outputs irrigation depth in each tariff periods for the testing dataset of the cangenfis model of 2 minimizes the average and deviation of the standard error prediction sep ventura et al 1995 of the cangenfis standard deviation was considered to avoid the tendency to improve some specific outputs of the cangenfis model e g forecasting of the irrigation depth applied in p6 fig 4 shows the flow chart of the generation and optimization the cangenfis model initially an initial population of npop size is randomly generated each chromosome chr or individual of the initial population is made up of ndec decision variables or genes that represent each hyperparameter of the cangenfis model to be optimized in this work the chromosome size is variable and depends on the number of inputs ninp to the forecasting model table 1 shows the decision variable genes considered in this work for ninp inputs in cangenfis model as well as the value range that everyone can take during the optimization process the first ninp genes determine the division of the discourse universe of each input variable of the predictive model the next ninp genes define the type of the membership function of each input variable which transform the crisp input values into fuzzy input values and represent the activation function of the neurones of the first layer of cangenfis model learning rate and forgetting factor are represented by the last two genes respectively once the initial population is created where the first ninp 2 genes of each chromosome chr define the architecture of the chr model and the two last genes defines the complete chr model architecture learning way each individual of this population is trained and the knowledge base each forecasted model is obtained after that each of these trained models are tested and the objective function of1 and of2 are computed then it is necessary to sort the initial population according to its aptitude i e its forecast capacity objective functions the best npop 2 individuals are then selected as the best individual of the initial population in the remaining stages the npop 2 individuals are modified crossover and mutation and a new population of npop individuals is generated the process was repeated for several generations ngen finally the set of npop optimal individuals optimal cangenfis models obtained in the last generation defines the pareto front the computational cost mainly in computational time and memory that the training process of each individual in each population required is hugely high thus the number of epochs during the training phase of each forecast model must be limited consequently at the end of the optimization process the best models in terms of hyperparameters is obtained however the synaptic weights of the neural network i e the knowledge base are not yet optimized as it has not had enough time enough training epochs to adjust them hence once the optimal models have been defined on the pareto front they must be retrained without restriction of training epochs obtaining the optimal knowledge base of the model 4 results and discussion the methodology developed was applied to czid during the 2015 2016 and 2017 irrigation seasons to forecast one day ahead the distribution in energy tariff periods of the irrigation depths applied at farm level by each farmer in the wua the complete dataset of irrigation depths applied contained a total of 77794 measures due to the differences of the irrigation practices for the main three crops and their impact on the applied irrigation depths gonzález perea et al 2018 the full dataset was classified according to the three main crops rice maize and tomato each of these datasets were randomly divided into two subsets training dataset 80 and testing dataset 20 the hyperparameters of the forecasting models were optimized by the multiobjective nsga ii genetic algorithm the number of individuals that must make up the initial population is related to the number and range of each gene thus the random initial population random cangenfis models consisted of 100 individuals or chromosomes npop 100 for each one of the main crops the number of generations depends on the stabilization time of each objective function this stabilization is related to each problem and should not be pre set allowing the genetic algorithm to achieve its own stabilization consequently the initial population was evolved for 300 40 and 70 generations ngen 300 40 and 70 for rice maize and tomato respectively where the values of of1 and of2 were stabilized the probabilities for mutation and crossover were set to 10 and 90 respectively 4 1 model inputs the most important inputs for cangenfis model were selected from a set of 21 potential inputs following the methodology described in section 2 2 table 2 shows the potential inputs evaluated and table 3 shows the most important inputs selected after applying the methodology of section 2 2 the most representative inputs and therefore the input variables of cangenfis model were number of hours of p1 p2 and p6 in the day to forecast weekday applied irrigation depth mm and day of the year doi the applied irrigation depth of the day to be forecasted is an essential input for the model when these models are working in real time in a wua this input can be also obtained in real time using the previous model developed by gonzález perea et al 2018 as table 3 shows the distribution in tariff period does not depends on any agroclimatic variables not even the farm size or non working days contrarily to the previous works were these variables were essential to forecast the daily irrigation scheduling these inputs highlight that the distribution in tariff period of the daily irrigation depth applied depends almost exclusively on hourly energy price of the tariff fig 2 in other words the distribution by tariff periods of the irrigation water applied depends more on the price of each tariff period than on the particularities or cultural habits of each farmer therefore only information about the two expensive p1 and p2 and the cheapest p6 tariff periods mi1 mi2 and mi3 respectively as well as the total amount of the irrigation water and the day of year and week mi4 and mi6 is required 4 2 pareto front of the optimization process by ga the modified genetic algorithm nsga ii optimized the objective functions maximizing of1 and minimizing of2 the random initial population of 100 chromosomes or individuals evolved over 300 40 and 70 generations for rice maize and tomato respectively each individual consisted of 14 genes 2 ninput lr λ because the number of input variables ninput was 6 fig 5 shows the pareto fronts obtained in the last generation for rice star mark maize cross mark and tomato square mark this figure shows that the three crops are clearly different obtaining the tomato model the best values of of1 and of2 ranging from 0 647 to 0 666 and from 0 198 to 0 204 respectively the of1 and of2 values ranged from 0 512 to 0 527 and from 0 254 to 0 26 respectively for the forecasting models developed for rice maize models obtained the widest range of values their objective functions ranged from 0 551 to 0 61 for of1 and from 0 254 to 0 288 for of2 the three pareto fronts show that both objective functions are clearly in conflict consequently as the representativeness of the predictive models represented by of1 the accuracy of the forecasting models represented by of2 decreased this sensitivity of the models between accuracy and representativeness is much more pronounced in the models developed for maize crops as the slope of this pareto front is steeper than the other two both the larger range of the values of the objective functions and the slope of the pareto front for the maize crop is relate to the number of generations during the optimization process the maize model needed the lower number of generations to stabilize their objective functions the methodology developed considered the effect of the random initial population over the evolution of the optimization process and a clock dynamic seed was programmed to avoid this effect in the evolution of the population therefore the differences of the ngen value in the three crops are related to the nature of the problem i e the differences in irrigation water management between crops and not to an effect associated with random initiation of the initial population consequently the maize model was easier to obtain than the other two crops in addition as reported by gonzález perea et al 2018 the irrigation water management in this crop is easier to reproduce and better results can be obtained than in the other two crops due to the irrigation method flood irrigation rice is the crop that needed the most ngen value to stabilise their objective functions and the one with the worst values of accuracy and representativeness this will be discussed below where the best model for each crop is analysed the architecture and the other hyperparameters of each model are defined by the values of each gene of each individual the generalization ability of a model capacity to reproduce previously unobserved events as in the test set depends on these genes the pareto fronts of rice and tomato did not show variation of the objective function values this indicates that the number of training epochs was insufficient and these models did not have enough time to find the best values of their synaptic weights consequently the values of the objective functions were insensitive to the different hyperparameters genes of each individual each model in order words in rice and tomato s pareto fronts the effect of the number of training epochs is more restrictive than the network architecture however the optimization process of the genetic algorithm does ensure that these individuals were the best w r t the others analysed during the optimization process and the fastest to train even if further refinement of their synaptic weights is necessary considering the values of each objective function one individual per crop has been selected as the best one thus fig 4 shows the best individual the best forecasting model from rice crop i r maize crop i m and tomato crop i t these individuals will be analysed in the next section 4 3 optimal cangenfis models the best individual cangenfis models for each crop type in each pareto front was selected thus i r i m and i t represents the best individual for rice maize and tomato respectively table 4 shows the gene values that make up each cangenfis model as well as the r2 and sep values of the test set after the refining process without limitations of the number of training epochs the partition of the discourse universe number of mfs of each input variable was clearly stablished in 3 except for mi5 in the rice model mi5 and mi6 in the maize model and mi6 in the tomato model the minimum and maximum values that these genes would take ranged from 2 to 5 for no input variable in any developed model i r i m and i t these genes corresponding to the partitions of their discourse universe tended to their maximum values these genes could range from 2 to 5 consequently the range of values for these genes during the optimization process was properly established a tendency towards any of the lower or upper limits would indicate the need to modify this range and repeat the optimization process of the genetic algorithm table 5 shows the linguistic variables for each one of the partitions of the discourse universe of each input variable for the three models assessed in the three models the number of hours in p1 p2 and p6 mi1 mi2 and mi3 respectively in the forecasted day were addressed in the same way for farmers who irrigate rice maize or tomato thus the linguistic variables or the reasoning that all farmers consider about the distribution of these hours for every day as high hi medium m or low lo i e the behaviour of each farmer in the wua in deciding how to apply the irrigation depth on a given day is conditioned by whether the number of hours available is high medium or low for the two most expensive tariff period p1 and p2 and the cheapest period p6 similarly for all farmers the week is divided into early week lo mid week m and late week hi it is reasonable that the partition of the discourse universe for this variable would have been 2 weekend and all other days since the distribution of the tariff periods is conditioned by weekends fig 2 however the results for this input variable mi4 show that it is also important whether the farmer is at the beginning or in the middle of the week possibly conditioned by his activity during the weekend and some other socio cultural practices that should be studied in detail the applied irrigation depth mi5 was processed differently for rice and maize than for tomato while for rice and maize considers high h or low l irrigation depths for tomato high h medium m or low l irrigation depths are considered the irrigation season was also divided differently depending on the crop type the decision of the distribution of the daily applied irrigation depth is conditioned whether doi mi6 is at the beginning middle or end of the irrigation season for rice however for maize and tomato the irrigation season was divided into early or late this way of considering the irrigation season is related to the irrigation system of each crop rice is irrigated by flooding maize and tomato by drip irrigation i e farmers with rice irrigated by flooding and vary their irrigation management according to three periods of the irrigation season beginning middle and end however the irrigation management of farmers with tomato and maize is affected only by two periods along the irrigation season this division of the irrigation season has not only been caused by the irrigation method but also the different phenological stages of each crop table 4 also shows the type of mfs for each input variable and each model the crop cycle the irrigation system and the daily irrigation depths to be applied in rice differ greatly from maize and tomato consequently the way in which the knowledge base of the fuzzy inference system of each cangenfis model transforms the crisp input values into linguistic variables fuzzy values is very similar for maize and tomato moving away from the behaviour for rice apart from the days of the week mi4 the knowledge base of the rice model is totally different from the other two models the values of learning rate were 3 89 10 6 10 6 and 1 21 10 3 for i r i m and i t respectively the optimal lr value depends on the shape of the n dimensional error function or cost function between the target value and the forecasted values during the training process thus in those error functions where the decreasing error path can clearly be found it is possible to increase the value of lr speeding up the training process however the error functions with more tortuous paths to their global minima cannot have very high lr value as they would not find this minimum value results show that the n dimensional space of the error function of i t model is less tortuous and easier to find an optimal point than the others due to it achieved the lower value of lr contrary i m obtained the lower value of lr forgetting factor is a hyperparameter of the training function used in this work rls this hyperparameter defines the amount of information which is forgotten in each step of the recursive training process the smaller value of λ the smaller is the contribution of previous sample to the covariance matrix of the rls algorithm this makes the algorithm more sensitive to recent samples or recent records rather than older ones thus the λ values for i r i m and i t were 0 9855 1 and 0 9775 respectively i m model is the only that obtain a value of 1 for this hyperparameter when the forgetting factor is 1 it is referred to as the growing window rls algorithm the representativeness and the accuracy of the three models selected are defined by the r2 and sep values and it also shows in table 4 the r2 values for i r i m and i t were 0 70 0 76 and 0 85 respectively the sep values for these three models were 19 9 22 9 and 19 5 respectively thus the i t model was the most accurate with the highest representativeness and lower error than 20 for 85 of the forecasting as gonzález perea et al 2018 shown in their results the rice model is the most complex probably because their irrigation system and the amount of data for this crop type consequently this work confirms these findings and also obtains the lowest representativeness although the accuracy was lower than 20 however the three models are mimo i e each model receives the input variable from mi1 to mi6 and return the distribution the applied irrigation depth in a day d for each tariff period from p1 to p6 thus the r2 and sep values are an average of the six outputs of each model figs 6 8 shows the scatterplots between observed and estimated irrigation water for the test dataset for the models i r i m and i t respectively for i r the r2 values ranged from 0 57 for p4 to 0 91 for p6 however the sep values ranged from 36 58 in p6 to 11 95 in p3 similarly the r2 values for i m and i r models ranged from 0 64 in p4 to 0 90 in p6 and from 0 82 in p2 to 0 94 in p6 respectively the sep values for these two models ranged from 38 86 in p6 to 12 62 in p5 and from 30 94 in p6 to 12 13 in p5 respectively for the three models the highest r2 value was obtained in p6 but with the highest sep value contrary the lowest sep value was found in p5 for i m and i t models and in p3 for i r model figs 6 8 also show that most of the irrigation water is logically applied in the cheapest tariff period p6 also larger farms with highest irrigation water inputs higher volume of irrigation water applied trend to maximize the input in the cheapest period consequently the most expensive tariff period p1 hardly exceeds 200 m3 per irrigation event with more than 95 of the tomato and maize farms are less than 5 ha and no rice farms are larger than 8 ha only 3 farms between 5 ha and 8 ha it is important to highlight that figs 6 8 show how the second cheapest tariff period p5 is the one that receives less irrigation water when intuitively it should be the second period receiving more water this is a consequence of the distribution of the tariff periods fig 2 throughout the irrigation season while p6 is in one of the months of the irrigation season with highest crop water requirements p5 is at the beginning and end of the irrigation season when the theoretical irrigation requirements are smaller these asymmetric distribution of the irrigation water between the tariff periods are responsible for the variation in the r2 and sep values between tariff periods as the architecture of the three models have been adapted and optimized for these conditions as more records are obtained in each of these tariff periods the models will learn and improve their accuracy in an autonomous and automatic way 5 conclusions the prediction of irrigation events occurrence and applied irrigation depths was previously addressed in previous works however the optimization of irrigation water use and the energy contracting requires also the knowledge of their distribution throughout the day thus a new hybrid methodology cangenfis combining multiple inputs multiple outputs fuzzy logic artificial neural networks and multiobjective genetic algorithms has been developed to forecast the intra daily distribution of each irrigation event the new methodology developed in matlab was applied to a real wua and three models were calibrated for rice maize and tomato although some differences between tariff periods were observed the r2 and sep values for the three models were 0 70 0 76 and 0 85 and 19 9 22 9 and 19 5 respectively cangenfis also optimized the inputs of the three forecasting models following fuzzy logic techniques contrarily to the forecasting of daily water demand the distribution by tariff periods did not depend on any agroclimatic variables these findings highlight that the hourly distribution of the daily irrigation events depend almost exclusively on tariff periods according to their price finally these models provide the amount of water that each farmer of the wua is going to apply in each energy tariff period one day ahead the aggregation of this information for the total number of farmers in the wua provides the total amount of water one day in advance but discriminated by energy tariff period in addition the farms are geopositioned so managers will know in advance which pipes can be overloaded thus with these models the manager have an overview about the circulating flows in the network the day after but also the distribution of water demand and therefore the power requirements in each tariff period could be estimated this information can be very valuable for the optimum contracting of the electricity tariff with the supplying company declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
