14135,immobilization of microorganisms is a widely adopted strategy for the efficient degradation of hazardous organic compounds like phenol microorganisms can be immobilized in synthetic or natural matrices in this work dried areca nut areca catechu husks and luffa luffa cylindrica sponge fibers were used as alternative and inexpensive natural matrices for microbial cell immobilization the potential of these immobilization systems for the effective bioremediation of phenolic wastewater was explored a bacterial consortium was isolated by enriching a sludge sample from a petroleum refinery in high phenol concentrations the mixed bacterial culture was capable of degrading 1000 mg l 1 of phenol in suspension cultures the bacterial consortium was immobilized on the lignocellulosic matrices phenol degradation studies were performed in batches to optimize the physicochemical parameters optimum ph and temperature for phenol degradation was found to be 8 0 and 37 c at an optimum ph and temperature the areca nut husk and luffa sponge systems immobilized with the mixed culture could degrade 1000 mg l 1 phenol in 28 h and 30 h respectively the highest experimental degradation rates in areca nut husk and luffa sponge systems were 0 37 h 1 and 0 21 h 1 respectively at 200 mg l 1 phenol degradation kinetic studies were carried out using several inhibition models further studies revealed that both matrices with immobilized microbes could be reused for several successive batch degradation experiments and stored at 4 c for several weeks without any noticeable loss in degradation efficiency keywords areca nut husk immobilization kinetic parameters luffa sponge fiber mixed bacterial culture phenol biodegradation 1 introduction phenols or phenolics are a class of organic chemical compounds well known for their toxic effects on microbes aquatic flora and fauna animals and humans even at low concentrations the simplest of them is phenol which is the most sought after pollutant due to its recalcitrant and ubiquitous nature phenolic compounds are very frequently found in run offs and effluents of various industries such as petrochemicals coal conversion coking plant leather textiles pharmaceutical olive oil paint polycarbonate resin ink paper perfume etc 1 phenol has been categorized in the list of significant contaminants by the us environmental protection agency usepa due to its high solubility in water sources and toxicity 2 the permissible limits of phenol in potable waters has been set to 1 μg l 1 by the world health organization who 3 hence removal of phenol from wastewater is essential before its release into the environment over the years researchers have shown that bioremediation is a cost effective and eco friendly alternative to the traditional physicochemical methods used for phenol removal 4 7 although sustainable the inhibitory effect of phenol at high concentrations pose a serious challenge for wastewater remediation by microorganisms 8 hence several strategies have been explored to overcome this problem most common approaches include use of genetically modified organisms acclimatization of organisms to lethal phenol concentrations and immobilization of organisms 9 immobilization of microbial cells offer several benefits over other approaches for treatment of phenolic wastewaters 1 fortifies microbes against the toxic effects of phenol and harsh environments 2 helps reach a high microbial concentration hence achieving a high contaminant degradation rate 3 helps easy recovery and re use of microbial cells for repeated degradation of target pollutants and 4 helps microbial cells stay viable during storage for extended durations with little or no loss of degradation capacity hence ensuring stable long term operation 5 10 11 immobilization by entrapment of microbial cells in matrices such as calcium alginate beads 8 12 or a more mechanically stable pva poly vinyl alcohol 4 6 13 were reported earlier entrapment of whole cells using chitosan beads 10 or hybrid systems involving alginate chitosan pva alginate and glycerol alginate 9 were also implemented immobilization studies were carried out using supports such as polyurethane foam puf 14 celite r 635 15 and liapor clay beads 16 a major drawback of systems such as calcium alginate is its instability against phosphates and disruption of gel particles due to co2 evolution 17 in recent years the pursuit for finding a natural renewable non toxic and biodegradable immobilization matrix has brought lignocellulosic biomass to limelight microbial cells immobilize onto lignocellulosic biomass via physical adsorption 18 owing to its abundance on planet earth a variety of lignocellulosic supports such as bagasse sawdust wood shavings chips rice husk straw and dry coconut husk were tested for fermentation and wastewater treatment studies 5 17 18 table 1 describes various reported immobilization matrices used for phenol degradation in the current study we have used dried areca nut husks and dry mature luffa vegetable fibers as potential candidates to immobilize bacteria for phenol degradation areca catechu family arecaceae is a species of palm which grows lavishly in asian countries the fruit is known as areca nut or betel nut india is the largest producer of areca nut in the world 19 the fruit is protected by a fibrous husk which is separated before consumption of the areca nut this husk is discarded and is considered as agricultural waste 19 owing to the considerable amount of sugars 21 in these husks they have been used as low cost substrates for citric acid production by solid state fermentation 20 on the other hand luffa cylindrica family cucurbitaceae is a vegetable crop that grows abundantly in tropical and sub tropical climates of african and asian countries the fruit although edible at a younger stage becomes very fibrous once ripened the mature fruit is dried until the fleshy part fades away leaving a skeleton of randomly interconnected network of highly fibrous matrix the dried fruit is widely used as bath scrubber and for manufacturing bath mats table and door mats 21 these fibers are highly porous and are used as a potential support for immobilization of microbial cells for ethanol production 21 22 the use of luffa sponge for immobilization of algal and fungal cells for removal of heavy metals was also reported 23 however to our knowledge there are no reports on bacterial immobilization on areca nut husk and luffa fibers for treatment of phenolic wastewater therefore we have explored the potential of these two lignocellulosic biomasses as carrier matrices for bacterial immobilization and their use for treatment of synthetic phenolic wastewater in this study a mixed bacterial culture which was previously acclimatized to high phenol concentrations was immobilized onto these two biomasses the effect of factors such as ph of the growth medium temperature of incubation and initial phenol concentration were studied and optimized the experimental degradation data were fitted to various established substrate inhibition models via matlab r2018a and various bio kinetic parameters were estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and raw materials all the analytical grade chemical components and phenol crystals were procured from himedia and merck india areca nut husks and luffa sponges were obtained from the local market in guwahati assam india 2 2 microorganisms and culture condition a microbial consortium was isolated in our earlier study 24 by enriching a sludge sample acquired from a petroleum refinery in high phenol concentrations the mixed microbial culture could utilize phenol up to a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 the enrichment culture contained three culturable strains of bacteria these isolates were identified as brevibacterium sp dbk1 ncbi genbank accession no kp231222 stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila dbk ncbi genbank accession no kc992293 and brucella sp dbk2 ncbi genbank accession no kp231223 by 16s rrna sequencing the mixed culture was maintained and cultivated in sterilized msm mineral salt medium the chemical composition of which has been described in our previous report 24 sub culturing was done every fifteen days in an incubator shaker at 37 c and 120 rpm incubator model zhicheng instruments zhwy 2112b with 1000 mg l 1 of phenol as a sole energy and carbon source the mixed culture at its late log phase was stored at 4 c 2 3 preparation of the lignocellulosic matrices and immobilization of the mixed culture areca nut husks were washed with water and dehydrated in a hot air oven at 85 c to remove any moisture as these are prone to fungal contamination the outside skin or the exocarp of the areca nut husks were removed and only the fibrous part or mesocarp was retained the luffa sponges were also washed with water and dried at 85 c to remove moisture the dried areca nut husks and mature luffa sponges were then chopped into pieces of 5 mm 6 mm approximately the chopped biomasses were washed several times with deionized water to remove pigments imparted by the particles these were dried again at 85 c the untreated biomasses were autoclaved dried and stored these were later used as matrices for microbial immobilization immobilization of microbial cells onto the dried biomass was performed in situ in conical flasks by a semi solid state approach where cells were immobilized by natural adsorption 5 17 20 g of sterile and dried areca nut husk was mixed with 200 ml of fresh bacterial culture the bacterial culture was maintained in 1000 mg l 1 phenol for achieving higher bacterial biomass densities the concentration of the bacterial culture was recorded as 1 09 od600 which was equivalent to 0 944 g l 1 dry cell weight dcw 1 0 od equivalent to 0 866 g l 1 of dry cell biomass r2 0 97 data not shown here this was allowed to stand in a static incubator at 37 c after 24 h the flasks were augmented with 50 ml of fresh media substituted with 200 mg l 1 phenol and allowed to stand overnight thereafter the entire media was replaced with 200 ml of fresh mineral media containing another 200 mg l 1 phenol this was allowed to stand for another 24 h in a static incubator at 37 c this method of immobilization was adopted from basak et al 5 with slight modifications similarly immobilization of bacterial culture was also carried out for luffa sponges since the density of luffa sponge is rather low when compared to areca nut husks only 6 g of dry luffa sponges were used for immobilization of bacterial culture the entire immobilization process was achieved in 500 ml conical flasks containing 200 ml of bacterial culture 2 4 optimization of physical parameters responsible for growth and substrate utilization batch studies 2 4 1 effect of initial ph of the culture media batch experiments were performed to ascertain the impact of initial ph of the growth medium on the bioremediation of phenol a wide range of ph levels were considered for the experiment 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 and 10 0 the selection of ph values were made based on our previous study 24 on phenol degradation using free cells of the mixed bacterial culture the initial pollutant concentration in the culture medium was maintained at 200 mg l 1 experiments were performed in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of culture media 15 g of wet areca nut husk and 6 g of wet luffa sponge fibers with immobilized microorganisms were used as inoculum for the experiments all the experiments were carried out at 37 c in an incubator shaker at 120 rpm phenol degradation was monitored at regular intervals degradation data was used to calculate the degradation rate of phenol which helped determine the optimal ph required for substrate utilization 2 4 2 effect of incubation temperature experiments were also performed to investigate the impact of temperature of incubation on the bioremediation of phenol a predetermined optimum ph calculated from the previous set of experiments was used for the study 200 mg l 1 of phenol was used as a solitary source of carbon for the experiments studies were performed at incubation temperatures of 25 c 30 c 37 c and 45 c in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of culture media in a shaker incubator at 120 rpm the inoculum volume was maintained at 15 g for wet areca nut husks and 6 g for wet luffa sponge fibers consumption of phenol by the immobilized microbes was monitored at regular intervals for calculation of phenol degradation rate and successive ascertainment of the optimum incubation temperature 2 4 3 effect of initial phenol concentrations at an optimum ph and temperature determined from the previous set of experiments conducted in sections 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 respectively studies were also conducted to ascertain the optimum phenol concentration for rapid substrate utilization various increasing concentrations of phenol 200 mg l 1 400 mg l 1 600 mg l 1 800 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 were used as the sole source of carbon and energy for this study inoculum load was maintained at 15 g for wet areca nut husk and 6 g for wet luffa sponge fibers experiments were performed in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of mineral media in a shaker incubator at 120 rpm residual concentrations of phenol were estimated by withdrawing samples at fixed intervals phenol degradation data was used for calculation of degradation rate q h 1 and analysis of degradation kinetics degradation kinetic study is discussed in a later section the optimum value of environmental parameters was determined based on the value of degradation rate q h 1 all experiments discussed above were conducted in triplicates 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 analysis of residual phenol nylon membrane filter papers 0 22 μm pore size pall corporation were used to filter samples residual phenol concentration in the filtrates were determined via high performance liquid chromatography model agilent technologies 1220 infinity lc fitted with a variable wavelength detector vwd and a reverse phase column agilent zorbax eclipse xdb c18 particle size 5 μm dimensions 3 0 x 150 mm after appropriate dilutions a mobile phase of water 60 acetonitrile 40 was used and a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 was maintained at room temperature residual phenol was detected by injecting aliquots of 20 μl at a wavelength of 280 nm 2 5 2 electron microscopic studies the lignocellulosic matrices with and without the immobilized mixed bacterial consortium was observed and studied via fesem field emission scanning electron microscopy 5 mm pieces of areca nut husk and luffa sponges were collected from the immobilization flasks and fixed by treatment with 3 5 glutaraldehyde for 6 h 17 these were further washed with sterile crystal free neutral phosphate buffer and dehydrated by treatment with increasing ethanol gradation 50 70 90 95 and 100 the samples were finally dried in a vacuum desiccator overnight the dried samples were directly placed on a double sided carbon tape on a fesem stub and coated with gold film the morphology of the bacterial community immobilized on the lignocellulosic matrices were witnessed and photographed at a magnification of 0 5 10 kx via zeiss fesem model sigma the oven dried lignocellulosic matrices without the immobilized bacterial culture were directly viewed under fesem without any kind of pre treatment 2 6 degradation kinetic studies and comparison of inhibition kinetic models experimental degradation data obtained from batch studies described in section 2 4 3 was fitted to several available kinetic models to elucidate the kinetics of phenol degradation by the immobilized microorganisms various established substrate inhibition kinetic models viz haldane model 25 yano model 26 aiba model 27 edward model 28 and webb model 29 table 2 were considered in this study degradation rate of phenol q h 1 was ascertained from the gradient of plot of the negative logarithm of s so vs time t 7 for various initial substrate concentrations so the plot of experimental degradation rates q versus values of various corresponding initial phenol concentrations so were fitted to the different substrate inhibition models different bio kinetic parameters such as qmax maximum degradation rate h 1 ki inhibition constant mg l 1 and ks affinity constant mg l 1 were calculated for the inhibition models using nonlinear regression analysis in matlab r2017b 2 7 storage and reusability studies of the mixed culture immobilized on the lignocellulosic biomass the effect of storage on the stability and biodegradation potential of the microbes immobilized on the lignocellulosic biomass was studied for a period 0 6 weeks after the immobilization of the mixed bacterial culture on the lignocellulosic biomass as described in section 2 3 a biodegradation experiment was conducted for a phenol concentration of 200 mg l 1 residual phenol concentrations were measured at regular intervals and time taken for complete phenol degradation was noted in order to maintain similar inoculum quality for the entire course of storage stability experiments abundant immobilized material was prepared for carrying out biodegradation studies in triplicates for eight batches the immobilized cells were then stored at 4 c for conducting the storage stability experiments biodegradation batch experiments were conducted in triplicates every week for up to 6 weeks to check for the decline if any in biodegradation potential of the immobilized mixed microorganisms before commencing the batch experiments the lignocellulosic biomass was allowed to reach the room temperature reusability of the immobilized microorganisms was also studied by conducting several successive batch degradation experiments for these studies the lignocellulosic biomass immobilized with the mixed microbial culture was retrieved from the first batch of experiments these were then washed with sterile distilled water subsequently the retrieved biomass was subjected to repeated batch biodegradation experiments for up to 15 batches after each batch the biomass was retrieved and washed with sterile distilled water residual phenol concentration was monitored at regular intervals and time taken for complete degradation was noted for all the batches all the studies were conducted in triplicates with a phenol concentration of 200 mg l 1 in 250 ml conical flasks a uniform ph and temperature of 8 0 and 37 c respectively was maintained in the shaker incubator at 120 rpm for all storage and reusability experiments 2 8 composition analysis studies of the lignocellulosic biomass compositional analysis studies were carried out for the lignocellulosic biomass without immobilized microorganisms and with immobilized microorganisms after 15 consecutive batch experiments to determine the degradation of the structural components if any of the lignocellulosic biomass hemicellulose was determined by a method described by goering and van soest 30 which involved estimating neutral detergent fiber ndf and acid detergent fiber adf separately hemicellulose content can be determined by calculating the difference between ndf and adf holocellulose was measured by treatment with sodium chlorite 31 lignin was estimated by tappi standard protocol technical association of the pulp and paper industry 3 results and discussion 3 1 lignocellulosic matrices immobilization of the mixed culture and electron microscopic imagery usually microorganisms are immobilized onto solid supports by recirculating a concentrated microbial culture suspension through a reactor where the lignocellulosic materials act as solid supports one major drawback of this process is cell desorption which restricts operational stability 17 in this study a semi solid state approach was adopted to achieve maximum cell immobilization and enhanced stability adding fresh media with phenol after 24 h and 48 h as discussed in section 2 3 resulted in enhanced cell growth causing microbial cells to be immobilized thoroughly on the supports 17 scanning electron microscopy fesem was performed to visualize the lignocellulosic matrices with and without immobilization of the mixed bacterial culture fig 1 a and b portrays the surface architecture of the areca nut husks and luffa sponge fibers respectively without immobilized microorganisms it can be easily visualized that the surface of the areca nut husks is a lot rougher and porous in texture when compared to the luffa sponge fibers fig 1 c and d depicts the immobilization of the microbial cells on the areca nut husks copious amounts of bacterial cells can be seen immobilized on the surface of the areca nut husks the surface architecture of the husks appears to be smooth in contrast to the surface without microorganisms which is possibly due to formation of biofilms fig 1 e and f illustrates the immobilization of microbial cells on the surface of the luffa sponge fibers it can be observed that when compared with areca nut husk fibers the intensity of immobilized bacterial cells on the luffa sponges has declined this impairment in immobilization intensity can be attributed to the fact that the surface of the luffa sponge fibers is smoother compared to the areca nut husks the rougher surface of the areca nut husks might be responsible for enhanced cell adsorption the bacterial cells were adsorbed on the lignocellulosic biomass naturally which can be ascribed to covalent bonding or electrostatic forces between the surface of the lignocellulosic biomass and the bacterial cells 5 3 2 effect of initial ph on the degradation of phenol ph plays a vital role in utilization and degradation of phenolic compounds by microorganisms maintaining an optimum ph of the culture media activates enzymes that are responsible for degradation of phenol extreme changes in ph renders these enzymes non functional causing denaturation and loss of catalytic activity 24 denaturation of enzymes impairs metabolic activity of the microorganism eventually leading to rapid obliteration of bacterial biomass hence an optimum initial ph should be imperatively maintained for efficient phenol degradation fig 2 a represents the phenol degradation curves at different ph values in case of areca nut husk immobilization system it can be observed that phenol was completely degraded in 6 h for ph 7 0 and ph 8 0 whereas complete degradation of phenol was achieved in 8 h for ph 5 0 and ph 6 0 for higher ph values of 9 0 and 10 0 more than 99 of the pollutant was degraded in 10 h fig 2b represents the phenol degradation percentage and degradation rates for 200 mg l 1 phenol at different ph values in areca nut husk immobilization system the degradation rate reached a maximum value of 0 37 h 1 at ph 8 0 although complete degradation of phenol was achieved at ph 7 0 the degradation rate was lower at a value of 0 23 h 1 it may be noted that when compared to the suspension cell culture reported in our previous study 24 there is a marked improvement in phenol degradation phenol was degraded completely in ph values of 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 besides more than 99 of phenol was also degraded at ph 9 and ph 10 during the study duration whereas in our previous study using free cells 24 at ph 5 5 and ph 8 5 a severe inhibition of growth was observed which indicated minimal or no degradation of phenol similarly fig 3 a represents the phenol degradation curves at different ph values in luffa sponge immobilization system here it can be observed that 200 mg l 1 of phenol was completely degraded at ph 8 0 in 8 h at ph 7 0 complete degradation was achieved in 10 h complete phenol degradation for ph 9 0 and ph 10 0 was achieved at 12 h and 14 h respectively at ph 6 0 complete degradation of phenol took 20 h however at ph 5 0 phenol was not completely degraded in the duration of the study and about 79 degradation could be achieved in 24 h fig 3b represents the phenol degradation rates and corresponding degradation percentages for luffa immobilization system the phenol degradation rate attained a maximum value of 0 21 h 1 at ph 8 0 hence an initial ph of 8 0 was determined to be optimum for efficient phenol degradation in both the immobilization systems since it was at this ph value that maximum phenol degradation rates were attained a substantial improvement of the capability of immobilized bacterial cells in tolerating harsher ph conditions can be attributed to the fact that immobilization on the lignocellulosic supports provided ample resistance and protection 13 moreover immobilization makes larger number of bacterial cells available for utilization of substrate compared to the freely suspended counterparts which were not able to tolerate highly acidic or alkaline ph 24 areca nut husk system was able to tolerate and degrade phenol over a wider range of ph when compared to luffa sponge system this could be attributed to the fact that the luffa sponges were less porous than areca nut husks and more bacterial cells were immobilized on the areca nut husks compared to luffa sponges the surface morphology and porosity of the husks possibly provided superior protection to the bacterial cells compared to the luffa sponges enabling the bacterial cells to tolerate harsher conditions 3 3 effect of incubation temperature on phenol bioremediation enzymes responsible for phenol degradation are vulnerable to temperature changes hence an optimum temperature must be maintained for efficient utilization of a substrate suboptimal temperatures might lead to impaired functioning of enzymes eventually slowing down organismal metabolism leading to slower and inefficient consumption of phenol fig 4 a and fig 4b represents the degradation rates and degradation percentages of phenol at different temperatures of incubation for areca nut husk and luffa sponge immobilization systems respectively all experiments were performed at ph 8 0 both cases witnessed an improvement in degradation rate with rise in temperature a peak degradation rate was achieved at 37 c for both the immobilization systems a maximum degradation rate of 0 37 h 1 was observed in case of areca nut husks whereas the maximum degradation rate was 0 21 h 1 in case of luffa sponges complete phenol degradation was achieved in 6 h and 8 h for areca nut husks and luffa sponge immobilization systems respectively the degradation rate declined at 45 c in both cases tolerance towards temperatures on either side of the optimum point was quite remarkable for both immobilization systems percentage degradation and degradation rate of phenol was more at 45 c compared to 25 c and 30 c areca nut husk system could degrade 71 34 of phenol at 45 c during the experimental duration data not shown here whereas luffa fiber system could achieve 65 18 phenol degradation at 45 c data not shown here phenol degradation rates at 30 c for both immobilization systems were also acceptable however the degradation percentages of phenol at 25 c was very low suggesting very slow substrate utilization rates when compared to our previous study involving free cells 24 there was a remarkable improvement in phenol degradation at 45 c the mixed culture in free suspension exhibited a stunted growth featuring very low growth rates and almost no phenol degradation 24 the above results verified that immobilization of microorganisms improved tolerance towards temperature changes 3 4 effect of initial substrate concentration on the degradation of phenol initial concentration of phenol plays a crucial role in the bioremediation process as phenol is a very potent growth inhibitor experiments were carried out for both lignocellulosic biomass with different initial phenol concentrations 200 mg l 1 400 mg l 1 600 mg l 1 800 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 at an optimized ph and temperature of 8 0 and 37 c respectively fig 5 a represents the phenol degradation profiles at various initial phenol concentrations for the areca nut husk system fig 5b represents the phenol degradation rates and degradation percentages for the same the maximum phenol degradation rate 0 37 h 1 was observed at 200 mg l 1 phenol the degradation rate declined with increase in phenol concentrations indicating the inhibitory effect of the substrate the degradation rate at 1000 mg l 1 phenol was 0 096 h 1 and the areca nut husk immobilized microbes could degrade only about 21 of the initial substrate concentration however the experiment was continued to monitor the time taken for the depletion of phenol entirely in all the batches considered in the study 1000 mg l 1 of phenol was completely depleted in 28 h likewise fig 6 a depicts the phenol degradation profiles for the luffa sponge immobilization system at varying phenol concentrations fig 6b represents the phenol degradation rates and degradation percentages for the luffa immobilized organisms the maximum degradation rate was 0 21 h 1 and it was achieved by the organisms growing in 200 mg l 1 phenol the trend of decline of the degradation rates were similar to the areca nut husk immobilization system indicating substrate inhibition organisms exhibited a minimum degradation rate of 0 089 h 1 at 1000 mg l 1 of phenol however 1000 mg l 1 phenol was degraded completely in 30 h by the microbes in the luffa sponge system the above results when compared to free cell culture from our earlier reported study revealed promising results a free suspension of the mixed culture could degrade 1000 mg l 1 phenol in 96 h 24 for both our immobilization systems there is a remarkable improvement in phenol degradation times the phenol degradation times reduced by more than three times in both cases this enhancement of degradation can be attributed to the fact that immobilization shields the microorganisms from the toxic effects of phenol 6 moreover reports also suggest that immobilization of bacterial cells enhance cellular activity by altering their physiological features in metabolism such as amplified enzyme induction reduced specific cell growth and cell yield 3 6 3 5 modeling and kinetics of phenol degradation phenol degradation kinetics by the bacterial consortium immobilized on areca nut husks and luffa sponges was studied at different starting phenol concentrations so 200 1000 mg l 1 of the growth medium for each initial phenol concentration experimental substrate degradation rates q h 1 were calculated as per the description in section 2 6 a maximum experimental degradation rate was achieved at a pollutant concentration of 200 mg l 1 for both areca nut husk and luffa sponge immobilization systems the experimental degradation rates were comparable to the reported literatures which made use of synthetic matrices table 1 thereafter the degradation rates started declining indicating substrate inhibition the plot of experimental degradation rates versus their corresponding initial substrate concentrations was fitted to several available inhibition kinetic models via matlab r2017b fig 7 a and fig 7b depicts the fitting of experimental q with model simulated values of different inhibition models for areca nut husk and luffa sponge system respectively several bio kinetic parameters were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis and portrayed in table 2 the corresponding values of the coefficients of correlation r2 are also reported the experimental degradation rates demonstrated by the mixed bacterial culture immobilized on the areca nut husks 0 37 h 1 were found to be higher than the bacteria immobilized on luffa sponges 0 21 h 1 based on the value of correlation coefficient r2 0 9858 the best fit in case of areca nut husk system was given by edward model with a predicted maximum degradation rate qmax of 0 0042 h 1 the values of ks and ki were predicted to be 3 58 mg l 1 and 231 mg l 1 respectively in case of luffa fibers however the best fitted model was aiba model with a r2 value of 0 9903 and a qmax of 0 3413 h 1 the values of ks and ki were calculated to be 39 5 mg l 1 and 663 mg l 1 respectively the values of ks points to the ability of the organisms to grow at a fairly higher concentration of phenol 13 apart from this however other models also fitted the experimental data fairly well in case of both the immobilization systems owing to the value of r2 interestingly haldane model which is the most widely used inhibition model exhibited a very low value of ki for both the immobilization systems although r2 is 0 9 ki value indicates inhibitory concentration of phenol which is toxic to the organisms 13 and an inferior predicted ki value compared to ks value renders the haldane model unsuitable 3 6 storage and reusability of the immobilized microorganisms stability of the immobilized cells during long term storage is an indispensable aspect to be considered for the feasible application of the immobilized cell system 6 the effect of storage of the immobilized microorganisms at 4 c on degradation of phenol was studied for a period of 6 weeks both lignocellulosic biomass with microorganisms immobilized were stored for a period of 7 14 21 28 35 and 42 days at 4 c fig 8 portrays the variation of the phenol degradation rates of areca nut husk and luffa sponge systems at optimal degradation conditions for 200 mg l 1 phenol it was noticed that there were minimal changes in degradation rates over the course of 6 weeks the time taken for complete depletion of 200 mg l 1 of phenol was also noted for each batch it was observed that each batch of experiments took precisely 6 h and 8 h for complete degradation of 200 mg l 1 phenol degradation data not shown here for areca nut husk and luffa sponge supports respectively these results demonstrated that the immobilized cells had a very strong storage stability and could successfully be reused for a long time the obtained results were at par with earlier reported studies 6 7 13 it is worth mentioning that the storage of immobilized cells is possible in sterilized glass containers or flasks at 4 c without any special care and any significant deterioration of degradation efficiency similar to storage the stability of immobilized cells in long term operation is also an important aspect which must be considered for practical applicability of the immobilized cell system 3 in order to investigate this areca nut husk and luffa sponge supports containing the immobilized microbes were exposed to 15 consecutive batch degradation experiments each batch consisted of 200 mg l 1 of phenol and 6 h and 8 h of incubation for areca nut husk and luffa sponge supports respectively it was observed that there were negligible shifts in the degradation efficiencies in case of both the supports data not shown here moreover 200 mg l 1 of phenol was biodegraded completely in the duration of the experiment for each batch the results are comparable to earlier reported literatures 6 13 and better than a few others 5 7 structural integrity in terms of lignocellulosic biomass composition was studied after the completion of reusability studies results discussed in the next section 3 7 3 7 studies on compositional analysis of the lignocellulosic biomass compositional analysis studies were carried out to determine the degradation of structural components of the lignocellulosic biomass if any due to repeated batch degradation experiments table 3 summarizes the results of the compositional analysis studies it can be clearly observed that there were no noticeable shifts in the structural composition of both the lignocellulosic biomass even after 15 consecutive batch biodegradation experiments these results indicate the resilience of both the lignocellulosic biomass and their resistance towards degradation by the mixed culture that was immobilized on them hence it can be concluded that both lignocellulosic biomasses can be used successfully as immobilization supports for the mixed bacterial culture to achieve effective and enhanced phenol degradation efficiencies 4 conclusions a bacterial consortium was isolated from a petroleum refinery sludge in a previously reported study 24 the consortium could degrade 1000 mg l 1 of phenol in 96 h this study investigated the potential of two lignocellulosic biomass as possible candidates for immobilization of the mixed bacterial culture for enhanced phenol remediation we have used dry areca nut husks and mature luffa sponges as immobilization supports the mixed bacterial culture was immobilized on the supports via natural adsorption when compared to the freely suspended degradation system reported in our earlier study 24 the immobilized system could degrade phenol a lot faster under optimized ph and temperature conditions the optimum ph and temperature for efficient phenol degradation were determined to be 8 0 and 37 c respectively the enhanced tolerance of the immobilized systems towards adverse conditions have also been demonstrated in this study degradation kinetic studies were carried out using different substrate inhibition models and bio kinetic parameters were estimated via nonlinear regression analysis in matlab the best fitted model for areca nut husk and luffa sponge system was edward model and aiba model respectively interestingly the immobilized microorganisms could be stored at 4 c for up to 6 weeks without any noticeable loss in degradation efficiency the immobilized microorganisms could also be used for successfully conducting up to 15 consecutive batch biodegradation experiments compositional analysis studies of both the lignocellulosic biomass before immobilization and after 15 successive batch experiments revealed that the structural components of the biomass were not degraded which establishes the fact that these can be successfully used for long term operation of reactors these results establish the fact that areca nut husks and luffa sponge fibers have the potential to be efficiently used as inexpensive immobilization matrices for the bioremediation of environmental pollutants further studies are being carried out to check the efficiency of these matrices in lab scale packed bed reactors and will be reported in future communications acknowledgement this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial

14135,immobilization of microorganisms is a widely adopted strategy for the efficient degradation of hazardous organic compounds like phenol microorganisms can be immobilized in synthetic or natural matrices in this work dried areca nut areca catechu husks and luffa luffa cylindrica sponge fibers were used as alternative and inexpensive natural matrices for microbial cell immobilization the potential of these immobilization systems for the effective bioremediation of phenolic wastewater was explored a bacterial consortium was isolated by enriching a sludge sample from a petroleum refinery in high phenol concentrations the mixed bacterial culture was capable of degrading 1000 mg l 1 of phenol in suspension cultures the bacterial consortium was immobilized on the lignocellulosic matrices phenol degradation studies were performed in batches to optimize the physicochemical parameters optimum ph and temperature for phenol degradation was found to be 8 0 and 37 c at an optimum ph and temperature the areca nut husk and luffa sponge systems immobilized with the mixed culture could degrade 1000 mg l 1 phenol in 28 h and 30 h respectively the highest experimental degradation rates in areca nut husk and luffa sponge systems were 0 37 h 1 and 0 21 h 1 respectively at 200 mg l 1 phenol degradation kinetic studies were carried out using several inhibition models further studies revealed that both matrices with immobilized microbes could be reused for several successive batch degradation experiments and stored at 4 c for several weeks without any noticeable loss in degradation efficiency keywords areca nut husk immobilization kinetic parameters luffa sponge fiber mixed bacterial culture phenol biodegradation 1 introduction phenols or phenolics are a class of organic chemical compounds well known for their toxic effects on microbes aquatic flora and fauna animals and humans even at low concentrations the simplest of them is phenol which is the most sought after pollutant due to its recalcitrant and ubiquitous nature phenolic compounds are very frequently found in run offs and effluents of various industries such as petrochemicals coal conversion coking plant leather textiles pharmaceutical olive oil paint polycarbonate resin ink paper perfume etc 1 phenol has been categorized in the list of significant contaminants by the us environmental protection agency usepa due to its high solubility in water sources and toxicity 2 the permissible limits of phenol in potable waters has been set to 1 μg l 1 by the world health organization who 3 hence removal of phenol from wastewater is essential before its release into the environment over the years researchers have shown that bioremediation is a cost effective and eco friendly alternative to the traditional physicochemical methods used for phenol removal 4 7 although sustainable the inhibitory effect of phenol at high concentrations pose a serious challenge for wastewater remediation by microorganisms 8 hence several strategies have been explored to overcome this problem most common approaches include use of genetically modified organisms acclimatization of organisms to lethal phenol concentrations and immobilization of organisms 9 immobilization of microbial cells offer several benefits over other approaches for treatment of phenolic wastewaters 1 fortifies microbes against the toxic effects of phenol and harsh environments 2 helps reach a high microbial concentration hence achieving a high contaminant degradation rate 3 helps easy recovery and re use of microbial cells for repeated degradation of target pollutants and 4 helps microbial cells stay viable during storage for extended durations with little or no loss of degradation capacity hence ensuring stable long term operation 5 10 11 immobilization by entrapment of microbial cells in matrices such as calcium alginate beads 8 12 or a more mechanically stable pva poly vinyl alcohol 4 6 13 were reported earlier entrapment of whole cells using chitosan beads 10 or hybrid systems involving alginate chitosan pva alginate and glycerol alginate 9 were also implemented immobilization studies were carried out using supports such as polyurethane foam puf 14 celite r 635 15 and liapor clay beads 16 a major drawback of systems such as calcium alginate is its instability against phosphates and disruption of gel particles due to co2 evolution 17 in recent years the pursuit for finding a natural renewable non toxic and biodegradable immobilization matrix has brought lignocellulosic biomass to limelight microbial cells immobilize onto lignocellulosic biomass via physical adsorption 18 owing to its abundance on planet earth a variety of lignocellulosic supports such as bagasse sawdust wood shavings chips rice husk straw and dry coconut husk were tested for fermentation and wastewater treatment studies 5 17 18 table 1 describes various reported immobilization matrices used for phenol degradation in the current study we have used dried areca nut husks and dry mature luffa vegetable fibers as potential candidates to immobilize bacteria for phenol degradation areca catechu family arecaceae is a species of palm which grows lavishly in asian countries the fruit is known as areca nut or betel nut india is the largest producer of areca nut in the world 19 the fruit is protected by a fibrous husk which is separated before consumption of the areca nut this husk is discarded and is considered as agricultural waste 19 owing to the considerable amount of sugars 21 in these husks they have been used as low cost substrates for citric acid production by solid state fermentation 20 on the other hand luffa cylindrica family cucurbitaceae is a vegetable crop that grows abundantly in tropical and sub tropical climates of african and asian countries the fruit although edible at a younger stage becomes very fibrous once ripened the mature fruit is dried until the fleshy part fades away leaving a skeleton of randomly interconnected network of highly fibrous matrix the dried fruit is widely used as bath scrubber and for manufacturing bath mats table and door mats 21 these fibers are highly porous and are used as a potential support for immobilization of microbial cells for ethanol production 21 22 the use of luffa sponge for immobilization of algal and fungal cells for removal of heavy metals was also reported 23 however to our knowledge there are no reports on bacterial immobilization on areca nut husk and luffa fibers for treatment of phenolic wastewater therefore we have explored the potential of these two lignocellulosic biomasses as carrier matrices for bacterial immobilization and their use for treatment of synthetic phenolic wastewater in this study a mixed bacterial culture which was previously acclimatized to high phenol concentrations was immobilized onto these two biomasses the effect of factors such as ph of the growth medium temperature of incubation and initial phenol concentration were studied and optimized the experimental degradation data were fitted to various established substrate inhibition models via matlab r2018a and various bio kinetic parameters were estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and raw materials all the analytical grade chemical components and phenol crystals were procured from himedia and merck india areca nut husks and luffa sponges were obtained from the local market in guwahati assam india 2 2 microorganisms and culture condition a microbial consortium was isolated in our earlier study 24 by enriching a sludge sample acquired from a petroleum refinery in high phenol concentrations the mixed microbial culture could utilize phenol up to a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 the enrichment culture contained three culturable strains of bacteria these isolates were identified as brevibacterium sp dbk1 ncbi genbank accession no kp231222 stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila dbk ncbi genbank accession no kc992293 and brucella sp dbk2 ncbi genbank accession no kp231223 by 16s rrna sequencing the mixed culture was maintained and cultivated in sterilized msm mineral salt medium the chemical composition of which has been described in our previous report 24 sub culturing was done every fifteen days in an incubator shaker at 37 c and 120 rpm incubator model zhicheng instruments zhwy 2112b with 1000 mg l 1 of phenol as a sole energy and carbon source the mixed culture at its late log phase was stored at 4 c 2 3 preparation of the lignocellulosic matrices and immobilization of the mixed culture areca nut husks were washed with water and dehydrated in a hot air oven at 85 c to remove any moisture as these are prone to fungal contamination the outside skin or the exocarp of the areca nut husks were removed and only the fibrous part or mesocarp was retained the luffa sponges were also washed with water and dried at 85 c to remove moisture the dried areca nut husks and mature luffa sponges were then chopped into pieces of 5 mm 6 mm approximately the chopped biomasses were washed several times with deionized water to remove pigments imparted by the particles these were dried again at 85 c the untreated biomasses were autoclaved dried and stored these were later used as matrices for microbial immobilization immobilization of microbial cells onto the dried biomass was performed in situ in conical flasks by a semi solid state approach where cells were immobilized by natural adsorption 5 17 20 g of sterile and dried areca nut husk was mixed with 200 ml of fresh bacterial culture the bacterial culture was maintained in 1000 mg l 1 phenol for achieving higher bacterial biomass densities the concentration of the bacterial culture was recorded as 1 09 od600 which was equivalent to 0 944 g l 1 dry cell weight dcw 1 0 od equivalent to 0 866 g l 1 of dry cell biomass r2 0 97 data not shown here this was allowed to stand in a static incubator at 37 c after 24 h the flasks were augmented with 50 ml of fresh media substituted with 200 mg l 1 phenol and allowed to stand overnight thereafter the entire media was replaced with 200 ml of fresh mineral media containing another 200 mg l 1 phenol this was allowed to stand for another 24 h in a static incubator at 37 c this method of immobilization was adopted from basak et al 5 with slight modifications similarly immobilization of bacterial culture was also carried out for luffa sponges since the density of luffa sponge is rather low when compared to areca nut husks only 6 g of dry luffa sponges were used for immobilization of bacterial culture the entire immobilization process was achieved in 500 ml conical flasks containing 200 ml of bacterial culture 2 4 optimization of physical parameters responsible for growth and substrate utilization batch studies 2 4 1 effect of initial ph of the culture media batch experiments were performed to ascertain the impact of initial ph of the growth medium on the bioremediation of phenol a wide range of ph levels were considered for the experiment 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 and 10 0 the selection of ph values were made based on our previous study 24 on phenol degradation using free cells of the mixed bacterial culture the initial pollutant concentration in the culture medium was maintained at 200 mg l 1 experiments were performed in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of culture media 15 g of wet areca nut husk and 6 g of wet luffa sponge fibers with immobilized microorganisms were used as inoculum for the experiments all the experiments were carried out at 37 c in an incubator shaker at 120 rpm phenol degradation was monitored at regular intervals degradation data was used to calculate the degradation rate of phenol which helped determine the optimal ph required for substrate utilization 2 4 2 effect of incubation temperature experiments were also performed to investigate the impact of temperature of incubation on the bioremediation of phenol a predetermined optimum ph calculated from the previous set of experiments was used for the study 200 mg l 1 of phenol was used as a solitary source of carbon for the experiments studies were performed at incubation temperatures of 25 c 30 c 37 c and 45 c in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of culture media in a shaker incubator at 120 rpm the inoculum volume was maintained at 15 g for wet areca nut husks and 6 g for wet luffa sponge fibers consumption of phenol by the immobilized microbes was monitored at regular intervals for calculation of phenol degradation rate and successive ascertainment of the optimum incubation temperature 2 4 3 effect of initial phenol concentrations at an optimum ph and temperature determined from the previous set of experiments conducted in sections 2 4 1 and 2 4 2 respectively studies were also conducted to ascertain the optimum phenol concentration for rapid substrate utilization various increasing concentrations of phenol 200 mg l 1 400 mg l 1 600 mg l 1 800 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 were used as the sole source of carbon and energy for this study inoculum load was maintained at 15 g for wet areca nut husk and 6 g for wet luffa sponge fibers experiments were performed in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of mineral media in a shaker incubator at 120 rpm residual concentrations of phenol were estimated by withdrawing samples at fixed intervals phenol degradation data was used for calculation of degradation rate q h 1 and analysis of degradation kinetics degradation kinetic study is discussed in a later section the optimum value of environmental parameters was determined based on the value of degradation rate q h 1 all experiments discussed above were conducted in triplicates 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 analysis of residual phenol nylon membrane filter papers 0 22 μm pore size pall corporation were used to filter samples residual phenol concentration in the filtrates were determined via high performance liquid chromatography model agilent technologies 1220 infinity lc fitted with a variable wavelength detector vwd and a reverse phase column agilent zorbax eclipse xdb c18 particle size 5 μm dimensions 3 0 x 150 mm after appropriate dilutions a mobile phase of water 60 acetonitrile 40 was used and a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 was maintained at room temperature residual phenol was detected by injecting aliquots of 20 μl at a wavelength of 280 nm 2 5 2 electron microscopic studies the lignocellulosic matrices with and without the immobilized mixed bacterial consortium was observed and studied via fesem field emission scanning electron microscopy 5 mm pieces of areca nut husk and luffa sponges were collected from the immobilization flasks and fixed by treatment with 3 5 glutaraldehyde for 6 h 17 these were further washed with sterile crystal free neutral phosphate buffer and dehydrated by treatment with increasing ethanol gradation 50 70 90 95 and 100 the samples were finally dried in a vacuum desiccator overnight the dried samples were directly placed on a double sided carbon tape on a fesem stub and coated with gold film the morphology of the bacterial community immobilized on the lignocellulosic matrices were witnessed and photographed at a magnification of 0 5 10 kx via zeiss fesem model sigma the oven dried lignocellulosic matrices without the immobilized bacterial culture were directly viewed under fesem without any kind of pre treatment 2 6 degradation kinetic studies and comparison of inhibition kinetic models experimental degradation data obtained from batch studies described in section 2 4 3 was fitted to several available kinetic models to elucidate the kinetics of phenol degradation by the immobilized microorganisms various established substrate inhibition kinetic models viz haldane model 25 yano model 26 aiba model 27 edward model 28 and webb model 29 table 2 were considered in this study degradation rate of phenol q h 1 was ascertained from the gradient of plot of the negative logarithm of s so vs time t 7 for various initial substrate concentrations so the plot of experimental degradation rates q versus values of various corresponding initial phenol concentrations so were fitted to the different substrate inhibition models different bio kinetic parameters such as qmax maximum degradation rate h 1 ki inhibition constant mg l 1 and ks affinity constant mg l 1 were calculated for the inhibition models using nonlinear regression analysis in matlab r2017b 2 7 storage and reusability studies of the mixed culture immobilized on the lignocellulosic biomass the effect of storage on the stability and biodegradation potential of the microbes immobilized on the lignocellulosic biomass was studied for a period 0 6 weeks after the immobilization of the mixed bacterial culture on the lignocellulosic biomass as described in section 2 3 a biodegradation experiment was conducted for a phenol concentration of 200 mg l 1 residual phenol concentrations were measured at regular intervals and time taken for complete phenol degradation was noted in order to maintain similar inoculum quality for the entire course of storage stability experiments abundant immobilized material was prepared for carrying out biodegradation studies in triplicates for eight batches the immobilized cells were then stored at 4 c for conducting the storage stability experiments biodegradation batch experiments were conducted in triplicates every week for up to 6 weeks to check for the decline if any in biodegradation potential of the immobilized mixed microorganisms before commencing the batch experiments the lignocellulosic biomass was allowed to reach the room temperature reusability of the immobilized microorganisms was also studied by conducting several successive batch degradation experiments for these studies the lignocellulosic biomass immobilized with the mixed microbial culture was retrieved from the first batch of experiments these were then washed with sterile distilled water subsequently the retrieved biomass was subjected to repeated batch biodegradation experiments for up to 15 batches after each batch the biomass was retrieved and washed with sterile distilled water residual phenol concentration was monitored at regular intervals and time taken for complete degradation was noted for all the batches all the studies were conducted in triplicates with a phenol concentration of 200 mg l 1 in 250 ml conical flasks a uniform ph and temperature of 8 0 and 37 c respectively was maintained in the shaker incubator at 120 rpm for all storage and reusability experiments 2 8 composition analysis studies of the lignocellulosic biomass compositional analysis studies were carried out for the lignocellulosic biomass without immobilized microorganisms and with immobilized microorganisms after 15 consecutive batch experiments to determine the degradation of the structural components if any of the lignocellulosic biomass hemicellulose was determined by a method described by goering and van soest 30 which involved estimating neutral detergent fiber ndf and acid detergent fiber adf separately hemicellulose content can be determined by calculating the difference between ndf and adf holocellulose was measured by treatment with sodium chlorite 31 lignin was estimated by tappi standard protocol technical association of the pulp and paper industry 3 results and discussion 3 1 lignocellulosic matrices immobilization of the mixed culture and electron microscopic imagery usually microorganisms are immobilized onto solid supports by recirculating a concentrated microbial culture suspension through a reactor where the lignocellulosic materials act as solid supports one major drawback of this process is cell desorption which restricts operational stability 17 in this study a semi solid state approach was adopted to achieve maximum cell immobilization and enhanced stability adding fresh media with phenol after 24 h and 48 h as discussed in section 2 3 resulted in enhanced cell growth causing microbial cells to be immobilized thoroughly on the supports 17 scanning electron microscopy fesem was performed to visualize the lignocellulosic matrices with and without immobilization of the mixed bacterial culture fig 1 a and b portrays the surface architecture of the areca nut husks and luffa sponge fibers respectively without immobilized microorganisms it can be easily visualized that the surface of the areca nut husks is a lot rougher and porous in texture when compared to the luffa sponge fibers fig 1 c and d depicts the immobilization of the microbial cells on the areca nut husks copious amounts of bacterial cells can be seen immobilized on the surface of the areca nut husks the surface architecture of the husks appears to be smooth in contrast to the surface without microorganisms which is possibly due to formation of biofilms fig 1 e and f illustrates the immobilization of microbial cells on the surface of the luffa sponge fibers it can be observed that when compared with areca nut husk fibers the intensity of immobilized bacterial cells on the luffa sponges has declined this impairment in immobilization intensity can be attributed to the fact that the surface of the luffa sponge fibers is smoother compared to the areca nut husks the rougher surface of the areca nut husks might be responsible for enhanced cell adsorption the bacterial cells were adsorbed on the lignocellulosic biomass naturally which can be ascribed to covalent bonding or electrostatic forces between the surface of the lignocellulosic biomass and the bacterial cells 5 3 2 effect of initial ph on the degradation of phenol ph plays a vital role in utilization and degradation of phenolic compounds by microorganisms maintaining an optimum ph of the culture media activates enzymes that are responsible for degradation of phenol extreme changes in ph renders these enzymes non functional causing denaturation and loss of catalytic activity 24 denaturation of enzymes impairs metabolic activity of the microorganism eventually leading to rapid obliteration of bacterial biomass hence an optimum initial ph should be imperatively maintained for efficient phenol degradation fig 2 a represents the phenol degradation curves at different ph values in case of areca nut husk immobilization system it can be observed that phenol was completely degraded in 6 h for ph 7 0 and ph 8 0 whereas complete degradation of phenol was achieved in 8 h for ph 5 0 and ph 6 0 for higher ph values of 9 0 and 10 0 more than 99 of the pollutant was degraded in 10 h fig 2b represents the phenol degradation percentage and degradation rates for 200 mg l 1 phenol at different ph values in areca nut husk immobilization system the degradation rate reached a maximum value of 0 37 h 1 at ph 8 0 although complete degradation of phenol was achieved at ph 7 0 the degradation rate was lower at a value of 0 23 h 1 it may be noted that when compared to the suspension cell culture reported in our previous study 24 there is a marked improvement in phenol degradation phenol was degraded completely in ph values of 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 besides more than 99 of phenol was also degraded at ph 9 and ph 10 during the study duration whereas in our previous study using free cells 24 at ph 5 5 and ph 8 5 a severe inhibition of growth was observed which indicated minimal or no degradation of phenol similarly fig 3 a represents the phenol degradation curves at different ph values in luffa sponge immobilization system here it can be observed that 200 mg l 1 of phenol was completely degraded at ph 8 0 in 8 h at ph 7 0 complete degradation was achieved in 10 h complete phenol degradation for ph 9 0 and ph 10 0 was achieved at 12 h and 14 h respectively at ph 6 0 complete degradation of phenol took 20 h however at ph 5 0 phenol was not completely degraded in the duration of the study and about 79 degradation could be achieved in 24 h fig 3b represents the phenol degradation rates and corresponding degradation percentages for luffa immobilization system the phenol degradation rate attained a maximum value of 0 21 h 1 at ph 8 0 hence an initial ph of 8 0 was determined to be optimum for efficient phenol degradation in both the immobilization systems since it was at this ph value that maximum phenol degradation rates were attained a substantial improvement of the capability of immobilized bacterial cells in tolerating harsher ph conditions can be attributed to the fact that immobilization on the lignocellulosic supports provided ample resistance and protection 13 moreover immobilization makes larger number of bacterial cells available for utilization of substrate compared to the freely suspended counterparts which were not able to tolerate highly acidic or alkaline ph 24 areca nut husk system was able to tolerate and degrade phenol over a wider range of ph when compared to luffa sponge system this could be attributed to the fact that the luffa sponges were less porous than areca nut husks and more bacterial cells were immobilized on the areca nut husks compared to luffa sponges the surface morphology and porosity of the husks possibly provided superior protection to the bacterial cells compared to the luffa sponges enabling the bacterial cells to tolerate harsher conditions 3 3 effect of incubation temperature on phenol bioremediation enzymes responsible for phenol degradation are vulnerable to temperature changes hence an optimum temperature must be maintained for efficient utilization of a substrate suboptimal temperatures might lead to impaired functioning of enzymes eventually slowing down organismal metabolism leading to slower and inefficient consumption of phenol fig 4 a and fig 4b represents the degradation rates and degradation percentages of phenol at different temperatures of incubation for areca nut husk and luffa sponge immobilization systems respectively all experiments were performed at ph 8 0 both cases witnessed an improvement in degradation rate with rise in temperature a peak degradation rate was achieved at 37 c for both the immobilization systems a maximum degradation rate of 0 37 h 1 was observed in case of areca nut husks whereas the maximum degradation rate was 0 21 h 1 in case of luffa sponges complete phenol degradation was achieved in 6 h and 8 h for areca nut husks and luffa sponge immobilization systems respectively the degradation rate declined at 45 c in both cases tolerance towards temperatures on either side of the optimum point was quite remarkable for both immobilization systems percentage degradation and degradation rate of phenol was more at 45 c compared to 25 c and 30 c areca nut husk system could degrade 71 34 of phenol at 45 c during the experimental duration data not shown here whereas luffa fiber system could achieve 65 18 phenol degradation at 45 c data not shown here phenol degradation rates at 30 c for both immobilization systems were also acceptable however the degradation percentages of phenol at 25 c was very low suggesting very slow substrate utilization rates when compared to our previous study involving free cells 24 there was a remarkable improvement in phenol degradation at 45 c the mixed culture in free suspension exhibited a stunted growth featuring very low growth rates and almost no phenol degradation 24 the above results verified that immobilization of microorganisms improved tolerance towards temperature changes 3 4 effect of initial substrate concentration on the degradation of phenol initial concentration of phenol plays a crucial role in the bioremediation process as phenol is a very potent growth inhibitor experiments were carried out for both lignocellulosic biomass with different initial phenol concentrations 200 mg l 1 400 mg l 1 600 mg l 1 800 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 at an optimized ph and temperature of 8 0 and 37 c respectively fig 5 a represents the phenol degradation profiles at various initial phenol concentrations for the areca nut husk system fig 5b represents the phenol degradation rates and degradation percentages for the same the maximum phenol degradation rate 0 37 h 1 was observed at 200 mg l 1 phenol the degradation rate declined with increase in phenol concentrations indicating the inhibitory effect of the substrate the degradation rate at 1000 mg l 1 phenol was 0 096 h 1 and the areca nut husk immobilized microbes could degrade only about 21 of the initial substrate concentration however the experiment was continued to monitor the time taken for the depletion of phenol entirely in all the batches considered in the study 1000 mg l 1 of phenol was completely depleted in 28 h likewise fig 6 a depicts the phenol degradation profiles for the luffa sponge immobilization system at varying phenol concentrations fig 6b represents the phenol degradation rates and degradation percentages for the luffa immobilized organisms the maximum degradation rate was 0 21 h 1 and it was achieved by the organisms growing in 200 mg l 1 phenol the trend of decline of the degradation rates were similar to the areca nut husk immobilization system indicating substrate inhibition organisms exhibited a minimum degradation rate of 0 089 h 1 at 1000 mg l 1 of phenol however 1000 mg l 1 phenol was degraded completely in 30 h by the microbes in the luffa sponge system the above results when compared to free cell culture from our earlier reported study revealed promising results a free suspension of the mixed culture could degrade 1000 mg l 1 phenol in 96 h 24 for both our immobilization systems there is a remarkable improvement in phenol degradation times the phenol degradation times reduced by more than three times in both cases this enhancement of degradation can be attributed to the fact that immobilization shields the microorganisms from the toxic effects of phenol 6 moreover reports also suggest that immobilization of bacterial cells enhance cellular activity by altering their physiological features in metabolism such as amplified enzyme induction reduced specific cell growth and cell yield 3 6 3 5 modeling and kinetics of phenol degradation phenol degradation kinetics by the bacterial consortium immobilized on areca nut husks and luffa sponges was studied at different starting phenol concentrations so 200 1000 mg l 1 of the growth medium for each initial phenol concentration experimental substrate degradation rates q h 1 were calculated as per the description in section 2 6 a maximum experimental degradation rate was achieved at a pollutant concentration of 200 mg l 1 for both areca nut husk and luffa sponge immobilization systems the experimental degradation rates were comparable to the reported literatures which made use of synthetic matrices table 1 thereafter the degradation rates started declining indicating substrate inhibition the plot of experimental degradation rates versus their corresponding initial substrate concentrations was fitted to several available inhibition kinetic models via matlab r2017b fig 7 a and fig 7b depicts the fitting of experimental q with model simulated values of different inhibition models for areca nut husk and luffa sponge system respectively several bio kinetic parameters were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis and portrayed in table 2 the corresponding values of the coefficients of correlation r2 are also reported the experimental degradation rates demonstrated by the mixed bacterial culture immobilized on the areca nut husks 0 37 h 1 were found to be higher than the bacteria immobilized on luffa sponges 0 21 h 1 based on the value of correlation coefficient r2 0 9858 the best fit in case of areca nut husk system was given by edward model with a predicted maximum degradation rate qmax of 0 0042 h 1 the values of ks and ki were predicted to be 3 58 mg l 1 and 231 mg l 1 respectively in case of luffa fibers however the best fitted model was aiba model with a r2 value of 0 9903 and a qmax of 0 3413 h 1 the values of ks and ki were calculated to be 39 5 mg l 1 and 663 mg l 1 respectively the values of ks points to the ability of the organisms to grow at a fairly higher concentration of phenol 13 apart from this however other models also fitted the experimental data fairly well in case of both the immobilization systems owing to the value of r2 interestingly haldane model which is the most widely used inhibition model exhibited a very low value of ki for both the immobilization systems although r2 is 0 9 ki value indicates inhibitory concentration of phenol which is toxic to the organisms 13 and an inferior predicted ki value compared to ks value renders the haldane model unsuitable 3 6 storage and reusability of the immobilized microorganisms stability of the immobilized cells during long term storage is an indispensable aspect to be considered for the feasible application of the immobilized cell system 6 the effect of storage of the immobilized microorganisms at 4 c on degradation of phenol was studied for a period of 6 weeks both lignocellulosic biomass with microorganisms immobilized were stored for a period of 7 14 21 28 35 and 42 days at 4 c fig 8 portrays the variation of the phenol degradation rates of areca nut husk and luffa sponge systems at optimal degradation conditions for 200 mg l 1 phenol it was noticed that there were minimal changes in degradation rates over the course of 6 weeks the time taken for complete depletion of 200 mg l 1 of phenol was also noted for each batch it was observed that each batch of experiments took precisely 6 h and 8 h for complete degradation of 200 mg l 1 phenol degradation data not shown here for areca nut husk and luffa sponge supports respectively these results demonstrated that the immobilized cells had a very strong storage stability and could successfully be reused for a long time the obtained results were at par with earlier reported studies 6 7 13 it is worth mentioning that the storage of immobilized cells is possible in sterilized glass containers or flasks at 4 c without any special care and any significant deterioration of degradation efficiency similar to storage the stability of immobilized cells in long term operation is also an important aspect which must be considered for practical applicability of the immobilized cell system 3 in order to investigate this areca nut husk and luffa sponge supports containing the immobilized microbes were exposed to 15 consecutive batch degradation experiments each batch consisted of 200 mg l 1 of phenol and 6 h and 8 h of incubation for areca nut husk and luffa sponge supports respectively it was observed that there were negligible shifts in the degradation efficiencies in case of both the supports data not shown here moreover 200 mg l 1 of phenol was biodegraded completely in the duration of the experiment for each batch the results are comparable to earlier reported literatures 6 13 and better than a few others 5 7 structural integrity in terms of lignocellulosic biomass composition was studied after the completion of reusability studies results discussed in the next section 3 7 3 7 studies on compositional analysis of the lignocellulosic biomass compositional analysis studies were carried out to determine the degradation of structural components of the lignocellulosic biomass if any due to repeated batch degradation experiments table 3 summarizes the results of the compositional analysis studies it can be clearly observed that there were no noticeable shifts in the structural composition of both the lignocellulosic biomass even after 15 consecutive batch biodegradation experiments these results indicate the resilience of both the lignocellulosic biomass and their resistance towards degradation by the mixed culture that was immobilized on them hence it can be concluded that both lignocellulosic biomasses can be used successfully as immobilization supports for the mixed bacterial culture to achieve effective and enhanced phenol degradation efficiencies 4 conclusions a bacterial consortium was isolated from a petroleum refinery sludge in a previously reported study 24 the consortium could degrade 1000 mg l 1 of phenol in 96 h this study investigated the potential of two lignocellulosic biomass as possible candidates for immobilization of the mixed bacterial culture for enhanced phenol remediation we have used dry areca nut husks and mature luffa sponges as immobilization supports the mixed bacterial culture was immobilized on the supports via natural adsorption when compared to the freely suspended degradation system reported in our earlier study 24 the immobilized system could degrade phenol a lot faster under optimized ph and temperature conditions the optimum ph and temperature for efficient phenol degradation were determined to be 8 0 and 37 c respectively the enhanced tolerance of the immobilized systems towards adverse conditions have also been demonstrated in this study degradation kinetic studies were carried out using different substrate inhibition models and bio kinetic parameters were estimated via nonlinear regression analysis in matlab the best fitted model for areca nut husk and luffa sponge system was edward model and aiba model respectively interestingly the immobilized microorganisms could be stored at 4 c for up to 6 weeks without any noticeable loss in degradation efficiency the immobilized microorganisms could also be used for successfully conducting up to 15 consecutive batch biodegradation experiments compositional analysis studies of both the lignocellulosic biomass before immobilization and after 15 successive batch experiments revealed that the structural components of the biomass were not degraded which establishes the fact that these can be successfully used for long term operation of reactors these results establish the fact that areca nut husks and luffa sponge fibers have the potential to be efficiently used as inexpensive immobilization matrices for the bioremediation of environmental pollutants further studies are being carried out to check the efficiency of these matrices in lab scale packed bed reactors and will be reported in future communications acknowledgement this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial

micro pollutants that can be found in effluents of a wide range of chemical industries specifically they can be existed in the effluents of petrochemical refineries and pharmaceutical industries thus there is no doubt of their specific passive impacts on the whole environment and especially to human health even at very low concentrations 1 therefore several agencies have intensively restricted the discharge of wastewater containing phenol without a proper treatment for instance 0 5 ppm is the legislated concentration of phenol in surface water based on the japan environmental governing standards 2 more importantly the recycle of wastewater as reuse water might be prohibited due to the existence of phenolic compounds several treatment methods were therefore developed to abate the phenolic compounds in many industrial applications for example oxidation adsorption distillation extraction and membrane processes are the most well known technologies used to remove phenolic compounds from wastewater 3 the membrane technology and especially the ro process has been extensively used to treat a wide range of organic pollutants and specifically phenolic compounds with a significant success 4 several experimental studies were carried out to remove phenol chlorophenol and dimethylphenol from synthetic industrial wastewater that confirmed the feasibility of a pilot scale ro process 5 8 in addition these studies also developed simple lumped parameter and one dimensional models to describe the interaction between the inlet and outlet parameters especially for the spiral wound ro process and for the removal of different phenolic compounds these studies also assisted to develop more accurate one and two dimensional steady state and dynamic mathematical models 9 11 also these detailed models were used to investigate the process performance and optimise the removal of phenolic compounds from wastewater however these models were built based on several assumptions that caused a noticeable deviation between theoretical prediction and experimental data for example the spiral wound membrane has been assumed to be unwound and flat which made its configuration same as the plate and frame module moreover ignoring the influence of the feed spacer on the fluid patterns inside the feed channel also affects the models predictions abbas and al bastaki 26 noted the complexity of obtaining rigorous mechanistic models of ro process due to insufficient knowledge of the difficult interaction between its operating parameters and concentration polarisation and fouling which are barely measured therefore artificial neural network ann has been widely used to model the complex processes due to its high precision compared to other stochastic mathematical methods 12 13 anns approach has been considered as one of the best stochastic methods to infer results and configure new functional relationships between the data 14 furthermore artificial intelligence has been found to be an efficient tool to carry out the design operation control and performance optimisation of any industrial process 15 16 ann has many advantageous compared to other stochastic methods and the associated network modelling does not require any governing correlations or relative assumptions to describe the process phenomena 17 also the fundamental characteristic of nonlinearity of neural network enables to forecast the behavior of several complicated processes including ro process the following discussed several recent studies that used ann to generate accurate models in order to predict the performance of ro process based on seawater desalination and wastewater treatment salgado reyna et al 12 investigated a four layer feed forward network with a back propagation algorithm which used to analyse the observational data of permeate flow rate of a pilot plant ro membrane based can manufacturing wastewater treatment plant under continuous flow and various operating conditions the developed a feed forward ann model comprised of two hidden layers with 4 and 3 neurons respectively this in turn showed a very good agreement between the model prediction and obtainable data barello et al 18 developed a time dependent neural network nn based correlation to forecast the water permeability constant kw in seawater ro desalination process under fouling conditions a very close prediction of kw was achieved for the nn based correlation compared to those existed correlations moreover the influence of numbers of hidden layers and neurons in each layer and the transfer functions was also explored the development of an intelligent network model for different types of ro membranes under a considerable range of operating conditions was successfully achieved by salami et al 27 it is noted that the model prediction is significantly affected by the number of considered hidden layers and neurons besides the sufficient of experimental data interestingly the study showed the reliability of ann model where a good agreement with the experimental data of correlation coefficient r of 0 97 was noticed more recently roehl et al 19 developed ann models from a six year experimental data to investigate the main reasons of membrane fouling in the introductory stage of a large scale of 3 stages municipal ro process plant this in turn elucidated the efficiency of ann to explore the most important parameters that boost the fouling propensity and therefore helped to quantify the way of process improvement it is evident from the above statements that all the published research of ann for the ro process modelling have been carried out based on seawater desalination and there is a clear limitation of ann used in the wastewater treatment more specifically no attempt to investigate the feasibility of ann to establish network modelling for the removal of chlorophenol from wastewater using an individual spiral wound ro process can be found in the open literature moreover there remains the challenge of having a reliable model of high accuracy to estimate the ro process performance for the abatement of a hazardous chlorophenol compound this research emphasises on this particular challenge and attempts to investigate the feasibility of the multilayered artificial neural network mlann model with genetic algorithm ga approach to estimate the performance of ro process for the removal of chlorophenol from wastewater experimental data from the literature is used for this purpose the predictions of the mlann model are also compared with the predictions of deterministic models developed for the chlorophenol removal 2 experimental work plant description and modelling contribution a laboratory pilot scale cross flow ro treatment system was used by sundaramoorthy et al 8 to remove chlorophenol at different concentrations from wastewater the ro process consists of a commercial thin film composite polyamide membrane of effective area 7 845 m² stuffed inside a spiral wound membrane module the detailed specification of the module is given in table 1 fig 1 presents the schematic diagram of the ro process showing a feed tank full of wastewater that is pumped to the ro module using a high pressure pump delivering pressure up to 20 atm the chlorophenol solutions were prepared at different concentrations varying between 778 to 6226 kmol m³ moreover the other operating parameters of flow rate and pressure were varied between 2 166 10 4 to 2 583 10 4 m³ s and 5 83 13 58 at m for each specific feed flow rate the treatment was carried out between 29 5 ⁰c to 32 5 ⁰c of operating temperature intensive sets of experimental data that carried out by sundaramoorthy et al 8 as given in table 2 the data include the inlet flow rate f b inlet pressure pb inlet temperature tb inlet concentration cb and overall chlorophenol rejection rej specifically 70 sets of data was used in this study modelling of any industrial process including the ro process can be used as an effective tool to predict the process performance against the variation of operating parameters more importantly there was a progressive motivation to develop deterministic mass momentum and energy balances mathematical models that can extensively investigate the ro process performance based on the removal of organic compounds from wastewater the complexity of these models depends on the underlying assumptions together with the existence of nonlinear mass and energy balances and thermodynamic correlations no doubt the development of a high accuracy model that can properly predict the influence of the process input parameters on the output responses can help to optimise the process in order to attain the highest removal of pollutants at the lowest penalties moreover the modelling study has a primitive advantage of carrying out intensive experiments that need a long operation time in addition to its flexibility to test different parameters easily inexpensive and early stage design therefore this study aims to develop an accurate model to predict the performance of ro process to remove chlorophenol from wastewater without the need of further experiments 3 concepts of ann ann is a computational technique to map input and output data from a process via nonlinear regression model developed for the best neural network architecture ann technique has the ability to analyse the relationships between the inputs and outputs based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks the simple architecture of ann consists of three layers named input hidden and output layers as depicted in fig 2 the input signal received from external source bias b are multiplied by weights w 20 21 if the results of multiplying a exceeds the threshold the signal will be released and send to the output depending on ann activation function 22 in this respect three stages training testing and validating with several computational operations are applied to achieve the desired goal through ann in each stage of ann the main computational operations are described below the equations of output signal of any hidden layer and output layer are defined in the counter of eqs 1 and 2 respectively 23 1 a 1 i 1 i n w i x i b 1 2 a 2 j 1 j k w j a i b 2 a 1 a 2 are the output signal of first and second hidden layers respectively x is the input parameter w and b represent the weight and bias respectively the activation function is used to normalise the data between 0 1 or 1 1 which is discrete or continuous in sigmoid respectively 3 f s 1 1 e s or in a hyperbolic tangent as 4 f s e s e s e s e s s is the value of input parameter the network may be linear or nonlinear during to an activation function 23 5 f 1 if s 0 1 otherwise the normalisation equation represented according to ref 24 6 s i 0 8 d m a x d m i n d i d m i n 0 1 dmin dmax and di are the minimum maximum and i values of the input output data respectively the predicted or target equation is represented as 7 y j 1 j k f 2 w j f 1 i 1 i n w i x i y is the prediction output value the weight matrices are calculated by applying an error back propagation method the accuracy of weights depends on the minimum error e of the output z k 1 k k in training stage and calculated using the sum of the square error based on ref 25 8 e k 1 k e k 2 k 1 k d k z k 2 k 1 k d k f w x k 2 w x is the weight matrix x is the input vectors and d is the desired target value 4 design and characteristics of proposed ann the development of the present neural network model is based on the genetic and back propagation algorithms used to improve the generalisation performance of a neural network and to generate a network modelling to forecast the performance indicators of chlorophenol rejection via the ro process as mentioned earlier this study utilises the actual observational data of chlorophenol removal from wastewater carried out by sundaramoorthy et al 8 a multilayer with two structures was used in the proposed ann model the steps design and characteristics of the proposed ann model in alyuda simulation https www alyuda com products neurointelligence features htm can be summarised as follows 1 in analysing and partitioning step the input data are partitioned randomly into training validation and test set 48 records for training set of 68 57 11 records for validation of 15 71 and 11 records for test sets of 15 71 2 in preprocessing step the data are scaled into rang 1 1 3 ga was used as an input feature selection method to improve the generalisation performance of the neural network this is basically carried out by identifying the input data that are not contribute significantly to the performance of neural network which in turn demonstrates the objective function of ga the genetic method is time consuming to select the best configuration despite its superiority of determining mutually required inputs this might signifies the drawback of ann however it is efficient to select the proper network by identifying the input data that significantly contribute the performance of ann the procedure of this method is summarised in five steps as follows a build a random population of input configurations b ignore input configurations that are not contributing significantly to the performance of neural network c select the superior configurations and use them to generate a new population d produce better input configuration using superior configurations e select the best configuration 4 ga parameters are smoothing 0 01 unit penalty 0 001 population size 50 generation 50 crossover rate 0 9 and mutation rate 0 1 5 in design step the number of hidden layer activation function and error function are selected as multilayer hyperbolic tangent and sum of squares respectively 6 the number of neurons in hidden layers was selected according to the number of inputs in the proposed equation of sanjay et al 24 9 j n 2 and 2 n n and j are the number of inputs and neurons respectively therefore two structures are build 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 as shown in fig 3 7 in training algorithm step the training parameters such as quick back propagation was used to calculate the weights matrices iterations 500 and randomisation range w 3 5 results and discussion seventy data points of sundaramoorthy et al 8 table 2 were used in this ann model with two structures 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 to predict the chlorophenol removal from wastewater and to study the effect of a number of neurons in the hidden layers on the matching between the measured and ann predicted values the datasets included several input parameters of the inlet flow rate f b inlet pressure pb inlet temperature tb and inlet concentration cb and response parameter of chlorophenol rejection rej the input data are partitioned randomly into training validation and test set 48 records for training set 11 records for validation set and 11 for test set of 68 57 15 71 and 15 71 for training validation and test set respectively figs 4 and 5 represent the plot of absolute errors against the number of iteration for structures of 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 respectively a sharp drop with the progress of iteration can be noticed in these figures specifically fig 4 depicts that the training of structure 4 2 2 1 stopped after 35 iterations with an absolute error of 0 91 and 1 11 of training and validation sets respectively however the training of structure 4 8 8 1 stopped after 13 iterations with an absolute error of 0 96 and 0 81 for training and validation sets respectively as can be seen in fig 5 generally the fast training and validation with few iterations depends on the good characteristics of input feature selection of ga method the ga method works on identifying the input data that have insignificant contribution to improve the generalisation process in training stage therefore the ga method has the superiority of determining mutually required inputs with less relative error and minimum iterations number but consumes time to select the best configuration on the other hand the improvement of an absolute error in structure 4 8 8 1 in validation stage can be attributed to the effect of numbers of neurons in the hidden layers it is important to mention that the assessment of ann performance is not specifically dependent on validation set however the combination of training and validation sets would provide a helpful tool to measure the performance of ann structure up to this point the validation set would reflect the unseen data that should not be used for model structure determination in this regards the testing stage has a primitive impact on determining the performance of structure fig 6 presents a scatter plot of the network outputs versus the targets experimental data of two structures 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 in testing stage all points are close to the line which means that the network has learnt the input output mappings with a good degree of accuracy however the scatter plot of structure 4 8 8 1 is closer to the experimental data compared to 4 2 2 1 the comparison between the performance of the two structures 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 in four stages in terms of three performance indicators of the coefficient of correlation coefficient determination r2 and average error ae as shown in table 3 this in turn show that the minimum average error is recorded in training stage of structure 4 8 8 1 of 0 042 with r2 0 999 and in testing stage of structure 4 8 8 1 of 0 67 with r2 0 989 therefore it can be said that 4 8 8 1 structure is nominated as the best model for predicting the chlorophenol rejection with the best value of r2 coefficient of correlation and average error during the performance of four stages to test the sensitivity of the ann for extrapolation accuracy under the effect of a large numbers of neurons in the hidden layers a third structure 4 15 15 1 has been considered as notified in table 3 this in turn showed the inconsistency of 4 15 15 1 structure where it yields unreasonable results of the performance indicators compared to the one of 4 8 8 1 structure the predicted values of chlorophenol rejection that appear in the training set and all stages of the artificial neural network for the 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 structures and the experimental data target are generated in figs 7 and 8 respectively the patterns of the ann structures show a high consistency where the produced lines are similar to those of experimental data however an accurate examination can be noticed for the plot of 4 8 8 1 structure and the experimental values for chlorophenol rejection furthermore a significant difference in the sum square of error values between 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 structures can confirm the accurate revealed examination of 4 8 8 1 structure up to this point this study has demonstrated the advantages of integrating the computer models and especially artificial intelligence combined with ga in the ro process based water treatment this is specifically aiding to develop of high accuracy models that can be used to predict performance of complex and non linear systems consider a massive set of real time data to be analysed which is not possible for other computer programs which is in turn would help the skilled operators to take accurate decision at any given time explicitly promote the design of water treatment systems such ro process at the hope of making strong safe and cost effective processes 6 conclusions the ann can be considered as an efficient and alternative method of modelling techniques of industrial processes including ro process especially in cases where mechanistic models are difficult to develop due to unknown underlying physics or uncertainty in parameters this paper is significant and unique in that it has developed the first comprehensive neural network model using the multilayer artificial intelligence combined with ga to predict the chlorophenol removal from wastewater using a pilot scale ro process in this respect the verification of the ann model was carried out based on actual experimental data for the chlorophenol removal from wastewater the ann model showed a high corroboration between the simulated chlorophenol rejection and the experimental data the results indicate that the accuracy of the artificial network structure 4 8 8 1 was satisfactory and coincided with the experimental data this also showed that the prediction accuracy is dependent on the number of neurons in the hidden layers the ann model presented in this research can be used in the future to maximise chlorophenol removal and minimise energy consumption while optimising operating variables 
14136,reverse osmosis ro can be considered as one of the most widely used technologies used to abate the existence of highly toxic compounds from wastewater in this paper a multilayer artificial neural network mlann with genetic algorithm ga have been considered to build a comprehensive mathematical model which can be used to predict the performance of an individual ro process in term of chlorophenol removal from wastewater the mlann model has been validated against 70 observational experimental datasets collected from the open literature the mlann model predictions have outperformed

error ave in this respect two structures 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 were also used to study the effect of a number of neurons in the hidden layers based on the difference between the measured and ann

4 8 8 1 of 0 67 with r2 0 989 therefore it can be said that 4 8 8 1 structure is nominated as the best model for predicting the chlorophenol rejection with the best value of r2 coefficient of correlation and average error during the performance of four stages to test the sensitivity of the ann for extrapolation accuracy under the effect of a large numbers of neurons in the hidden layers a third structure 4 15 15 1 has been considered as notified in table 3 this in turn showed the inconsistency of 4 15 15 1 structure where it yields unreasonable results of the performance indicators compared to the one of 4 8 8 1 structure the predicted values of chlorophenol rejection that appear in the training set and all stages of the artificial neural network for the 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 structures and the experimental data target are generated in figs 7 and 8 respectively the patterns of the ann structures show a high consistency where the produced lines are similar to those of experimental data however an accurate examination can be noticed for the plot of 4 8 8 1 structure and the experimental values for chlorophenol rejection furthermore a significant difference in the sum square of error values between 4 2 2 1 and 4 8 8 1 structures can confirm the accurate revealed examination of 4 8 8 1 structure up to this point this study has demonstrated the advantages of integrating the computer models and especially artificial intelligence combined with ga in the ro process based water treatment this is specifically aiding to develop of high accuracy models that can be used to predict performance of complex and non linear systems consider a massive set of real time data to be analysed which is not possible for other computer programs which is in turn would help the skilled operators to take accurate decision at any given time explicitly promote the design of water treatment systems such ro process at the hope of making strong safe and cost effective processes 6 conclusions the ann can be considered as an efficient and alternative method of modelling techniques of industrial processes including ro process especially in cases where mechanistic models are difficult to develop due to unknown underlying physics or uncertainty in parameters this paper is significant and unique in that it has developed the first comprehensive neural network model using the multilayer artificial intelligence combined with ga to predict the chlorophenol removal from wastewater using a pilot scale ro process in this respect the verification of the ann model was carried out based on actual experimental data for the chlorophenol removal from wastewater the ann model showed a high corroboration between the simulated chlorophenol rejection and the experimental data the results indicate that the accuracy of the artificial network structure 4 8 8 1 was satisfactory and coincided with the experimental data this also showed that the prediction accuracy is dependent on the number of neurons in the hidden layers the ann model presented in this research can be used in the future to maximise chlorophenol removal and minimise energy consumption while optimising operating variables 
14137,melanoidin removal in a microwave mw coupled with persulfate ps and or hydrogen peroxide h2o2 system was investigated as a precursor batch mode mw ps experiment was conducted at 250 mg l of melanoidin concentration the removal was observed to be 100 in 20 min of mw irradiation at ps dose of 2500 mg l and it was found that the rate constant increased with ps dosage on the other hand the mw h2o2 process has shown 31 removal at 6000 mg l h2o2 dosage in 20 min a central composite design ccd was used to identify the interaction between melanoidin concentration 500 10000 mg l ph 2 12 h2o2 0 6000 mg l and ps 0 5000 mg l dosages on melanoidin removal in mw system the basic condition ph 7 has shown higher melanoidin removal in the presence of h2o2 ps however proportionate decrease in removal was observed with increase in melanoidin concentration the addition of h2o2 and ps has amplified the removal of colour induced by melanoidin which was modeled by quadratic r2 0 87 and cubic r2 0 98 regression models a set of validation experiments were carried out under model predicted optimum conditions the experimental observations were in good correlation with the cubic model predicted values alcohol scavenging experiment shows that both sulfate and hydroxyl radical are responsible for melanoidin removal the generation of hydroxyl radicals was estimated a simple first order kinetic equation based model was developed to calculate the cost per kg of melanoidin removal in mw ps h2o2 system overall mw ps h2o2 system seems to be a better alternative for high rate melanoidin removal keywords melanoidin removal microwave coupled system response surface methodology multi oxidant system 1 introduction the treatment of wastewater from agro based industries like distillery winery and brewery has become a serious challenge at present due to the high organic content and the presence of recalcitrant and refractory compounds like melanoidin phenolics etc melanoidins are dark brown coloured high molecular weight polymers formed as the end products of maillard reaction they have antioxidant anti hypertensive and antimicrobial activities 1 maillard reaction occurs when a carbohydrate reacts with an amino acid or an amine at a temperature higher than 40 c therefore these melanoidins are common constituents in the wastewater of agro based industries that process organic food materials at high temperatures due to the presence of melanoidins as high as 2 20 g l biological treatment is not feasible for wastewater from such industries aerobic and anaerobic treatment systems can easily remove sugars volatile organics and other easily biodegradable compounds that constitute cod and bod but the colour and cod constituted by melanoidin remain unchanged after treatment biological treatment systems could remove only 6 7 of melanoidin and therefore reverse osmosis and or advanced oxidation processes aops have been used to concentrate or degrade melanoidins 2 4 microwave mw technology has been used for various applications including preparation of catalysts 5 7 sludge management 8 9 biogas production 10 heating and enhancement of different catalytic oxidation and reduction processes 11 12 mw systems are coupled with other aops and oxidants such as persulfate ps and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 for the treatment of wastewaters containing various organic pollutants 13 21 mw creates hotspots and favors free radical generation which in turn reduces the activation energy 22 the mechanism of sulphate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh reaction under mw irradiation is explained based on eqs 1 9 under acidic conditions the addition of ps to mw system accelerates the generation of so4 as shown in eq 1 subsequently the generated so4 can lead to the formation of oh eqs 3 4 similarly the presence of h2o2 under mw environment can generate oh and superoxide ion o2 eq 9 whereas under combined ps h2o2 peroxymonosulfate hso5 can be generated as shown in eq 12 23 24 the efficiency of hso5 is higher compared to ps which can result in enhancement of pollutant removal 19 23 on the other hand the presence of hso5 so4 oh and o2 could accelerate the rate of pollutant removal and better mineralization of the organics however high concentration of radicals may result in self quenching effect eq 2 10 and in turn could reduce the rate of oxidation 25 27 the generation of radical has been quantified in the past with alcohol quenching experiments 27 26 in addition the removal rate also depends on the nature of pollutant type of bonding between molecules and structure of the target compound 1 m w h e a t s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 2 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 k 4 t o 8 1 10 8 l m o l 1 s 1 3 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 o h h k 6 10 1 l m o l 1 s 1 4 s o 4 o h s o

melanoidin produces deep brown colour and therefore aops that are not dependent on photochemical activation are generally preferred as a result ozonation ultrasound and other similar hybrid systems have been adopted for melanoidin removal 28 30 it was reported that coupled multi oxidant systems are capable of producing synergistic effects 31 thus far melanoidin removal in coupled mw multi oxidant system has not been investigated in detail moreover the interactions of oxidant dosage with ph and initial melanoidin concentration are difficult to be predicted in traditional experimental design under mw multi oxidant systems central composite design ccd is an effective tool used for design of experiment optimization of system parameters analysis of variance and error analysis therefore this investigation is focused to study the a melanoidin removal between mw ps mw h2o2 and mw ps h2o2 systems b melanoidin removal rate constants under different systems c interaction between initial melanoidin concentration ph and oxidant dosage by ccd d generation of free radical species with alcohol scavenging experiments and e cost for melanoidin removal in the mw multi oxidant system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium persulfate 98 w w and hydrogen peroxide 30 w w were purchased from avra chemicals india and fischer scientific india respectively premium grade ethanol etoh and analytical grade tert butanol tba 99 purity was purchased from hayman uk and merck india respectively analytical grade dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine dnph were purchased from cisco research laboratory ltd india acetonitrile hplc grade was purchased from rankem india dextrose glycine naoh and h2so4 used for the experiments were procured from merck india distilled water dw was used for all experimental purpose 2 2 preparation of melanoidin solution a stock melanoidin solution of 210 20 g l cod 240 10 g l was prepared by mixing dextrose 1 m glycine 1 m and sodium carbonate 0 5 m subsequently the solution ph was adjusted to 7 by adding 1 n h2so4 stirred for 30 min and incubated in a hot air oven at 95 for 7 h the dark brown solution obtained was cooled and stored at 4 in the refrigerator 2 3 mw reactor set up a customized mw reactor as used previously 14 of frequency 2450 mhz and capable of operating at 1000 w with an inbuilt magnetic stirrer and temperature sensor was used for the experimental work ragatech pvt ltd india a reaction vessel of 1 l volume was used and 500 w power and 80 was maintained throughout the experiment the mw reactor was operated in batch mode with 100 ml working volume a counterflow heat exchanging condenser was housed to collect the vapour which was circulated back into the reaction vessel to maintain a constant working volume 2 4 experimental techniques 2 4 1 melanoidin removal batch experiments in order to evaluate the effect of ph dosage and irradiation time on melanoidin removal mw batch experiments were conducted with 250 mg l of melanoidin and under different combinations of ph 2 12 ps dosage 100 5000 mg l and h2o2 dosage 100 6000 mg l the experiments were conducted for 20 min and the samples were withdrawn from the reactor at various time intervals to determine melanoidin removal the batch study was divided into three phases 1 mw ps 2 mw h2o2 and 3 mw ps h2o2 the effect of ps and or h2o2 dose mw irradiation time and ph on melanoidin removal observed in these experiments are used to evaluate boundary condition for ccd experiments with mw ps h2o2 system alcohol quenching experiment was conducted for melanoidin degradation with mw ps h2o2 process in presence of scavenging agent to stop radical generation during the reaction the scavengers used were tba and etoh for quenching oh and so4 respectively the concentration of each scavenging agent added during the experiment was 0 4 m to compare effect of scavengers on melanoidin removal the oh was estimated by trapping with dmso and converting into formaldehyde by adding dnph the dnph hcho concentration was detected and calibrated in hplc dionex usa fitted with c18 silica based reverse phase column and uv vis detector the mobile phase was acetonitrile water 60 40 with a flow rate of 1 ml min the retention time of dnph and dnph hcho derivatives were found at 4 8 and 7 4 min respectively for hplc analysis 2 5 ml of sample was added to 2 5 ml of 25 mm phosphate buffer and 0 2 ml of dnph subsequently the sample was mixed well and kept for 30 min in room temperature finally the resultant mixture was diluted 20 times and injected into hplc for analysis 2 4 2 experimental design for melanoidin removal the response surface methodology was used to optimise experimental parameters of mw ps h2o2 system for better melanoidin removal at different initial concentrations a 24 full factorial design with 7 center points totally 31 runs table 1 was designed via central composite design ccd approach ps dosage 0 5000 mg l h2o2 dosage 0 6000 mg l ph 2 12 and initial melanoidin concentration 500 10000 mg l were selected as the independent variables table s1 the ccd experiments were conducted at 500 w power 80 and for 10 min the samples collected at the end of 10 min were analysed for colour reduction and melanoidin removal were used as dependent variables the interaction between independent and dependent variables was analysed via response surface and contour plots moreover quadratic and cubic regression models were developed based on the ccd experiments and used for predicting melanoidin removal 2 4 3 validation experiments based on the results of ccd experiments a selected optimised conditions a combination of ps and h2o2 dosages ph and initial melanoidin concentration were identified and the mw experiments were carried out under the identified conditions the experimental results under the optimised conditions were compared with the model predicted values 2 4 4 analytical techniques the colour developed by the presence of melanoidin was measured as pt co colour units at a wavelength of 465 nm dr 3900 hach germany and the melanoidin concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer spectramax m3 thermo fisher usa at a wavelength of 320 nm fig s1 a digital ph meter eutech pc700 singapore was used to measure the solution ph total organic carbon toc was analyzed in toc analyzer shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 melanoidin removal batch experiments as a precursor to ccd experiments the effects of ph oxidant dosage and mw irradiation time on melanoidin removal were investigated at 250 mg l melanoidin concentration fig 1 a and b show the effects of ps and h2o2 dosages on melanoidin removal at various irradiation times respectively melanoidin removal was observed to be 94 at a ps dosage of 2500 mg l after 20 min whereas 100 was observed at a ps dosage of 5000 mg l in 10 min on the other hand the colour reduction was observed to be in good correlation with melanoidin removal i e 94 at 2500 mg l after 20 min and 100 at 5000 mg l after 10 min however 14 color reduction was observed at 100 mg l of ps dosage in 20 min at ph 7 the melanoidin removal was found to be lower in mw h2o2 system compared with mw ps system fig 1 a maximum of 31 melanoidin removal was observed in 20 min at the highest h2o2 dosage investigated i e 6000 mg l fig 1 c shows melanoidin removal in mw ps h2o2 system at different combination of ps and h2o2 dosages this shows that an increase in ps dosage has influenced the reaction kinetics more than h2o2 dosage fig s5 a maximum of 98 colour reduction was achieved after 20 min with 5000 mg l of ps and 100 mg l of h2o2 the reaction rate has increased gradually with increase in both ps and h2o2 dosages however the reaction rate was higher for ps nevertheless h2o2 has enhanced ps radical formation thereby increasing colour reduction in mw ps h2o2 process the colour reduction with mw ps h2o2 ps 1000 mg l h2o2 1000 mg l was 90 3 compared to 78 in mw ps system with 1000 mg l ps the melanoidin removal rate constants under mw ps and mw h2o2 systems were estimated using pseudo first order and second order kinetic models as shown in eq 14 and eq 15 respectively 14 m t m 0 e k 1 t 15 1 m 0 1 m t k 2 t where m0 is the initial melanoidin concentration and mt is the melanoidin concentration at any time t the respective rate constants were found to be 0 084 min 1 r2 0 84 and 0 0009 lmg 1 min 1 r2 0 9 at a ps dosage of 1000 mg l fig s2 a and b similarly the reaction constants were calculated as 0 0203 min 1 r2 0 84 and 0 0001 lmg 1 min 1 r2 0 89 for pseudo first and second order kinetic model respectively at a 1000 mg l h2o2 dosage fig s3 a and b for both systems the second order kinetic model had a better fit than the pseudo first order kinetic model it can be concluded that at an oxidant dosage above 1000 mg l the radicals generated in the system might be much higher as a result the melanoidin degradation could be better expressed by the second order kinetics however the rate constants were found to increase with oxidant dosage gradually in both mw ps and mw h2o2 systems fig s4 similarly rate constant for mw ps h2o2 system was found increase with oxidant dosage fig s5 the reason for higher melanoidin removal in mw ps system than mw h2o2 system could be attributed to better hydrothermal activation of ps compared to h2o2 with mw irradiation 19 the ph of mw ps and mw h2o2 systems has constituted an important role in melanoidin removal mw ps system was effective at acidic ph whereas basic ph was better in mw h2o2 system fig 2 it was reported that at acidic conditions ps addition was found to favour more so4 generation under elevated temperatures 32 on the other hand at alkaline conditions so4 favours the subsequent generation of oh as shown in eq 2 the oh radical generated could be non specifically consumed by so4 2 and hco3 leading to a reduction in melanoidin removal however h2o2 was effective at basic ph due to the increase in oh activity by increased oh ion on the other hand mw ps h2o2 system was effective at basic ph in this case h2o2 has enhanced ps activation which could be a reason for higher efficiency at basic ph in combined mw ps h2o2 system 33 34 3 2 alcohol scavenging experiment and hydroxyl radical estimation mw ps h2o2 experiment was undertaken with quenching agents for determining radical species the reaction of etoh with both so4 and oh was reported to be faster with rate constant of 7 7 108 and 2 7 109 respectively 35 however tba is expected to react slowly with so4 rate constant 4 105 26 36 fig 3 a shows the results of quenching experiment where both etoh and tba of 0 4 m were added during experiment the results show that the colour reduction has declined to 47 from 65 on addition of tba whereas it declined to 29 on addition of etoh this infers that both oh and so4 are responsible for color reduction in mw ps h2o2 system however so4 plays dominant role in the color reduction of melanoidin solution a similar effect was reported during mw ps degradation of ao7 dye with activated carbon 36 to trap the oh and quantify its concentration 500 mm of dmso was added to dw and melanoidin solution subsequently a calibration graph was plotted for as shown in fig s6 and using the calibration graph oh generated in dw and melanoidin sample was estimated fig 3 b it was observed that the oh was found to increase with respect to time in both the systems a maximum oh concentration of 1 04 mm and 0 85 mm were observed in dw and treated melanoidin samples respectively after 15 min which indicates that oh was utilized for melanoidin removal 3 3 toc removal the toc removal was compared between mw ps mw h2o2 and mw ps h2o2 and illustrated in fig 4 mw h2o2 at 1000 mg l dosage achieved only 2 toc removal after 20 min the mw ps process resulted in 35 toc removal after 20 min at 1000 mg l it corresponds to 89 color reduction after 20 min from melanoidin solution it shows that color forming compound could be converted to simpler organic compound instead of complete mineralization h2o2 is usually ineffective compared to ps in the presence of mw for mineralisation the addition of 1000 mg l of h2o2 with mw ps 1000 mg l increased the mineralisation efficiency to 36 3 4 experimental design for melanoidin removal a 24 full factorial ccd was developed and the range of independent variables i e ps dosage a h2o2 dosage b initial melanoidin concentration c and ph d were chosen from the results of batch experiments the ccd experiments were conducted and based on the results the colour reduction and rate of melanoidin removal were calculated and reported in table 1 using the data polynomial regression models were developed and were assessed for the goodness of fit the parameters with the least significance were neglected through backward elimination the colour reduction efficiency was fitted to both cubic eq 16 and quadratic models eq 17 and fitness of the models were compared the cubic model has shown a better fit r2 0 9757 and low standard deviation compared to the quadratic model r2 0 8735 moreover the adjusted and predicted r2 values were found to be higher for the cubic model the coefficient of variance cv of cubic model was lesser than that of quadratic model which indicates a lower standard deviation to mean ratio though the f value of both the models were similar the lack of fit p value of cubic model was higher than that of the quadratic model the predicted residual error sum of squares press was lower for cubic model than that of the quadratic model the fit statistics of the responses are provided in table 2 according to the observed fit statistics cubic model could be preferred however the results of cubic and quadratic model were compared during validation the linear parameters were found to be significant in both the models with p values less than 0 05 table 2 the second order interaction parameters were insignificant in quadratic model with very high p values whereas the interactive effects of ab ac and ad were reflected a2b a2c a2d and ab2 significance in the cubic model therefore the interactive effects were included in cubic model 16 colour reduction in cubic model 58 499 0 0239 a 0 0133 b 0 00170 c 2 345 d 0 000023 ab 8 681 10 6 ac 0

be seen that the oxidant dosages and ph have a positive effect on colour reduction on the other hand the increase in melanoidin concentration has produced a negative effect on colour reduction fig 5 b d and f a similar trend was observed also in the quadratic model eq 10 colour reduction was found to increase with increasing oxidants dosage fig 5 at higher melanoidin concentrations 7000 mg l an efficiency of greater than 70 can be obtained only by either increasing the oxidant dosage outside design space or by increasing the ph above 9 5 it was observed from the batch experiments that acidic condition was effective in reducing colour in the mw ps system whereas the mw h2o2 system was effective under basic conditions however when both the oxidants were present basic ph was found suitable the regression equation in uncoded form for melanoidin removal per min in mw ps h2o2 system is shown in eq 18 18 rate 1 2 0 990 0 000701 a 0 000754b 0 00096 c 0 189 d a power transformation of 0 5 was carried out to the response to improve the accuracy of the model the power transformation was done step by step by comparing the validation results with the model predicted results and by carefully checking the fit statistics though the lack of fit p value was significant the model was able to predict the response within the design space of the independent parameters with an r2 of 0 9111 a linear model fitted the response more accurately than a quadratic model the factorial plots of the response are shown in fig 6 from the coefficients of coded equation table s2 it can be seen that rate of the reaction is strongly correlated with an increase in melanoidin concentration c followed by h2o2 b ps a and then ph d nevertheless increment in any of these parameters would result in increasing the rate of the degradation reaction table 3 3 5 validation experiments in addition to the ccd experiments a set of validation experiments were conducted under model predicted conditions as shown in table 4 the experimental results under the conditions with model predicted results are compared in table 4 and fig 7 it was found that both cubic and quadratic models were able to predict the colour reduction with 95 confidence the cubic model was able to fit the response even for extreme concentrations of melanoidin and it was better than the quadratic model fig 7 the observed values were plotted against model predicted values for both quadratic and cubic models and are shown in fig 7 a slope close to unity and intercept closer to zero would signify accurate prediction of the observed values by the model the slopes of the plots were observed to be 0 7325 and 1 0752 respectively table s3 whereas the corresponding intercept values were found to be 21 983 and 2 798 this signifies that the prediction of quadratic model would be biased towards the intercept for lower values of the design space error analysis between model predicted values and the observed values showed that both the models predicted the colour removal with less than a relative error of 0 1 within the boundaries of the design space when the melanoidin concentration was increased beyond the design space boundary the relative error increased to 0 2 the cubic model is expected to perform better than the quadratic model for colour removal 4 cost analysis and comparison with other studies the operational cost in usd per kg of melanoidin removed in ccd experiments was calculated and shown in table 1 the cost was calculated by adding the cost of oxidant and power requirement as shown in eqs 19 20 additional cost for ph adjustment was not considered in the calculation since the ph of wastewater systems differ and by considering the model predicted rate values the cost calculated would have been adjusted to the ph considered during rate calculation the calculated costs were ranging from 5 11 kg melanoidin removal to around 33 92 kg melanoidin for the optimised conditions during validation table 4 the cost becomes lower at higher concentrations of melanoidin where the rate of removal is also high in addition when the experiments were carried out the residual activity of h2o2 was inexistent while the colour of ps treated sample continued to decolourise the melanoidin this indicates that the operating conditions considered for the study are not fully effective for the removal of melanoidin by ps mw systems can reach as high as 500 c but the experiment was limited to 80 c to reduce excess evaporation of water when real time melanoidin containing wastewater is treated with mw the mw multi oxidant reactor system could be operated at higher temperatures and the evaporated water can be directly recovered as pure water instead of recycling into the system as a result the overall cost of operation would come down 19 c o s t k g o f m e l a n o i d i n r e m o v e d f i r s t o r d e r k i n e t i c s c o s t m w cost ps cost h 2 o 2 m 0 m 0 e kt 20 cost kg of melanoidin removed second

treatment systems like uv h2o2 ozonation and catalytic oxidation with ozone were able to remove melanoidin efficiently 45 100 under a melanoidin concentration range of 300 20000 mg l the dose and catalyst requirements were found to be more at higher melanoidin concentration and at larger sample volumes in addition the reaction time was observed to be very high in most of the treatment systems listed in table 5 however in this study colour reduction at melanoidin concentration of 500 mg l and 10 000 mg l were found to be 95 and 49 respectively within a mw irradiation time of 10 min 5 conclusion the coupled mw ps h2o2 system was found to be efficient for the removal of melanoidin due to enhancement in the generation of so4 and oh the effect of ph was significant in mw oxidant s system under acidic conditions so4 was predominant but oh was predominant under basic conditions however mw ps was more efficient than mw h2o2 at neutral ph and 100 removal was observed at a ps dosage of 5000 mg l for initial melanoidin concentration of 250 mg l different radical species such as oh and so4 were responsible for the removal of melanoidin from the aqueous system as evident from alcohol scavenging experiments the ccd experiments under mw ps h2o2 system showed good interaction between ph h2o2 dosage ps dosage and melanoidin concentration and showed better performance under basic ph colour reduction was found to increase with ps and h2o2 dosage on the other hand the cost estimation kg revealed a reduced cost with increase in melanoidin concentration overall mw ps h2o2 system could be applied for partial treatment pretreatment for melanoidin removal declaration of competing interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article

values alcohol scavenging experiment shows that both sulfate and hydroxyl radical are responsible for melanoidin removal the generation of hydroxyl radicals was estimated a simple first order kinetic equation based model was developed to calculate the cost per kg of melanoidin removal in mw ps h2o2 system overall mw ps h2o2 system seems to be a better alternative for high rate melanoidin removal

brewery has become a serious challenge at present due to the high organic content and the presence of recalcitrant and refractory compounds like melanoidin phenolics etc melanoidins are dark brown coloured high molecular weight polymers formed as the end products of maillard reaction they have antioxidant anti hypertensive and antimicrobial activities 1 maillard reaction occurs when a carbohydrate reacts with an amino acid or an amine at a temperature higher than 40 c therefore these melanoidins are common constituents in the wastewater of agro based industries that process organic food materials at high temperatures due to the presence of melanoidins as high as 2 20 g l biological treatment is not feasible for wastewater from such industries aerobic and anaerobic treatment systems can easily remove sugars volatile organics and other easily biodegradable compounds that constitute cod and bod but the colour and cod constituted by melanoidin remain unchanged after treatment biological treatment systems could remove only 6 7 of melanoidin and therefore reverse osmosis and or advanced oxidation processes aops have been used to concentrate or degrade melanoidins 2 4 microwave mw technology has been used for various applications including preparation of catalysts 5 7 sludge management 8 9 biogas production 10 heating and enhancement of different catalytic oxidation and reduction processes 11 12 mw systems are coupled with other aops and oxidants such as persulfate ps and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 for the treatment of wastewaters containing various organic pollutants 13 21 mw creates hotspots and favors free radical generation which in turn reduces the activation energy 22 the mechanism of sulphate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh reaction under mw irradiation is explained based on eqs 1 9 under acidic conditions the addition of ps to mw system accelerates the generation of so4 as shown in eq 1 subsequently the generated so4 can lead to the formation of oh eqs 3 4 similarly the presence of h2o2 under mw environment can generate oh and superoxide ion o2 eq 9 whereas under combined ps h2o2 peroxymonosulfate hso5 can be generated as shown in eq 12 23 24 the efficiency of hso5 is higher compared to ps which can result in enhancement of pollutant removal 19 23 on the other hand the presence of hso5 so4 oh and o2 could accelerate the rate of pollutant removal and better mineralization of the organics however high concentration of radicals may result in self quenching effect eq 2 10 and in turn could reduce the rate of oxidation 25 27 the generation of radical has been quantified in the past with alcohol quenching experiments 27 26 in addition the removal rate also depends on the nature of pollutant type of bonding between molecules and structure of the target compound 1 m w h e a t s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 2 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 k 4 t o 8 1 10 8 l m o l 1 s 1 3 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 o h h k 6 10 1 l m o l 1 s 1 4 s o 4 o h s o

melanoidin produces deep brown colour and therefore aops that are not dependent on photochemical activation are generally preferred as a result ozonation ultrasound and other similar hybrid systems have been adopted for melanoidin removal 28 30 it was reported that coupled multi oxidant systems are capable of producing synergistic effects 31 thus far melanoidin removal in coupled mw multi oxidant system has not been investigated in detail moreover the interactions of oxidant dosage with ph and initial melanoidin concentration are difficult to be predicted in traditional experimental design under mw multi oxidant systems central composite design ccd is an effective tool used for design of experiment optimization of system parameters analysis of variance and error analysis therefore this investigation is focused to study the a melanoidin removal between mw ps mw h2o2 and mw ps h2o2 systems b melanoidin removal rate constants under different systems c interaction between initial melanoidin concentration ph and oxidant dosage by ccd d generation of free radical species with alcohol scavenging experiments and e cost for melanoidin removal in the mw multi oxidant system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium persulfate 98 w w and hydrogen peroxide 30 w w were purchased from avra chemicals india and fischer scientific india respectively premium grade ethanol etoh and analytical grade tert butanol tba 99 purity was purchased from hayman uk and merck india respectively analytical grade dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine dnph were purchased from cisco research laboratory ltd india acetonitrile hplc grade was purchased from rankem india dextrose glycine naoh and h2so4 used for the experiments were procured from merck india distilled water dw was used for all experimental purpose 2 2 preparation of melanoidin solution a stock melanoidin solution of 210 20 g l cod 240 10 g l was prepared by mixing dextrose 1 m glycine 1 m and sodium carbonate 0 5 m subsequently the solution ph was adjusted to 7 by adding 1 n h2so4 stirred for 30 min and incubated in a hot air oven at 95 for 7 h the dark brown solution obtained was cooled and stored at 4 in the refrigerator 2 3 mw reactor set up a customized mw reactor as used previously 14 of frequency 2450 mhz and capable of operating at 1000 w with an inbuilt magnetic stirrer and temperature sensor was used for the experimental work ragatech pvt ltd india a reaction vessel of 1 l volume was used and 500 w power and 80 was maintained throughout the experiment the mw reactor was operated in batch mode with 100 ml working volume a counterflow heat exchanging condenser was housed to collect the vapour which was circulated back into the reaction vessel to maintain a constant working volume 2 4 experimental techniques 2 4 1 melanoidin removal batch experiments in order to evaluate the effect of ph dosage and irradiation time on melanoidin removal mw batch experiments were conducted with 250 mg l of melanoidin and under different combinations of ph 2 12 ps dosage 100 5000 mg l and h2o2 dosage 100 6000 mg l the experiments were conducted for 20 min and the samples were withdrawn from the reactor at various time intervals to determine melanoidin removal the batch study was divided into three phases 1 mw ps 2 mw h2o2 and 3 mw ps h2o2 the effect of ps and or h2o2 dose mw irradiation time and ph on melanoidin removal observed in these experiments are used to evaluate boundary condition for ccd experiments with mw ps h2o2 system alcohol quenching experiment was conducted for melanoidin degradation with mw ps h2o2 process in presence of scavenging agent to stop radical generation during the reaction the scavengers used were tba and etoh for quenching oh and so4 respectively the concentration of each scavenging agent added during the experiment was 0 4 m to compare effect of scavengers on melanoidin removal the oh was estimated by trapping with dmso and converting into formaldehyde by adding dnph the dnph hcho concentration was detected and calibrated in hplc dionex usa fitted with c18 silica based reverse phase column and uv vis detector the mobile phase was acetonitrile water 60 40 with a flow rate of 1 ml min the retention time of dnph and dnph hcho derivatives were found at 4 8 and 7 4 min respectively for hplc analysis 2 5 ml of sample was added to 2 5 ml of 25 mm phosphate buffer and 0 2 ml of dnph subsequently the sample was mixed well and kept for 30 min in room temperature finally the resultant mixture was diluted 20 times and injected into hplc for analysis 2 4 2 experimental design for melanoidin removal the response surface methodology was used to optimise experimental parameters of mw ps h2o2 system for better melanoidin removal at different initial concentrations a 24 full factorial design with 7 center points totally 31 runs table 1 was designed via central composite design ccd approach ps dosage 0 5000 mg l h2o2 dosage 0 6000 mg l ph 2 12 and initial melanoidin concentration 500 10000 mg l were selected as the independent variables table s1 the ccd experiments were conducted at 500 w power 80 and for 10 min the samples collected at the end of 10 min were analysed for colour reduction and melanoidin removal were used as dependent variables the interaction between independent and dependent variables was analysed via response surface and contour plots moreover quadratic and cubic regression models were developed based on the ccd experiments and used for predicting melanoidin removal 2 4 3 validation experiments based on the results of ccd experiments a selected optimised conditions a combination of ps and h2o2 dosages ph and initial melanoidin concentration were identified and the mw experiments were carried out under the identified conditions the experimental results under the optimised conditions were compared with the model predicted values 2 4 4 analytical techniques the colour developed by the presence of melanoidin was measured as pt co colour units at a wavelength of 465 nm dr 3900 hach germany and the melanoidin concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer spectramax m3 thermo fisher usa at a wavelength of 320 nm fig s1 a digital ph meter eutech pc700 singapore was used to measure the solution ph total organic carbon toc was analyzed in toc analyzer shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 melanoidin removal batch experiments as a precursor to ccd experiments the effects of ph oxidant dosage and mw irradiation time on melanoidin removal were investigated at 250 mg l melanoidin concentration fig 1 a and b show the effects of ps and h2o2 dosages on melanoidin removal at various irradiation times respectively melanoidin removal was observed to be 94 at a ps dosage of 2500 mg l after 20 min whereas 100 was observed at a ps dosage of 5000 mg l in 10 min on the other hand the colour reduction was observed to be in good correlation with melanoidin removal i e 94 at 2500 mg l after 20 min and 100 at 5000 mg l after 10 min however 14 color reduction was observed at 100 mg l of ps dosage in 20 min at ph 7 the melanoidin removal was found to be lower in mw h2o2 system compared with mw ps system fig 1 a maximum of 31 melanoidin removal was observed in 20 min at the highest h2o2 dosage investigated i e 6000 mg l fig 1 c shows melanoidin removal in mw ps h2o2 system at different combination of ps and h2o2 dosages this shows that an increase in ps dosage has influenced the reaction kinetics more than h2o2 dosage fig s5 a maximum of 98 colour reduction was achieved after 20 min with 5000 mg l of ps and 100 mg l of h2o2 the reaction rate has increased gradually with increase in both ps and h2o2 dosages however the reaction rate was higher for ps nevertheless h2o2 has enhanced ps radical formation thereby increasing colour reduction in mw ps h2o2 process the colour reduction with mw ps h2o2 ps 1000 mg l h2o2 1000 mg l was 90 3 compared to 78 in mw ps system with 1000 mg l ps the melanoidin removal rate constants under mw ps and mw h2o2 systems were estimated using pseudo first order and second order kinetic models as shown in eq 14 and eq 15 respectively 14 m t m 0 e k 1 t 15 1 m 0 1 m t k 2 t where m0 is the initial melanoidin concentration and mt is the melanoidin concentration at any time t the respective rate constants were found to be 0 084 min 1 r2 0 84 and 0 0009 lmg 1 min 1 r2 0 9 at a ps dosage of 1000 mg l fig s2 a and b similarly the reaction constants were calculated as 0 0203 min 1 r2 0 84 and 0 0001 lmg 1 min 1 r2 0 89 for pseudo first and second order kinetic model respectively at a 1000 mg l h2o2 dosage fig s3 a and b for both systems the second order kinetic model had a better fit than the pseudo first order kinetic model it can be concluded that at an oxidant dosage above 1000 mg l the radicals generated in the system might be much higher as a result the melanoidin degradation could be better expressed by the second order kinetics however the rate constants were found to increase with oxidant dosage gradually in both mw ps and mw h2o2 systems fig s4 similarly rate constant for mw ps h2o2 system was found increase with oxidant dosage fig s5 the reason for higher melanoidin removal in mw ps system than mw h2o2 system could be attributed to better hydrothermal activation of ps compared to h2o2 with mw irradiation 19 the ph of mw ps and mw h2o2 systems has constituted an important role in melanoidin removal mw ps system was effective at acidic ph whereas basic ph was better in mw h2o2 system fig 2 it was reported that at acidic conditions ps addition was found to favour more so4 generation under elevated temperatures 32 on the other hand at alkaline conditions so4 favours the subsequent generation of oh as shown in eq 2 the oh radical generated could be non specifically consumed by so4 2 and hco3 leading to a reduction in melanoidin removal however h2o2 was effective at basic ph due to the increase in oh activity by increased oh ion on the other hand mw ps h2o2 system was effective at basic ph in this case h2o2 has enhanced ps activation which could be a reason for higher efficiency at basic ph in combined mw ps h2o2 system 33 34 3 2 alcohol scavenging experiment and hydroxyl radical estimation mw ps h2o2 experiment was undertaken with quenching agents for determining radical species the reaction of etoh with both so4 and oh was reported to be faster with rate constant of 7 7 108 and 2 7 109 respectively 35 however tba is expected to react slowly with so4 rate constant 4 105 26 36 fig 3 a shows the results of quenching experiment where both etoh and tba of 0 4 m were added during experiment the results show that the colour reduction has declined to 47 from 65 on addition of tba whereas it declined to 29 on addition of etoh this infers that both oh and so4 are responsible for color reduction in mw ps h2o2 system however so4 plays dominant role in the color reduction of melanoidin solution a similar effect was reported during mw ps degradation of ao7 dye with activated carbon 36 to trap the oh and quantify its concentration 500 mm of dmso was added to dw and melanoidin solution subsequently a calibration graph was plotted for as shown in fig s6 and using the calibration graph oh generated in dw and melanoidin sample was estimated fig 3 b it was observed that the oh was found to increase with respect to time in both the systems a maximum oh concentration of 1 04 mm and 0 85 mm were observed in dw and treated melanoidin samples respectively after 15 min which indicates that oh was utilized for melanoidin removal 3 3 toc removal the toc removal was compared between mw ps mw h2o2 and mw ps h2o2 and illustrated in fig 4 mw h2o2 at 1000 mg l dosage achieved only 2 toc removal after 20 min the mw ps process resulted in 35 toc removal after 20 min at 1000 mg l it corresponds to 89 color reduction after 20 min from melanoidin solution it shows that color forming compound could be converted to simpler organic compound instead of complete mineralization h2o2 is usually ineffective compared to ps in the presence of mw for mineralisation the addition of 1000 mg l of h2o2 with mw ps 1000 mg l increased the mineralisation efficiency to 36 3 4 experimental design for melanoidin removal a 24 full factorial ccd was developed and the range of independent variables i e ps dosage a h2o2 dosage b initial melanoidin concentration c and ph d were chosen from the results of batch experiments the ccd experiments were conducted and based on the results the colour reduction and rate of melanoidin removal were calculated and reported in table 1 using the data polynomial regression models were developed and were assessed for the goodness of fit the parameters with the least significance were neglected through backward elimination the colour reduction efficiency was fitted to both cubic eq 16 and quadratic models eq 17 and fitness of the models were compared the cubic model has shown a better fit r2 0 9757 and low standard deviation compared to the quadratic model r2 0 8735 moreover the adjusted and predicted r2 values were found to be higher for the cubic model the coefficient of variance cv of cubic model was lesser than that of quadratic model which indicates a lower standard deviation to mean ratio though the f value of both the models were similar the lack of fit p value of cubic model was higher than that of the quadratic model the predicted residual error sum of squares press was lower for cubic model than that of the quadratic model the fit statistics of the responses are provided in table 2 according to the observed fit statistics cubic model could be preferred however the results of cubic and quadratic model were compared during validation the linear parameters were found to be significant in both the models with p values less than 0 05 table 2 the second order interaction parameters were insignificant in quadratic model with very high p values whereas the interactive effects of ab ac and ad were reflected a2b a2c a2d and ab2 significance in the cubic model therefore the interactive effects were included in cubic model 16 colour reduction in cubic model 58 499 0 0239 a 0 0133 b 0 00170 c 2 345 d 0 000023 ab 8 681 10 6 ac 0

be seen that the oxidant dosages and ph have a positive effect on colour reduction on the other hand the increase in melanoidin concentration has produced a negative effect on colour reduction fig 5 b d and f a similar trend was observed also in the quadratic model eq 10 colour reduction was found to increase with increasing oxidants dosage fig 5 at higher melanoidin concentrations 7000 mg l an efficiency of greater than 70 can be obtained only by either increasing the oxidant dosage outside design space or by increasing the ph above 9 5 it was observed from the batch experiments that acidic condition was effective in reducing colour in the mw ps system whereas the mw h2o2 system was effective under basic conditions however when both the oxidants were present basic ph was found suitable the regression equation in uncoded form for melanoidin removal per min in mw ps h2o2 system is shown in eq 18 18 rate 1 2 0 990 0 000701 a 0 000754b 0 00096 c 0 189 d a power transformation of 0 5 was carried out to the response to improve the accuracy of the model the power transformation was done step by step by comparing the validation results with the model predicted results and by carefully checking the fit statistics though the lack of fit p value was significant the model was able to predict the response within the design space of the independent parameters with an r2 of 0 9111 a linear model fitted the response more accurately than a quadratic model the factorial plots of the response are shown in fig 6 from the coefficients of coded equation table s2 it can be seen that rate of the reaction is strongly correlated with an increase in melanoidin concentration c followed by h2o2 b ps a and then ph d nevertheless increment in any of these parameters would result in increasing the rate of the degradation reaction table 3 3 5 validation experiments in addition to the ccd experiments a set of validation experiments were conducted under model predicted conditions as shown in table 4 the experimental results under the conditions with model predicted results are compared in table 4 and fig 7 it was found that both cubic and quadratic models were able to predict the colour reduction with 95 confidence the cubic model was able to fit the response even for extreme concentrations of melanoidin and it was better than the quadratic model fig 7 the observed values were plotted against model predicted values for both quadratic and cubic models and are shown in fig 7 a slope close to unity and intercept closer to zero would signify accurate prediction of the observed values by the model the slopes of the plots were observed to be 0 7325 and 1 0752 respectively table s3 whereas the corresponding intercept values were found to be 21 983 and 2 798 this signifies that the prediction of quadratic model would be biased towards the intercept for lower values of the design space error analysis between model predicted values and the observed values showed that both the models predicted the colour removal with less than a relative error of 0 1 within the boundaries of the design space when the melanoidin concentration was increased beyond the design space boundary the relative error increased to 0 2 the cubic model is expected to perform better than the quadratic model for colour removal 4 cost analysis and comparison with other studies the operational cost in usd per kg of melanoidin removed in ccd experiments was calculated and shown in table 1 the cost was calculated by adding the cost of oxidant and power requirement as shown in eqs 19 20 additional cost for ph adjustment was not considered in the calculation since the ph of wastewater systems differ and by considering the model predicted rate values the cost calculated would have been adjusted to the ph considered during rate calculation the calculated costs were ranging from 5 11 kg melanoidin removal to around 33 92 kg melanoidin for the optimised conditions during validation table 4 the cost becomes lower at higher concentrations of melanoidin where the rate of removal is also high in addition when the experiments were carried out the residual activity of h2o2 was inexistent while the colour of ps treated sample continued to decolourise the melanoidin this indicates that the operating conditions considered for the study are not fully effective for the removal of melanoidin by ps mw systems can reach as high as 500 c but the experiment was limited to 80 c to reduce excess evaporation of water when real time melanoidin containing wastewater is treated with mw the mw multi oxidant reactor system could be operated at higher temperatures and the evaporated water can be directly recovered as pure water instead of recycling into the system as a result the overall cost of operation would come down 19 c o s t k g o f m e l a n o i d i n r e m o v e d f i r s t o r d e r k i n e t i c s c o s t m w cost ps cost h 2 o 2 m 0 m 0 e kt 20 cost kg of melanoidin removed second

treatment systems like uv h2o2 ozonation and catalytic oxidation with ozone were able to remove melanoidin efficiently 45 100 under a melanoidin concentration range of 300 20000 mg l the dose and catalyst requirements were found to be more at higher melanoidin concentration and at larger sample volumes in addition the reaction time was observed to be very high in most of the treatment systems listed in table 5 however in this study colour reduction at melanoidin concentration of 500 mg l and 10 000 mg l were found to be 95 and 49 respectively within a mw irradiation time of 10 min 5 conclusion the coupled mw ps h2o2 system was found to be efficient for the removal of melanoidin due to enhancement in the generation of so4 and oh the effect of ph was significant in mw oxidant s system under acidic conditions so4 was predominant but oh was predominant under basic conditions however mw ps was more efficient than mw h2o2 at neutral ph and 100 removal was observed at a ps dosage of 5000 mg l for initial melanoidin concentration of 250 mg l different radical species such as oh and so4 were responsible for the removal of melanoidin from the aqueous system as evident from alcohol scavenging experiments the ccd experiments under mw ps h2o2 system showed good interaction between ph h2o2 dosage ps dosage and melanoidin concentration and showed better performance under basic ph colour reduction was found to increase with ps and h2o2 dosage on the other hand the cost estimation kg revealed a reduced cost with increase in melanoidin concentration overall mw ps h2o2

14138,in this work we investigated the synergy of oxidation adsorption and surface interaction in fluidized bed fenton process with granular activated carbon gac as carriers experiments were conducted to evaluate the synergy of oxidation and adsorption in the removal of a model pollutant reactive black 5 the effects of carrier loading and solution ph on the process performance were investigated to determine the nature of interaction between the carriers fenton s reagent and pollutant the surface of the gac was analyzed using ftir sem edx xps and bet analyses the highest cod and color removal obtained were 83 and 99 respectively at 20 g carrier loading and ph 3 more than 28 of the initial cod was removed through adsorption by the carrier the process performance increased with increase in carrier loading but decreased when the loading exceeded a certain threshold although the highest cod removal was obtained at ph 3 effective removal was still achieved at ph 7 the surface analysis of the carrier reveals that both fenton s reagent and organic pollutant are adsorbed on the surface of the carrier indicating that the removal of the pollutant is through both adsorption and oxidation the performance of gac in this study is superior to the commonly employed carrier sio2 this study shows that gac can be used as an effective carrier in fluidized bed for fenton process keywords granular activated carbon fenton oxidation adsorption fluidized bed reactor adsorption oxidation synergy 1 introduction the widespread use of chemicals in industrial processes has led to an increasingly high level of recalcitrant organic pollutants in the environment although conventional physicochemical and biological wastewater treatment technologies are widely used to treat industrial effluents some of the organic pollutants are recalcitrant and therefore difficult to remove using these technologies 1 2 recalcitrant pollutants such as pesticides dyes pharmaceuticals and personal care products have been detected in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants 3 4 thus more effective treatment process must be deployed to remove these recalcitrant pollutants advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted a significant interest as effective treatment technologies for wastewater containing recalcitrant pollutants these processes are characterized by the generation of hydroxyl radical ho that can effective oxidize organic pollutants typical aops include fenton oxidation photocatalysis electrochemical oxidation and sonolysis fenton oxidation is among the most effective aops and involves a homogeneous reaction between fe2 and h2o2 to generate ho as shown in eq 1 to eq 3 fenton oxidation is widely used to remove organic pollutants due to its simplicity and effectiveness 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh h o 2 h o o r g a n i c s co 2 h 2 o products 3 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 ho 2 h despite the efficacy of fenton oxidation as a wastewater treatment technology it possesses some drawbacks the reactions in eq 1 to eq 3 and the subsequent chain reactions involved in fenton oxidation require an acidic condition ph 2 8 3 to maintain the catalytic role of fe2 5 consequently large chemical inputs will be required to acidify the wastewater and to neutralize the treated effluent 6 7 another limitation of fenton oxidation is the generation of excessive ferrous sludge which will require further treatment and disposal 8 10 many approaches have been put forward as possible solutions to the limitations of homogeneous fenton oxidation among these the use of fluidized bed reactor in fenton oxidation termed fluidized bed fenton process has received a significant interest 11 12 in the process solid carriers are fluidized with the fenton s reagent providing surfaces for the nucleation and crystallization of iron oxide 13 14 additionally due to the excellent mixing by the fluidization process performance can be enhanced through higher mass transfer and decreased chemical consumption 15 previous studies have shown that fluidized bed fenton process produces less sludge and achieved 15 20 higher removal efficiency compared to conventional fenton oxidation 16 17 due to the role of fluidized carriers in sludge reduction and enhancing the overall process performance selection of carriers is an important consideration currently the most commonly used fluidized carriers are sio2 and al2o3 while some studies have presented sio2 as the best carrier 18 others have pointed otherwise 19 thus more studies are needed on the fluidized carriers and their effects on the process performance granular activated carbon gac has been widely used in fluidized bed bioreactors 20 21 and fluidized bed adsorption processes 22 23 previous studies have shown gac to be an excellent fluidized carrier for different applications deploying gac as a carrier in fenton oxidation means that both adsorption and oxidation could occur during the treatment process although studies have shown the possibility of synergies between adsorption and advanced oxidation processes such as fenton oxidation 24 26 the synergy of the combined fluidized gac fenton oxidation has not been reported we noted the existence of some few studies on the combined homogeneous fenton oxidation activated carbon adsorption dwivedi et al 27 reported the optimization of fenton pretreatment integrated with gac for carbamazepine removal focusing on central composite design optimization and toxicity analysis lyu et al 28 integrated adsorption and fenton oxidation in a fluidized bed reactor for the treatment of multi dye wastewater the focus of the study was the hydraulic classification of fluidization comparison of activated carbon and ceramsite as carriers and iron crystallization thankappan et al 29 studied the removal of leather tanning agent syntan from aqueous solution using fenton oxidation followed by gac adsorption the treatment was a two stage sequential process and thus no synergistic effect was presented some studies have also reported the use of materials that could act as both adsorbents and fenton like heterogeneous catalysts 29 33 despite these studies however a detailed insight into the synergistic mechanism of fluidized gac adsorption and fenton oxidation is lacking the objective of this work is therefore to evaluate the feasibility of using gac as a low cost carrier for fluidized bed fenton process focusing on the adsorption oxidation synergy and the interactions on the surface of the gac the large surface area of the activated carbon can provide the necessary surfaces for the crystallization of iron oxides as well as possible adsorption of pollutants understanding the nature of interaction between the fluidized carrier fenton s reagent and organic pollutant is key aspect of the fluidized bed fenton process thus surface analysis of the carrier was conducted before and after the fluidized bed fenton process to get insights into the interactions a recalcitrant azo dye reactive black 5 rb5 was used as the model pollutant to evaluate the performance of the process rb5 is selected because it is widely used in textile industry and is among the most recalcitrant azo dyes 34 2 methodology 2 1 chemicals the chemicals used h2o2 30 feso4 7h2o hcl naoh and glass beads were procured from sigma aldrich palm kernel shell gac was obtained from pacific activated carbon malaysia the particle size of the activated carbon ranges between 0 020 μm to 2000 μm with the highest proportion around 1000 μm the activated carbon was washed with distilled water and dried at 110 c for 24 h rb5 dye 50 dye content was procured from sigma aldrich and its properties are listed in table 1 it is a reactive diazo dye with sulfonic and chromophore moieties in its molecule the recalcitrance of rb5 can be attributed to the presence of the two azo bond in its molecule 2 2 experimental set up details of the fluidized bed reactor used in this study was described in our previous study 35 glass beads were loaded at the bottom of the reactor to serve as distributors a predetermined amount of gac 10 30 g was then loaded on top of the glass beads for each run the fluidization was equalized prior to introducing the dye solution into the reactor and the superficial velocity was maintained by recirculation to provide 50 fluidization for the synthetic wastewater 500 mg of rb5 was dissolved in 1 l of distilled water the prepared rb5 solution 500 mg l was introduced into the reactor followed by ph adjustment using naoh or hcl since high ionic strength could affect the solute solvent interaction 36 low molarity acid base 1 m was used for the ph adjustment the fenton oxidation was initiated by the addition of feso4 7h2o 1 mm followed by the addition of h2o2 40 mm the experiments were conducted under the concentration ratio of dye fe2 h2o2 1 0 1 2 5 samples were collected at predetermined time for analysis the fenton reaction was stopped by raising the solution ph above 10 37 while any unreacted h2o2 oh was quenched using mno2 as described elsewhere 38 experiments were replicated to ensure reproducibility the effect of particle loading was investigated by varying the amount of gac in the rector 10 g 20 g 30 g the effect of ph was compared by conducting the process in the acidic and circumneutral ph controlled experiments were conducted to quantify the contribution of adsorption of pollutant onto the surface of gac for the adsorption 500 mg l of rb5 solution was introduced into the reactor with a predetermined gac loading 10 g 20 g 30 g and the process was ran without the addition of fenton s reagent similar experiments were conducted with the commonly used carrier sio2 to compare its performance with the gac 2 3 analytical methods the particle size distribution of the gac was measured using a malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern instrument ltd with a normal sensitivity and using water as the dispersant the zeta potential was measured using malvern zetasizer version 6 20 malvern instruments ltd with water as dispersant the zeta potential was recorded as an average of 100 runs at 2 00 mm measurement position using attenuation factor of 6 the surface area and porosity of the activated carbon was determined through n2 adsorption desorption isotherm at 77 k on a micrometrics asap 2020 tristar ii 3020 kr surface area analyzer using brunauer emmett teller and barrett joyner halenda bjh methods the morphology of the carriers before and after the fluidized bed fenton process was investigated by scanning electron microscope sem using fei quanta 200 thermofisher scientific the elemental composition of the carriers was examined by the energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy using gemini edax zeiss carl zeiss germany the surface functional groups of the carriers before and after fluidized bed fenton treatment was examined through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir using a perkin elmer spectrometer ftir spectrum 400 parking elmer with light in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was conducted using ulvac phi quantera ii to study the elemental composition and binding energy of the carriers before and after the treatment wastewater analysis was done according to the standard methods for the examinations of water and wastewater for chemical oxygen demand cod measurement 3 ml treated samples were added to a prepared cod test cells supplied by merck and co the cells were then heated at 148 c for 2 h using a thermo reactor spectroquant tr 420 the cod of the solution was then determined spectrophotometer spectroquant pharo 300 merck germany the color of the dye solution was measured at 464 nm using the same spectrophotometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of carrier and surface interaction 3 1 1 surface area and pore size of the carrier the bet surface area and pore size of the gac were determined by n2 adsorption desorption method and the results are presented in table 2 the average pore size is 1 88 nm indicating that it contains microporous particles the gac has a large specific surface area of 949 56 m2 g the measurement of the single adsorption desorption total pore volume shows that the micropore volume constitutes more than 67 of the total pore volumes indicating that the gac is largely microporous similar observations on granular activated carbon have been reported 39 40 fig 1 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm the curve exhibited the characteristics of a type i isotherm which is typically obtained with microporous solids the isotherm displayed an h4 hysteresis containing a slit like pores which shows that the gac contains limited amounts of mesopores 40 41 3 1 2 zeta potential zeta potential is a measure of the magnitude of charge repulsion attraction at the interface of a solid particle and its liquid medium it reflects the effective charge at the surface of the particles and is therefore an important parameter to understand the mechanism of particle interactions the zeta potential can affect the interactions between gac organic pollutants and fenton s reagent the zeta potential of the gac was measured at different ph using a malvern zetasizer and the point of zero charge was determined by plotting the values of zeta potential against ph fig 2 the point of zero charge phpzc of the gac was found to be ph 11 this implies that the surface of the gac is positively charged at ph values less than 11 and negatively charged at ph values above 11 this phpzc value indicates the potential electrostatic attraction between the positively charged gac surface and the anionic rb5 molecules under the solution ph used in this study 3 1 3 fourier transformation infrared analysis ftir spectroscopy was used to study the surface functional groups of the gac before and after the treatment process fig 3 shows the ftir analysis of the gac before and after fluidized fenton process the results of the ftir analysis of the fresh gac is similar to that reported by misnon et al 42 in their study of electrochemical properties of oil palm kernel shell based carbon the wide weak band around 3700 cm 1 is due to the oh stretching mode resulting from the absorption of water molecules and alcohols 43 44 the two sharp peaks at 2924 cm 1 and 2853 cm 1 can be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric ch stretching 45 the relatively weak peak at 1748 cm 1 is due to the stretching of co and the peak at 1559 cm 1 is assigned to the stretching mode from carbonyl group cc 46 the peak at 1177 cm 1 is due to the stretching mode of coc 42 the region of 700 600 cm 1 can be assigned to the vibration of ch bending 43 after the fluidized bed fenton process the intensities of the bands decreased a new broad and strong band appeared at 3433 cm 1 which can be assigned to o h stretching resulting from adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups 42 additional peaks are also observed at 2323 cm 1 2015 cm 1 1108 cm 1 and 1020 cm 1 the appearances of new peaks and the disappearance of the initial ones indicate the possible interactions between the gac rb5 and the fenton s reagent 3 1 4 scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray the morphology and elemental composition of the gac can be used to gain insight into the possible interaction between fluidized carriers and fenton s reagent thus the morphology and elemental composition of the gac were studied using sem and edx analysis fig 4 a and b shows the morphology of the gac prior to the fluidized bed fenton process displaying a granular structure with an irregular rough surface that is typical of granular activated carbon 47 49 on the other hand fig 4 c and d displays the gac after the fluidized bed fenton process the change in the morphology of the carrier can be seen as the surface displays rough crystalline structure in contrast to the amorphous structure of fig 4 a and b energy dispersive x ray analysis was further conducted to investigate the elemental composition of the gac before and after the fluidized bed fenton process table 3 shows the elemental composition and the percentage weight of the elemental composition of the gac before and after the fluidized bed fenton process before the treatment c 86 59 and o 10 18 were the major constituents of the gac though traces of other elements such as f mg al and si were observed in the elemental mapping these traces were likely due to impurities from the preparation of the activated carbon however fe was not detected in the elemental mapping after the fluidized bed fenton process 15 fe was detected in the elemental composition furthermore the percentage weight of c decreased from 86 59 to 53 59 while that of o increased from 10 18 to 29 66 the appearance of fe and the increase of o can be attributed to the formation of iron oxide on the surface of the gac which is one the processes that occur in fluidized bed fenton process 14 3 1 5 x ray photo electron spectroscopy analysis the carrier was also analyzed by x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps to evaluate the chemical states of various elements and the functional groups the survey scan spectra of the gac showed mainly the presence of carbon and oxygen with some trace amounts of iron and sulfur after the fluidized bed fenton process the weight content of the elements before the process gac and after the process fbf gac are summarized in table 4 which confirmed the reduction of carbon content from 86 62 gac to 66 81 fbf gac and an increase of oxygen content from 8 82 gac to 29 93 fbf gac the full xps spectra of the gac and fbf gac are shown in fig 5 to further evaluate the chemical state of oxygen and carbon functional groups the deconvoluted high resolution xps c 1s region spectra of gac and fbf gac are shown in fig 6 a the comparison of xps spectrum for gac and fbf gac showed that the deconvoluted c 1s peaks appeared at 284 2 ev and 284 ev respectively which correspond to cc however in the case of fbf gac the peak intensity was weakened indicating the reduction of carbon content because of hydrolysis the o1s spectra shown in fig 6 b marked maximum peaks at 531 ev and 531 2 ev for fbf ac and gac respectively this signal is assigned to the presence of oc o functional groups the intensity of this signal is higher in fbf ac in addition the appearance of new peaks i e fe 2p1 and fe 2p3 at around 710 8 and 709 6 ev indicates respectively the presence of fe2o3 and feo on the surface of the carrier after the fluidized bed fenton process besides the appearance of s p2 peak at around 164 ev indicates the presence of r sh thiol on the carrier which may be due to the degradation of rb5 dye over the surface of the gac 3 2 synergistic performance of the combined process 3 2 1 effect of ph fenton oxidation is strongly affected by the ph of the solution which is required to be in a narrow acidic range for effective performance of the process the optimum ph to ensure the catalytic ability of fe2 fe3 is usually between 2 8 to 3 5 this represents one of the major limitations of homogeneous fenton oxidation higher ph above this range leads to precipitation of oxyhydroxide while lower ph slows down the reactivity of fe2 50 therefore the effect of ph on the combined fenton oxidation gac adsorption was investigated the effect of ph on the process performance was studied under two different ph the objective was to determine whether the combined process can be effective at circumneutral ph therefore the process performance under ph 3 and 7 was compared fig 7 shows the rate of cod removal under the two different ph conditions the cod removal under ph 3 is higher than that of ph 7 throughout the process time for example the cod removal under ph 3 was about 74 in the first 10 min whilst it was only about 53 for the ph 7 within the same time at the end of 60 min the cod removal was more than 80 for ph 3 whereas it was only about 69 for ph 7 under ph 3 fe2 remains in solution and exerts its catalytic ability to decompose h2o2 effectively consequently the removal of the organic pollutant is dominated by oxidation through fenton reactions this explains the rapid rate of cod removal on the other hand ph 7 slows down fenton reaction due to the precipitation of insoluble iron oxides which have lower catalytic ability 51 these iron oxides are precipitated on the surface of gac and can induce heterogeneous fenton process 11 14 28 however the crystallization of iron oxide on the surface of gac may also reduce the adsorption sites for the pollutant it is clear from fig 7 that the cod removal at ph 7 is still effective which shows the possibility of conducting the process at circumneutral ph fig 8 shows the effect pf ph on the color removal although in each case more than 99 color removal can be achieved in the first 10 min there was little difference in the overall color removal between the two different ph conditions in the first 10 min for example about 99 75 color removal was achieved under ph 7 and 99 35 color removal was achieved under ph 3 after that the color removal fluctuated and then remained nearly the same throughout the process time unlike cod removal the color removal was slightly higher at the neutral ph the low color removal at the acidic ph has been attributed to the scavenging effects of h and precipitation of iron hydroxide 52 this observation is consistent with many previous studies using fenton oxidation 53 54 although the performance of the gac is higher under ph 3 compared to ph 7 effective mineralization of the dye could still be achieved under the latter condition thus the possibility of cost reduction by conducting the process under the neutral ph must be considered large amount of chemicals are used during the acidification and subsequent neutralization processes that are necessary in conventional fenton oxidation 55 56 eliminating these two steps through conducting fenton oxidation at circumneutral ph can therefore reduce the overall cost of the treatment in this regard integrating fenton oxidation with fluidized gac could offer a viable alternative 3 2 2 contribution of adsorption to pollutant removal to investigate the contribution of gac through adsorption of the pollutant controlled experiments were conducted with gac alone and compared with the combined process fenton gac fig 9 shows the results of the controlled experiment for cod removal under adsorption alone the cod removal was only about 8 in the first 10 min and increased to about 30 after 60 min however for the combined process the removal was more than 70 in the first 10 min and reached about 80 after 60 min compared to fenton oxidation adsorption is a slow process and hence the relatively low removal under the designed process time however in the presence of fenton s reagent the removal of the pollutant is largely driven by the ho which has a high redox potential 2 8 ev and fast reactions rate 109 m 1s 1 7 consequently the cod removal is higher in the combined process due to the synergistic effects of the two process similar results were obtained previously when fenton oxidation was integrated with adsorption 24 30 31 hadjltaief et al 57 compared the removal of 2 chlorophenol through adsorption and adsorption fenton by fe rich clay the adsorption resulted in 20 removal of 2 chlorophenol which reached more than 70 under the combined adsorption fenton oxidation li et al 10 also reported the superiority of combined adsorption fenton oxidation compared with adsorption alone in the case of adsorption the removal is through the physico chemical interaction at the surface of the adsorbent while further degradation was provided when the fenton oxidation was introduced for comparison the cod removal by combined fenton oxidation and sio2 under the same conditions is also shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the performance of the combined fenton oxidation and gac is higher than fenton sio2 by about 20 which shows the superiority of the gac as a carrier in fluidized bed fenton process the mechanism of rb5 adsorption by gac can be explain by considering the zeta potential of the adsorbent from the analysis of zeta potential the phpzc of gac was found to be 11 this indicates that the surface of the gac is positively charged under the ph conditions 3 and 7 adopted in this study on the other hand rb5 is an anionic dye with low pka values due to the sulfonate groups that are attached to it 58 thus there is a strong possibility of electrostatic interaction between negatively charged rb5 and the positively charged surface of the gac similar mechanism has been reported by previous studies of rb5 adsorption by carbon based materials 58 59 3 2 3 effect of particle loading although the main objective of the fluidized carrier is to provide surfaces for the nucleation and crystallization of iron oxide it can also serve as an adsorbent for the target pollutant the previous section has quantified the adsorptive removal of the pollutant by the gac in this section the effect of particle loading on the process performance was investigated by varying the amount of the gac in the fluidized bed reactor 10 g 20 g 30 g fig 10 shows the cod removal for the three different particle loadings the cod removal increased when the particle loading was increased from 10 g to 20 g the increased in the cod removal with the increase in particle loading may be due to two reasons more adsorption and crystallization sites will become available when the particle loading is increased 60 since the gac has large surface area most of the intermediates can be adsorbed on its surfaces further reducing the cod of the solution 28 in this case the gac serves like a filtration stage enhancing the process performance 61 consequently the cod removal increased with increase in gac loading due to more adsorption sites provided by the solids another plausible explanation is that the increase in the loading of the fluidized solid caused an increase in the agitation in the reactor which may enhance particles mixing and interaction however when the particle loading was increased to 30 g the cod removal decreased this could be due the excessive settling of particles and poor particle fluidization 60 it was observed that as the particle loading was increased from 20 g to 30 g particle stacking and poor fluidization ensued in the reactor fig 11 shows the effect of particle loading on color removal it is apparent that particle loading does not significantly affect the color removal as more than 99 color removal can be achieved under all the particles loading the high rate of color removal irrespective of the particle loading is due to the rapid removal of color by the fenton oxidation the color of the dye is due to the azo double bond which can be easily conjugated by the hydroxyl radicals from the homogeneous fenton reaction 62 therefore the color removal using fenton oxidation proceeds very fast due to the initial rapid rate of reaction however the color removal was slighter higher in the case of 10 g and 20 g compared to 30 g this is likely due to the stacking effect as explain above 3 2 4 comparison of gac and sio2 the performance of gac as an alternative fluidized carrier was compared with the commonly used carrier sio2 fig 12 shows the cod removal using the two different carriers and the mixture of the two carriers under ph 3 the gac exhibited higher cod removal compared to sio2 while more than 70 cod removal was achieved in the first 10 min using gac only 53 was achieved with the sio2 under the same time at the end of 60 min the cod removal reached 80 in the gac system while it was about 60 for sio2 system the higher cod removal by the gac system was due to its larger surface area and functional groups as verified by the bet and ftir analyses the removal of pollutant by fluidized bed fenton process occurs through fenton oxidation and adsorption on the surface of the carriers as discussed previously the adsorptive removal of pollutant by gac is relatively high than sio2 thus gac exhibited higher pollutant removal than sio2 when the two carriers were mixed in the ratio of 1 1 the process performance was still lower than using gac alone however the removal under the gac sio2 system was nearly the same as that of sio2 alone another advantage of using gac is that the process performance can still be effective towards the circumneutral ph as discussed previously the performance of fluidized bed fenton process using gac was effective between ph 3 and 7 unlike the reported studies using sio2 where the ph restriction was strongly observed 11 60 the possibility of using a circumneutral ph condition confers a practical advantage to the use of gac compared to sio2 3 3 discussion although solid carriers are primarily utilized for crystallization of iron oxide with the aim of reducing sludge generation in homogeneous fenton oxidation such carriers can contribute to pollutants removal through adsorption this is even more probable where carriers with large surface area and surface functional groups are employed the spectroscopic and experimental results have pointed to the existence of both adsorption and oxidation in the fluidized bed fenton process investigated herein thus the removal of the pollutant can be attributed to the synergy of the adsorption by the gac and oxidation through the fenton generated ho besides this there was an evidence of the presence of fenton s reagent on the surface of gac after the fluidized bed fenton process which indicates the interactions of the two components analyzing the morphology and functional groups of adsorbents before and after adsorption can be used to gain insights into the possible interactions adsorption processes 63 64 the bet sem xps and ftir analyses have shown that the gac has a large specific surface area high porosity and various functional groups these excellent properties are favorable for the adsorption of rb5 and its intermediates as well as precipitation of iron as ferro organic complexes 28 thus it can be inferred that the removal of rb5 is through the combined ho oxidation and gac adsorption fig 13 depicts the proposed mechanism of the synergistic oxidation adsorption in the removal of rb5 the rb5 is primarily removed by the simultaneously action of ho and adsorptive interaction at the surface of the gac due to the precipitation of iron oxide at the surface of the gac a heterogeneous fenton oxidation is also introduced into the process although the removal of the rb5 is through adsorption and oxidation the latter is the dominant process due to the rapid degradation by the ho in our previous study the treatment of rb5 by fenton oxidation alone resulted in about 50 cod removal 13 as shown above the gac adsorption could only remove about 30 of the initial cod after 1 h for the combined process however the cod removal was 80 after 1 h indicating the synergy of the processes it is expected that similar synergistic effect will be obtained with other aops where ho is the common driving force for the oxidation although the cod removal by the gac alone is relatively low its contribution to the performance of the fluidized bed fenton process is still higher than the commonly used carrier sio2 a major limitation of using gac as a carrier is the possible saturation with a repeated use however the fenton oxidation could induced the regeneration of spent gac 65 thus gac can still be considered as a suitable carrier in fluidized bed fenton process for the treatment of textile effluents 4 conclusion this work evaluated the possibility of utilizing gac as a carrier in fluidized bed fenton process for recalcitrant wastewater treatment the process resulted in about 83 cod removal within 60 min which is 20 higher than a process employing the commonly used fluidized carrier sio2 although the highest performance was attained under ph 3 effective performance could still be obtained under ph 7 this implies that the gac can enable the application of fluidized bed fenton at circumneutral ph condition potentially eliminating the acidification and neutralization stages associated with the fenton oxidation surface analysis of the carrier before and after the process showed the evidence of interaction between the carrier fenton s reagent and the pollutant the overall results indicate that the pollutant removal is through the synergistic effect of adsorption and oxidation with the latter being the dominant process this study has shown that gac can be utilized as an effective carrier in fluidized bed fenton process for recalcitrant wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest 
14138,in this work we investigated the synergy of oxidation adsorption and surface interaction in fluidized bed fenton process with granular activated carbon gac as carriers experiments were conducted to evaluate the synergy of oxidation and adsorption in the removal of a model pollutant reactive black 5 the effects of carrier loading and solution ph on the process performance were investigated to determine the nature of interaction between the carriers fenton s reagent and pollutant the surface of the gac was analyzed using ftir sem edx xps and bet analyses the highest cod and color removal obtained were 83 and 99 respectively at 20 g carrier loading and ph 3 more than 28 of the initial cod was removed through adsorption by the carrier the process performance increased with increase in carrier loading but decreased when the loading exceeded a certain threshold although the highest cod removal was obtained at ph 3 effective removal was still achieved at ph 7 the surface analysis of the carrier reveals that both fenton s reagent and organic pollutant are adsorbed on the surface of the carrier indicating that the removal of the pollutant is through both adsorption and oxidation the performance of gac in this study is superior to the commonly employed carrier sio2 this study shows that gac can be used as an effective carrier in fluidized bed for fenton process keywords granular activated carbon fenton oxidation adsorption fluidized bed reactor adsorption oxidation synergy 1 introduction the widespread use of chemicals in industrial processes has led to an increasingly high level of recalcitrant organic pollutants in the environment although conventional physicochemical and biological wastewater treatment technologies are widely used to treat industrial effluents some of the organic pollutants are recalcitrant and therefore difficult to remove using these technologies 1 2 recalcitrant pollutants such as pesticides dyes pharmaceuticals and personal care products have been detected in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants 3 4 thus more effective treatment process must be deployed to remove these recalcitrant pollutants advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted a significant interest as effective treatment technologies for wastewater containing recalcitrant pollutants these processes are characterized by the generation of hydroxyl radical ho that can effective oxidize organic pollutants typical aops include fenton oxidation photocatalysis electrochemical oxidation and sonolysis fenton oxidation is among the most effective aops and involves a homogeneous reaction between fe2 and h2o2 to generate ho as shown in eq 1 to eq 3 fenton oxidation is widely used to remove organic pollutants due to its simplicity and effectiveness 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh h o 2 h o o r g a n i c s co 2 h 2 o products 3 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 ho 2 h despite the efficacy of fenton oxidation as a wastewater treatment technology it possesses some drawbacks the reactions in eq 1 to eq 3 and the subsequent chain reactions involved in fenton oxidation require an acidic condition ph 2 8 3 to maintain the catalytic role of fe2 5 consequently large chemical inputs will be required to acidify the wastewater and to neutralize the treated effluent 6 7 another limitation of fenton oxidation is the generation of excessive ferrous sludge which will require further treatment and disposal 8 10 many approaches have been put forward as possible solutions to the limitations of homogeneous fenton oxidation among these the use of fluidized bed reactor in fenton oxidation termed fluidized bed fenton process has received a significant interest 11 12 in the process solid carriers are fluidized with the fenton s reagent providing surfaces for the nucleation and crystallization of iron oxide 13 14 additionally due to the excellent mixing by the fluidization process performance can be enhanced through higher mass transfer and decreased chemical consumption 15 previous studies have shown that fluidized bed fenton process produces less sludge and achieved 15 20 higher removal efficiency compared to conventional fenton oxidation 16 17 due to the role of fluidized carriers in sludge reduction and enhancing the overall process performance selection of carriers is an important consideration currently the most commonly used fluidized carriers are sio2 and al2o3 while some studies have presented sio2 as the best carrier 18 others have pointed otherwise 19 thus more studies are needed on the fluidized carriers and their effects on the process performance granular activated carbon gac has been widely used in fluidized bed bioreactors 20 21 and fluidized bed adsorption processes 22 23 previous studies have shown gac to be an excellent fluidized carrier for different applications deploying gac as a carrier in fenton oxidation means that both adsorption and oxidation could occur during the treatment process although studies have shown the possibility of synergies between adsorption and advanced oxidation processes such as fenton oxidation 24 26 the synergy of the combined fluidized gac fenton oxidation has not been reported we noted the existence of some few studies on the combined homogeneous fenton oxidation activated carbon adsorption dwivedi et al 27 reported the optimization of fenton pretreatment integrated with gac for carbamazepine removal focusing on central composite design optimization and toxicity analysis lyu et al 28 integrated adsorption and fenton oxidation in a fluidized bed reactor for the treatment of multi dye wastewater the focus of the study was the hydraulic classification of fluidization comparison of activated carbon and ceramsite as carriers and iron crystallization thankappan et al 29 studied the removal of leather tanning agent syntan from aqueous solution using fenton oxidation followed by gac adsorption the treatment was a two stage sequential process and thus no synergistic effect was presented some studies have also reported the use of materials that could act as both adsorbents and fenton like heterogeneous catalysts 29 33 despite these studies however a detailed insight into the synergistic mechanism of fluidized gac adsorption and fenton oxidation is lacking the objective of this work is therefore to evaluate the feasibility of using gac as a low cost carrier for fluidized bed fenton process focusing on the adsorption oxidation synergy and the interactions on the surface of the gac the large surface area of the activated carbon can provide the necessary surfaces for the crystallization of iron oxides as well as possible adsorption of pollutants understanding the nature of interaction between the fluidized carrier fenton s reagent and organic pollutant is key aspect of the fluidized bed fenton process thus surface analysis of the carrier was conducted before and after the fluidized bed fenton process to get insights into the interactions a recalcitrant azo dye reactive black 5 rb5 was used as the model pollutant to evaluate the performance of the process rb5 is selected because it is widely used in textile industry and is among the most recalcitrant azo dyes 34 2 methodology 2 1 chemicals the chemicals used h2o2 30 feso4 7h2o hcl naoh and glass beads were procured from sigma

diazo dye with sulfonic and chromophore moieties in its molecule the recalcitrance of rb5 can be attributed to the presence of the two azo bond in its molecule 2 2 experimental set up details of the fluidized bed reactor used in this study was described in our previous study 35 glass beads were loaded at the bottom of the reactor to serve as distributors a predetermined amount of gac 10 30 g was then loaded on top of the glass beads for each run the fluidization was equalized prior to introducing the dye solution into the reactor and the superficial velocity was maintained by recirculation to provide 50 fluidization for the synthetic wastewater 500 mg of rb5 was dissolved in 1 l of distilled water the prepared rb5 solution 500 mg l was introduced into the reactor followed by ph adjustment using naoh or hcl since high ionic strength could affect the solute solvent interaction 36 low molarity acid base 1 m was used for the ph adjustment the fenton oxidation was initiated by the addition of feso4 7h2o 1 mm followed by the addition of h2o2 40 mm the experiments were conducted under the concentration ratio of dye fe2 h2o2 1 0 1 2 5 samples were collected at predetermined time for analysis the fenton reaction was stopped by raising the solution ph above 10 37 while any unreacted h2o2 oh was quenched using mno2 as described elsewhere 38 experiments were replicated to ensure reproducibility the effect of particle loading was investigated by varying the amount of gac in the rector 10 g 20 g 30 g the effect of ph was compared by conducting the process in the acidic and circumneutral ph controlled experiments were conducted to quantify the contribution of adsorption of pollutant onto the surface of gac for the adsorption 500 mg l of rb5 solution was introduced into the reactor with a predetermined gac loading 10 g 20 g 30 g and the process was ran without the addition of fenton s reagent similar experiments were conducted with the commonly used carrier sio2 to compare its performance with the gac 2 3 analytical methods the particle size distribution of the gac was measured using a malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern instrument ltd with a normal sensitivity and

were determined by n2 adsorption desorption method and the results are presented in table 2 the average pore size is 1 88 nm indicating that it contains microporous particles the gac has a large specific surface area of 949 56 m2 g the measurement of the single adsorption desorption total pore volume shows that the micropore volume constitutes more than 67 of the total pore volumes indicating that the gac is largely microporous similar observations on granular activated carbon have been reported 39 40 fig 1 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm the curve exhibited the characteristics of a type i isotherm which is typically obtained with microporous solids the isotherm displayed an h4 hysteresis containing a slit like pores which shows that the gac contains limited amounts of mesopores 40 41 3 1 2 zeta potential zeta potential is a measure of the magnitude of charge repulsion attraction at the interface of a solid particle and its liquid medium it reflects the effective charge at the surface of the particles and is therefore an important parameter to understand the mechanism of particle interactions the zeta potential can affect the interactions between gac organic pollutants and fenton s reagent the zeta potential of the gac was measured at different ph using a malvern zetasizer and the point of zero charge was determined by plotting the values of zeta potential against ph fig 2 the point of zero charge phpzc of the gac was found to be ph 11 this implies that the surface of the gac is positively charged at ph values less than 11 and negatively charged at ph values above 11 this phpzc value indicates the potential electrostatic attraction between the positively charged gac surface and the anionic rb5 molecules under the solution ph used in this study 3 1 3 fourier transformation infrared analysis ftir spectroscopy was used to study the surface functional groups of the gac before and after the treatment process fig 3 shows the ftir analysis of the gac before and after fluidized fenton process the results of the ftir analysis of the fresh gac is similar to that reported by misnon et al 42 in their study of electrochemical properties of oil palm kernel shell based carbon the wide weak band around 3700 cm 1 is due to the oh stretching mode resulting from the absorption of water molecules and alcohols 43 44 the two sharp peaks at 2924 cm 1 and 2853 cm 1 can be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric ch stretching 45 the relatively weak peak at 1748 cm 1 is due to the stretching of co and the peak at 1559 cm 1 is assigned to the stretching mode from carbonyl group cc 46 the peak at 1177 cm 1 is due to the stretching mode of coc 42 the region of 700 600 cm 1 can be assigned to the vibration of ch bending 43 after the fluidized bed fenton process the intensities of the bands decreased a new broad and strong band appeared at 3433 cm 1 which can be assigned to o h stretching resulting from adsorbed water or hydroxyl groups 42 additional peaks are also observed at 2323 cm 1 2015 cm 1 1108 cm 1 and 1020 cm 1 the appearances of new peaks and the disappearance of the initial ones indicate the possible interactions between the gac rb5 and the fenton s reagent 3 1 4 scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray the morphology and elemental composition of the gac can be used to gain insight into the possible interaction between fluidized carriers and fenton s reagent thus the morphology and elemental composition of the gac were studied using sem and edx analysis fig 4 a and b shows the morphology of the gac prior to the fluidized bed fenton process displaying a granular structure with an irregular rough surface that is typical of granular activated carbon 47 49 on the other hand fig 4 c and d displays the gac after the fluidized bed fenton process the change in the morphology of the carrier can be seen as the surface displays rough crystalline structure in contrast to the amorphous structure of fig 4 a and b energy dispersive x ray analysis was further conducted to investigate the elemental composition of the gac before and after the fluidized bed fenton process table 3 shows the elemental composition and the percentage weight of the elemental composition of the gac before and after the fluidized bed fenton process before the treatment c 86 59 and o 10 18 were the major constituents of the gac though traces of other elements such as f mg al and si were observed in the elemental mapping these traces were likely due to impurities from the preparation of the activated carbon however fe was not detected in the elemental mapping after the fluidized bed fenton process 15 fe was detected in the elemental composition furthermore the percentage weight of c decreased from 86 59 to 53 59 while that of o increased from 10 18 to 29 66 the appearance of fe and the increase of o can be attributed to the formation of iron oxide on the surface of the gac which is one the processes that occur in fluidized bed fenton process 14 3 1 5 x ray photo electron spectroscopy analysis the carrier was also analyzed by x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps to evaluate the chemical states of various elements and the functional groups the survey scan spectra of the gac showed mainly the presence of carbon and oxygen with some trace amounts of iron and sulfur after the fluidized bed fenton process the weight content of the elements before the process gac and after the process fbf gac are summarized in table 4 which confirmed the reduction of carbon content from 86 62 gac to 66 81 fbf gac and an increase of oxygen content from 8 82 gac to 29 93 fbf gac the full xps spectra of the gac and fbf gac are shown in fig 5 to further evaluate the chemical state of oxygen and carbon functional groups the deconvoluted high resolution xps c 1s region spectra of gac and fbf gac are shown in fig 6 a the comparison of xps spectrum for gac and fbf gac showed that the deconvoluted c 1s peaks appeared at 284 2 ev and 284 ev respectively which correspond to cc however in the case of fbf gac the peak intensity was weakened indicating the reduction of carbon content because of hydrolysis the o1s spectra shown in fig 6 b marked maximum peaks at 531 ev and 531 2 ev for fbf ac and gac respectively this signal is assigned to the presence of oc o functional groups the intensity of this signal is higher in fbf ac in addition the appearance of new peaks i e fe 2p1 and fe 2p3 at around 710 8 and 709 6 ev indicates respectively the presence of fe2o3 and feo on the surface of the carrier after the fluidized bed fenton process besides the appearance of s p2 peak at around 164 ev indicates the presence of r sh thiol on the carrier which may be due to the degradation of rb5 dye over the surface of the gac 3 2 synergistic performance of the combined process 3 2 1 effect of ph fenton oxidation is strongly affected by the ph of the solution which is required to be in a narrow acidic range for effective performance of the process the optimum ph to ensure the catalytic ability of fe2 fe3 is usually between 2 8 to 3 5 this represents one of the major limitations of homogeneous fenton oxidation higher ph above this range leads to precipitation of oxyhydroxide while lower ph slows down the reactivity of fe2 50 therefore the effect of ph on the combined fenton oxidation gac adsorption was investigated the effect of ph on the process performance was studied under two different ph the objective was to determine whether the combined process can be effective at circumneutral ph therefore the process performance under ph 3 and 7 was compared fig 7 shows the rate of cod removal under the two different ph conditions the cod removal under ph 3 is higher than that of ph 7 throughout the process time for example the cod removal under ph 3 was about 74 in the first 10 min whilst it was only about 53 for the ph 7 within the same time at the end of 60 min the cod removal was more than 80 for ph 3 whereas it was only about 69 for ph 7 under ph 3 fe2 remains in solution and exerts its catalytic ability to decompose h2o2 effectively consequently the removal of the organic pollutant is dominated by oxidation through fenton reactions this explains the rapid rate of cod removal on the other hand ph 7 slows down fenton reaction due to the precipitation of insoluble iron oxides which have lower catalytic ability 51 these iron oxides are precipitated on the surface of gac and can induce heterogeneous fenton process 11 14 28 however the crystallization of iron oxide on the surface of gac may also reduce the adsorption sites for the pollutant it is clear from fig 7 that the cod removal at ph 7 is still effective which shows the possibility of conducting the process at circumneutral ph fig 8 shows the effect pf ph on the color removal although in each case more than 99 color removal can be achieved in the first 10 min there was little difference in the overall color removal between the two different ph conditions in the first 10 min for example about 99 75 color removal was achieved under ph 7 and 99 35 color removal was achieved under ph 3 after that the color removal fluctuated and then remained nearly the same throughout the process time unlike cod removal the color removal was slightly higher at the neutral ph the low color removal at the acidic ph has been attributed to the scavenging effects of h and precipitation of iron hydroxide 52 this observation is consistent with many previous studies using fenton oxidation 53 54 although the performance of the gac is higher under ph 3 compared to ph 7 effective mineralization of the dye could still be achieved under the latter condition thus the possibility of cost reduction by conducting the process under the neutral ph must be considered large amount of chemicals are used during the acidification and subsequent neutralization processes that are necessary in conventional fenton oxidation 55 56 eliminating these two steps through conducting fenton oxidation at circumneutral ph can therefore reduce the overall cost of the treatment in this regard integrating fenton oxidation with fluidized gac could offer a viable alternative 3 2 2 contribution of adsorption to pollutant removal to investigate the contribution of gac through adsorption of the pollutant controlled experiments were conducted with gac alone and compared with the combined process fenton gac fig 9 shows the results of the controlled experiment for cod removal under adsorption alone the cod removal was only about 8 in the first 10 min and increased to about 30 after 60 min however for the combined process the removal was more than 70 in the first 10 min and reached about 80 after 60 min compared to fenton oxidation adsorption is a slow process and hence the relatively low removal under the designed process time however in the presence of fenton s reagent the removal of the pollutant is largely driven by the ho which has a high redox potential 2 8 ev and fast reactions rate 109 m 1s 1 7 consequently the cod removal is higher in the combined process due to the synergistic effects of the two process similar results were obtained previously when fenton oxidation was integrated with adsorption 24 30 31 hadjltaief et al 57 compared the removal of 2 chlorophenol through adsorption and adsorption fenton by fe rich clay the adsorption resulted in 20 removal of 2 chlorophenol which reached more than 70 under the combined adsorption fenton oxidation li et al 10 also reported the superiority of combined adsorption fenton oxidation compared with adsorption alone in the case of adsorption the removal is through the physico chemical interaction at the surface of the adsorbent while further degradation was provided when the fenton oxidation was introduced for comparison the cod removal by combined fenton oxidation and sio2 under the same conditions is also shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the performance of the combined fenton oxidation and gac is higher than fenton sio2 by about 20 which shows the superiority of the gac as a carrier in fluidized bed fenton process the mechanism of rb5 adsorption by gac can be explain by considering the zeta potential of the adsorbent from the analysis of zeta potential the phpzc of gac was found to be 11 this indicates that the surface of the gac is positively charged under the ph conditions 3 and 7 adopted in this study on the other hand rb5 is an anionic dye with low pka values due to the sulfonate groups that are attached to it 58 thus there is a strong possibility of electrostatic interaction between negatively charged rb5 and the positively charged surface of the gac similar mechanism has been reported by previous studies of rb5 adsorption by carbon based materials 58 59 3 2 3 effect of particle loading although the main objective of the fluidized carrier is to provide surfaces for the nucleation and crystallization of iron oxide it can also serve as an adsorbent for the target pollutant the previous section has quantified the adsorptive removal of the pollutant by the gac in this section the effect of particle loading on the process performance was investigated by varying the amount of the gac in the fluidized bed reactor 10 g 20 g 30 g fig 10 shows the cod removal for the three different particle loadings the cod removal increased when the particle loading was increased from 10 g to 20 g the increased in the cod removal with the increase in particle loading may be due to two reasons more adsorption and crystallization sites will become available when the particle loading is increased 60 since the gac has large surface area most of the intermediates can be adsorbed on its surfaces further reducing the cod of the solution 28 in this case the gac serves like a filtration stage enhancing the process performance 61 consequently the cod removal increased with increase in gac loading due to more adsorption sites provided by the solids another plausible explanation is that the increase in the loading of the fluidized solid caused an increase in the agitation in the reactor which may enhance particles mixing and interaction however when the particle loading was increased to 30 g the cod removal decreased this could be due the excessive settling of particles and poor particle fluidization 60 it was observed that as the particle loading was increased from 20 g to 30 g particle stacking and poor fluidization ensued in the reactor fig 11 shows the effect of particle loading on color removal it is apparent that particle loading does not significantly affect the color removal as more than 99 color removal can be achieved under all the particles loading the high rate of color removal irrespective of the particle loading is due to the rapid removal of color by the fenton oxidation the color of the dye is due to the azo double bond which can be easily conjugated by the hydroxyl radicals from the homogeneous fenton reaction 62 therefore the color removal using fenton oxidation proceeds very fast due to the initial rapid rate of reaction however the color removal was slighter higher in the case of 10 g and 20 g compared to 30 g this is likely due to the stacking effect as explain above 3 2 4 comparison of gac and sio2 the performance of gac as an alternative fluidized carrier was compared with the commonly used carrier sio2 fig 12 shows the cod removal using the two different carriers and the mixture of the two carriers under ph 3 the gac exhibited higher cod removal compared to sio2 while more than 70 cod removal was achieved in the first 10 min using gac only 53 was achieved with the sio2 under the same time at the end of 60 min the cod removal reached 80 in the gac system while it was about 60 for sio2 system the higher cod removal by the gac system was due to its larger surface area and functional groups as verified by the bet and ftir analyses the removal of pollutant by fluidized bed fenton process occurs through fenton oxidation and adsorption on the surface of the carriers as discussed previously the adsorptive removal of pollutant by gac is relatively high than sio2 thus gac exhibited higher pollutant removal than sio2 when the two carriers were mixed in the ratio of 1 1 the process performance was still lower than using gac alone however the removal under the gac sio2 system was nearly the same as that of sio2 alone another advantage of using gac is that the process performance can still be effective towards the circumneutral ph as discussed previously the performance of fluidized bed fenton process using gac was effective between ph 3 and 7 unlike the reported studies using sio2 where the ph restriction was strongly observed 11 60 the possibility of using a circumneutral ph condition confers a practical advantage to the use of gac compared to sio2 3 3 discussion although solid carriers are primarily utilized for crystallization of iron oxide with the aim of reducing sludge generation in homogeneous fenton oxidation such carriers can contribute to pollutants removal through adsorption this is even more probable where carriers with large surface area and surface functional groups are employed the spectroscopic and experimental results have pointed to the existence of both adsorption and oxidation in the fluidized bed fenton process investigated herein thus the removal of the pollutant can be attributed to the synergy of the adsorption by the gac and oxidation through the fenton generated ho besides this there was an evidence of the presence of fenton s reagent on the surface of gac after the fluidized bed fenton process which indicates the interactions of the two components analyzing the morphology and functional groups of adsorbents before and after adsorption can be used to gain insights into the possible interactions adsorption processes 63 64 the bet sem xps and ftir analyses have shown that the gac has a large specific surface area high porosity and various functional groups these excellent properties are favorable for the adsorption of rb5 and its intermediates as well as precipitation of iron as ferro organic complexes 28 thus it can be inferred that the removal of rb5 is through the combined ho oxidation and gac adsorption fig 13 depicts the proposed mechanism of the synergistic oxidation adsorption in the removal of rb5 the rb5 is primarily removed by the simultaneously action of ho and adsorptive interaction at the surface of the gac due to the precipitation of iron oxide at the surface of the gac a heterogeneous fenton oxidation is also introduced into the process although the removal of the rb5 is through adsorption and oxidation the latter is the dominant process due to the rapid degradation by the ho in our previous study the treatment of rb5 by fenton oxidation alone resulted in about 50 cod removal 13 as shown above the gac adsorption could only remove about 30 of the initial cod after 1 h for the combined process however the cod removal was 80 after 1 h indicating the synergy of the processes it is expected that similar synergistic effect will be obtained with other aops where ho is the common driving force for the oxidation although the cod removal by the gac alone is relatively low its contribution to the performance of the fluidized bed fenton process is still higher than the commonly used carrier sio2 a major limitation of using gac as a carrier is the possible saturation with a repeated use however the fenton oxidation could induced the regeneration of spent gac 65 thus gac can still be considered as a suitable carrier in fluidized bed fenton process for the treatment of textile effluents 4 conclusion this work evaluated the possibility of utilizing gac as a carrier in fluidized bed fenton process for recalcitrant wastewater treatment the process resulted in about 83 cod removal within 60 min which is 20 higher than a process employing the commonly used fluidized carrier sio2 although the highest performance was attained under ph 3 effective performance could still be obtained under ph 7 this implies that the gac can enable the application of fluidized bed fenton at circumneutral ph condition potentially eliminating the acidification and neutralization stages associated with the fenton oxidation surface analysis of the carrier before and after the process showed the evidence of interaction between the carrier fenton s reagent and the pollutant the overall results indicate that the pollutant removal is through the synergistic effect of adsorption and oxidation with the latter being the dominant process this study has shown that gac can be utilized as an effective carrier in fluidized bed fenton process for recalcitrant wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest 
14139,in this study photocatalytic degradation of trimethoprim by synthesized s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts was investigated both photocatalysts have been immobilized on circular aluminum plates by polysiloxane to investigate their reusability performance the morphology and structure of the catalysts were studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy x ray diffraction and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the photocatalytic experiments were carried out using suspended and attached catalysts using a metal halide lamp as a light source the degradation efficiencies of trimethoprim were 100 and 98 2 at catalyst dose of 0 5 g l ph of 7 0 and irradiation time of 240 min using suspended ru wo3 zro2 and s tio2 respectively after immobilization of the catalysts on the aluminum plates the removal efficiencies in five repetitive cycles were 98 96 9 96 8 93 2 and 83 4 using ru wo3 zro2 while they were 88 6 86 84 78 and 75 9 in case of s tio2 the irradiation time of each cycle was 240 min and the initial trimethoprim concentration was 10 mg l the degradation rates of trimethoprim were estimated in the case of suspended and immobilized s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 the radical trapping experiments using various scavengers revealed that superoxide radicals holes and hydroxyl radicals all participated in the photo degradation process furthermore the transformation products generated during the trimethoprim oxidation process were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy to identify the possible degradation pathways keywords pharmaceuticals photocatalysis transformation products trimethoprim wastewater 1 introduction antibiotics are frequently released to the aquatic environment through the industrial and domestic wastewater of pharmaceutical companies as well as the feces of humans and animals 1 the immunizing of bacteria against antibiotics due to the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is considered one of the major concerns therefore it is essential to develop eco friendly methods for the degradation of antibiotics 2 trimethoprim is one of the widely used antibiotics due to its activity towards many types of bacteria consequently it has been frequently found in wastewater 3 traditional biological wastewater treatment technologies cannot completely remove the bio resistant contaminants such as antibiotics 4 advanced oxidation processes aops can effectively degrade bio recalcitrant contaminants through the production of highly active species capable of oxidizing bio resistant pollutants to harmless products 5 photocatalysis is considered one of the promising advanced oxidation processes due to its sustainable nature including low energy consumption and the potential to utilize solar light 6 surface recombination is considered one of the major problems associated with conventional semiconductors 7 therefore the doping of various materials on the surface of semiconductors has been investigated indeed the doping can reduce the recombination rate and also participate in the reduction of bandgap 8 the decrease in the bandgap will enhance the photocatalytic activity towards visible light recently many studies have added various dopants to conventional catalysts to improve its performance chen et al used the co hydrolysis method to synthesize cationic s doped tio2 for the oxidation of nitrobenzene p chlorophenol and phenol in aqueous solutions using a variety of illumination sources 9 zeng et al prepared wo3 mos2 ag hollow nanotubes using a hydrothermal and deposition method for the degradation of peroxymonosulfate pms 10 nano scale photocatalysts are frequently used in suspension to exploit the high surface area of the particles 11 however the dispersion of photocatalysts in water is associated with many limitations such as the difficulty of light penetration due to the high turbidity and the complexity of powder collection for reuse 12 therefore heat attachment methods were successfully used for the loading of catalysts on different mediums however they consume high energy in preparation 13 moreover particles can be easily released by the shear force induced by mixing 14 in this work the polysiloxane was used to attain durable bonds between photocatalysts and aluminum plates for degradation of trimethoprim the performance of suspended and attached s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts was investigated the reusability performance of attached catalysts oxidant species responsible for photo degradation and oxidation pathway were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials trimethoprim was obtained from mp bio usa acetonitrile and formic acid were obtained from sigma aldrich titanium isopropoxide ethanol and zro2 were obtained from wako japan thiourea was obtained from tokyo chemical industry co ltd all chemicals were of analytical grade and have been used without any pre treatments 2 2 experimental procedures the s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts were synthesized according to our previous reports gar alalm samy et al 2018 gar alalm ookawara et al 2016 the attached catalysts were prepared by the immobilization of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 particles on aluminum plates using polysiloxane the diameter and the thickness of aluminum plates are 65 mm and 2 mm respectively and the aluminum grade is 3003 a strong bond between the catalyst and the aluminum plates can be attained by placing a layer of polysiloxane with a thickness of 1 mm on the surface of the aluminum plate then a uniform distribution of 1 gm of s tio2 or ru wo3 zro2 catalysts was carried out on the aluminum plate with a polysiloxane layer the drying process of the plates was carried out by keeping the plates at room temperature for 24 h the plates were washed by distilled water to remove free particles and confirm the strong bond between the catalyst particles and aluminum plates the photo reactor was about 250 ml pyrex beaker filled with 100 ml of trimethoprim solution and the light source was maintained at 200 mm from the surface of the solution the illumination source was a 400 w metal halide lamp venture metal halide lamps emit visibly and uv light according to the emission profile of metal halide lamps as shown in fig s1 16 the lamp has a maximum wavelength of 510 nm and 220 μw cm 2 is the photon flux of the lamp the first 30 min in the experiment were in dark to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium then the lamp was switched on to start the photo degradation reaction the aluminum plate was placed at the bottom of the beaker and magnetic stirrer was used to achieve a continuous link between the contaminated solution and the catalyst particles immobilized on the plate in the case of suspended catalyst certain doses of s tio2 or ru wo3 zro2 catalysts were added to the contaminated solution instead of placing the plate at the bottom of the beaker 2 3 analytical methods trimethoprim concentrations were detected using hplc system agilent 1200 series usa filtration of the samples was carried out by whatman syringe filters with a pore size of 0 2 μm before injection of 20 μl of the sample into a

wavelength of 237 nm and the flow rate was 1 5 ml min 1 the retention time of the trimethoprim peak was 1 927 min identification of transformation products was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lc ms ms shimadzu 2020 with a shim pack xr ods column at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min using the same mobile phase in hplc analysis transmission electron microscopy tem joel jem 2100 japan with an accelerating voltage of 200 kv was used to obtain the images with high resolution of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 the x ray diffraction xrd 6000 shimadzu japan analysis was used to determine the phases of the crystallinity of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 using cu kα radiation λ 1 54056 å the chemical composition of synthesized catalysts was determined using energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy jeol jsm 6510lv japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 the tem images fig 1 a showed that the diameter of s tio2 particles ranged from 12 to 22 nm while the ru wo3 zro2 particle diameter ranged from 12 to 27 nm as demonstrated in fig 1b the small diameters of both s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 particles suggest the high catalytic surface area of the photocatalysts edx analysis fig 2 confirmed the presence of ru w and zr in the prepared ru wo3 zro2 and the existence of sulfur and titanium in the synthesized s tio2 was also confirmed using edx analysis according to our previous study 8 fig 3 shows the xrd pattern of the synthesized s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts the highest peak was detected at 2θ 25 5 for s tio2 catalyst which belongs to active anatase tio2 17 the peaks at 2θ 37 6 48 1 54 20 55 4 and 62 5 are attributed to the various planes of anatase phase of tio2 jcpds no 21 1272 18 the existence of a small peak at 2θ 30 5 may be due to the remaining amounts of the brookite phase of titania 18 the sulfur has no unique peaks due to the uniform dispersion of its ions with anatase crystallite 19 the monoclinic phase of the wo3 crystals was detected through the three peaks observed at 2θ 23 24 3 pdf no 83 0951 as shown in fig 3 the existence of free tungstate anions on the catalyst surface was confirmed by the peaks at 2θ 22 9 23 7 and 24 4 20 the peaks at 2θ 28 9 33 8 and 34 5 are due to the tetragonal crystal phase of zro2 pdf number 27 0997 the peaks of the tetragonal crystal phase were broader due to the addition of ru pdf number 00 006 0663 15 3 2 the photocatalytic activity of the suspended catalyst preliminary studies were performed to check the effect of ph on the degradation of trimethoprim using s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 at a catalyst dose of 0 5 g l and a reaction time of 240 min fig s2 demonstrates that the change in ph had a slight effect on the degradation of trimethoprim using both photocatalysts hence the followed experiments were performed without ph adjustment the effects of doses of suspended s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts on the removal efficiency of trimethoprim are shown in fig 4 the five levels of s tio2 dose 0 1 g l 1 0 g l were used at initial trimethoprim concentration of 10 mg l ph of 7 and irradiation time of 240 min whereas the three levels 0 25 g l 1 0 g l of ru wo3 zro2 dose were studied at the same conditions the removal efficiencies due to adsorption during the 30 min incubation in the dark were 6 0 9 90 2 0 3 40 and 12 40 using 0 1 g l 0 25 g l 0 5 g l 0 8 g l and 1 0 g l doses of s tio2 respectively while the degradation efficiencies in the dark were 7 0 32 0 and 23 50 using 0 25 g l 0 5 g l and 1 0 g l doses of ru wo3 zro2 respectively confirming that the overall removal efficiency was mainly due to the photocatalytic degradation the photo degradation efficiency increased from 79 3 to 98 2 by increasing the catalyst dose of s tio2 from 0 1 g l to 0 5 g l the degradation efficiency was also increased from 94 6 to 100 using ru wo3 zro2 catalyst dose of 0 25 g l and 0 5 g l respectively after 240 min moreover the complete degradation of trimethoprim was achieved at an irradiation time of 180 min using 1 0 g l of ru wo3 zro2 the rise in catalyst dose leads to the enhancement of photo degradation efficiency possibly due to the increase of active sites responsible for the generation of hydroxyl radicals 8 raising s tio2 loading to greater than 0 5 g l however led to a slight reduction of photo degradation efficiency to 95 6 and 94 at catalyst dose of 0 8 g l and 1 0 g l respectively it may be explained by the fact that higher doses of the catalyst lead to an increase of the turbidity of the solution hindering photons to reach the active sites of the catalyst surface due to the scattering effect 21 furthermore the possibility of agglomeration of particles can be increased in the case of higher doses and this can lead to the reduction of active sites 22 accordingly the optimum catalyst dose is considered 0 5 g l in the case of the s tio2 catalyst 3 3 photocatalytic activity and reusability of the attached catalyst the reusability of the attached s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts was investigated in five consecutive experiments at initial trimethoprim concentration of 10 mg l ph of 7 0 and time of 240 min as depicted in fig 5 a and b ru wo3 zro2 showed higher performance and reusability potential than s tio2 in five consecutive cycles the degradation efficiencies were 98 96 9 96 8 93 2 and 83 4 using attached ru wo3 zro2 in the five repetitive cycles while the removal efficiencies were 88 6 86 84 78 and 75 9 in case of s tio2 the high performance of ru wo3 zro2 can be attributed to the existence of ru and zr ions which act as an electron trap and inhibit the recombination of radicals the observed degradation efficiency in five consecutive experiments confirmed the high stability and reusability of both s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts the continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals during five consecutive cycles suggest the availability of active sites on the aluminum plate even after a long period of irradiation the slight decrease in photo degradation efficiency in each successive cycle may be related to the small amount of catalyst released from the plate and or leftovers of contaminants on the catalyst decreasing the active surface area in general the performance of the attached catalyst is lower than the suspended catalyst at the same condition most likely because the interaction between pollutants and the catalyst only takes place at the bottom of the reactor additionally the light needs to pass through the total depth of the water to excite the catalyst particles the shear and friction forces resulting from the rapid movement of the stirrer at the bottom of the reactor can result in the release of catalyst particles from the plate however the results showed that attached s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 by polysiloxane have the potential for reusability several times moreover the attached catalyst is more sustainable than suspended catalysts due to the difficulty of collecting suspended catalyst especially nano scale catalysts increasing the illumination time can overcome the limitations related to the attached catalyst and contribute to the reduction of the cost in the case of large scale application 3 4 degradation kinetics of trimethoprim langmuir hinshelwood model was used to estimate the degradation rates of trimethoprim using s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 in suspended and attached modes eq 1 illustrates the relation between the remaining concentration of trimethoprim and time 23 1 ln c o c k o b s t where kobs is the reaction rate co and c are the initial concentration of trimethoprim and the concentration of trimethoprim at time t the degradation rates of trimethoprim using ru wo3 zro2 in suspended and immobilized modes were higher than the degradation rates in the case of s tio2 in both cases as shown in fig 6 a and b the superiority of ru wo3 zro2 catalyst in attached and suspended modes was due to the addition of zr and ru ions which have the ability to catch electrons and reduce recombination rate leading to higher photodegradation efficiency moreover the degradation rate in suspended mode was higher than the degradation rate in an immobilized mode in the case of both catalysts in the case of the attached mode the light needs to pass the total depth of the water to reach the active sites of the immobilized catalyst and generate reactive species while the light excites the catalyst particles everywhere in the solution using suspended catalysts furthermore the contact between the catalyst particles and the pollutant is higher in the case of suspended catalysts as the contact only takes place at the bottom of the reactor using attached catalysts table 1 shows the degradation rates of trimethoprim using s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 suspended and immobilized catalysts 3 5 degradation mechanism fig 7 demonstrates the generated radicals for the degradation of trimethoprim the excitation of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 by the 400 w metal halide lamp leads to the migration of electrons from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb leaving holes in the valence band the reaction of electrons in cb with oxygen o2 results in the formation of superoxide radicals o2 while holes vb react with water or hydroxyl ions oh to generate hydroxyl radicals o h holes hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals are in charge of the degradation of trimethoprim isopropanol iso ammonium oxalate ao and ascorbic acid aa were used as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals and holes respectively to specify the active species responsible for the degradation of trimethoprim as shown in fig 8 24 26 the degradation efficiency of trimethoprim 10 mg l by s tio2 was 98 2 without the addition of any scavengers while the photo degradation efficiency decreased to 82 8 93 3 and 44 9 using 1 mm of iso ao and aa respectively at a dose of 0 5 g l ph of 7 and irradiation time of 240 min as illustrated in fig 8 a in the case of ru wo3 zro2 the photo degradation efficiency reduced to 85 92 9 and 48 using 1 mm of iso ao and aa respectively at the same previous conditions the results confirmed that hydroxyl radicals holes and superoxide radicals all contributed to the degradation process however the holes contributed to a greater extent than superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals 3 6 photo degradation transformation products and potential degradation pathway the transformation products generated during the photo degradation process of trimethoprim tmp c14h19n4o3 m z 291 were measured by mass spectrometry as shown in fig 9 hydroxylation de methylation and cleavage are the main reactions in the tmp degradation process by radicals as reported in the literature 27 compounds with the general formula of c14h19n4o3 x x

intermediate m z 307 c14h19n4o4 was identified as α hydro xytrimethoprim tmp oh and formed through the hydroxylation of trimethoprim 27 di hydroxylated m z 323 c14h19n4o5 was also formed through the hydroxylation of trimethoprim 28 the products α ketotrimethoprim tmp o m z 305 can be generated through the oxidation of tmp products with formula c14 y h19 2yn4o3 x y varying from 1 to 3 can be generated through de methylation reactions compounds with m z 309 c13h17n4o5 m z 341 c13h17n4o7 m z 295 c12h15n4o5 m z 279 c12h15n4o4 m z 281 c11h13n4o5 and m z 277 c13h16n4o3 were formed through de methylation hydroxylation process of tmp 28 products m z 139 c5h6n4o m z 155 c5h6n4o2 m z 171 c8h10o4 and m z 141 c5h8n4o were suggested to be generated by the cleavage of tmp 28 based on the observation of these transformation products a possible degradation pathway is suggested in fig 9 4 conclusions s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts were synthesized and their performance in the attached and suspended state was evaluated for the degradation of trimethoprim the characterization of the synthesized s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts suggested a successful interaction of components and high active surface area the optimum catalyst doses in suspension state of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 were 0 5 and 1 0 g l respectively the degradation efficiencies of trimethoprim were 100 and 98 2 at catalyst dose of 0 5 g l ph of 7 0 and irradiation time of 240 min using suspended ru wo3 zro2 and s tio2 respectively ru wo3 zro2 showed higher performance and reusability than s tio2 in five consecutive runs in the attached state the removal efficiencies in five consecutive runs were 88 6 86 84 78 and 75 9 for the attached s tio2 while the degradation rates were 98 96 9 96 8 93 2 and 83 4 in case of attached ru wo3 zro2 the degradation rates of trimethoprim in the case of the immobilized mode were lower than the degradation rates using catalysts in suspended mode the main active species in charge of the photo degradation process were holes and hydroxyl radicals the potential degradation pathways were suggested based on the identification of transformation products declaration

14139,in this study photocatalytic degradation of trimethoprim by synthesized s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts was investigated both photocatalysts have been immobilized on circular aluminum plates by polysiloxane to investigate their reusability performance the morphology and structure of the catalysts were studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy x ray diffraction and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the photocatalytic experiments were carried out using suspended and attached catalysts using a metal halide lamp as a light source the degradation efficiencies of trimethoprim were 100 and 98 2 at catalyst dose of 0 5 g l ph of 7 0 and irradiation time of 240 min using suspended ru wo3 zro2 and s tio2 respectively after immobilization of the catalysts on the aluminum plates the removal efficiencies in five repetitive cycles were 98 96 9 96 8 93 2 and 83 4 using ru wo3 zro2 while they were 88 6 86 84 78 and 75 9 in case of s tio2 the irradiation time of each cycle was 240 min and the initial trimethoprim concentration was 10 mg l the degradation rates of trimethoprim were estimated in the case of suspended and immobilized s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 the radical trapping experiments using various scavengers revealed that superoxide radicals holes and hydroxyl radicals all participated in the photo degradation process furthermore the transformation products generated during the trimethoprim oxidation process were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy to identify the possible degradation pathways keywords pharmaceuticals photocatalysis transformation products trimethoprim wastewater 1 introduction antibiotics are frequently released to the aquatic environment through the industrial and domestic wastewater of pharmaceutical companies as well as the feces of humans and animals 1 the immunizing of bacteria against antibiotics due to the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is considered one of the major concerns therefore it is essential to develop eco friendly methods for the degradation of antibiotics 2 trimethoprim is one of the widely used antibiotics due to its activity towards many types of bacteria consequently it has been frequently found in wastewater 3 traditional biological wastewater treatment technologies cannot completely remove the bio resistant contaminants such as antibiotics 4 advanced oxidation processes aops can effectively degrade bio recalcitrant contaminants through the production of highly active species capable of oxidizing bio resistant pollutants to harmless products 5 photocatalysis is considered one of the promising advanced oxidation processes due to its sustainable nature including low energy consumption and the potential to utilize solar light 6 surface recombination is considered one of the major problems associated with conventional semiconductors 7 therefore the doping of various materials on the surface of semiconductors has been investigated indeed the doping can reduce the recombination rate and also participate in the reduction of bandgap 8 the decrease in the bandgap will enhance the photocatalytic activity towards visible light recently many studies have added various dopants to conventional catalysts to improve its performance chen et al used the co hydrolysis method to synthesize cationic s doped tio2 for the oxidation of nitrobenzene p chlorophenol and phenol in aqueous solutions using a variety of illumination sources 9 zeng et al prepared wo3 mos2 ag hollow nanotubes using a hydrothermal and deposition method for the degradation of peroxymonosulfate pms 10 nano scale photocatalysts are frequently used in suspension to exploit the high surface area of the particles 11 however the dispersion of photocatalysts in water is associated with many limitations such as the difficulty of light penetration due to the high turbidity and the complexity of powder collection for reuse 12 therefore heat attachment methods were successfully used for the loading of catalysts on different mediums however they consume high energy in preparation 13 moreover particles can be easily released by the shear force induced by mixing 14 in this work the polysiloxane was used to attain durable bonds between photocatalysts and aluminum plates for degradation of trimethoprim the performance of suspended and attached s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts was investigated the reusability performance of attached catalysts oxidant species responsible for photo degradation and oxidation pathway were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials trimethoprim was obtained from mp bio usa acetonitrile and formic acid were obtained from sigma aldrich titanium isopropoxide ethanol and zro2 were obtained from wako japan thiourea was obtained from tokyo chemical industry co ltd all chemicals were of analytical grade and have been used without any pre treatments 2 2 experimental procedures the s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts were synthesized according to our previous reports gar alalm samy et al 2018 gar alalm ookawara et al 2016 the attached catalysts were prepared by the immobilization of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 particles on aluminum plates using polysiloxane the diameter and the thickness of aluminum plates are 65 mm and 2 mm respectively and the aluminum grade is 3003 a strong bond between the catalyst and the aluminum plates can be attained by placing a layer of polysiloxane with a thickness of 1 mm on the surface of the aluminum plate then a uniform distribution of 1 gm of s tio2 or ru wo3 zro2 catalysts was carried out on the aluminum plate with a polysiloxane layer the drying process of the plates was carried out by keeping the plates at room temperature for 24 h the plates were washed by distilled water to remove free particles and confirm the strong bond between the catalyst particles and aluminum plates the photo reactor was about 250 ml pyrex beaker filled with 100 ml of trimethoprim solution and the light source was maintained at 200 mm from the surface of the solution the illumination source was a 400 w metal halide lamp venture metal halide lamps emit visibly and uv light according to the emission profile of metal halide lamps as shown in fig s1 16 the lamp has a maximum wavelength of 510 nm and 220 μw cm 2 is the photon flux of the lamp the first 30 min in the experiment were in dark to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium then the lamp was switched on to start the photo degradation reaction the aluminum plate was placed at the bottom of the beaker and magnetic stirrer was used to achieve a continuous link between the contaminated solution and the catalyst particles immobilized on the plate in the case of suspended catalyst certain doses of s tio2 or ru wo3 zro2 catalysts were added to the contaminated solution instead of placing the plate at the bottom of the beaker 2 3 analytical methods trimethoprim concentrations were detected using hplc system agilent 1200 series usa filtration of the samples was carried out by whatman syringe filters with a pore size of 0 2 μm before injection of 20 μl of the sample into a column apollo c18 5 mm 4 6 150 mm and the column temperature was fixed at 40 c the initial mobile phase consists of 30 acetonitrile a and 70 water with 0 1 v v formic acid b then the percentage of solvent a increased gradually to 90 within 4 min and this percentage lasted for 2 min finally the percentages of mobile phase returned to the initial conditions trimethoprim peak was observed at a wavelength of 237 nm and the flow rate was 1 5 ml min 1 the retention time of the trimethoprim peak was 1 927 min identification of transformation products was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lc ms ms shimadzu 2020 with a shim pack xr ods column at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min using the same mobile phase in hplc analysis transmission electron microscopy tem joel jem 2100 japan with an accelerating voltage of 200 kv was used to obtain the images with high resolution of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 the x ray diffraction xrd 6000 shimadzu japan analysis was used to determine the phases of the crystallinity of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 using cu kα radiation λ 1 54056 å the chemical composition of synthesized catalysts was determined using energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopy jeol jsm 6510lv japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 the tem images fig 1 a showed that the diameter of s tio2 particles ranged from 12 to 22 nm while the ru wo3 zro2 particle diameter ranged from 12 to 27 nm as demonstrated in fig 1b the small diameters of both s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 particles suggest the high catalytic surface area of the photocatalysts edx analysis fig 2 confirmed the presence of ru w and zr in the prepared ru wo3 zro2 and the existence of sulfur and titanium in the synthesized s tio2 was also confirmed using edx analysis according to our previous study 8 fig 3 shows the xrd pattern of the synthesized s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts the highest peak was detected at 2θ 25 5 for s tio2 catalyst which belongs to active anatase tio2 17 the peaks at 2θ 37 6 48 1 54 20 55 4 and 62 5 are attributed to the various planes of anatase phase of tio2 jcpds no 21 1272 18 the existence of a small peak at 2θ 30 5 may be due to the remaining amounts of the brookite phase of titania 18 the sulfur has no unique peaks due to the uniform dispersion of its ions with anatase crystallite 19 the monoclinic phase of the wo3 crystals was detected through the three peaks observed at 2θ 23 24 3 pdf no 83 0951 as shown in fig 3 the existence of free tungstate anions on the catalyst surface was confirmed by the peaks at 2θ 22 9 23 7 and 24 4 20 the peaks at 2θ 28 9 33 8 and 34 5 are due to the tetragonal crystal phase of zro2 pdf number 27 0997 the peaks of the tetragonal crystal phase were broader due to the addition of ru pdf number 00 006 0663 15 3 2 the photocatalytic activity of the suspended catalyst preliminary studies were performed to check the effect of ph on the degradation of trimethoprim using s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 at a catalyst dose of 0 5 g l and a reaction time of 240 min fig s2 demonstrates that the change in ph had a slight effect on the degradation of trimethoprim using both photocatalysts hence the followed experiments were performed without ph adjustment the effects of doses of suspended s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts on the removal efficiency of trimethoprim are shown in fig 4 the five levels of s tio2 dose 0 1 g l 1 0 g l were used at initial trimethoprim concentration of 10 mg l ph of 7 and irradiation time of 240 min whereas the three levels 0 25 g l 1 0 g l of ru wo3 zro2 dose were studied at the same conditions the removal efficiencies due to adsorption during the 30 min incubation in the dark were 6 0 9 90 2 0 3 40 and 12 40 using 0 1 g l 0 25 g l 0 5 g l 0 8 g l and 1 0 g l doses of s tio2 respectively while the degradation efficiencies in the dark were 7 0 32 0 and 23 50 using 0 25 g l 0 5 g l and 1 0 g l doses of ru wo3 zro2 respectively confirming that the overall removal efficiency was mainly due to the photocatalytic degradation the photo degradation efficiency increased from 79 3 to 98 2 by increasing the catalyst dose of s tio2 from 0 1 g l to 0 5 g l the degradation efficiency was also increased from 94 6 to 100 using ru wo3 zro2 catalyst dose of 0 25 g l and 0 5 g l respectively after 240 min moreover the complete degradation of trimethoprim was achieved at an irradiation time of 180 min using 1 0 g l of ru wo3 zro2 the rise in catalyst dose leads to the enhancement of photo degradation efficiency possibly due to the increase of active sites responsible for the generation of hydroxyl radicals 8 raising s tio2 loading to greater than 0 5 g l however led to a slight reduction of photo degradation efficiency to 95 6 and 94 at catalyst dose of 0 8 g l and 1 0 g l respectively it may be explained by the fact that higher doses of the catalyst lead to an increase of the turbidity of the solution hindering photons to reach the active sites of the catalyst surface due to the scattering effect 21 furthermore the possibility of agglomeration of particles can be increased in the case of higher doses and this can lead to the reduction of active sites 22 accordingly the optimum catalyst dose is considered 0 5 g l in the case of the s tio2 catalyst 3 3 photocatalytic activity and reusability of the attached catalyst the reusability of the attached s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts was investigated in five consecutive experiments at initial trimethoprim concentration of 10 mg l ph of 7 0 and time of 240 min as depicted in fig 5 a and b ru wo3 zro2 showed higher performance and reusability potential than s tio2 in five consecutive cycles the degradation efficiencies were 98 96 9 96 8 93 2 and 83 4 using attached ru wo3 zro2 in the five repetitive cycles while the removal efficiencies were 88 6 86 84 78 and 75 9 in case of s tio2 the high performance of ru wo3 zro2 can be attributed to the existence of ru and zr ions which act as an electron trap and inhibit the recombination of radicals the observed degradation efficiency in five consecutive experiments confirmed the high stability and reusability of both s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts the continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals during five consecutive cycles suggest the availability of active sites on the aluminum plate even after a long period of irradiation the slight decrease in photo degradation efficiency in each successive cycle may be related to the small amount of catalyst released from the plate and or leftovers of contaminants on the catalyst decreasing the active surface area in general the performance of the attached catalyst is lower than the suspended catalyst at the same condition most likely because the interaction between pollutants and the catalyst only takes place at the bottom of the reactor additionally the light needs to pass through the total depth of the water to excite the catalyst particles the shear and friction forces resulting from the rapid movement of the stirrer at the bottom of the reactor can result in the release of catalyst particles from the plate however the results showed that attached s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 by polysiloxane have the potential for reusability several times moreover the attached catalyst is more sustainable than suspended catalysts due to the difficulty of collecting suspended catalyst especially nano scale catalysts increasing the illumination time can overcome the limitations related to the attached catalyst and contribute to the reduction of the cost in the case of large scale application 3 4 degradation kinetics of trimethoprim langmuir hinshelwood model was used to estimate the degradation rates of trimethoprim using s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 in suspended and attached modes eq 1 illustrates the relation between the remaining concentration of trimethoprim and time 23 1 ln c o c k o b s t where kobs is the reaction rate co and c are the initial concentration of trimethoprim and the concentration of trimethoprim at time t the degradation rates of trimethoprim using ru wo3 zro2 in suspended and immobilized modes were higher than the degradation rates in the case of s tio2 in both cases as shown in fig 6 a and b the superiority of ru wo3 zro2 catalyst in attached and suspended modes was due to the addition of zr and ru ions which have the ability to catch electrons and reduce recombination rate leading to higher photodegradation efficiency moreover the degradation rate in suspended mode was higher than the degradation rate in an immobilized mode in the case of both catalysts in the case of the attached mode the light needs to pass the total depth of the water to reach the active sites of the immobilized catalyst and generate reactive species while the light excites the catalyst particles everywhere in the solution using suspended catalysts furthermore the contact between the catalyst particles and the pollutant is higher in the case of suspended catalysts as the contact only takes place at the bottom of the reactor using attached catalysts table 1 shows the degradation rates of trimethoprim using s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 suspended and immobilized catalysts 3 5 degradation mechanism fig 7 demonstrates the generated radicals for the degradation of trimethoprim the excitation of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 by the 400 w metal halide lamp leads to the migration of electrons from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb leaving holes in the valence band the reaction of electrons in cb with oxygen o2 results in the formation of superoxide radicals o2 while holes vb react with water or hydroxyl ions oh to generate hydroxyl radicals o h holes hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals are in charge of the degradation of trimethoprim isopropanol iso ammonium oxalate ao and ascorbic acid aa were used as scavengers for hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals and holes respectively to specify the active species responsible for the degradation of trimethoprim as shown in fig 8 24 26 the degradation efficiency of trimethoprim 10 mg l by s tio2 was 98 2 without the addition of any scavengers while the photo degradation efficiency decreased to 82 8 93 3 and 44 9 using 1 mm of iso ao and aa respectively at a dose of 0 5 g l ph of 7 and irradiation time of 240 min as illustrated in fig 8 a in the case of ru wo3 zro2 the photo degradation efficiency reduced to 85 92 9 and 48 using 1 mm of iso ao and aa respectively at the same previous conditions the results confirmed that hydroxyl radicals holes and superoxide radicals all contributed to the degradation process however the holes contributed to a greater extent than superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals 3 6 photo degradation transformation products and potential degradation pathway the transformation products generated during the photo degradation process of trimethoprim tmp c14h19n4o3 m z 291 were measured by mass spectrometry as shown in fig 9 hydroxylation de methylation and cleavage are the main reactions in the tmp degradation process by radicals as reported in the literature 27 compounds with the general formula of c14h19n4o3 x x varying from 1 to 4 can be formed through hydroxylation reaction these compounds can be classified into mono bi tetra and penta hydroxylated compounds depending on the value of x the mono hydroxylated intermediate m z 307 c14h19n4o4 was identified as α hydro xytrimethoprim tmp oh and formed through the hydroxylation of trimethoprim 27 di hydroxylated m z 323 c14h19n4o5 was also formed through the hydroxylation of trimethoprim 28 the products α ketotrimethoprim tmp o m z 305 can be generated through the oxidation of tmp products with formula c14 y h19 2yn4o3 x y varying from 1 to 3 can be generated through de methylation reactions compounds with m z 309 c13h17n4o5 m z 341 c13h17n4o7 m z 295 c12h15n4o5 m z 279 c12h15n4o4 m z 281 c11h13n4o5 and m z 277 c13h16n4o3 were formed through de methylation hydroxylation process of tmp 28 products m z 139 c5h6n4o m z 155 c5h6n4o2 m z 171 c8h10o4 and m z 141 c5h8n4o were suggested to be generated by the cleavage of tmp 28 based on the observation of these transformation products a possible degradation pathway is suggested in fig 9 4 conclusions s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts were synthesized and their performance in the attached and suspended state was evaluated for the degradation of trimethoprim the characterization of the synthesized s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 catalysts suggested a successful interaction of components and high active surface area the optimum catalyst doses in suspension state of s tio2 and ru wo3 zro2 were 0 5 and 1 0 g l respectively the degradation efficiencies of trimethoprim were 100 and 98 2 at catalyst dose of 0 5 g l ph of 7 0 and irradiation time of 240 min using suspended ru wo3 zro2 and s tio2 respectively ru wo3 zro2 showed higher performance and reusability than s tio2 in five consecutive runs in the attached state the removal efficiencies in five consecutive runs were 88 6 86 84 78 and 75 9 for the attached s tio2 while the degradation rates were 98 96 9 96 8 93 2 and 83 4 in case of attached ru wo3 zro2 the degradation rates of trimethoprim in the case of the immobilized mode were lower than the degradation rates using catalysts in suspended mode the main active species in charge of the photo degradation process were holes and hydroxyl radicals the potential degradation pathways were suggested based on the identification of transformation products declaration
